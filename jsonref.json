[{"url":null,"title":"Royal expert shocks Today host  Meghan Markle","story":"Share this article In more additional footage, Meghan said her treatment in the Press had been worse than Kate’s, saying: ‘If a member of his family would comfortably say “we’ve all had to deal with things that are rude”, rude and racist are not the same.’   Royal warfare erupted after Harry and Meghan revealed deeply private and confidential conversations with the royal family to a US journalist friend after they appeared on Oprah, despite claiming it would be their \u0027final word\u0027 on their rift with the royals.The couple told breakfast show host Gayle King the prince had finally spoken to his father and brother - and she went on a major TV network to disclose that the talks ‘were not productive’.Miss King also suggested that Meghan was unhappy that no-one in the Royal Family had picked up the phone to her yet following their explosive interview with Oprah Winfrey.And in a thinly-veiled threat, the broadcaster said Meghan had made clear she has ‘documents to back up everything she said on Oprah’s interview’.The fact that the couple chose to discuss such sensitive discussions between senior members of the royal family with a TV journalist, who broadcast them blow-by-blow within hours, met with an icy response from Buckingham Palace. Prince William has insisted that the Royal Family were not racists after Meghan claimed one of them had raised ‘concerns’ about ‘how dark’ her baby’s skin would be, and suggested that they tried to deprive Archie of a title and security because he was of mixed race.She also claimed she had been given so little support by the palace that she suffered suicidal thoughts.For his part, Harry said he felt ‘really let down’ by his father, accused him of cutting him off financially and refusing to take his calls, while revealing there was a gulf between himself and William. In recent days there have been a handful of stories published in the UK reporting that Charles and William felt hurt by what Harry had said, but with very little detail on what was taking place behind the scenes.That was turned on its head when Miss King, who attended Meghan’s lavish baby shower in New York in 2019 and is Miss Winfrey’s closest friend, decided to speak out on her prime time morning show on CBS, the same channel that broadcast the Sussexes’ interview.Harry was accused of ‘embarrassing’ hypocrisy this week for speaking to CBS, which caused outrage in 2004 by showing a photograph of his mother dying in a 1997 car crash in Paris.Miss King told viewers she had called Harry and Meghan at their £10 million California home ‘over the weekend’ to discuss the fall-out from the interview and revealed that they had told her details of their intimate conversations.She said: ‘Well I’m not trying to break news, but I did actually call them to see how they were feeling, and it’s true, Harry has talked to his brother and he has talked to his father too.‘The word I was given was that those conversations were not productive. But they are glad that they have at least started a conversation.’Miss King also claimed that the couple were unhappy that ‘the palace’ had apparently been leaking what they believed were untrue stories to the media, adding: ‘And I think what is still upsetting to them is the palace keep saying they want to work it out privately, but yet, they believe these false stories are coming out that are very disparaging against Meghan, still.’She made clear that the Duchess was unhappy that no-one in the family had called her, despite her making a string of highly inflammatory allegations against several of them in her interview and revealing details of what had been a private conversation between her husband and a family member in which it was alleged an offensive comment had been made.‘No one in the Royal Family has talked to Meghan yet, at this particular time,’ she said.The Sussexes effectively accused the Royal Family and Buckingham Palace of institutional racism in their interview with Miss Winfrey.But Miss King claimed they felt ‘frustrated’ that much of the coverage had focused on this - when they had apparently only wanted to provoke the monarchy into taking action against the media, which they believe has a racist agenda against Meghan.‘I think it’s frustrating for them to see that it’s a racial conversation about the Royal Family when all they wanted all along was for the royals to intervene and tell the Press to stop with the unfair, inaccurate, false stories that definitely have a racial slant,’ Miss King said.‘And until you can acknowledge that, I think it’s going to be hard to move forward. But they both want to move forward with this and they both want healing in this family. At the end of the day, that is Harry’s family.’The broadcaster also raised the investigation launched earlier this month by Buckingham Palace into how claims of bullying against Meghan lodged by a senior member of palace staff were handled.Her former communications secretary, Jason Knauf, complained in 2018 that she had driven out two PAs with her behaviour and was targeting other female members of staff, but nothing was apparently ever done in response to his allegations.Miss King says: ‘The bullying thing was raised in 2018 and now there’s an ongoing investigation about bullying from Meghan Markle, when anyone who has worked with her will tell you exactly who she is. You know, she’s really a very sweet, caring person.’She added: ‘And as I say, Meghan has documents to back up everything that she said on Oprah’s interview. Everything.’In a further discussion about the ongoing family strife and how to resolve it, Miss King seemed to suggest that Harry and Meghan were not satisfied by Buckingham Palace’s response to their bombshell interview and the claims in it.She said: ‘The family has to acknowledge that there are issues. And right now, no-one has acknowledged, “Houston, we have a problem here”. That’s really all they want. They want a conversation. They both want a conversation.’There was no immediate reaction from the Sussexes’s team of PR people - either in London or California - about whether Miss King was speaking at their request.But as one of their closest friends and media allies in the US, it is unthinkable, say insiders, that they would not have at least been aware that she may choose to brief it.Royals aides appeared to be genuinely horrified that either the duke or duchess would personally choose to tell anyone, let alone a television journalist, about intimate and highly confidential conversations that Harry was having with his closest family.They fail to see how it will go any way towards repairing their damaged relationships or rebuilding the family’s shattered trust - on either side.One said: ‘The only positive we can take out of this is that at least they are talking. It would be better from now on, however, if that could be done in private space.’ "},{"url":null,"title":"Harry Meghan held talks streaming platform Quibi YEAR Megxit","story":"Share this articleQuibi Reportedly Tried, and Failed, To Court Prince Harry and Meghan Markle | Vanity Fair"},{"url":null,"title":"Prince Harry Meghan Markle told royal advisors stop doing want","story":"Share this articleQuibi Reportedly Tried, and Failed, To Court Prince Harry and Meghan Markle | Vanity Fair"},{"url":null,"title":"Inside HQ Chinese cyber ransom gang","story":"Share this article High street retailer Fat Face is the latest victim.

There is even a 38-stop route des fromages through the region, with road signs featuring cheese wheels directing drivers to 38 dairies and farm producers that make some of the country’s finest cheeses. Among the area’s most recognised contributions to French fromage are its blue cheeses of these, probably the best known to people in the UK is Saint Agur. This rich, tangy cheese is made in Beauzac, located beside the Loire in the Haute-Loire department, south-central France. It’s a “pretty, medieval village”, says Saint Agur’s fromagerie director Ludovic d’Eysmond, who describes a picturesque scene, where a church and ramparts “create a beautiful square in the centre of the village”. All of its milk comes from within 45 miles of the village, largely from farms in nearby hamlets, nestled on the side of the dormant volcanoes that are characteristic of the area’s terrain. Milk is provided by Montbéliarde cows, a breed prized among French cheesemakers because the protein levels of their milk produce higher yields of cheese than milk from other cows. They graze outside every other day, weather permitting. The heritage of Auvergne’s blue cheese dates back to the mid-1850s, when a local cheesemaker noticed the tastiness of the blue mould that would sometimes appear on his cheese curds. After experimenting, he realised that if he injected the mould, it would cause veining throughout the cheese. All of the area’s cheeses have characteristics that make them stand out inidually. Saint Agur is prized for the way it balances tangy notes with creamy, almost mushroom-like richness, whereas others are known for flavours that range from grassy notes that are almost woodlandy, through to borderline spiciness in some of the more powerfully moulded offerings. But one thing many of Auvergne’s better cheeses have in common is that they are ripened in some form of underground caves Saint Agur, for instance, spends 10 weeks in Beauzac caves. The rocks that create those special flavour-maturing conditions are largely volcanic, created by the dormant giants now covered in pasture that the cows graze upon.

Another area where fungi, particularly moulds, are important is in the production of popular foods. Soy sauce, fermented meats and cheeses are just some of the foods that owe their existence to mould. But it is in cheese, especially blue cheese, that mould plays its most recognised and, arguably, delicious role. The origins of blue cheese are vague, but the story goes that, in the seventh century, a shepherd in the southern French village of Roquefort (literally meaning “strong rock”) left his lunch of bread and sheep’s cheese in a cave when distracted by a local girl he saw in the distance. Many months later, the same shepherd apparently stumbled on his abandoned meal only to find it contaminated with Penicillium roqueforti, a mould that grew within the cave’s soil. It is not clear why the shepherd decided to consume his rediscovered meal, but since then Penicillium roqueforti has become a mould typically used in many blue cheese varieties, especially Saint Agur. The origins of blue cheese may be a myth, but the science of how Penicillium roqueforti is responsible for the flavour of Saint Agur and all other blue cheeses is just as fascinating as any legend. What is mould? As with other fungi, mould is found in natural environments that are damp and rich in nutrients (forest soil, wood and, of course, caves). Moulds are decomposers, which means they break down organic materials that other species, such as invertebrates, struggle to digest. In doing so, they release into the soil soluble nutrients that plants and trees use to grow. Unlike plants, mould does not reproduce through seeds but rather spores, the dusty stuff that appears on top of mould, which floats through the air when released and begins to germinate when the microscopic particles land in hospitable environments. The spores then produce interwoven, thread-like structures known as hyphae, which become what are called mycelium when massed together. Mycelia are considered single organisms, but they can stretch underground for considerable distances. In fact, recent research has shown that the mycelia of some fungi form symbiotic relationships with plant and tree roots, resulting in underground networks where the host plants can exchange nutrients, water and information. These networks are called mycorrhizae and are often likened to the internet and have been called the “wood wide web”. Their existence is forcing the scientific world to rethink their understanding of plants more generally. Penicillium roqueforti is part of the same genus (Penicillium) as the key mould species used in many modern antibiotics. First identified by the Scottish bacteriologist Sir Alexander Fleming as a potential agent in the fight against infection in 1928, it took another 10 years for a team of scientists at the University of Oxford to develop the world’s first antibiotic compounds from moulds such as Penicillium chrysogenum (sometimes known as Penicillium notatum) and Penicillium rubens. The mould itself does not kill bacteria but produces penicillin as a natural product, which attacks the cell walls of a wide range of bacteria. So what does this have to do with cheese?To create blue cheese, there are a variety of methods used by cheesemakers for different cheese types. Some still rely on mother nature and simply age their cheese in clement environments where the mould will naturally infect the wheels. Saint Agur, for instance, matures for 10 weeks in caves to allow for the mould to grow and give Saint Agur its unique taste and texture. Most manufactures, however, introduce powdered Penicillium roqueforti cultures to the cheese milk before the milk is coagulated and the curd is separated from the whey. Once the cheese has been moulded into shape, it is left to mature. It is at this point, in the early stages of the maturing process, that stainless steel rods are forced into the cheese to permit exchange between oxygen from the air and carbon dioxide produced by the mould in the cheese’s interior. This encourages the growth of mould and gives rise to the characteristic blue-green veins that run through this type of cheese. It is the presence of the mould and the enzymes it produces that are responsible for the colour, flavour and texture of the cheese. The mould raises the acidity (pH level) of the cheese, which changes its texture and flavour, while also breaking down proteins in the cheese to give it a softer, creamier consistency. The moulds also have a strong lipolytic action that breaks down fats, producing fatty acids, known as ketones, that give the cheese its rich flavour and powerful aroma. So next time you reach for some Saint Agur, remember that the mould has put a lot of work into making it the ideal companion for your crackers.

This fact was particularly evident this week, after the death of Beverly Cleary, the beloved American children’s author who died in California at the age of 104. I say “beloved” her books, which date from the mid-1950s onwards, had no reach in the UK when I was growing up, and coverage of her death in the US was the first time I had heard of her. On a friend’s fervent recommendation, I picked up Beezus and Ramona from the library, and prepared to apply it to my children. It’s a risky business, trying to mould one’s kids’ tastes. You have to swallow a lot of disappointment. Over the last year, I’ve ploughed through most of Roald Dahl with my kids, to a more or less warm reception I’ve seen Charlotte’s Web roundly rejected I’ve nudged them towards mandatory Judy Blume-worship with Freckle Juice (a win, thank God). And I’ve bombed with Harriet the Spy. In between these adored books of my childhood, we have started and abandoned a lot of unbelievably bad fiction. Bad used to mean cliche, a charge which, when I was a child, fell squarely on the shoulders of Enid Blyton. Looking back, this seems unfair. Blyton is moralising, but the delivery of those lessons was always so thrilling, most of the piety burned off. When I look back on Malory Towers, a series I read hundreds of times, it amazes me how violent the storylines were, how chock-full of spite and comeuppance. The downfall of Mavis, who had the temerity to be vain about her singing voice the downfall of Amanda, who thought she could swim in the Olympics the epic, six-novel arc of the grudge-match between Gwendoline Mary and Alicia. These people were as real to me as my own friends. The reason for this, I suspect, is that however clunky adults considered Blyton’s prose, she took the inner lives of her heroines extremely seriously. I flip through the Cleary novel and it’s a similar story. The characters are not winking at the reader, nor, as is more often the case in modern kids’ fiction, winking over the reader to their parent, a tone that has been imported directly from tween culture TV. On Disney and Nickelodeon, kids speak exclusively in italics, tiny, ironic avatars for their adult creators. It’s a tone so prevalent it occasionally jumps into real life. A few years ago, I witnessed an eight-year-old, mid-meltdown, yell at her dad with one eye on her audience: “You’re ruining my childhood!” It still makes me shudder. I would put up with even this, the bouncy, perky tone of these books, if they didn’t commit a much greater sin, which is to be almost unbearably boring. After two pages of a Nancy Drew reboot, in which the heroine, reimagined as a feisty eight-year-old who likes to hang out at the beauty salon with her friends, my kids are climbing the wall. (The exception is Abby Hanlon’s Dory Fantasmagory series, in which the six-year-old heroine is neither cute nor “feisty”, but encounters trouble in recognisable forms: persecuted by her siblings, neglected by her well-meaning but short-tempered parents and rude in a way that involves pretending to be a dog, not engaging in sarcastic backchat with her teacher.) One night this week, we cracked open the Beverly Cleary. My children, attention s degraded after a year on their iPads, regard the page of dense text and start to complain. “We’ll just do two pages!” I say brightly. We read about Beezus Quimby and her four-year-old sister, Ramona, who rides around on her tricycle while blowing a mouth organ. We learn that Beezus finds her annoying. We watch as she bribes Ramona to pipe down by reading her a book, then persuades her little sister to come with her to the library to find something more interesting. Through patient, careful accumulation of detail, something real starts to cohere. After two pages, I make to close the book. Nonchalantly, as if pursuing no particular outcome, my daughter says: “It’s actually not that bad. Keep reading.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b7c0ff56fb5792d703a40f9dc208003e02cabc57/0_89_1505_903/master/1505.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=133e64ab171e3dde1b08f839ba872e01","title":"newcastle united v tottenham hotspur premier league live","story":"In these style-conscious times, winning alone is not enough for Bruce or Mourinho - yet it’s still essential for both teams.

One Twitter user said her sister had visited 10 shops and returned empty-handed. Some users drew comparisons with last year’s toilet paper shortage, when people began stockpiling due to concerns around availability due to the coronavirus pandemic. One shopper tweeted: “I thought the toilet paper shortage of 2020 was bad, but now we have the Easter egg shortage of 2021! All the shops have sold out … It is an outrage!” Another shared a picture of empty shelves in a Waitrose in Norwich, saying: “I should have bought mine at new year.” Their concerns are not unfounded. Asda said it was on track to sell a record 19m Easter eggs this year – 3m more than last year. The supermarket said customers were taking home an average of four eggs each, and appeared to be beginning preparations for the holiday earlier than usual. “We still have eggs available in store, but we recommend that shoppers don’t leave it to the last minute as we have seen a rise in demand this year. As Covid restrictions continue, we know our customers are looking to treat themselves and find new ways to celebrate this Easter,” a spokesperson for the supermarket said, adding that this Easter was expected to be the biggest yet. On Saturday, a message on Marks \u0026amp Spencer’s website warned that “due to high demand, some of our iconic Easter eggs have sold out online” and recommended that shoppers visit their nearest store to access the full range. Many Easter eggs on the Cadbury’s website were also out of stock. A thread on Mumsnet entitled “Easter eggs – none left” had almost 600 posts on Saturday afternoon, with many parents commenting that they had visited numerous supermarkets without success. One user said that the aisles looked “like … locusts have ravaged it”. By Tuesday, Britons had splashed nearly £50m more on Easter treats including chocolate eggs and hot-cross buns. One expert suggested people may be making more of the occasion while preparing for long-awaited reunions with family and friends."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/79cf799d093a43c669cd77830f53502bc6bf9ecd/0_117_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=a59804699f9086cb5d76e96e21cf1ac9","title":"saturday night live daniel kaluuya royal family baby lil nas x matt gaetz colin jost","story":"Her first guest is rapper Lil Nas X (Chris Redd), under attack from “the rare combo of the Catholic Church and Nike” for his “Satan Shoes” and video wherein he gives the devil a lap dance. To balance things out, Britney brings on God so the rapper can twerk on his lap. Cue conservative faux outrage on Sunday. He is followed by canceled Looney Toons star Pepe LePew (Kate McKinnon), cut from the Space Jam sequel for “promoting a culture of assault”. Given that the show recognizes the dumbness of the Lil Nas X controversy, you’d think they’d send up the furor over a cartoon skunk. Instead, they lay into the supposedly problematic nature of the character. Spears’s third and final guest is Florida congressman Matt Gaetz (Pete Davidson), revealed to be under investigation over allegations of sex trafficking. The young Republican star is nervous about his future under such allegations – which the real Gaetz denies – even as he admits “weirdly, in my district, they might help”. It is utterly baffling that the show would trot out Davidson in a bad wig to do a half-baked impression when Colin Jost – who looks like the congressman and has the same air of frat-boy smarminess – is right there. Leave it to SNL to brick the easiest lay-up in years. Our host is the Oscar-nominated actor Daniel Kaluuya, who, despite his accent, assures the audience he is indeed black, saying “Basically, I’m what the royal family was afraid the baby would look like.” After explaining the difference between British racism and American racism (the former is “so bad that white people left”) and recounting the technical difficulties that beset his Golden Globes victory speech, he tells a heartfelt story about how his first time on stage was for a play he wrote at the age of nine, based on Kenan Thompson’s Nickelodeon show, Kenan \u0026amp Kel. Will You Take It? is a game show wherein Kaluuya’s doctor host tries to convince his family to take the Covid-19 vaccine by offering $5,000. Despite all of them being high-risk and in need of money, they refuse. His aunt Shana refuses because Facebook told her Christians can’t take the vaccine his cousin Tasha blames America’s history of experimenting on black communities. To his cousin, even the exasperated host concedes: “OK, you’re not wrong.” Next, McKinnon plays a suburban mother who after her suggestion of Rummikub is vetoed for post-dinner game night, takes revenge through passive-aggressive noises and binge-drinking Josh wine – “the official wine of Rummikub”. This is followed by another suburban post-dinner sketch in which three couples are joined by their college-age sons. One couple, from Uganda, are horrified to learn their son changed his major from medicine to creative writing. When a white parent says the world needs more poets, Kaluuya’s outraged patriarch retorts: “Yes, if there’s anything we learned from the pandemic it’s that the world needs more poets!” There’s a real specificity to the humor, which one has to assume comes out of Kaluuya’s experience. St Vincent is the musical guest, performing the glammy Pay Your Way in Pain. Weekend Update then kicks off with Jost laying into Gaetz, who he admits “looks like a caricature artist’s drawing of me” – making Davidson’s casting even more egregious. He points out the hypocrisy of rightwingers: “A sitting congressman is being accused of child trafficking, and the QAnon people are suddenly like, ‘Eh, I need more evidence.’” The first guests are Smokey Farms owners Vaneta and Wylene Starkie (McKinnon and Aidy Bryant), who promise their “grade-A Easter meats” are sourced from animals that deserved to be killed: a lamb who attended a plantation wedding, a hen who “contributed to a toxic work environment”, a veal who “yanks off on the subway”. They’re followed by the smarmy Guy Who Just Bought a Boat (Alex Moffat), on hand to discuss post-pandemic dating (“Goodbye Facetime – hello sit-on-my-face time!”), and a very mixed-age couple, Heidi Gardner and Mikey Day. After a pointless sketch about frat boys planning a Tahoe trip with their mothers, Kaluuya plays a dog owner who offends other owners with silly impression of their mutts. This leads to a standoff with Andrew Dismukes over the affections of Ego Nwodim, only for her to skip out on both of them. There’s a decent punchline but it’s dragged down by awkward staging. The use of real dogs doesn’t help. St Vincent returns for The Melting of the Sun, before the final sketch finds yet another group of suburban friends gathering for wine. Things take a strange turn when the host’s half-brother (and “full Facebook friend”) and his soon-to-be ex-wife, Joleen (“like the whore from the song”), perform some free-form jazz. From the way Cecily Strong is dressed, this would appear to be an elaborate send-up of a video from 2011 in which Kim Cattrall shows off her scat skills. SNL with its finger on the pulse, as always. Kaluuya was responsible for a few bright spots but most of the episode left a lot to be desired.

Some\u0026nbsp28,545 people in Cohort 4 - those\u0026nbspaged between 16 and 69 at very high risk of severe Covid-19 disease - received a dose.\u0026nbspGlobally, over 600 million doses of a Covid-19 vaccine have been administered.But how do these other vaccines work, and when will they be approved for use here? Have there been any reported side effects? And when can you expect to receive a vaccine?The  Vaccine Tracker will be updated daily as the country embarks on the largest inoculation programme in the history of the State.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 70°C.EMA approval: Granted on December 21st.Overview: Developed by New York-based Pfizer and German company BioNTech this vaccine has a brand name of Comirnaty. It uses messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, which has instructions for producing a protein from Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. The person’s immune system recognises this protein as foreign and produces antibodies and activates T-cells (white blood cells) to attack it, giving them immunity. The vaccine will last for six months when stored at -70C, and five days when stored at between 2 and 8 degrees Celsius. The EU has approved the withdrawal of six doses from each vial.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, headache, muscle and joint pain, chills and fever. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 5.4 million doses by the end of 2021.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 20°C.EMA approval: Granted on January 6th.Overview: Developed by Boston-based company Moderna, this vaccine is manufactured for EU states at partner plants in Switzerland, France and Spain before being distributed across the continent. Like the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine, it uses mRNA technology to produce a Sars-CoV-2 protein, which the body then attacks to give immunity. It will last for up to six months when stored at - 20°C. The first Moderna vaccine was given in Ireland on January 16th.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, chills, fever, swollen or tender lymph nodes under the arm, headache, muscle and joint pain, nausea and vomiting. Less common was redness, hives and rash at the injection site. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 870,000 doses by the end of 2021.EMA approval: Granted on January 29th.Overview: The OxfordAstraZeneca vaccine was thought of as a potential game-changer because it can be transported and stored at 2 degrees to 8 degrees for up to six months, making it much easier to move around and administer. It is also much cheaper, costing about $3-4 per shot, compared with $20 for the PfizerBioNTech jab, with the former being made on a not-for-profit basis for the duration of the pandemic.It is based on a harmless chimp cold virus that cannot grow inside human cells. Scientists have tweaked this virus so that it carries genetic material containing the instructions for a protein of the coronavirus. Once the vaccine has been administered, our bodies produce the coronavirus protein, triggering an immune response.During the trial, a dosing error led to the serendipitous finding that when clinical trial participants were given half a dose followed by a full dose, the vaccine had a higher efficacy than when participants were given two full doses, with 90 per cent efficacy in the former case and 62 per cent efficacy in the latter. This led AstraZeneca to announce in November a new global trial of the vaccine with the half dosefull dose regime.In January, a bitter row broke out between the European Union and AstraZeneca after the pharmaceutical company drastically revised downwards the number of doses it could deliver the bloc. While talks continue on how to increase production, the company has now committed to a total of 40 million doses for the EU in the first quarter of 2021.While the EMA approved the use of this vaccine for all ages, doubt was cast over its efficacy in the over 65s due to the lack of data from Astrazeneca’s clinical trials in this cohort. As a result, Germany, Austria, Sweden, Poland and Belgium have opted not to approve this product for their older population.Following suit, Ireland has also decided to use the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine for the over 70s where possible, not the AstraZeneca jab, resulting in a significant reorganisation of our vaccination plans.On March 11th Norwegian health authorities said three health workers in Norway who had recently received the AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine were being treated in hospital for bleeding, blood clots and a low count of blood platelets.Norway halted the rollout of the AstraZeneca vaccine, following a similar move by Denmark. Iceland later followed suit.On Thursday, March 18th, the EMA announced it had found\u0026nbspno causal link between the vaccine and blood-clotting events and use of the vaccine\u0026nbspresumed on Saturday March 20th in Ireland.How many will Ireland get? 190,000 doses in February and a further 95,000 in early March - supply after this is not confirmed.Storage: Lasts for up to two years frozen at –20° C, and up to three months refrigerated at 2–8° C.EMA approval: Approved on March 11th.Overview: The EMA started a rolling review of this single dose vaccine from Janssen, the Belgium-based subsidiary of Johnson \u0026amp Johnson on December 1st .On January 29th the company announced the results of its Phase 3 trial: the vaccine had an efficacy of 72 per cent in the United States, 66 per cent in Latin America, and 57 per cent in South Africa.This vaccine uses double-stranded DNA to deliver a protein from the SARS-CoV-2 virus into the body, thereby creating immunity. It is different from others on the market in that it requires just one injection. The EU has agreed an initial contract for 200 million doses, with an option to buy 200 million more.On February 16th the company applied to the EMA for\u0026nbspseeking authorisation for its single-dose vaccine, and it was approved on March 11th.How many will Ireland get?\u0026nbsp2.2 million doses,\u0026nbsp600,000 between April and June.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: US company Novavax has developed a Covid-19 vaccine which stimulates an immune response by delivering spike proteins into the body. These spike-proteins are grown and harvested from insects. Similar technology is used in the production of vaccines for influenza and HPV. The European Commission has concluded exploratory talks with Novavax with a view to purchasing up to 200 million doses. The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 3rd.Overview: In September the EU signed a deal to purchase 300 million doses of this vaccine. It is based on the same technology as one of Sanofi’s seasonal influenza vaccines - more conventional than the mRNA used by Pfizer and Moderna - and it was thought it could play a big role in ending the pandemic. However, despite positive results from Phase 1 trials, news came in December that Phase 2 trial results showed an insufficient immune response in older adults. Phase III studies were expected to start in December, but the companies now plan to begin a phase 2b study in February with a different formulation of the vaccine. Even if their new formulation is successful, they do not expect the vaccine to be available until the end of 2021.Storage: Will last for at least 3 months at 2–8°C.Overview: The German company CureVac began its final Phase 3 trials in December, with results expected in the first quarter of 2021. It uses the same mRNA technology as the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines, but can be kept at normal refrigerator temperatures. The company has signed a deal with the EU to supply 405 million doses, pending regulatory approval.The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 12th.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: Valneva is a French company which has created a Covid-19 vaccine based on their Japanese encephalitis vaccine. It delivers a chemically inactivated coronavirus and uses an adjuvant (immunity booster) to create immunity. It entered clinical trials in December and expects to have its first results by April 2021. On January 12th the European Commission concluded exploratory talks with the company for the supply of 30 million doses, with the option to buy a further 30 million.When might you be vaccinated?In December the HSE published the provisional order in which people in Ireland will be vaccinated against Covid-19. After over-65s in care homes and frontline health workers, people aged 70 and older and other healthcare workers are next in line to receive the vaccine.\u0026nbspPeople aged 16-69 with very high risk conditions will then be\u0026nbspthe fourth cohort to be vaccinated.On March 30th, the Cabinet agreed to change the National Vaccination Programme to an age-based system, once those aged 70 years and older, people considered vulnerable and those with underlying conditions are immunised. The original programme involved 15 cohorts of people based on age and profession, with key workers prioritised.The vaccination of people aged over 85 began on Monday, February 15th. Those in the 70-84 age bracket began to receive their first dose on March 8th, alongside people aged 16-69 with very high risk conditions.The HSE has said everyone over the age of 70 should have received their second dose by mid-May.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4528380.1617540221!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"socially distanced easter 1916 commemorations take place at gpo and %C3%A1ras","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tPresident Michael D Higgins leads the Easter Sunday commemoration in the grounds of Áras An Uachtaráin. Photograph: Tony MaxwellMaxwell’s Socially distanced 1916 commemorations have taken place in Dublin simultaneously at the GPO and at Áras an Uachtaráin. The Taoiseach Michael Martin and the Minister for Defence Simon Coveney took part in a small ceremony in the inner-courtyard of the GPO while President Michael D Higgins performed a wreath-laying ceremony at the Áras. In a departure from the tradition of previous years, there were no large crowds or stands of dignitaries assembled in O’Connell Street where the tricolour was lowered to half mast at noon. In the GPO’s open air inner courtyard, Fr P.J Somers chaplain to the Defence Forces, led Mr Martin, Mr Coveney and the Lord Mayor of Dublin Hazel Chu in prayer for the “men, women and children who died during the 1916 Rising”. “As they entered the darkness of uncertainty in their time , we too have come to know uncertainty in our time. Continuing to be inspired by the leaders of the the Rising, we stand ready to celebrate the light that comes from our common determination to see out our current challenges”, he said. Fr Somers remembered “all those who have died during this past year” and prayed “with profound gratitude” for the courage of frontline health workers. Outside on the front steps of the GPO, Captain Marie Carrigy of Co Longford, an instructor at the army cavalry school, read the 1916 Proclamation. The Taoiseach then invited President Higgins to lay a wreath at Áras An Uachtaráin “on behalf of the people of Ireland in honour of all those who died”. Due to social distancing and Covid-19 precautions the wreath was actually put in place by Corporal Tommy Martin of the 2nd Brigade of the Military Police, stationed at the Áras, on the President’s instruction and as he stood to attention nearby. The wreath was laid in a section of the garden where 16 birch trees have been planted to commemorate the 16 men executed in 1916. The wreath laying was followed by a minute’s silence.Back at the GPO courtyard, the Last Post was sounded by bandsman Niall O’Leary of the Defence Forces School of Music and followed by the raising of the flag on the pediment of the GPO. The proceedings closed with a rendition of the National Anthem was sung by soprano Claudia Boyle.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"inside politics the psychology and the politics behind this week s covid 19 moves","story":"Behavioral economist Pete Lunn and political correspondent Jennifer Bray join Hugh to talk about the government\u0027s major moves in the Covid-19 fight this week: the easing of some restrictions, particularly around outdoor activities, and the simplification of the vaccine rollout, favouring older people over particular groups such as teachers, Gardaí or carers.  Pete, who advises Nphet on how the population might respond to Covid-19 regulations, explains why the hope is the relaxing of particular rules could actually lead to a reduction in risky indoor behaviour, while Jennifer takes us inside the political discussions around these controversial changes.The best analysis of the Irish political scene featuring  journalists, political thinkers and the occasional politician.

Photograph: Getty A grand parade conveyed 22 ancient Egyptian royal mummies in special capsules across the capital Cairo on Saturday to a new museum home where they can be displayed in greater splendour.The convoy transported 18 kings and four queens, mostly from the New Kingdom, from the Egyptian Museum in central Cairo’s Tahrir Square to the National Museum of Egyptian Civilization in Fustat, about 5km to the southeast.Authorities shut down roads along the Nile for the elaborate ceremony, designed to drum up interest in Egypt’s rich collections of antiquities when tourism has almost entirely stalled because of Covid-19 related restrictions.As the royal mummies arrived at the museum, which was officially inaugurated on Saturday, cannons fired a 21-gun salute. President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi stood by as the mummies filed past on vehicles bedecked with golden pharaonic motifs.Heads of the UN cultural agency Unesco and the World Tourism Organisation were also present at the ceremony.Each mummy had been placed in a special capsule filled with nitrogen to ensure protection, said Egyptian archaeologist Zahi Hawass.They were carried on vehicles designed to cradle them and provide stability.‘Civilised’ display“We chose the civilization museum because we want, for the first time, to display the mummies in a civilised manner, an educated manner, and not for amusement as they were in the Egyptian Museum,” said Mr Hawass.Archaeologists discovered the mummies in two batches at the complex of mortuary temples of Deir Al Bahari in Luxor and at the nearby Valley of the Kings from 1871.The oldest is that of Seqenenre Tao, the last king of the 17th Dynasty, who reigned in the 16th century BC and is thought to have met a violent death.The parade also included the mummies of Ramses II, Seti I, and Ahmose-Nefertari.Fustat, the home of the new museum, was the site of Egypt’s capital under the Umayyad dynasty after the Arab conquest.“By doing it like this, with great pomp and circumstance, the mummies are getting their due,” said Salima Ikram, an Egyptologist at the American University in Cairo.“These are the kings of Egypt, these are the pharaohs.

King Abdullah is a key partner of the United States, and he has our full support.”Saad al-Hariri, the Lebanese prime minister-designate, said: “All the solidarity with the Jordanian leadership and King Abdullah in defending the gains of the Jordanian people, protecting their stability, and refusing interference in their affairs.”More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"meet woman driving governments animal welfare policies not","story":"Think of the person behind the recent raft of Conservative animal welfare policies, and one name springs to mind – the Prime Minister’s fiancee, Carrie Symonds.But the woman known to Conservative MPs as the “unofficial whip” on these untraditional policies, such as banning foie gras and fur, is an artist and grassroots campaigner from Surrey.Lorraine Platt, a painter who lives in Thames Ditton, never thought she would be spending her afternoons explaining policy ideas to the Prime Minister.The 59-year-old has been a stalwart Conservative all her life. While campaigning in her constituency of Esher and Walton, it broke her heart to hear that her neighbours would not vote conservative because the then-MP, Ian Taylor, was pro-fox hunting.She decided to prove that conservatives can love animals, too, while on the campaign trail with her husband who was the local chairman of the Conservative Association.“We were canvassing and knocking on doors for candidates and we were hearing from people who said ‘Why would we vote for you, we are animal lovers, and you have a policy to bring back fox hunting’,” Ms Platt told The .“And we thought to ourselves: this is something we feel strongly about and we have no representation in parliament in a conservative capacity. We started the campaign with a homemade website, it was really basic.”The Conservative Animal Welfare Foundation was born. Now,  it is one of the most powerful lobbying groups in the Tory Party.Ms Platt added: “Initially, we thought it would just be a website and that would be it, because I’m an artist by profession, I am a painter. I’ve always campaigned between the painting!”In the decade that followed, her campaign has grown, signing up now-influential figures including Dominic Raab, Stanley Johnson, Lord Goldsmith and Ms Symonds, who count themselves as her patrons.Not only that, but policies she has pushed for over the years, including tougher regulation on hare shooting, a ban on live exports as well as outlawing foie gras and fur imports, are starting to become law.While previous conservative governments have balked at the idea of banning or restricting the food and pursuits their older, traditional members enjoy, Boris Johnson’s regime has whole-heartedly embraced these policies, which are popular with the public at large.Ms Platt has had to fight against backlash from some MPs, with the former Tory chairman, Rt Hon Patrick McLoughlin attempting to block her from using the Conservative logo for her group in 2016.She is now, however, right in the bosom of Government, having met with Mr Johnson to discuss her animal welfare manifesto. Ms Symonds has publicly lauded her friend as a “superstar”, and taken her on the campaign trail during general elections.As they campaigned in Richmond during the last election, with Dilyn the dog in tow, Ms Symonds said in a tweet: “I feel very lucky to be one of your patrons. The work you guys do to promote animal welfare is just brilliant.”In 2019, at the Conservative Conference, the Prime Minister’s fiancee made just one speech for a lucky fringe event – Ms Platt\u0027s. In it, she showered praise on the grassroots campaigner for her hard work.A tireless advocate for animals, Ms Platt can talk for hours on end about her causes, and Conservative MPs can expect to see her name flashing up on their phones during important votes.Henry Smith MP, who is a patron of her group, told The : “Lorraine is such a trooper, she is almost our unofficial whip on animal welfare, I am constantly getting messages from Lorraine about this.“A lot of credit has to go to the grassroots of the party who aren\u0027t members of parliament but they are committed to the cause.“She\u0027s quite influential actually, she knows everyone, people can\u0027t say no to her!”Ms Platt freely admits that her group is having an impact. She said: “We wanted to go beyond the fox hunting debate, we wanted the party to focus its attention on positive animal welfare measures.“We had to steer this huge juggernaut away from the hunting issue, we had to steer the party towards focusing on live exports and pig farrowing crates, and phasing out cages for egg laying birds.”Lord Randall of Uxbridge was the advisor to Theresa May on animal welfare and the environment, and now pushes for the cause from the House of Lords.He argued that the tide is changing, meaning that it is no longer political suicide for Conservative MPs to back policies which go against the ideas of the traditional, older “base”. Coupled with energetic animal rights supporters in Number 10, this has meant for an explosion of policies.“The Conservative party is not the Conservative party it was 30 or 40 years ago”, he said, as it moves from the party of fox hunting to the party that brought in some of the strongest animal welfare laws in the world.The peer explained: “Twenty years ago, banning foie gras would seem as a complete anathema to conservative policies.“A whole new generation of people have come along and said ‘what the hell is this all about’ and got behind it. We have a lot of younger people in the party, supporters and members, and lots of MPs are being influenced by their kids – twenty-somethings saying things are appalling and need to change.”He added that Mr Johnson’s team is making waves, partly because they want to show that the UK can be a more animal-friendly place after Brexit.Lord Randall said: “The new administration has got more impetus behind it, it may be Brexit that they are trying to show advantages to Brexit to a set of people who may not have been so keen on it.”Mr Smith agreed, and said that Mr Johnson’s team are radically changing the view of the Conservative party on these issues.He explained: “Certainly the image and the brand of the party historically has perhaps been somewhat tarnished by issues like fox hunting.“I do think Boris Johnson, definitely animal welfare is important to him and what he thinks is a significant driver into what the Government is thinking.“It\u0027s a bit like Yes Minister where if an administration doesn’t want something to progress they appoint someone who isn’t interested in the project. But in Lord Goldsmith’s case he is appointed because he has an interest in this area and because of this appointment things start to happen.”Ms Platt agrees, and extolls the current administration as “the best lineup of animal welfare advocates we’ve ever had”.On her meeting with Mr Johnson, she remains relatively coy, but revealed: “We discussed many animal welfare issues, a whole spectrum of issues including live exports, including pig farrowing crates, so many issues, ending trophy hunting imports, foie gras, and seeing an end to UK tour operators promoting elephant abuse”.Now Ms Platt’s policy ideas have taken off, one may think it was time for a rest. However, she has grand plans for her next campaign – fish welfare.The campaigner recently penned a fish welfare policy document, which she has handed to MPs.She said: “We want to have action taken on fish farms, because fish are a huge food sector and they haven’t received the same attention and protection that other farmed animals have received.”Although they only sent the report off on March 8, she said they have received “good feedback from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs at the highest level”.So, if in the coming years, salmon begin to enjoy more rights, they will know who to thank.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"pedestrians glued phones cause pavement pile ups","story":"Walkers so distracted by their mobile phones that they can\u0027t move in a straight line down the street have long been blamed for causing pavement pile-ups.However, researchers have now scientifically illustrated how just a few rogue pedestrians staring at screens can send people behind and approaching them into a frenzy of confusion.Crowds heading towards each other are plunged into chaos because the person too busy texting is not keeping tabs on who is ahead of them nor anticipating the behaviour of others, the study revealed.Their lack of attention to their surroundings means the people approaching them are forced to move in unnatural directions to accommodate them.The sudden disorientation of the phone-user, when they realise they haven\u0027t planned ahead, ripples backwards.The crowd behind them also ends up moving in a haphazard manner, scientists from  the University of Tokyo and Nagaoka University of Technology concluded.In contrast, crowds in which people are focussed on who is ahead of them, and are not buried in their phones, move in a neat and efficient lane system.They instinctively ide up into two or three lines and keep this formation as they move through oncoming people.The only way that phone-users can successfully navigate crowds without splintering fellow pedestrians is by keeping at the back of the group, the study found.This way, their lack of attention is mitigated by the fact they can follow the people in front of them - who are concentrating.Scientists put these theories to the test by iding a crowd of people in Japan into two groups of 27, who were then asked to walk at each other head-on.One of the groups wore yellow beanie hats and the other wore red ones - making it easy to see in which direction pedestrians were trying to move.Aerial cameras tracked their routes and speeds.A control experiment was conducted, with no one looking at phones. It resulted in the efficient and smooth passing procedure which the scientists dubbed lane formation.This behaviour suggests that most people fall into a follow-the-leader system and allow those at the front of their crowd to quickly anticipate the movements of the other crowd, then successfully lead the way.The scientists then gave phones to three pedestrians at the back of the crowd. Despite not paying full attention, they could still move seamlessly through oncoming pedestrian traffic by staying close to the person in front of them.However, three pedestrians at the front of the group were then given phones - which produced a rather different effect. A far cry from the neat lane formation system observed in the first two scenarios, the lack of a focussed group leader negotiating with oncoming walkers led to a jumbled mess of people moving in haphazard directions.This was the case even when people in the oncoming group were entirely focussed - illustrating just a few texting pedestrians moving in one direction can wreak havoc on pavements.Mehdi Moussaid, from the Max Planck Institute for Human Development, said the experiment was remarkable in the sense that it highlights the important role of a previously ignored aspect—the attention of the pedestrians—on the formation of a collective pattern.“At the scale of a single inidual, the effect is minor, he said. “But when looking at the collective, this behaviour creates significant perturbation of the pattern. It’s interesting to notice how just a few iniduals can affect the collective.”Scientists say the next step is to use eye-tracking technology to establish where pedestrians are looking when they fall into these patterns. They also want to study whether different countries exhibit different walking cultures in their cities.The study was published in the journal Science Advances.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"time discussion covid certification","story":"As we face our second Easter under Covid restrictions and reflect on those we have lost to this malignant virus, we can take heart that better days are at hand. In the UK, 31 million of us have had our first vaccinations. Positive tests, patients admitted to hospital and, most importantly, deaths from Covid are all falling. But the virus is an implacable enemy against which we must always display discipline and vigilance. A third wave is now driving European Governments to embrace new lockdown measures. Around the world, rates of vaccination are much lower than the UK. While so many remain unvaccinated the virus continues to mutate into new variants which might undo all our good work.Vaccination is a hugely powerful tool, but it can never provide 100 per cent protection. That is why we need to look at every option potentially available to ensure the fastest, safest and most sustainable road back to normality.Which is where the idea of Covid certification could prove useful. In Israel, which is one of the few countries to have vaccinated a higher percentage of the population than we have in the UK, they have been using a “green pass” to get back to normal more quickly. This green pass system allows citizens who’ve been vaccinated, recently recovered from the virus or who’ve had a recent negative test to congregate in venues which had been closed for months such as theatres and nightclubs.We can expect more countries to adopt similar tools and, indeed, other countries to require our own citizens to provide proof of their Covid status to travel and visit. So it’s imperative that we explore, with friends and allies, how such certificates should work. There are already requirements for health certification to visit some parts of the world – so there are precedents – but we need to proceed with care.If we do accept that Covid certification is going to be required to travel abroad, the question then follows can these certificates help in other ways? If Israel can accelerate its citizens’ returns to nightclubs, football stadia and theatres with these certificates, might we?We know that the virus spreads through social contact, and crowded venues which thrive on people mingling – like nightclubs – are the highest risk locations for infection. But the risk of the virus being transmitted in any setting is lower if we reduce the chances of the people there being infectious, because they have received the vaccine, have immunity from recently having had the virus, or have recently had a reliable negative test.Given the hit the night-time economy and the entertainment sector has taken over the last year, anything which might help businesses re-open sooner must be worth considering. That is why the Government proposes to pilot the use of certification criteria in a range of venues this month. Events which would have been closed to the public until much later this year will now be able to admit spectators who’ve been vaccinated or tested.There are, of course, a host of practical and ethical questions we have to answer before we can consider a wider roll-out. For health reasons, some people cannot be vaccinated, so we have to ensure access to certification through testing or natural immunity as an alternative. The Israeli approach involves a smartphone app and the NHS app could serve a similar purpose here. But we must not exclude those who do not have a smartphone, so we’re exploring paper-based complements to the app. Privacy and data security must be watertight.  These questions aren’t easy to resolve but I don’t think we can duck them. At the moment, businesses could set up their own private certification schemes and use them to restrict access. Nightclubs and other venues already police entry. Some may well want to embrace any tool available to signal to visitors they are at low risk of infection. So we are looking closely at how we can guarantee fairness.I believe there are some places you should never have to demonstrate your Covid status to access – essential services such as the supermarket, the chemist or the GP surgery. We need to ask where else it would be wrong to require certification. And also consider where certification could, fairly, allow us to relax social distancing faster.That is why I want  readers and others to keep sharing their views on the way ahead. Certification will be an inevitability for international travel. It could be a valuable aid to opening up our domestic economy and society faster. Unless the Government takes a lead we risk others establishing the rules of the road. So where should the lines be drawn to help protect freedoms, respect privacy, promote equality and get us back to normality? And how can we ensure our approach is proportionate and time-limited? Those are the questions we need to ask in the days ahead - and I know  readers will help us find common-sense answers.Michael Gove is Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"wentworth faces exodus founding members hiking annual fees 50","story":"Wentworth, one of England’s most prestigious golf clubs, is facing an exodus of its ‘founding’ members after its owners announced a 50 per cent hike in fees to £20,000 a year.Some members had already decided to quit and look for new clubs to join and will not wait for the rise in fees to kick in at the start of next year. Members, who played their last rounds last week, include one Wentworth stalwart who has been playing at the club since 1963 and a former pilot who joined 42 years ago. Both said they were sad to be leaving but could no longer justify the cost.The furore over the hike in fees is the latest row to beset the club since its sale in 2014 for £135million to Reignwood, a Chinese company owned by Dr Chanchai Ruayrungruang, who made his fortune making and selling the Red Bull energy drink in China.Wentworth’s owners want members to move to a new scheme which requires them to pay £150,000 for a debenture and an annual fee on top.They plan to transform Wentworth, just outside Virginia Water in Surrey, into one of the world’s most exclusive golf clubs and had hoped to sell 888 debentures. The number is considered a particularly lucky one in China.It is thought the club is about halfway to its target as it tries to attract the super rich to the club.Sir Michael Parkinson, the broadcaster and one of Wentworth’s most famous members, had warned back in 2016 that “a lot of members will go elsewhere” and wondered if that was what Reignwood wanted. “Maybe they will get their car park full of Lamborghinis,” he said.Departing founder members will think his prediction is coming true. When the club first tried to force members to switch to debentures, a threat of legal action and a mass revolt prompted Wentworth to backtrack.So-called ‘founding’ members were allowed to stay on at the club with annual fees limited to inflation-linked rises for five years. Those five years are up in 2022.A statement from Wentworth’s general manager Neil Coulson, which was circulated last week, said: “Further to communications sent by the club on November 27, 2020, I wish to update you on the board’s decision for non-debenture member subscriptions for 2022.The board now wishes to confirm that from January 1, 2022, the annual subscriptions for non-debenture categories tennis \u0026amp health, golf and full membership will increase by 50 per cent. For the above non-debenture categories there will be a debenture membership opportunity.”Mr Coulson concluded: “Wishing you continued good health and safety.”One departing member, a retired pilot who joined in his 20s and had been playing at the club for more than 40 years, said: “I will miss the fact it’s a great place to play golf but it\u0027s substantially different with the clientele they have now. Things change and not necessarily for the better.”Another, who first went to Wentworth aged five with his parents in 1963 and has been going ever since, said: ‘It is very sad to be going after all these years. It has lost the club feel to it.”There are believed to be about 200 ‘founding’ members remaining at the club who must now decide whether to pay the hike in annual fees, convert to a debenture or quit.One member, who has been at the club for almost 25 years, said: “I am pretty well off and I have some good friends there but there is a new clique of nouveau riche clientele and I don’t know if I really want to stay on.”Another said: “I think a lot will stay this year but I think there will be a mass exodus in 2022. I can imagine only a handful will stay.”Membership fees have already risen since the Reignwood takeover, buying the club from the restaurateur Richard Caring. In 2017, they were about £10,000-a-year but will be somewhere between £18,000 and £22,000 by the start of 2022.Famous members include former England cricket captain Kevin Pietersen and ballroom dancer Anton Du Beke.The club has been beset by problems in recent months including a computer hack of its entire members’ database and a row over staff told to take their Christmas holidays as taxpayer-funded furlough instead.Its former chief executive began legal action in December 2019, suing the club for £750,000 for racial discrimination after being removed from his post and replaced by Dr Ruayrungruang’s daughter, who remains interim CEO.In a statement, Wentworth said: “Wentworth Club has a longstanding business strategy to retain and build on its status as one of the most prestigious golf and country clubs in the world. The board is committed to this and to the debenture model. This is a matter for Wentworth Club and its members.”More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"church england culture can treat minorities like germs says","story":"The Church of England can create a culture where minorities are being treated “ like germs”, the Dean of St Paul’s Cathedral has claimed. Speaking ahead of Easter Sunday, the Very Reverend Dr David Ison, said the Church and its God “appear inhuman to many” because it is “complicit” in “structural discrimination” against women, black, poor and LGBT people.His comments come days after a landmark review set up by Number 10 concluded that Britain is no longer a place “where the system is deliberately rigged against ethnic minorities”.The report sparked a backlash from Labour MPs, charities and academics who accused the Government of keeping us debating about the existence of racism rather than doing anything about it. However, the Dean, who was installed in his current role in 2012, argued the Church “goes further than society does” in its discrimination.He made the controversial claims in a piece written for Via Media, the blog of Jayne Ozanne - the Church’s most prominent LGBT campaigner - and has been shared exclusively with The .He said: “The Uighurs and Rohingya. Political and religious terrorism. Black Lives Matter. Child poverty and homelessness. Violence and discrimination against women, LGBTI and disabled people. “Cruelty continues, and those with power who do it will find ways to justify the unjustifiable. We even do it in the Church – not only with repeated safeguarding failures, but by being complicit with society at large in structural discrimination against black people and poor people and women and LGBTI people. “The Church goes further now than society does in maintaining exemptions from discrimination against women and gay people, and we justify it in the name of what is acceptable to God – which makes the Church and its God appear inhuman to many.”In the comment piece, entitled Is God inhuman?, he added: “Why do we think that being good and kind is ‘proper’ and ‘befitting’ human behaviour, when experience is that human behaviour includes so much that we want to reject as ‘inhuman’? “Discrimination, violence, misogyny, racism and slavery come from dehumanising those who are ‘different’, excluding them from being our fully human neighbour, treating them as ‘other’ or as evil or to be eradicated like germs from the social body, acting as we do so out of the evil that has not been eradicated in us.”This is not the first time that the Dean of St Paul’s Cathedral has been critical of the church. As an open evangelical who is supportive of same-sex partnerships, he has repeatedly called on the Church of England to back gay marriage.Earlier this week, the communities secretary, Robert Jenrick, visited St Paul’s Cathedral to meet the dean and see how the community is preparing to hold Covid-secure Easter services. Under the current restrictions, communal worship or prayer can be attended by as many people as the place of worship can safely accommodate, in a way which complies with COVID-19 secure guidance and the law. This means that people from different households or support bubbles must not mix when participating in communal worship. More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"covid vaccine passports might work uk","story":"Prime Minister Boris Johnson is expected on Monday to confirm for the first time that a system of Covid certification is being developed to allow people to return to sporting matches, theatres and other major public events, as well as travelling overseas for holidays.The Government defines Covid certificates or passports as something that can show you have had either a vaccine, a recent negative test, or antibodies from having the infection within the last six months.Mr Johnson is not expected to announce significant detail about the plan on Monday, but is rumoured to be preparing to rule out using passports in certain settings, such as hospitals, GP surgeries, public transport and supermarkets.The Government could turn one of the NHS smartphone apps into a digital Covid passport or run a separate app, allowing the public to carry around a proof of vaccination, a test, or antibodies.There is also discussion about a non-digital version of a passport for those who do not have a smartphone.The passport is expected to consider three factors: vaccination, a recent negative test, or antibodies.This review into Covid certificates is being led by Michael Gove, the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster.The EFL Cup Final and an FA Cup Semi-Final are among a range of pilot events hosting audiences as part of the government’s plan to test out Covid certification, alongside social distancing, ventilation and test-on-entry protocols.The Government said attendees will not be permitted entry if they have symptoms of Covid-19. They will also have to provide contact details of everyone in their group for NHS Test and Trace.Liverpool City Council said that the events in Liverpool, including a club night on April 30, will not involve passports.The full list of events are as follows:16 - Hot Water Comedy Club, Liverpool - 300 people (indoor seated)18 - FA Cup Semi-Final - Wembley - 4,000 people (outdoor seated)17 - 3 May - Snooker World Championships - Sheffield Crucible Theatre - up to 1,000 people a day (indoor seated)23-25  - Luna Outdoor Cinema, Liverpool - 1,000 people (outdoor seated)24-25 - Three 10k runs -  Hatfield Park - 3,000 people and up to 3,000 spectators at each event (outdoor, mass participation run)25 - Carabao Cup Final, Wembley -  8,000 people (outdoor, seated)29 - Business Event, Liverpool - 1,000 people (indoor, seated and mixing)30 - Circus Nightclub, Liverpool - circa 3,000 people (indoor club night)15 - FA Cup Final, Wembley, London - 21,000 people (outdoor, seated)Senior government sources have told The  that the system will take months, not weeks to develop, raising the prospect that the passports will not be available until the autumn.Writing in The , Mr Gove said there were a host of practical and ethical questions we have to answer before we can consider a wider roll-out.For health reasons, some people cannot be vaccinated, so we have to ensure access to certification through testing or natural immunity as an alternative.We must not exclude those who do not have a smartphone, so we’re exploring paper-based complements to the app. Privacy and data security must be watertight.Mr Gove said nightclubs and other venues already police entry.

It starts with a death, a chance to mourn, and ends with a resurrection – the promise of an end to lockdown. When you get that kind of coincidence between theology and current events, it’s tempting to describe religion as metaphor, a set of stories someone wrote to bring comfort. But religion also challenges one’s assumptions. If you really believe in it, it can turn your life upside down.Jesus rising from the dead is not poetry: to Christians it is a historical event. This is mindblowing, not only because it defies the laws of science, one in the eye for Richard Dawkins, but because it implies that everything Jesus said is true and that all his teachings are not just “good advice” but the word of God. Then there’s the proposition that Jesus went through the horrors of crucifixion willingly, that he could’ve stopped it but chose not to.Covid and the lockdown have been about trying to avoid death, which is right and human. Easter is about the son of God dying voluntarily, which is ine. To clarify, lots of people have lost their lives helping others during this pandemic, people of all faiths and none, and sacrifice is a theme you find across all cultures. But Jesus, Christians believe, was actually put on this Earth in order to be killed, and this narrative flies against our human instinct to cling onto as much of life as possible.Countless Christians have tried to emulate Jesus’s selflessness, such as Damien of Molokai, the 19th century missionary who worked so fearlessly among the diseased that he caught leprosy and died, or the Medieval visionary Angela of Foligno, who bathed a leper and then drank the water. She rejoiced when she got a scab caught in her throat. Suffering is more than a sad fact of life, many believe, but can be ennobling. God is pro-risk.Mystics have been replaced by scientists, doctors and rational thinkers, which is fine because it’s nice to live in an era without crucifixions and in which plagues might be beaten, not just endured. But a downside for religion is that it is now hard to sell the “life of the spirit” to a society that is almost wholly materialist, for which death is the end, best hidden from view, and terrifying.This is why so many churches have had a “bad pandemic”: they remain superb at “accompanying” others through their grief, but they are nervous about talking about what happens next, that resurrection is on the cards. How do we connect the dots between the story of a good man dying, which we can all wonder at yet accept, and the outrageous claim that he was God and he came back? That’s a huge leap to expect in human comprehension. Many Christians fear that if they ask people to take it, they’ll leave them behind, so they don’t try.Nevertheless, Christianity isn’t only about teaching the right way to live but also the right way to die. The two are connected. I’d like to die suddenly, painlessly – perhaps in the middle of a good cigar – but also with a clear conscience. I suspect that means I’ve got to start living more courageously and, against all one’s instincts, for the benefit of others.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"superpowers eye greenland vote scramble earths treasures","story":"AS elections go, it sounds rather minor-league: a contest with just 40,000 voters, triggered by a planning row in one of the most remote, inhospitable corners of the planet.On Tuesday, though, diplomats from Washington to Beijing will be watching carefully as Greenland holds snap parliamentary polls.With a total of population of just 56,000, its electorate is smaller than some British town councils – yet their vote over the vexed issue of the Kvanefjeld mine project could have implications not just for Greenland, but the global superpower race.Overlooking the tiny fishing settlement of Narsaq, where locals live mainly off catching whales and seals, the project aims to tap into one of world\u0027s biggest deposits of rare earth minerals - materials as vital to the 21st-century as oil was to the 20th.Their supermagnetic, superconductive properties are used in everything from i-Phones and solar panels through to hybrid cars and weapons systems.Yet while they are key to the goals of a high-tech, low-carbon world, extracting them itself can be an environmentally-hazardous process - a point not lost on Greenland\u0027s residents, some of whom are sceptical of promises from the Australian firm behind the project, Greenland Minerals, that strict anti-pollution measures will be enforced.The country\u0027s ruling Siumut party called Tuesday\u0027s snap polls amid growing rifts over the project, which has already led to rowdy public meetings and police called in to investigate death threats.“The mine will destroy everything,” said Jens Davidsen, a Narsaq fisherman. “We are afraid dust from the mine will hurt our fishing grounds and drinking water.”Frontrunners in the election are the Left-wing, pro-green Inuit Ataqatigiit party, who could throw the mine project out altogether, despite warnings from rival parties that Greenland\u0027s isolated economy must end its dependence on fishing.But for others, the stakes are about much more than even that. Of particular concern is that Greenland Minerals is part-owned by Shenghe Holdings, a Chinese firm with close ties to the Beijing government.Western diplomats fear that Beijing may be seeking to monopolise Greenland\u0027s rare earth deposits - giving it control over what is fast becoming the world\u0027s most valuable resource.Such worries are underscored by the fact that Beijing already dominates the rare earth market as it is. More than half of all existing supplies are mined in China, which supplies the European Union with 98 per cent of its needs, and the US with 80 per cent.With Greenland considered the last great untapped rare earth reserve - estimates run to up to 25 per cent of total resources – it is now the target of a new superpower scramble”.Whether it\u0027s an Apple Mac or an F35 fighter jet, you can\u0027t make any smart technology without using rare earth minerals, said Dwayne Menezes, managing director of the Polar Research and Policy Initiative, a London-based international think-tank.They\u0027re also really important for a Britain that wants to be a leader on climate issues. All big offshore wind projects, for example, need rare earths - our entire transport, industrial and energy strategy depends on them.Last month, his thinktank produced a new report, calling for a Five Eyes critical minerals alliance between Britain and its traditional intelligence allies - the US, Canada, Australia and New Zealand.The report said that Greenland offers the US and its allies the opportunity to reduce their dependence on China for resources essential to their defence and security.It added that British mineral exploration firms were also operating in Greenland, and called for closer post-Brexit trade ties between the two nations.The report comes in the wake of former US President Donald Trump\u0027s 2019 offer to buy Greenland from Denmark, just as the US bought Alaska from Russia in 1867.While Mr Trump’s offer earned widespread ridicule - not least because Greenland is now semi-independent - it reflected a belated re-appreciation of Greenland\u0027s strategic importance.Last year, the US opened a new consulate in Greenland\u0027s capital, Nuuk - its first to operate there since 1953. Mr Trump\u0027s successor, Joe Biden, who is similarly hawkish on China, has also ordered a review of America\u0027s dependence on Chinese rare-earth supply chains.China is further wooing Greenland through its Polar Silk Road, an infrastructure project geared around new shipping routes opening up through the melting of the Arctic ice cap.However, plans by Beijing to invest heavily in key Greenlandic infrastructure - include an old naval base and a new airport - have been sidelined by Denmark, allegedly at Washington\u0027s behest.Greenlanders, meanwhile, are realising that sitting on the world\u0027s newest treasure trove puts them in a geopolitical tug-of-war.A mineral boom shared out between just 56,000 people could transform living standards, as well as bring financial independence from Denmark, which currently subsidises a third of the Nuuk government’s budget.Jens-Erik Kirkegaard, a former minerals minister who backs the Greenland Minerals project, said that rather than taking sides, Greenland wanted to be a free and open market for everybody who wants to participate.If Europe and the US were worried, he told The , they need to show more than just concerns, and start putting money into exploration.But Mikkel Myrup, a local environmentalist, warns that if the Greenland Minerals project goes ahead, the stormy public meetings of recent months may be just the beginning.I am all for Greenland exploring its mineral potential, but this is not the project to start our mineral adventure with,” he said.“China\u0027s own environmental record is not good, and if the Chinese government gets a foothold here, we will have to have a lot of other discussions - it is a non-democratic government with no respect for human rights.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus vaccine passport scheme app","story":"NewsCoronavirus vaccine passport scheme and app may not launch until SeptemberBoris Johnson is to set out plans to develop a \"Covid status certication\" scheme to enable the safeof mass gatherings but questions have been raised about how soon it will actually happenmirrorShareCommentsByGavin CordonSam Rkaina:,  APR Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soonCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror video what-look-out-boris-johnsons-,customFields:,enableJWPlayer:true,jwPlayerSiteID:hPpIvH,jwPlayerMediaID:ZxQhiJzj,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : #

Officials are planning a series of trial events in April and May as they look to find a way for venues such as football grounds and nightclubs to reopen without the need for social distancing. But government sources have reportedly told thethe idea, which will likely involving using an app, could take months rather than weeks to develop.One source told the newspaper: “I don’t expect it to be until much later in the year,” and may not be until September.If accurate, that will raise questions about whether the scheme will serve much of a purpose, given that half of adults have already had their first vaccine jab, with millions more to follow well before the autumn.More than five million people in the UK have also now received their second dose of the vaccine. The Prime Minister - who will set out more details on Monday - said the Government was doing everything it can to enable theof mass events. However, MPs will want to study the proposals closely with many deeply suspicious about anything which smacks of a vaccine passport for domestic use.  More than  Tory MPs have publicly declared their opposition to the idea, and Mr Johnson could struggle to get the plan through Parliamentthey decide to oppose it. In developing the scheme, officials will take into account three factors - whether an inidual has received the vaccine, has recently tested negative for the virus, or has natural immunity having tested positive in the previous six months. The NHS is said to be currently working on ways of providing people with the means to demonstrate their Covid status through digital and non-digital routes. The review is also looking at how ventilation and testing on entry could facilitate the safeof audiencesto mass events and closed settings. Ministers believe the scheme will be most useful in managing the risks where the are large numbers of people in close proximity such as music festivals, sporting matches and nightclubs.  Setting where certication will not be required include essential shops and public transport. It will also not apply to businesses which are set to reopen over the coming weeks such as pubs, restaurants and non-essential retail. Officials are working with clinical and ethical experts to ensure there are appropriate exemptions for people who are advised to the vaccine and for whom repeat testing would be dficult. The first trial is due to take place on April  at the Hot Water Comedy Club in Liverpool, to be followed two days later by the FA Cup semi-final at Wembley. Other events where the scheme is to be tested include the World Snooker Championship at the Crucible Theatre in Sheffield - running from from April  to May  - and a mass participation run at Hatfield House on April  and . The pilots will culminate with the FA Cup Final, again at Wembley, on May . Mr Johnson said: We have made huge strides over the past few months with our vaccine programme and everyone in the country has made huge sacrices to get us to this stage in our recovery from Covid-.  We are doing everything we can to enable the reopening of our country so people canto the events, travel and other things they love as safely as possible, and these reviews will play an important role in allowing this to happen. The Prime Minister will also outline the Governmentaposs approach for easing restrictions on foreign travel when its global travel task force reports on April . Ministers have made clear that the ban on foreign travel will remain in place until at least May . When it is finally lted, it will be be replaced by a risk-based traffic light system with red, amber and green ratings for countries around the world.

So someone should make one about the biggest mystery of our times – how Boris Johnson manages to sodding get away with it. ImagineJeremy Corbyn had become Prime Minister and £, of public money went to a woman he’d had sex with on his settee, while his we was away. Iain Duncan-Smith would propose in parliament that a tactical nuclear strike was carried out on the spring onion patch on his allotment. The Dailywould say: “In order to maintain that our nation upholds the rule of public decency, it is imperative that Mr Corbyn is smothered in beef fat and made to run naked through an industrial estate, strapped to the settee while chased by a pack of wild dogs, then Jacob Rees-Mogg sips sherry to the celebratory tones of a bugle to rejoice at his capture.” The head of the Civil Service would tell us Corbyn had breached the code on International Furniture Fornication, so renounced his right to be human and must now be classied as an amphibian, and made to live on a lily in the New Forest. The Chief Executive of the Settee Society would be on television every day, declaring Corbyn had offended settees deeply. Indeed he personally knew hundreds of them that were now terried to leave the DFS warehouse. The settee on which the act took place would be placed in a glass called the “Box of Evil” and people would be charged £ to queue up and see it from a distance, with signs on the wall warning no one should go too close as it was so toxic, you could catch Corbynity off it, which would make you forget to sing National Anthems and make promises to nationalise things without costing them properly. Instead, most of the British media ignored completely that the Prime Minister was accused of using his position of Mayor of London to fund the project of a woman he fancied.  Andthey had to report it, they’d probably say “Bonky Boris as randy as an Easter bunny’”and he’d go up % in the polls. In the same way, imagineCorbyn had wasted £billion on a useless Test and Trace system. The Daily Mail would demand: “Corbyn must be made to grow £billion worth of marrows and give them all away to pay off his debt.” From coronavirus to Brexit, our daily politics newsletter is there to guide you these turbulent times.

Now beginning his second year as leader, the former chief public prosecutor pledges to end the party’s softly, softly approach on crime with tough sentences for rapists, murderers and street thugs. Rapists who abduct and kill victims will get whole-le tarfs to help women feel better protected. And he promises to overturn Tory laws which put statues before people when he becomes PM. In a Sunday Mirror interview he said: “A starting point of five years for rape while suggesting  years for damaging statues is the clearest example of the Government getting its priorities completely wrong.” There will be two years’ jail for attacking shop and transport workers and a legal right for anti-social behaviour victims to have complaints investigated by police.Sir Keir, , who was Director of Public Prosecutions for five years from , added: “ Labour has not been strong enough on crime and policing in the past.I have spent a good deal of my professional le prosecuting criminals. We need to get serious about anti-social behaviour. “Abuse and intimidation ruins lives to the point where people no longer feel safe to come out of their homes.”Sir Keir became Labour leader with .% of the vote a year ago today, four months after Jeremy Corbyn led the party to its biggest defeat in  years.“I’ve not made a speech to a live audience or shaken a voter’s hand since,” he said. “It’s been beyond frustrating.” He told us this time last year his task was to “win back the trust of the country.” Sir Keir said: “The work we have to do will take more than a year. I needed to make it clear in Year One Labour was under new leadership and to root out anti-Semitism. “In Year Two I will set out the case for getting Britain working. After the pandemic we can’t just patch up the broken system we had before.  “The main reason we had Europe’s highest death toll and the worst economic impact is because of the weakened foundations after  years of austerity. “But we will only rebuild trust by listening good and hard to voters and communities. We have made the Labour Party relevant again. “During the leadership race I was being asked whether the Labour Party would even survive. Now I’m being asked why we’re not ahead in the polls!We were as good as relegated but now we’re back on the pitch and can build from here.” Local elections are only  days away and with so many postponed from last year they will become a national test of Labour’s popularity.

Under the current coronavirus lockdown roadmap, leaving the UK with one of a number of essential reasons is illegal until May .At that point a traffic light system will come into force. It will be based on a range of factors - including the proportion of a given countryaposs population that has been vaccinated, rates of infection, emerging new iants and the countryaposs access to reliable scientic data and genomic sequencing. Do you think the traffic light system is a good idea  Tell us in the comments below. Travellers arriving from countries rated green will not be required to isolate - although three pre-departure and post-arrival tests will still be needed.One test must be no longer than  hours before you leave for Britain, and two - on the second and eighth day - after the traveller is back, the Daily Mail reports. For those classed as amber, the restrictions will remain as they are with arrivals required to isolate for ten days onto the UK. The same testing regime must be carried out as for green countries, although those able to pay extra can pay to have a third test on day five, cutting isolation time. People coming back from red countries will have to follow the same testing protocol, but with no option for an early third test and hotel quarantine required.  It is likely that tests will be made cheaper than they currently are, so travellers arenapost required to fork out hundreds of pounds to get into the country. While the government has not yet released a list of countries broken down by traffic light, using the likely criteria guesses can be made as to which nation is in which. Israel is likely to be classied as green due to its high vaccination rate of  per cent and low infection rate of  cases per , people.Other countries odds on to be in the same category are Malta, Portugal, Gibraltar, UAE, the US, Canada, Barbados, Mexico, Sri Lanka, Morocco and Grenada, according to one analysis of vaccination and case rates.At things currently stand countries like Turkey and Greece may be classied as amber, although the rate of infection on the European continent means the picture is rapidly changing. Brazil, which recorded more than , cases in a single day on April  and is contending with its own iant, is a contender for the red list. This all remains speculation however, and the government has said that the best course of action is to stay in the UK.  A spokesperson said it is too early to predict which countries will be on which list over the summer, adding: as such, we continue to advise people not to book summer holidays abroad. Under the current rules in England leaving the UK without a reasonable excuse risks a £, fine. Such excuses include work, studying, elite sports, medical reasons, care and assistance to a vulnerable person or a wedding of a close family member. There is also a £ fixed penalty notice for failing to fill in a travel declaration form for those planning to leave the UK. Bosses from leading UK airlines have tried to dial up the pressure on Johnson to give them the green light for international travel within weeks, it has been reported.The chief executives of British Airways, easyJet, Jet, Loganair, Ryanair, Tui and Virgin Atlantic as well as trade body Airlines UK wrote to the PM as ministers made it clear the ban on foreign travel will be in place until at least mid-May.Airline chiefs said in their letter, published by The Sun, they recognised restriction-free universal travel may not be possible by May .

There on a screen in front of him was British astronaut Tim Peake – chatting to him all about le in orbit. Then the youngster, who could name all the planets, was given a virtual reality headset to go on spacewalks. And just two days before he died, Aiden – who wanted to be an astronaut – was stunned to discover he’d had a star officially named after him. His moving send-off was all arranged by charity Make-A-Wish after his mum and dad contacted them to ask for a “space hug” for their tragic son from Tim.What do you think of this story  Let us know in our commentsThe Mirroraposs newsletter brings you the latest news, exciting showbiz and TV stories, sport updates and essential political information.The newsletter is emailed out first thing every morning, at noon and every evening. Never miss a moment by signing up to our newsletter here.  And the -year-old hero was only too glad to help. “It was very special for me to be able to bring a bit of happiness to Aiden,” he said. Last July Aiden was diagnosed with a terminal veins condition that weakened his heart – with mum Caitlin given the shocking news from doctors just minutes after he had met his new baby brother Logan in hospital. Her eldest son was given months to live. And now Caitlin and husband Joshua are battling to make it law for babies showing a “failure to thrive” to have vital organs checked at six months. “It would not have saved Aiden,” says Caitlin, . “But I’d hate other parents to be in a position where something could have made a dference.”  For now, she and Joshua are consoled by the memories of their son’s final weeks – and the kindness of the hero who sent her the video message for her son. Caitlin says: “Before I started the video, I said to Aiden, ‘This is a real astronaut who wants to talk to you’. He loved spacemen after seeing Buzz Lightyear in Toy Story and was ecstatic. He couldn’t believe an astronaut wanted to speak to him.” Tim – who made the first spacewalk by an “official” British astronaut in  – told Aiden: “It is quite incredible to think you would have been a small baby while I was up there floating around in orbit around Earth. It’s the most incredible experience you could ever imagine.” Tim showed Aiden a bacon sandwich in a tin, like the first meal he had on the International Space Station, the drink pouch he took on space walks and the no-rinse shampoo used by astronauts. He signed off with: “So there you go… there’s a few secrets of what we do in space. Sending you big space hugs Aiden, from Tim Peake.”  Caitlin says: “Tim became one of Aiden’s heroes and his message helped make those final days that little bit more special. It’s nice to know there are people out there who will do what they can to put a smile on a child’s face.” Aiden saw the message just three days before he died in December – a day later the Make-A-Wish certicate arrived, telling him a star had been named after him. It marked “the family’s final perfect day together”, says Caitlin. She says: “It wasn’t in our night sky at the time – it appears in April. “So we downloaded an app that shows all the constellations and showed Aiden that instead. He was chuffed, particularly as it was in the Hercules constellation and he loved the Disney film.” Aiden’s problems began just before birth in , when his heart rate dropped during contractions. “We almost lost him,” says Caitlin. “When they placed him on my chest, he was grey and not breathing properly. After a couple of weeks, he was drinking a lot more milk but not putting on weight.”  At six months, doctors made an assessment of “failure to thrive” – a medical term to describe slow physical development. At two Aiden was hospitalised with pneumonia and Caitlin feared something  was wrong. But it was not until June  that the Queen Alexandra hospital, Portsmouth got to the bottom of his problems, finding his liver enlarged, pneumonia in both lungs and heart failure. Doctors diagnosed pulmonary vein stenosis – which destroys veins between the heart and lungs. It strikes less than two in , children under two, with a survival rate of less than % within five years of diagnosis, says the Canadian Respiratory Journal.  Caitlin was given the terrying news after giving birth to Logan on June . Excited Aiden had just met his new brother in the hospital. Now Caitlin and Joshua, of Gosport, Hants, are being backed by their MP Caroline Dinenage and the Children’s Heart Federation in their campaign. Caitlin says: “We brought one child into the world then were told we were likely to lose our other son. The NHS says while ‘a failure to thrive’ is not a diagnosis, it recognises a baby’s faltering growth is cause for concern. “But all ‘failure to thrive’ babies should have major organs checked at six months as a legal requirement. “Aiden struggled with eating and slow development as he grew, but it wasn’t until he deteriorated at four that major tests were done.”  CHF chief Anne Kearney-Clarke told us: “Sadly, this is not the first time we have come across a situation where vital signs have been missed. This is why we are campaigning for pulse oximetry testing for all newborn infants. No child should be labelled as failing to thrive without their heart being monitored for a potential problem.” In his final days in a hospice, Aiden did space walks on his Oculus virtual reality headset and opened early Christmas presents. “The last time I bathed him we pretended he was using astronaut no-rinse shampoo,” says carer Caitlin.

John McFadden, , popped to the shops to buy a vape after deciding it was time for him to ditch the cigarettes. With his change he bought a X Scratchcard - and was astonished to claim the top prize. He has already splashed out on a new car and is planning a dream holiday to the South Pacic and South-East Asia. Granddad-of-two John, from Southampton, said: “I knew I had to do something about my smoking. “With the change from buying the vape, I bought a Scratchcard and took it home. “When I started scratching it off, it said £, under the first number and I thought ‘whoopee!’ “I carried on and just kept seeing more and more £,s.

He added: “I called Camelot and was stunned when they said I had actually won £M and that I was a millionaire. “I couldn’t believe it was real.” The orced dad-of-three is planning to move closer to his children and grandchildren, who live in Weymouth, Dorset.

John and Laura Lewis embarked on a mission to build the structure around a majestic tree in their land and even called an architect to make it as luxurious as possible. The treehouse is the size of a small house - about  square metres and  metres off the floor.The couple said this is the third treehouse they built together, but the whole process was much more complex and challenging than the previous times, Wales Online reports.The foundations of the treehouse are constructed from large steel frames which are built over the tree roots, with the decking, joists and floorboards added next. Then, when the treehouse had a sound base, the build team could start erecting the actual structure including the walls, upstairs floor and roof. Prince Llywelyn treehouse is an exciting structure not only for children, but also for adults. One of its most amazing features is a veranda boasting a hot tub - a dream location to stargaze. In the house there is also a luxurious brass bath. Laura said: I love the brass bath. I was adamant I wanted a aposwowapos bath for the new treehouse. I searched all over the internet searching for the perfect one. I didnapost really know what I was looking for to be honest - I just knew when I found it, and fell in love! I tend to work outwards when planning the interiors and everything in the bathroom was designed to revolve around the bath. When youaposre in it, you can also see the stream which runs underneath the treehouse. It looks like a little waterfall. Inside, the spacious house in the air can offer a sociable and super-trendy looking kitchen diner that has mesmerising views out over the coupleaposs land and beyond for many miles, to the Radnor Forset on the horizon. The main material inside the structure is wood, but some special additions include metallic accents, soft tactile textures and fabrics. One of the most surprising parts of the treehouse is the floor-suspended hammock, affectionately named by the couple as the aposonly the braveapos hammock. Laura said: We needed a treehouse large enough to accommodate a family of five and have achieved it by adding a hammock, so it can actually sleep seven with two of them on the hammock.  John added: The floor suspended hammock is a great feature. We sourced it from a company in France. It was actually our architect who suggested the idea, you need a lot of height to install one, which we had with this treehouse. Originally it was planned for the outside, but it rains a lot in Wales, so it didnapost seem practical to have it out on the decking so we put it inside instead. Another feature to notice inside the treehouse is the intriguing wall dedicated to old doors, adding texture, colour and interest to the space, as well as a new upcycled lease of le for these  former front doors. There is also a slide for children - and probably adults too - to have fun. John said: In the past two weeks, weaposve added the  foot stainless steel slide on the decking, made from reclaimed materials. Itaposs about -years-old but weaposve cleaned it up, so technically itaposs aposvintage.apos  He said that at first they wanted to build something futuristic, but after looking at the designed they decided to go for something more traditional - with some modern touch. The couple added they wanted to use sustainable material in constructing the treehouse. John said: The front section is made from reclaimed oak beams which could be  years old. I actually bought them a couple of years ago thinking we might build a treehouse - so itaposs amazing to finally see it come to fruition. The cladding we used is also made of leftover bits of board which are about  years old, but we repurposed. But one of my favourite features is the roof which is made out of recycled plastic slates. I wish weaposd known about them sooner so I could have used them on the other two treehouses. They are unreal and should last for le. Over the years of constructing their treehouse business called Squirrelaposs Nest, the couple have learnt as they have progressed through this unique property construction journey. John says: The other two treehouses both took around  months to build, but we had some really bad weather, wind and rain. And with the first treehouse we had three foot of snow and actually lost some materials - we couldnapost find them until it melted! This latest build was not struck by compilations of the weather but by the global coronavirus pandemic, but it was still their fastest construction so far.John says: From start to finish, it took us six months - our quickest build yet, this was despite delays from suppliers due to Covid. Materials which would usually take two weeks to order, we had to wait eight weeks or more. There were also huge delays with the glass which held things up a bit, as we couldnapost do any internal work until that was in. We started the build in May , so it was spring and we had lovely weather, so we were lucky with that. We completed in October  and weaposre pretty pleased with that result. It cost us around £, to build it from scratch. Now that this latest luxury treehouse is ready to welcome guests, the couple couldnapost be happier with the outcome and struggle to decide which aspect of the structure ultimately wins their hearts. John said: I think itaposs the upstairs living space because of the views. This is the first treehouse where we have the living area upstairs, so itaposs a bit topsy-turvy in that respect. He added: Being a carpenter, Iaposm really pleased with the oak glazed gable as it has so much character. I also like going underneath the treehouse and looking up at it. Itaposs big anyway, but it just looks ginormous! Laura said: I love the downstairs dining kitchen area, itaposs the only treehouse that has a dining table.

The mercury will plummet as low as -C and gales are forecast especially in the north of the UK on Sunday and Monday as wintry conditions .“Frequent snow and hail showers, accompanied by a very strong northerly wind may lead to some disruption from later Sunday,” was the Met Office ’s prediction for northern Scotland as it gave a yellow warning.“Some roads and railways affected with longer journey times by road, bus and train services.” Frost is set to greet most of the country as people wake up on Sunday. “Easter day starts off dry bright but chilly and then we will see plenty of sunshine through the day especially for eastern parts of England,” said a Met office forecaster. He then, though, told people to prepare for a further cold blast. “Through the evening and overnight period the rain in the north will gradually make its way further south and this introduces much colder air and stronger winds bringing snow across parts of Scotland as we move into Easter Monday.  “Easter Monday cold, very windy with wintry showers expected anywhere by the end of the day.” Weather warnings for wind and snow are in place for Monday and Tuesday in Scotland.But other parts of the country wonapost escape the chill, with everywhere in England from the south to the north expected to see sub-zero temperatures at some point. Looking ahead to the rest of the week the situation doesn’t improve much with it being advisable to wrap up warm. Very cold and windy with further wintry showers on Tuesday, said the Met Office. Drier, but still cold, on Wednesday. Less cold through Thursday, but with rain and strong winds in the north. It will be a far cry from last Wednesday, with Weybourne in north Norfolk seeing temperatures peaking at .C. The figure fell just short of the hottest ever March temperature of .C, which was recorded in  at Mepal in Cambridgeshire.

Hopefully, it won’t be too long for most of the lads.“We’ll have Fin back for the summer in pre-season. That’s a wee test for him that I’m sure he’ll come through with flying colours.“Everybody  is healthy and good to go.”Shining more light on Sow’s problem, hamstring tightness, McPake is happy the striker came off when he did as he pulled up in last weekend’s - win over Dunfermline.The Dee gaffer added: “It’s not a tear. It’s just tight and, to be fair to the big man, he’d been carrying it for a wee while.“Danny Mullen wasn’t right. He only trained last Friday morning so we’d done all our prep with Osman in the team and then, unfortunately, it got tight in the game.“He looked after it, we’re glad he done that, and Danny went on and did well.“We got pretty lucky with that because he probably wasn’t quite ready to play that amount of game time.“It worked out OK for us in the end.”With so many battling with their fitness, McPake would be forgiven for using this afternoon’s cup clash with Saints as an opportunity to get minutes in legs.However, he insists their focus is on progression and that means picking the strongest team available.“I see it as a cup-tie that we’ve been building up to all week,” he said.“The league’s been put to the side. People will say I’m lying but I’m not, the Scottish Cup is a hugely important tournament for every club in Scotland.“We want to progress and I see it as a chance to play against a very good St Johnstone side that have cemented their place in the top six and already won a cup.Dundee v St Johnstone: Where on TV can you watch Saturday#s all-Tayside Scottish Cup clash \" title\"#Dundee v St Johnstone: Where on TV can you watch Saturday#s all-Tayside Scottish Cup clash # # Evening \" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp dundee-v-st-johnstone-where-on-tv-can-you-watch-saturdays-all-tayside-scottish-cup-clash embed # secretVRjCdBV\" data-secret\"VRjCdBV\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"“Taking away everything they’ve done this season, this is their biggest game and because it’s the next one it’s ours, too.“Our biggest aim was promotion but when the cup comes around it takes up your full week.“I’m not going to rubbish it and say I see it as a chance to play squad players or fringe boys because our full squad is going to be needed between now and the end of the season.“I think it’s paramount that everybody is at a level anyway. Most of the players are at the minute.“It’s an important game and we’ll pick the team we believe can go out and give a very good account of Dundee Football Club and give us a chance to beat a very good St Johnstone team.”As for the Perth men, McPake has been impressed with the job boss Callum Davidson has done in guiding his side to the top six and a Betfred Cup season in his first season in the McDiarmid Park dugout.And, having crossed paths with Davidson on coaching courses, he’s not been surprised by the success either as his Dark Blues side aim to cause an upset.McPake continued: “Callum’s done an excellent job.“I really like him and, first and foremost, he’s a really good guy.“Myself and Davedid our Pro Licence with him and he’s a fantastic coach.“The job he’s done there is remarkable,I’m honest. The way he’s got his team playing, they’re good to watch in the system he plays.“They’re very fluid and a real threat. To go and win a cup, even in the games against Celtic and Rangers I’ve watched them in, they’ve been in those games.“They’ve never really been out of games and that’s credit to Callum and his coaching staff.“Our aim is to put a good show on for Dundee and give them a real test when they come here.“We’re at home and we’ve got to try to take the game to them.“We know it’s going to be really tough, we’re under no illusions that any game is easy, but add in what they’ve done this season and it makes it even harder.“It’s a cup-tie and it’s a game we’re really looking forward to.“You need a level of performance to win any game but for this we need to be at our very best, I believe.“It takes that performance against Dunfermline, minus the first six minutes, or the one we had at Hearts here .“We need to hit those levels right through the pitch to give ourselves a chance.”Dundee #thirtysomethings# desperate to cap careers with silverware, says Dark Blues assistant Dave Mackay\" title\"#Dundee #thirtysomethings# desperate to cap careers with silverware, says Dark Blues assistant Dave Mackay# # Evening \" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp  embed # secretULCBLVFMi\" data-secret\"ULCBLVFMi\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/syndicatenews/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/11/20014320_37093249-e1606753677725-940x564.jpg ","title":"dundee st johnstone charlie adam not derby","story":".dct-cta@-webkit-keyframes dctSpinnertransform:rotate%transform:rotate@keyframes dctSpinnertransform:rotate%transform:rotate.dct-cta__title.dct-cta__content p.dct-cta__content p:not.dct-cta__content p:last-child.dct-cta__label.dct-cta__input.dct-cta__input::-webkit-input-placeholder.dct-cta__input::-moz-placeholder.dct-cta__input:-ms-input-placeholder.dct-cta__input::placeholder.dct-cta__label:hover.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__label:focus.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__input:hover,.dct-cta__input:focus.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__btn .stransition:all cubic-bezier .s.dct-cta__btn.dct-cta__btn:disabled.dct-cta__btn:not.dct-cta__btn:not:hover.dct-cta__btn:not:hover,.dct-cta__btn:not:focus.dct-cta__btn-text.dct-cta__btn:before .stransition:all cubic-bezier .s.dct-cta__btn-loadingborder-top:px solid #fffborder-radius:%width:pxheight:pxbox-sizing:border-box-webkit-animation:dctSpinner .s linear infiniteanimation:dctSpinner .s linear infinite.dct-cta--signup.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__title.dct-cta--signup__dialogs.dct-cta--signup__dialog.dct-cta--signup__dialog--success.dct-cta--signup__dialog--error.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__grid.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--subscribe.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__title.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__content@media only screen and @media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap@media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap+.dct-cta__content@supports or.dct-cta__flex:after.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--signup__dialog.dct-cta--signup__dialog--js-active.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap,.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__content@media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe--contained .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe--contained .dct-cta__image-wrap@media only screen and @supports or.dct-cta__grid:after.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label,.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__gridgrid-template-columns:fr minmaxgrid-gap:.rem .remDundee captain Charlie Adam is looking to get one over Tayside neighbours St Johnstone # but insists the Dark Blues# Scottish Cup clash with the Perth men is not a derby.Saints come to Dens Park today with both sides seeking progress into the last .The stakes are high but Adam says that stops at football, with no local bragging rights on the line.For Dundonian and dyed in the wool Dee Adam, there is only one derby.The -year-old said: “It is not a derby. There is only one derby for us.“This is just another game for us against a club that has done well under Tommy Wright winning the Scottish Cup.“They have now won the League Cup, are in a good bit of form and have a couple of decent players.“But the derby for us is across the road and they are the ones where,you get an opportunity to play against your rivals United, they are the big games for us.“This is not a derby for us – it is just another game in the Scottish Cup.”Despite their success in making the top six and winning the Betfred Cup, Adam also insists the McDiarmid Park men are not an inspiration for Dundee.The former Rangers, Liverpool and Scotland man says the chance of lting silverware is the only motivation the Dee need.“We don’t take inspiration from anybody ,” he said.“We look at ourselves and what we can do within the walls of the stadium and what we can control.“We knowwe can be more consistent than what we have been, then we will have a chance of getting promoted.“I don’t look at anybody  and thinkwe do that then we will end up like that. We focus on ourselves.“We are a good football club and we will look to win games between now and the end of the season. Hopefully, that Dunfermline resultcoming back from - down can spur our season on.“Obviously, the Scottish Cup is something dferent andyou get through you might have an opportunity to play one of the Old Firm or an Aberdeen where it is another big challenge.”Dundee go into the cup meeting as underdogs to Premiership St Johnstone and Adam reckons it’s a role that could suit his side.Regardless of the opposition, playing at Dens in a one-off tie makes it a level playing field for the midfielder and his team.“We played Hibs earlier this season and did well for  minutes. We lost a couple of bad goals but in the second game we lost - but played well in that so there is nothing to fear,” he added.“It is not aswe are going in against Celtic or Rangers – something like that.Scottish Cup build-up: The seven St Johnstone and Dundee players who could have ended up in the other team\" title\"#Scottish Cup build-up: The seven St Johnstone and Dundee players who could have ended up in the other team# # The Courier\" src\"https:www.thecourier fp sport football st-johnstone  scottish-cup-build-up-the-seven-st-johnstone-and-dundee-players-who-could-have-ended-up-in-the-other-team embed # secretqaUleRwSM\" data-secret\"qaUleRwSM\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"“We are playing St Johnstone.

If we win it, we are into the next round and we will take that into a run of games in the league where it is important we win a few matches.”Due to spending much of his career down south with the Reds, Blackpool, Stoke City and Reading, Adam doesn’t have much in the way of Scottish Cup memories.He often wasn’t involved in the Gers’ glories but does have experience in the competition as a young player on loan at St Mirren in the   season.“I don’t have too many actually,” he tried to recall.“My recollections of the Scottish Cup would probably be more of being at St Mirren when we beat Motherwell - and I scored two goals.“We had played Spartans on a Sunday afternoon and I remember the park we played on but that’s the enjoyment of the Scottish Cup as you don’t normally get to go to these places so it is dferent.“We played Gretna as well but we lost -. We probably should have won that.“But I don’t really remember too much about playing in the Scottish Cup for Rangers.“Listen, the tradition is there, the history of the Scottish Cup is massive and it doesn#t matteryou are playing at Rangers, Celtic or Annan, Alloa it still has the magic.“It is a big game and there is always a buzz about the place.“It is just a shame there will be no supporters here as there would have been a decent crowd.”Adam hopes to take to the pitch this afternoon feeling revitalised after enduring recent spells on the sidelines through Covid- self-isolation and suspension.It’s been a dficult period for the Dee’s talisman but he has been impressed with how the team have performed in his absence.Adam commented: “It has been a frustrating few weeks, missing the games with Covid and then trying to get back to a fitness level where I was able to go and compete.“The last couple of games I have been on the bench and then I was suspended.“But that is over with and the focus is on now and the end of the season to win as many games as we can to get into the play-offs.“I will be trying to get back into the team as the lads have won a few games, so I just have to be ready and hopefully the opportunity comes today.”Dundee assistant boss Dave Mackay insists there is no huge gulf in quality between Dark Blues and Scottish Cup foes St Johnstone\" title\"#Dundee assistant boss Dave Mackay insists there is no huge gulf in quality between Dark Blues and Scottish Cup foes St Johnstone# # Evening \" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp dundee-dave-mackay-st-johnstone-scottish-cup-gap embed # secretrnideRQS\" data-secret\"rnideRQS\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/04/2.58980158-1-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/04/2.58980158-1-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/04/2.58980158-1-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/04/2.58980158-1-240x180.jpg 300w sizes=(max-width: 940px) 940w, 620w, 300w ","title":"gym worker in dundee sees poetry work popularity soar during lockdown","story":"A city gym worker who has spent lockdown fine tuning her poetry writing has been earning rave reviews for her works over the past  months.

Chris van der Kuyl has been a friend of mine for years and when we sat down to work on our first game together, the music was regarded as an incidental thing.In in the last  years it#s become central to the games process and for me, it#s one of those things that could only have happened in Dundee.Now when I go to America and other places and tell people I#m from Dundee, the place that gave the the world Grand Theft Auto and Minecraft and Lemmings # they see it as a powerhouse.Technology means you can be located anywhere now, the last big game I worked on was with a company in New Orleans. But when I started out in the music industry with Danny Wilson in the s we had to move to London.The great thing was you stood out.But I think there was a sense then that Dundee was a city that had a past and less of a clear idea about its future, and you can#t say that now.There#s a can-do attitude to the place and the people.The s maybe weren#t a great time for the city # a lot of the old industries were going # but people just got their heads down and started doing the things that had to be done to get us to where we are now and a lot of the creative industries that are doing really well grew out of that spirit.I think the size of the city is important.Everyone knows each other, so it#s easy to scale up when you have a project that suddenly takes off because you know a couple of musicians who can help, or you know all the people in the gaming industry.I find people in Dundee are less competitive than in places like London too. There#s a sense of collective responsibility #we stick together we can all be lted up.People have a confidence in their own abilities that means they don#t feel threatened when they give someone  a leg up and that benefits the whole city.A lot of people deserve credit for the huge range of creative industries in Dundee right now.Look at all the smaller companies that started as spin-outs from the likes of Abertay University and initiatives like Dare to be Digital.People had the foresight to say #okay we#re turning out all these amazing graduates, let#s find a way to keep all that potential talent in the city#.As a Dundonian it#s easy to take that for granted but sometimes when you stop and look at it through the eyes of other people it#s gives you a real kick up the backside.There are still challenges of course. We can#t allow it to become a two tier society.It#s got to be inclusive and there are still people in the city who are not doing so well. We have to make sure the successes trickle down to everyone.But honestly, there#s nowhere  I#d rather be.It#s great to see Dundee getting this kind of recognition, says Jim Spence.And it#s nice to see everyone jumping on the bandwagon of celebrating the city#s success but I do find it irksome when I hear people talking about what#s happening now asit#s something out of the ordinary.There seems to be this idea that Dundee is suddenly doing well for itself after long years when everything was terrible but really the city has always been held in high regard around the world.You hear it from some of the professional Dundonians, as I call them # folk who haven#t lived in the city for years. Historians too.This sense that Dundee has always lagged behind. It#s just not true and I find it quite offensive.It#s not so long ago that Dundee was a bigger city than Aberdeen.In the post-war years it was thriving. This image of a bustling, vibrant city hasn#t come out of nowhere # it#s been the reality for a long, long time.Yes it went into a brief period of industrial decline in the  but that was the bit that was out of the ordinary # not the recovery that has happened since.The growth we#re seeing now has been the result of a recalibration rather than anything more dramatic.We#re back on course, with a slightly dferent focus, but this is the direction we#ve always been going in.The other thing you have to remember is that Dundee has always enjoyed a good reputation overseas.It#s only here in Scotland that people had this very dated view of the city.I did the bulk of my travelling as a sports reporter # throughout Europe mostly and further afield.And wherever you went, from Athens to Madrid and Moscow, people knew about Dundee and held it in the highest regard # largely because of  its successes at football.The people I met in other countries regarded it as a world class city even when people at home didn#t.They didn#t know about Hearts or Hibs but they could reel off the names of United players.More recently, I travelled a bit in my role as Rector at Dundee University and again, when we went abroad people knew all about Dundee and understood it to be a city that punched above its weight in areas like dentistry, and biotech and the creative industries.It was only really in Scotland # Glasgow in particular, dare I say it # that the parochial attitudes persisted and you encountered this sometimes astonishing ignorance about what Dundee was really like.If reports like this help to put all that behind us # here at home, as much as in the rest of the world # I#ll be happy.Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest"},{"url":null,"title":"hamilton-grammar-schools-tribute-pupil-brandon-rice","story":"THE headteacher of a pupil who collapsed at home and later died has paid touching tribute to the ldquocharismatic teenager."},{"url":null,"title":"skyes-limit-sabhal-mor-ostaig---unique-gaelic-only-college-set-stunning-island-location","story":"AS global interest in Gaelic grows, students from across the world are travelling to Skye to study at Sabhal Mograver Ostaig, the National Centre for Gaelic Language and Culture."},{"url":null,"title":"new-bbc-documentary-series-jamie-genevieve-great-indoors-air-week","story":"SOCIAL media star Jamie Genevieve will feature in a new documentary series this week."},{"url":null,"title":"list-glasgow-shops-administration-lockdown","story":"GLASGOWS prominent shopping streets will look very dferent post lockdown with many major retailers calling in the administrators."},{"url":null,"title":"brush-britains-marilyn-dream-come-true-glasgow-teen","story":"IT IS no wonder teenage boy Iain Henderson thought he was dreaming back in Glasgow in ."},{"url":null,"title":"remembering-reverend-effie-irvine-pioneering-woman-minister-made-scottish-history","story":" Reverend Effie Irvine made history when she became the first woman minister appointed to a parish in Scotland.

they plan to support Aberdeen following the news the city may lose its last department store.Last week the north-east was rocked by the news John Lewis plans to close its store in Aberdeen – the only remaining department store in the north of Scotland.The retailer’s plans to close its branch on George Street provoked a huge public backlash, with more than , people signing petitions and hundreds more writing letters asking the chain to reconsider.A taskforce, including local authority chiefs and business leaders, was set up in a bid to convince John Lewis to rethink its decision.The closure of the store could lead to the loss of around  jobs – the latest in a long line of blows for the local economy.City leaders fear a #domino effect# where the loss of the store has an impact on other businesses in Aberdeen and the north-east, prompting calls for government support.The council#s administration has written to the leader of each main political party urging them to support the campaign.We asked the leaders what they will do to support the citythey form the next Scottish Government following May#s election.Here is what they said.#Throughout the pandemic, our retail sector has taken a massive hit and this is reflected by the unfortunate and incredibly sad decision that John Lewis took to close its doors in Aberdeen # a decision I hope it is willing to reconsider.#As we recover from the pandemic and out of lockdown, businesses need to be at the heart of that and a re-elected SNP Government would stand ready to work with the Aberdeen taskforce and all parties in the city to ensure Aberdeen City Centre is vibrant and attractive.“The SNP in government have already backed business in the city with more than £m of support during the pandemic.#Re-electing an SNP Government will ensure Aberdeen City receives a raft of measures to regenerate the area, including access to the £m City Centre Recovery Fund and the £m town centre fund, as well as £m set aside in this year#s budget specically to help support and create jobs in Aberdeen City and Aberdeenshire.#An SNP government stands ready to support Aberdeen, to revitalise the city centre, and to support investment where it is needed.##I’d like to thank everybody involved with the taskforce for working together to try and keep John Lewis in Aberdeen.#News of the planned closure was greeted with dismay across the North East, and I know this must be a really dficult time for the  members of staff.#I hope that a solution can be found that will allow John Lewis to maintain a presence in the city.#The Covid pandemic and its accompanying restrictions have accelerated problems that already existed for retail and our town centres.#Aberdeen has also been hit worse than most, with a collapse in oil prices and a business rates system that takes far more than it gives.#The truth is that the SNP government hasn’t given the region the attention it deserves.#That#s why I launched a campaign last week for a fair share for the north-east, including a £ billion regional enterprise agency, upgrades to key infrastructure, and rolling out broadband far faster than the SNP.#“Our high streets have been decimated through the pandemic and the loss of John Lewis is a terrible blow for Aberdeen city centre, its employees and customers.“Scottish Labour is a pro-business party and is committed to launching a Business Network to establish solid relations with employers across the country.“City centre businesses will be vital in rebuilding our economy. We will focus on jobs and retail to help kick start our post-pandemic recovery, and ensure our high streets thrive once more.”Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie said: #The closure of John Lewis leaves a major hole in the middle of Aberdeen. We are determined to build a strong and flourishing economy in the North East so that we can sustain international brands like John Lewis in the city.“In the recent Scottish budget the Scottish Liberal Democrats secured £m for transition training specically for the North East boost the economy and new industries.#Under Scottish Liberal Democrat proposals, we will reform business rates to take the burden off high street retailers and give those shops the ability to compete with online retailers.#We will also give local authorities more powers to get to reshape their city and town centres into vibrant and flourishing places that people want to visit, spend money and set up shop.#“The John Lewis closure is devastating news for the workers and it shows how we really need to rethink our high streets after the pandemic, to make them more resilient and focused on the communities that live in and rely on them.#If we want our town centres to thrive, we need attractive public urban spaces that people want to spend time in.#This means levelling the playing field for independent shops, cooperatives like John Lewis and for community spaces, and stop giving tax-dodging online retailers incentives and tax breaks.”For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium

were due to meet bosses at John Lewis today in a bid to convince the retail giant to remain in Aberdeen.Last week the chain announced plans to close the branch on George Street – the northernmost in the UK and the only Scottish store outside the central belt.The closure of the outlet would lead to the loss of  jobs, although any final decision on its future would be subject to a consultation with staff.Yesterday we revealed a taskforce – including council leaders and key figures in Aberdeen’s business scene – had been set up to lobby the chain to keep the store open.It was due to meet with bosses at John Lewis for the first time earlier today.Aberdeen City Council co-leader Douglas Lumsden, who along with fellow administration chiefs Jenny Laing and Marie Boulton sits on the taskforce, said he hoped recent “big announcements” regarding investment in the city would be taken into account.“There have been a lot of big announcements in Aberdeen recently,” Mr Lumsden said.“There is the energy transition zone and the energy transition fund from the government.“As a local authority we have also pledged £ million into city centre redevelopment as well so there is a lot going on and we want to make sure John Lewis are aware of all the good things going on in the local economy before making a final decision.“In the whole of the north region our earnings are still above average. We might have had a tough couple of years but we do see some good signs for the future and it would be goodJohn Lewis were part of that.“I understandsomeone from John Lewis was just looking at the numbers and is only seeing sales falling, but we would urge them to look at the bigger picture and the investment coming to the area. We hope they would take all that into consideration before making a final decision.”It is understood a key issue for the retailer is the size of the outlet, with bosses at John Lewis believing they do not need , square feet of space.However, the taskforce is keen to explore alternatives that could entice the retailer to reconsider its decision.One possibility being considered is that of opening a smaller John Lewis branch, along with a Waitrose store, either within the same building or in another location in the city centre.However, that option would require vehicle access and parking.Eventhe outlet does close down, John Lewis would still need to pay business rates and other costs such as security, since it is the owner of the building.The taskforce sees the branch as vital not just for Aberdeen, but for the whole of the north of Scotland, with the city as a whole viewed as a shopping hub for people in Aberdeenshire, Moray and the Highlands.One of the major fears among members of the group is a “domino” effect, where other businesses in the city close as a result of John Lewis’ withdrawal from Aberdeen.A petition calling for the retailer to rethink its proposal has gained more than , signatures since it was set up last week.Adrian Watson, chief executive of Aberdeen Inspired, said: “We had a detailed meeting between Aberdeen City Council leaders and other business organisation leads and we now carry this strong collective will to the table.#It was lost on no one what John Lewis partnership’s presence in Aberdeen means to the city and indeed the wider north of Scotland.“For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium

It shows new reported cases and deaths in the last day, as well as the total cases in each area since the pandemic began.After a second wave over winter, most areas of the country are starting to see figures fall again.The proportion of people who test positive every day was trending downward since December.The chart below shows local positivity rates. This is now a key metric that is considered when putting each area into tiers. The colour scales refer to the potential levels recommended by the World Health Organisation.Another key metric is the rate of cases per , people. The chart below shows the seven day rate in each local authority. Similar to the chart above, this chart is also colour coded by the potential levels as recommended by the WHO.In the early stages of the pandemic, cases were more concentrated in older generations. In the last few months this has shted towards cases being more prevalent in younger people – however, cases are declining in the more vulnerable age groups as the vaccine rollout progresses.As the number of daily new cases reduces, the cumulative totals for the health board areas become less important. The heatmap below shows the number of new cases by health board area.The chart below shows the daily number of deaths after a positive test as well as the cases where coronavirus was mentioned on the death certicate.The heatmap below shows the age demographics of the people who have lost their lives to the virus.The chart below shows a daily snapshot of the number of people in hospital and ICU with Covid-.

He#s been injured. He#s just come back into things.#I#m presuming it#s just cramp initially and I#m hopeful it#s nothing more serious.#He grew into the game. He loves going forward but maybe he needs to tighten up defensively at times # but all young players do as they learn the game.#He#s a confident lad and loves getting on the ball and putting crosses into the box.#I thought he did that really well, first half especially, plenty crosses into the box. For a full debut it was a decent one.#Callum Hendry climbed off the bench to fire just the second Dons# goal in  games as the mis-firing Premiership outfit dodged a major upset against Jim Duffy#s League One part-timers.The on-loan Saints frontman was also the man that scored their only other goal during that miserable run and Sheerin admitted he always had Hendry in mind for a super-sub role after opting to start with Flo Kamberi.#Callum was excellent,# said Sheerin after watching the -year-old pounce with seven minutes left to spare Aberdeen#s blushes.#The way we wanted to step up meant it was just a dferent type of striker that we opted for at the start.#But I always had it in my mind that I#d need to get him on at some stage because of the way he#s trained this week.#I#m really pleased to see him get his goal. He showed how sharp he is in and around the area with his quick feet then doing the keeper with his eyes as he stuck it in the corner.#The Dons passed up a string of chances before Hendry#s strike clinched victory.Sons keeper Sam Ramsbottom was in inspired form on his th birthday, but there was no icing on the cake for Dumbarton as they bowed out.Speaking to the club#s website, Ramsbottom said: #It#s not every day you get the chance to create a shock result on your birthday.#We couldn#t do that today, but it#s been an alright day.

If you have a sporting collection, no matter what size or sport, please do get in touch.#It is hoped the project will also support Scotland’s sporting collections to be better understood and help identy the role sport plays in wider issues around health and wellbeing.The research is being conducted by archive specialists Turnstone Consultancy.Research lead Kat Petersen added: #Sporting heritage might be tidily boxed up in an archive or accumulating in a cupboard in your office or clubhouse. However it is being stored or displayed,you have any records or objects relating to sports in Scotland we would love to hear from you.#If anyone is aware of any sporting collections which may be of interest, or at risk in some way, an online survey is available for completion.

Not before time.I was supportive of the mitigation plan, using nets and catch pits, as the simplest and least expensive approach. It was certainly worth a try, but it is abundantly clear now # with reputedly £ million spent # that it is not working.The , tonnes or more poised to come down on the road may well be an underestimate, and recent closures of the OMR, despite the new bund, doesn’t say very much for the efficacy of the protection. So we need an alternative, and we need it soon, not  years away.Talk of #alternative traffic corridors# is just a distraction.There may well be a case for a bridge-and-tunnel approach. Such has been successful in Norway and # notably # both in Iceland and Faroe Islands, which have much smaller resource bases than Norway. But these would be long-term schemes, each requiring the completion of several major interlinked crossings, for the like of which Scotland’s roads authority has hitherto shown neither interest nor aptitude.The problem at the Rest is a local one which requires a local solution. It’s only a mile or so of road which is at issue there.The alternatives, realistically, boil down to three:Overhead protection might well be required over quite a long distance, as it’s not just the bit at the catch pits which is threatened. The slopes of the Cobbler have experienced slides too. Since the hillside ies it might not be possible to use standard prefabricated modules, and in any case installation work would close the A for some time.A tunnel through to Butterbridge could be driven quite quickly # particularlythe Norwegians did it # but the approach in upper Glen Croe would require protection just like the OMR. Sir William Lithgow’s proposal mentions this, but construction would also almost certainly close the OMR, leaving no ersion for that period.The construction of a new alignment up the south west side of the glen, however, either on or roughly parallel to the existing forestry road, would avoid interference with through traffic.Both the gradient and the transverse slope would be substantially similar to those of the existing A, though thewould be marginally greater, which is probably why the north east side was chosen when the #new# A was built.The core of the case for the third option, however, is that the south west side of the glen has experienced far less erosion, both historically and in recent years, than the north east one.Stand at the upper viewpoint, or better still a little way along the Lochgoilhead road, and look around. The slopes of Ben Luibhean on which the A runs show far more watercourses and gullies than any of the others in the vicinity.This indicates a lot more rainfall impacting that slope, probably by the prevailing weather being funnelled on to it through the pass at the top of Glen More. And that weather is becoming worse.There have been no major slips over the forestry road in recent years, despite a spate of them on the opposite slope. It may just be the trees. I don’t think so, but in any case the trees are there, while it would take some years for tree cover to established above the A.Going back a lot further in time, the pattern is the same. The burn in the floor of upper Glen Croe has been pushed, over the centuries, by slip debris coming down from the north east slope, and the depth of that debris can easily be seen in the gullies recently carved in it behind the new bund.There is also a fair number of impressively-sized boulders on the lower slopes on that side, which at some point rolled down the hillside. Some of these came from the Cobbler, and although most are below the road a few are not. There is nothing to say that more will not arrive.A further point is that while the lower slopes on each side of the upper glen are similar, those on the south west side ease off towards the top, while those on the NE slope do not.It is on these upper slopes that the small slips develop which can pick up more and more water and debris on their way down, hence the fan shape of the typical slip. There is, in other words, a lot less potential for the initiation of slips on the south west side.I think that this all points to the need for a serious look at the forestry road, and I fail to understand why the investigations a few years ago dismissed it as a viable alternative.It’s the existing A which isn’t viable. And why any of these solutions would take  years to complete also beats me. Local objections  There is only one house in upper Glen Croe, and in the rest of Argyll I have yet to meet anyone who doesn’t want a permanent solution.My suspicion is that the biggest dficulty is that Transport Scotland can’t yet find a way to explain how £ million could be spent to such little effect. I might, of course, be wrong in all this, but I wait to be convinced of it.Arthur Blue, ArdrishaigSir,Since the temporary repairs to the Rest are clearly getting nowhere and costing money into the bargain, I would like to suggest a radical solution to the problem, and that is to build a viaduct right down the centre of the valley, based on the design of the MillauFor those not familiar with this structure, it is well worth an internet search. I believe this is still the world#s tallest bridge and is a really beautul structure.Seen from a distance, the white deck and piers look quite unreal # moreBefore anyone asks where that sum of money is to be found, I would point out that Boris Johnson#s proposed tunnel to Northern Ireland may cost between £ billion and £ billion # nobody knows because it hasn#t been designed yet. Nevertheless, Alister Jack is extremely enthusiastic about the proposal, so clearly money is not a problem.Not only would this new viaduct solve the problem once and for all, I suspect that, like the Millau Viaduct, it would become a much-photographed tourist attraction.John McCall, LochgilpheadSir,In last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser, Councillor Alastair Redman criticises the SNP for setting aside £, of its own money to campaign for an independent Scotland.Not surprisingly, he fails to enlighten us as to the costs of  the Tory party#s #Union Unit# set up by the Prime Minister at the taxpayers# expense.David Hay, MinardSir,Due to the speed with which the NHS is carrying out its vaccination programme, there is hope that we can soon all get out again andto normal.We still, however, face huge challenges. The economy has suffered. The NHS faces a big backlog of cancelled operations. Our young people have a lot of schooling to catch up on. We don’t have much time left to stop our climate changing before it is too late.Here in Argyll the Scottish Government must rise to the challenge of building a permanent solution at the Rest and Be Thankful.These must be our priorities. We can’t afford to spend the next few years arguing over independence. That’s an unnecessary distraction.We need a needle-sharp focus on the recovery without the distraction of another isive referendum.Put recovery first.Councillor Alan Reid, Cowal wardMr Reid is the Argyll and Bute LibDem candidate for May#s Scottish parliamentary election"},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor march 12 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

The vaccination process carried out with great economy and efficiency # and entirely painlessly so that we really will have to stop calling it #the jag#.The real bonus was the warmth and good humour from everyone involved that made the whole process welcoming, so that you left with a smile on your face. Only after the event do you realise what a tremendous team effort it was from everyone involved and all of them deserve our thanks.I hope very much that the Mid Argyll area makes a near  per cent response to the vaccination invitation, because that is what this effort deserves and will demonstrate to those involved the very real, genuine appreciation we have for their work during the pandemic.Norman Rea, Kintallen, TayvallichSir,The rank hypocrisy of the Scottish Tories knows no bounds.While they are frothing at the mouth that the first minister should resign over allegedly misleading the Scottish Parliament, at the same time Prime Minister Johnson was proven to have deliberately misled the Westminster parliament.Standing up in the House of Commons, Mr Johnson stated that all Covid-related contracts were #on the record#.This was three days after the High Court ruled the government had acted unlawfully by failing to publish hundreds of such contracts, which somehow seemed to find their way to those with Tory party connections.Two weeks prior to this, the Health Minister Matt Hancock was found guilty of illegal activity by the High Court, refusing to resign or even apologise when the extent of illegal awarding of PPE contracts was revealed.Last year Tory Home Secretary Priti Patel was found guilty of breaching the ministerial code by being a bully and shouting and swearing at civil servant employees in the Home Office, recently reaching a £, settlement with the former Home Office Permanent Secretary.Compare and contrast that with north of the border, where the Tory party has demanded the resignation of the first minister even before the outcome of the enquiries into the handling of the Alex Salmond case by the Scottish Government has been published.Not a cheep from them demanding an apology, let alone a resignation, for the flagrant abuses by their Westminster colleagues. What hypocrites.Alex Orr, EdinburghSir,This Mother’s Day, school feeding charity Mary’s Meals would like to pay tribute to incredible women around the world.From the mums in the UK whose food has nourished us throughout our childhoods, including those who volunteer and fundraise for Mary’s Meals, to the women who cook and serve our daily meals for children in some of the world’s poorest countries, we celebrate them all.Mary’s Meals feeds more than . million hungry children in  countries every school day.That’s why I am asking your readers to send a Mary’s Meals gt card to the special women in their lives this Mother’s Day.

Thanks to the amazing commitment of some truly dedicated people working in the NHS and in social care, lives have been saved and people have been cared for. Stroke teams up and down the country have in many areas managed to continue to offer specialist care and treatment to patients throughout the pandemic. We cannot thank them enough.But the fallout from Covid- is going to pose challenges for everyone in health and social care. Our Recoveries at Risk report last autumn highlighted the real le impact of the pandemic on people recovering from a stroke.Emerging evidence of links between Covid- and stroke means that now, more than ever, a renewed national focus on stroke is needed in Scotland.Health officials have been working during the pandemic to review evidence and define what #a progressive stroke service for Scotland# should look like.This will include improved stroke care bundle figures, improved stroke prevention measures, a national thrombectomy service and stroke-specic, person-centred rehabilitation.The charity is pleased that people affected by stroke will be included in the development of this work.A draft paper will be with the Scottish Government in the next few weeks. Whatever the outcome of May’s election, the Stroke Association in Scotland expects the next government to push this work on, and for a new, improved, progressive stroke service to be implemented.Colin Oliver, public affairs officer, the Stroke Association in Scotland"},{"url":null,"title":"argylls abigail releases debut single","story":"Fiona ScottUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Keith also co-wrote and produced the single at his studio on the Isle of Lewis.Abigail said: #The single is about encouraging women to follow their passions and carve out a le that they can enjoy and be proud of.#The music video that we created doesn’t have me in it, I wanted it to showcase powerful women who are following their dreams in whatever field their passions and talents lie.#The ambition behind the single is for it to be inspiring and help others to find the courage and drive to fight for their goals, no matter what those are.#I have always recorded with my band Heron Valley, who are a traditional folk band, so recording something for myself has been really dferent. Firstly, due to the obvious genre dferences but also because I’ve always had the support of five other people to make key choices, so it’s been a big change making decisions by myself on how I want the music to sound.#I have really enjoyed the process and the musical independence recording the single has given me.#Originally from rural Argyll, Abigail grew up with music very much at the heart of her family learning fiddle from a young age, also being taught guitar and vocal stylings at home with her father. She joined Heron Valley in its infancy while also studying at Royal Conservatoire of Scotland Junior School.As well as touring extensively with Heron Valley, Abigail went on to graduate from The Royal Conservatoire of Scotland where she studied Scots Song and classical violin. Her unique music style and honest song writing make Abigail an exciting prospect for the Scottish music scene and Lady a much-anticipated release.Lady will be available to download and stream from Friday March ."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column march 12 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

It is not a competition and none of artwork will be judged.Gigha-based youth work facilitator Kenny Wilson, one of the project#s organisers, explained: #As youth workers, we kept hearing the same phrases from young people, phrases like #My bedroom has become my classroom# and #I feel like the walls are closing in on me#. Young people were asking questions like #Where can we go # Nowhere. #Who we can meet # No-one. #What are we allowed to do # During lockdown, very little at all.#The idea is to give artistic young people something to do that#s not prescribed by the Curriculum for Excellence [Scotland#s education framework] or by the government to give them the freedom to choose what they want to do, to design whatever they want to design.#The reward will be seeing their artwork published online and in the newspapers. The purpose of the whole thing is to increase the wellbeing of young people, to give them a boost # it#s as simple as that.#He added: #It could well be that something catches the eye of someone in the wider artistic community and they could be put in touch with the young creator of the piece in question # but that would have to be arranged through the youth workers, subject to careful child protection measures, and with parents# consent.#Kenny explained that safeguarding is an essential part of all that youth workers do and, as such, the organisers have created a GDPR statement which reads: #We will ensure that all personal data that we collect will only be held until all the images have been showcased, and will be processed lawfully, fairly and in a transparent manner and only collected for the legitimate purposes of the showcase, and will never be passed on to any other organisation or third party without your explicit permission.#Those who would like to register an interest in taking part, can email ayelovetomake@gmail providing their first name and location. They are not required to submit their surname, full address or age, as long as they are within the  to  age range.When the project officially launches on Friday March , they can then send photographs of their artwork to the same email address so it can be uploaded to the project#s Instagram account, where it will be made visible to the public after the Sunday April  closing date.Kenny added: #If you are a young person with a desire to create, then go for it!#"},{"url":null,"title":"heathers treks renaissance ruins and ancient rock art","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

She has travelled and trekked throughout the world, walked across Scotland numerous times, climbed many of its peaks and now lives in Argyll amongst the scenery she loves.Lovely Kilmartin Glen is host to many wonderful historic sites and ancient monuments.Overlooking its northern reaches the renaissance remains of Master John Carswell’s Carnasserie Castle stand proud, its ruins eerily dramatic despite now being more home to crow than human.There are many ways in which to explore the area. This circular takes you through time from Carnasserie Castle in the east to the prehistoric rock art at Ormaig in the west, before wending southwards on the path used in bygone days to reach Old Poltalloch. Then, turning east, you come to Lady’s Seat, which offers lovely views down the glen, a brief respite before turning northwards toto the castle’s realm. Glimpses over to Loch Craignish and down Kilmartin Glen give one time to ponder the geology of the area swept by the glaciers of the last ice age.At the car park you will see a small path exiting the NE corner by the information boards. Turn left and head up the track towards the castle. You initially come to a turning left, you will take this shortly. Meanwhile the castle lies just ahead, through a gate and up a steep path to your left. Currently you can but admire its grandeur from the outside, either from here or the next section of the walk .Return to the track and take the turn on your right SW up through the trees and to a gate. Ahead you will cross the field for m, with the castle to your right, before re-joining the farm track. Follow it to a T-junction .Turn right and continue up the field and through a gate. A young forestry plantation lies to your left, pretty and convoluted little hills and glens to your right. Effectively the valley floor is the line of a dyke with the lumps, bumps and ides a mixture of limestone, igneous rock intrusions, sandstones, gritstones, conglomerates and folding doing much to create the complex NE SW flow seen in the shape of the hills and lochs all carved out by glaciers.Follow the track over the col past a gnarly old plantation on a knoll. The route descends for km towards Loch Craignish before veering sharply right to cross the Eas Mor burn at its western end. Note the main track you come on to. For those wishing to miss the path to Old Poltalloch you will need toto this point and keep following it south east to join up with the rest of the route.Cross the bridge over the Eas Mor. Ignore the small path to your right with a barrier and continue for m look out for the new track signposted up to the prehistoric rock art of Ormaig. After ascending m you will see the little paths to your right leading to the stones, a good place to pause and wonder at those who carved them.Return to the track below and south over the Eas Mor. At the sharp left-hand bend turn immediately right towards the sea. After just m, opposite a ruined croft, an easily missed path slips down to a wall. As soon as you are on it, it is obvious and now wends its way southwards towards Old Poltalloch through the ‘Big Wood’.The path is boggy in places with the odd fallen tree. After .km it reaches a forestry road turn left and follow this for m to a sharp left-hand bend. The path goes straight ahead at the bottom of the bend just below a turning point, again it is not obvious until you are on it. Continue to follow this all the way until you reach the road at Old Poltalloch, passing farmstead ruins and the old walled garden on your right. The house itself has now been renovated.Turn left. The track, which also leads to a jetty below, climbs upwards for nearly km before reaching the col leading to Kilmartin Glen. Ignore the two tracks you pass on your left .Descend for m and take the grassy forestry track to your right. After m a path leads upwards on your right to Lady’s Seat, a worthy detour for a grand view over the glen.Return to the track and turn right to descend to the main track below . Cross straight over, through a gate to the right of some sheep pens. Passing a track from your right after mzigzag down through the woods to a gate. The track does a sharp -degree turn right and, a little after, turn left to follow the tracks back to Carnasserie and your earlier outward route.Please note: Historic and Environment Scotland properties and sites remain closed due to Covid the castle can only be viewed from the outside at this time.

Had we and her doctors been aware of the symptoms, Marjie might be alive today. If diagnosed at the earliest stage, nine in  women will survive. But two thirds of women are diagnosed late, when the cancer is harder to treat.This March, for Oian Cancer Awareness Month, I’m writing to ask your readers to take just two minutes of their time to learn the symptoms and spread the word to their families and friends.The main symptoms of oian cancer are: persistent bloating, feeling full or having dficulty eating, tummy pain, and needing to wee more often or more urgently.If you believe in a future where every woman diagnosed with oian cancer has the best chance of survival, please show your support and visit www.targetoiancancer.org.uk MarchSarah Greene, Target Oian Cancer PatronSir,We welcome the latest announcement from the Scottish Government that communal worship can potentially resume from March  with the possibility of up to  people in attendance, assuming physical distancing of two metres can be in place.Christians are Easter people we live with hope in all circumstances, and the church will be providing guidance to congregations to help them ensure that buildings are re-opened in a safe and responsible manner.While some congregations will adopt a cautious approach regarding the reopening of our buildings # and others won#t have the practical means to do so # everyone will be very glad at this news and will already be looking forward to how most appropriately to celebrate Easter .In whatever we do, we#ll be remembering that the God who raised Jesus from the grave has been faithful to us throughout the whole of this last year.Rt Rev Dr Martin Fair, Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of ScotlandSir,The first Citizens’ Assembly of Scotland has submitted its final report to the Scottish Parliament, with its  powerful democratic recommendations aimed at improving the wellbeing of Scotland#s people and governance.I personally would have loved to be a participant in this new democratic exercise, meeting and sharing with, speaking and listening to, a wide range of our people, many very unlike me and with very dferent perspectives, opinions and lived experience.To be informed by a range of expert, evidence-based perspectives, to explore and discuss implications and reservations, and to move towards a rough consensus on a range of key questions that will affect ourselves, our children and grandchildren, and that will shape the future of our country – that’s the exemplar of the active, responsible citizen of st century Scotland.There#s a climate assembly also currently working towards its conclusions, and I await its recommendations with interest and anticipation.Recommendation six of the first assembly is: #That in order to ensure that citizens can make informed decisions in relation to rebuilding their communities the Scottish government and parliament should: establish community-based citizens# assemblies to assess what is happening in our communities , identy gaps and recommend actions, including through digital technology, that can bring people together and make our communities more inclusive.#We have a Scottish election coming up in May, and I hope to see a good turnout as a good majority of Scotland’s electorate, from age  upwards, make sure to vote in this most critical exercise of our moment of power and responsibility.Subsequently, I hope to very soon look forward to a renewed interest in local democracy, as an Argyll and Bute Citizens# Assembly debates and decide the shape of Argyll and Bute#s future for the coming decisive decade.Perhaps that future will include enhanced interest and participation in some version of our current powerless and voiceless community councils.Mary MacCallum Sullivan, Ardrishaig"},{"url":null,"title":"longing for a rest","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

This is mainly due to massive insecticide use and habitat loss caused by intensication of agriculture.Up to  per cent of flowering plants and  per cent of commercial crops require insects for pollination, with honeybees and hoverflies most often doing the job.But with declining numbers of these species, farmers may employ hives of bees to prevent crop yields falling.Wild honeybees forage within three miles of their nest, and onthey perform the #waggle dance# that advertises the location of productive foraging sites to other bees. Also, odours from scented flowers picked up inside the nest while unloading pollen act as cues to guide nest-mates to specic flowers.Now scientists have articially imprinted bees with flower odours in an attempt to improve crop yields*.In trying to establish long-term memory for flower odours, the scientists offered bees in three separate groups of hives alternative odours:  sucrose solution scented with synthetic sunflower odours,  sucrose solution scented with jasmine odours,  sucrose solution alone. They then relocated the hives to a sunflower plantation and compared the foraging activities of bees exposed to the three solutions.First, scientists decoded waggle dances to identy sunflower-specic dances. Using this information, they observed bees from hives fed with sunflower odours performing sunflower dances one hour after hive relocation.Contrastingly, the control bees fed jasmine odours took - hours and control sucrose-fed bees took  hours to perform sunflower dances.This resulted in the sunflower odour-imprinted bees performing signicantly more sunflower-specic waggle dances during the first day of relocation, peaking at  per cent increase over control hives preferentially visiting sunflowers and bringing in more sunflower pollen loads than the control bees.The scientists then measured the all-important crop yields in five plots containing dferent sunflower hybrid plants pollinated by sunflower odour-imprinted compared to control bees.Seed yields in all five plots were highest when pollinated by sunflower odour-fed bees, with increased production up to  per cent above control bees.They conclude that providing bees pre-programmed to forage on specic crops could circumvent wild pollinator shortages and signicantly increase crop yields.*Current Biology , -.

Especially when option one, the Glen Croe route, was the chosen option from the A Trunk Road Study # summary report published by Jacobs in .Surely, after nine years of consulting, the Scottish Government and Transport Scotland can choose the best solution rather than going through a y and expensive consultation process.Based on this, our members would like the permanent solution fast tracked, which is well within the Scottish Government’s power and we would ask for this to be seriously considered.Our other comments and feedback to last week’s announcement are as follows:The timber road route should be upgraded as a short-term solution this summer and not in the suggested  months.Argyll businesses have faced the issues of landslides for many years. However, the situation has worsened over the past year and in our opinion it has now become a national emergency and requires immediate action.The , tons of unstable material could swamp any further mitigation measures put in place on the A and Old Military Roadand make the roads impassable. This could easily happen when we next have an extended period of rainfall.Savings in further mitigation work could go towards upgrading the forestry road.The long-term solution should be selected from the  The A Trunk Road Study and based on the delivery of the most sustainable outcome.Any well-developed permanent solution needs to be open  without fear of being buried under tons of rock and mud, and will have less environmental impact than the landslides, catchpits, netting and OMR bund we are currently experiencing.Our understanding of costs and timescales from similar schemes in Norway show a tunnel could be built in three years at a cost of £-m, and not the £-m stated by Transport Scotland.Members of The RABT Campaign group represent a cross section of business sectors and we would welcome the chance to meet with your officials to discuss how we might help cut through the y timescales and fast-track decision making.John Gurr  Sir,I heard that there was work going on in Lochgilphead town centre, and that some people were complaining, about mess and upheaval.

As we look ahead to this year’s event on Saturday March  at .pm, many of us are reflecting on the future, as we emerge from the latest, and hopefully last #stay at home# period.With that in mind, we are asking people to use Earth Hour by helping us to create the #Great Scottish Canvas#. Switch off your lights and by candlelight or torchlight, use the hour to paint a picture, craft a poem, doodle or write something which illustrates the future Scotland you want to live in.With so many eyes on Scotland this year, due to Scottish Parliament elections in May and the vital COP climate talks in November, we want to show the world the vision of the Scottish people, for a greener and fairer society for us all.

Being a member of the NQ group is a step forward in ensuring youth participation is standard rather than tokenistic.##Of course representing the young people of Argyll and Bute has been a huge honour and a privilege,# added Cameron.#It’s been amazing to meet and work with so many incredible young people across the constituency, who will continue to do our area proud.#The SYP is entirely youth-led, representing Scotland’s young people. Elections are held every two years and people aged from  to  from across Scotland stand as candidates in all  local authority areas and from national voluntary organisations.The next SYP elections are due to take place at the end of this year, but Cameron will not be standing again in Argyll and Bute, though does intend to do so in another constituency.He said: #I would encourage any young person in Argyll and Bute considering standing for SYP to do so.#Young people can register an interest now by contacting the Argyll and Bute Council#s community learning team or by checking SYP#s social media accounts for more information # @OfficialSYP.Reflecting on the past week Cameron said: #I feel incredibly overwhelmed but really proud to have won MSYP of the Year. I absolutely was not expecting it.#Looking to le beyond the youth parliament, he continued: #My plans for the future are a bit uncertain. I’m currently taking on le’s twists and turns when they present themselves to me! I have a passion for politics so who knows where it might take me.#SYP has given me so many incredible opportunities that I am really grateful for as well as boosting my skills in campaigning, consulting and lobbying as well as hugely boosting my confidence.#"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column april 2 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

While saving in some areas of expenditure, it has incurred extra costs in tackling the pandemic and faces an uncertain funding future while the national economy tries to recover. The drive to save money in services where bringing in a little more through, for example, parking fees and fines, is understandable up to a point.But when the economy is on le support after a pandemic, surely the relatively paltry sums to be made are not worth the potential damage to Inveraray#s recovery, as seems to be the view of locals Perhaps councillors could look at this a little dferently. If they are determined to push this through for control traffic purposes, why not donate the proceeds, which would be a by-product of well-behaved traffic, to the town  The pier fund could certainly use it. Both the community council and Inspire Inveraray would no doubt welcome the cash and find many uses for public benefit.Just a thought.Congratulations to Cameron on his award. This is a huge achievement among a group of young people who each work hard for others.It is also  a great achievement for MacLeod Construction to be shortlisted for a national award.

However, on further reading, this was yet another unsurprising disappointment. The preferred corridor through Glen Croe is still to be announced and there is still no timetable for completion.Landslips at the Rest and be Thankful have frequently seen much of Argyll isolated from central Scotland, or journeys delayed by endless roadworks or convoys along the old military road. Most of these problems have occurred during the SNP’s  years in government and the continued failure to provide a permanent solution is yet more proof of how little the SNP cares about or understand the needs of people and businesses outside the central belt.It was clear long ago that patchwork schemes were not a solution but, rather than provide a new corridor which would have resulted in major capital expenditure, tens of millions of pounds have instead been wasted on years of ineffective schemes which nature evades in next to no time.In the meantime, the SNP has had no dficulty finding money to prop up central belt vanity projects like the Edinburgh trams.Mike Russell, SNP MSP for Argyll and Bute, has been far more concerned with Indyref and Brexit than the day to day concerns of his constituents and has done nothing to ensure that providing a reliable road connection to Argyll is a top priority for Michael Matheson, the Cabinet Secretary for Transport.The Holyrood elections on May  are an ideal opportunity for the residents and business owners in Argyll, whose daily lives are affected by such an unreliable road, to voice their dissatisfaction and vote for anyone other than the SNP or the Greens who oppose any road building on principle.A dferent government might not guarantee a speedy resolution, but after  years of failed sticking-plaster attempts to patch up the existing road, it certainly couldn’t be worse.Donald McCallum, Strathaven.Sir,Across the Kintyre and the Islands ward I continue to receive complaints about the rather shoddy condition of road signage.In some cases the signs are faded and covered in dirt and in many other cases they are falling to pieces.One example of this is the road signs above the footpath outside Port Ellen Primary School on Islay and sadly there are many other examples. In my opinion in the future Argyll and Bute Council must be more diligent in maintaining our signs.Road signs help to regulate traffic, provide crucial visual guidance and give drivers important previews, especially during night-time conditions.Councillor Alastair RedmanSir,I write further to correspondence on Lochgilphead#s expensive new pavements.When they are finally finished, could somebody seethey have a bucket or two of tarry stones left over that could be chucked into the tank trap that passes for a roundabout, next to the Tesco garage David Hay, MinardSir,I have immense pleasure in communicating to your readers our new address following our successful relocation of our main office premises.Our email, website and telephone numbers remain the same as before.Email: info@abcab.org.uk and phone  .We have had no break in service and continue to provide advice and support to clients across Argyll and Bute, with our advisers all working from home under current government guidance.We are also available to provide advice to those who find themselves in a vulnerable position and require face-to-face advice by appointment in our Helensburgh and Lochgilphead offices.We commence our second volunteer adviser training programme next month and look forward to welcoming our new trainees.Jen Broadhurst, Bureau Manager, Argyll and Bute Citizens Advice BureauSir,Following the Scottish Government#s pay offer of four per cent across the board for all NHS workers, Unite will ballot its members on the offer over the next few weeks.Unite represents workers in every pay band across the entire NHS structure and recognises that while this offer will put money into the pockets of our members, any monthly pay uplt will y considerably between iniduals. For this reason Unite will be putting this offer to our members without recommendation.The offer includes an opportunity to revisit any settlement including an intention by the Scottish Government to allocate additional funding through Barnett Consequentials. Unite will demand that any additional payment made to the Scottish Government by Westminster through this formula, is passed on to our members.Workers across the NHS have been described as #heroic# in what has been an exceptionally challenging year.

While he was gutting and cleaning a large cod at sea, something fell onto the deck.When the deck was cleared and washed down, Mr Colville examined his find# the honeycomb from a bee#s hive!How on earth it ever managed to find its way to the murky depths and into a cod#s stomach we will never discover.It is just #one of those things#.Councillors call for removal of #eyesore#Campbeltown councillors are up in arms about a #rusting eyesore# which is lying on the shores of Campbeltown Loch.The ex-Admiralty tug Empire Ace ran aground at Southend nearly two years ago and was towed to the loch, where it was beached. It has lain at the Rocky Burn area ever since.The vessel caused a row between the Town Council and the firm who owned it, George Hood and Company of Helensburgh.At a meeting last September, it was suggested that the firm be charged dues.Councillor Harry Moffat was quoted as saying: #If people are allowed to dump boats in the loch, I can go and dump a car and nobody can do anything about it.#The council discussed the question of taking legal action against the firm. A considerable number of people have since remarked on the unsightliness of the vessel, which has started to rust.Fishermen ing from the grounds were using the Empire Ace as a mooring stage while they cleaned and washed their catches.But a spokesman for the Helensburgh firm said that it had sold the vessel some months ago. The spokesman refused to reveal the identity of the buyers, but after inquiries, we ascertained that it was purchased by McFadyen’s, the local contracting firm.A spokesman for Archibald McFadyen and Sons said that the Empire Ace was purchased by the firm about two weeks ago.He added that breaking up work was to start on the vessel #within the next few days#.Tobacco firm expands furtherThe well-known Campbeltown firm of Richard Daniels Ltd, tobacco wholesalers and distributors, has opened a depot in Peebles, to meet an increased demand from customers on the east coast.The firm, whose custom stretches from Aberdeen to Middlesborough in England, has just been awarded a #very large# contract from a brewing firm to supply its retail outlet # public houses.Askedthe Peebles opening would create redundancies locally, Mr James Daniels told the Courier that staff in Campbeltown would be unaffected.#It is merely a new phase being added to the business,# he said.ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOCastlehill Church Sunday SchoolThe children of the Kinloch Church Sunday School had a highly enjoyable social evening on Friday last.

I care about mankind in general and the plight of its citizens, particularly where there is a prevalence of political ineptitude affecting their lives.To reiterate, the EU purchasing system regarding vaccines was and still is chaotic, with the bureaucratic executive in Brussels initially lashing out, and currently certain members within the group are endeavouring to purchase supplies of vaccines for their citizens.In addition, we now have a ban by some countries of vaccine exports from EU manufacturers to non-EU countries. An action which has angered the World Health Organization and upset Australia and other countries.Regarding the comment that the vaccine success is an illusion, perhaps the perusal of some scientic pronouncements in relation to the efficacy would be appropriate.To accuse me of crowing is not only resented but additionally hurtful. I have an extended family in France.My daughter is married to a now retired French army captain and she is an environmental scientist and director of a laboratory in the IRD , a French public research institution. While her mother-in-law has had her first vaccination and in the last week so has her husband, she does not know when she will get an appointment.Currently, in certain areas of France, the virus is very active and part of her remit involves travel to some of these hot-spots when working from home is not practicable. A situation which is very concerning to me.I also do not know when I will be permitted to see them, either in France or in Scotland.Crowing, indeed, I think not.Amidst the miscellany of economic disaster claims awaiting an independent Scotland thrown up by Michael McGeachy in last week#s Courier, I am gratied that Mr McGeachy does, at the very least, accept that Scotland has no debt at the point of independence. This is progress.Unfortunately, Mr McGeachy then goes on to hold up Scotland#s putative deficit as an ace card in the unionist case to #prove# that Scotland is an economic basket-case surviving on English largesse. In reality, it demonstrates the opposite.Scotland#s #deficit#, created within the UK, with our overall budget set by another government # that#s  per cent of Scotland#s revenues and  per cent of our spending # is a damning indictment of Westminster#s reckless economic vandalism. It is the cost of Westminster Tory rule and the union#s failure.Indeed,being part of the UK was such an advantage, Scotland would have a stronger economy than our northern independent competitors.That they are all considerably more successful, with fewer economic resources than Scotland, makes the case for Scotland to have control of all the sovereign economic levers required to succeed in the global economy.Mr McGeachy concludes with the familiar splenetic, #you had your referendum# in . In this time we have had three Prime Ministers, two Westminster elections and one Holyrood election, not forgetting England#s Brexit imposed upon Scotland.Democracy is not pick and mix, Mr McGeachy. The #Better Together# parties can huff and puff about #taking back control# to London, but Scotland is not their possession.We still live in a free country andScots vote this May for an SNP government focused on Scottish priorities, including the right to ensure that Scotland#s future is Scotland#s choice, not Boris Johnson#s, democracy, as we saw with the election of President Biden, will prevail.The fact that the SNP has produced a new digital strategy document will come as little consolation to residents of the Highlands and Islands, who would struggle to download it eventhey wanted to.The SNP has left the Highlands and Islands in the digital dark ages.The  SNP manesto committed to deliver superfast broadbandto every home and business by . This has comprehensively failed, with ministers refusing to discuss completion dates. A December  report logged an average download speed of .Mbps in Glen Shiel. That is  times slower than Scotland’s fastest street.The pandemic has exposed the glaring digital ide that exists between rural and urban parts of Scotland.Scottish Liberal Democrats want our remote and rural communities to be great places to live, work and study.That#s why we are setting out new proposals to put power in the hands of local community managers and prioritise investment in catch-up zones to ensure that everyone has access to the digital services they need to prosper.Cancer continues to claim lives regardless of the pandemic.As resources within the NHS are stretched to their limits, charities like Target Oian Cancer need your help more than ever before. Please help us raise awareness and raise funds. Whilst we are all fighting coronavirus, Target Oian Cancer is putting the needs of women with oian cancer before all .In , my mother, the actress Marjie Lawrence, was diagnosed with oian cancer just three weeks before she died.Had we and her doctors been aware of the symptoms, Marjie might be alive today. If diagnosed at the earliest stage, nine in  women will survive. But two thirds of women are diagnosed late, when the cancer is harder to treat.This March, for Oian Cancer Awareness Month, I#m writing to ask your readers to take just two minutes of their time to learn the symptoms and spread the word to their families and friends.The main symptoms of oian cancer are: persistent bloating, feeling full or having dficulty eating, tummy pain, and needing to wee more often or more urgently.If you believe in a future where every woman diagnosed with oian cancer has the best chance of survival, please show your support and visit www.targetoiancancer.org.uk March"},{"url":null,"title":"thought for the week march 19 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

A boss criticises a worker for an unavoidable error. A law officer takes a bribe. A cashier short changes a customer…I could go on.Danish philosopher Soren Kierkegaard remained a Christian all his le, but was very critical of the church in his day for its double standards.As we approach Easter, I think of how the crowds who welcomed Jesus into Jerusalem, pulling branches off the trees to wave, shouting #Hosanna# so enthusiastically, were largely the same crowds calling for his blood only days later when they called #Crucy#. How could they turn so quickly  Where was their integrity Some just followed the crowd others feared Jesus was challenging the accepted order, so better get rid of him for the greater good.If we face betrayal, injustice, double standards, how do we react  Revenge, get our own back  That is a very natural reaction, but the consequence is to prolong the bitterness, perhaps ramp up the situation.Jesus asks us to step back, to #turn the other cheek# , to suck up the injustice, the double standards, and let peace rule.Impossible  Well, that is what He did at the cross, and because of Him, I think it is possible.I don#t always get it right in my le, but #don#t do as I do , do as He tells you#.

Three-quarters of the herring landed in Britain are caught between the Clyde and the Minches,# he revealed.If the limit was abolished, Mr Stewart went on, foreigners would not send carrier boats, but ships to catch fish.He concluded by wondering what would happen to communities like Campbeltown, Carradale and Tarbert and places all around.Mr William McAffer, of Tarbert, said his main fear was unemployment.#If we lose the limit, we will lose our identity,# he said.And Councillor Henry Moffat warned: #We#re going to finish up with plenty of empty boats and more men on the dole. People#s livelihood is at stake now.#ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOThe Poor RollA considerable number of applications for poor relief were disposed of, and the roll of outdoor poor was revised, several alterations in the payments made to iniduals being sanctioned.Bailie Campbell, in connection with the usage where by children in receipt of Parish Council assistance are struck off the roll on attaining the age of  years, suggested that the rule should not be rigidly enforced, but that allowances should be continued as long as children remained in school.Such a concession might be a help to bright pupils, and in the case of others it would keep them off the streets and out of harm till such time as they secured employment.Mr M#Arthur thought it was a waste of time keeping children in school after .Pupils of exceptional educational promise might be helped on the recommendations of responsible authorities, but as for the others the best service that could be done them would be to assist in securing employment for them, and particularly with regard to girls, getting them into domestic service.Temperance reportRev Mr MacLeod, as convenor of the Temperance Committee, submitted his annual report on temperance.He said it had been hoped that the report this year would be of exceptional interest, but the No-Licence Poll taken last November showed that they had still a long way to go before they reached the goal of their desires.There was little cause for elation in the present situation, but still there was no reason to be discouraged.The failure of the efforts on behalf of No-Licence last November was due to the apathy of Christian men and women and to their indference to the terrible effects of the drink traffic.They congratulated their Arran brethren on the magnicent fight they had put up and the splendid result achieved.Shiskine had been the prime factor in the struggle, and there great things had been done but in the north end good work had also been achieved, against odds.Mr MacLeod emphasised the need for no slackening of effort in bringing home to the minds and consciences of the people their duty in relation to the drink traffic, and advised especially the education of the young with regard to this matter.There was plenty of room for increased effort in these directions in all congregations of the Presbytery.Mr MacLeod was thanked for his report."},{"url":null,"title":"happy lockdown birthday march 26 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +viaYOURTWITTERNAMEHERE\" title\"Tweet this\"TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Especially when option one, the Glen Croe route, was the chosen option from the A Trunk Road Study # summary report published by Jacobs, issued in .Surely, after nine years of consulting, the Scottish Government and Transport Scotland can choose the best solution rather than going through a y and expensive consultation process.Based on this, our members would like the permanent solution fast tracked, which is well within the Scottish Government’s power and we would ask for this to be seriously considered.Our other comments and feedback to last week’s announcement are as follows:The timber road route should be upgraded as a short-term solution this summer and not in the suggested  months.Argyll businesses have faced the issues of landslides for many years. However, the situation has worsened over the past year and in our opinion it has now become a national emergency and requires immediate action.The , tonnes of unstable material could swamp any further mitigation measures put in place on the A and Old Military Roadand make the roads impassable. This could easily happen when we next have an extended period of rainfall.Savings in further mitigation work could go towards upgrading the forestry road.The long-term solution should be selected from the  The A Trunk Road Study and based on the delivery of the most sustainable outcome.Any well-developed permanent solution needs to be open  without fear of being buried under tons of rock and mud, and will have less environmental impact than the landslides, catchpits, netting and OMR bund we are currently experiencing.Our understanding of costs and timescales from similar schemes in Norway show a tunnel could be built in three years at a cost of £-m, and not the £-m confirmed by Transport Scotland.Members of The RABT Campaign group represent a cross section of business sectors and we would welcome the chance to meet with your officials to discuss how we might help cut through the y timescales and fast track decision making.In the s and s boys were often recruited from the town and district by shipping companies.

With Tommy#s family#s kind permission, the Courier shares his story again.Campbeltown#s Tommy Kelly could have no idea he was playing before a future football icon when invited to England for professional trials in .Tommy, something of a football legend in his native Kintyre after a prominent role with Campbeltown Pupils, was known as #Iron Man# for his fearsome playing style and boundless energy.After shining in the local leagues, he was invited to Hartlepool United, a club starting season   in English football#s fourth tier, and managed by Brian Clough # all thanks to an unlikely talent spotter.Tommy said: #As far as I know it was a tanker driver working down here who told Hartlepool about me.#The next thing I had a letter through the door inviting me to a trial.#Clough ran the rule over Tommy, who played mostly as an outside right, who was then in his early s and starting out on an eventual -year career in Campbeltown with the gas board.The young Clough, in his first management job after a prolic career was cut short by injury, greeted Tommy by saying: #I hope the heather#s not growing out of your ears.#Tommy said: #That threw me a bit. I wondered who this arrogant young manager was.#I can still see him now. Although he was just starting out in management, he had total respect among the players. All you heard was #boss, boss, boss# when they addressed him.#Tommy played at outside right against a local side and scored two goals. Clough was so impressed he wanted the #Iron Man# back down for two more trial matches, and Tommy, having loved the atmosphere, was keen to .He said: #The crowd at the Victoria Ground was brilliant and it was a great feeling scoring two goals.#However, the second trip did not turn out quite as planned.Tommy laughed: #Hartlepool paid expenses for my trips but it was hardly enough to get me to Peninver.#I ed and brought the late Mike McGougan, a classy winger for the Pupils, down with me. I phoned Mr Clough beforehand and he was ok with it.#So when we arrived, I met Clough and introduced him to Mike.#Clough said: #Why don#t you bring the whole f****** pipe band down ##We were a bit shocked and Mike got annoyed and spoke back to him. He never played while we were down there.#I spent three weeks at Hartlepool between the two trips, but Clough would only sign me as an amateur. He and his assistant Peter Taylor, who was an absolute gentleman, were on a tight budget.#By that time, I had a family to think about, so it just didn#t work out. I told him it was professional or nothing.#I was just a hard player with a great engine, and the odd goal in me.

People were also forced to gather in evacuation shelters, making it harder to physically distance.A collection being carried out by A#Chleit, Clachan and Gigha churches will be sent to the WDP committee which has projects in Vanuatu to help with the aftermath of the most recent disasters.Everybody who participated in the service was given a bookmark to remind them of the country and its people.TARBERT:Organisers of Tarbert Seafood Festival have cancelled this year#s festival in light of ongoing Covid- restrictions around mass gatherings.The  festival was due to have been held over two days from July .While this news will likely disappoint the hundreds of people who flock to Tarbert for this popular, family-friendly weekend, the news is not all bad as organisers are confident this year#s Tarbert Music Festival will go ahead as planned from September  to .John Hardie of Tarbert Enterprise Company said: #While the recent announcement from the Scottish Government on the roadmap out of lockdown, together with the fantastic work being done by the NHS with its vaccine roll-out is encouraging, unfortunately it wasn#t enough to allow us to hold this year#s seafood festival safely.#Evenwe are in tier zero, as is hoped, by the end of June, restrictions on numbers of people attending mass gatherings will still apply. The festival is one of Scotland#s friendliest festivals with friends meeting up, milling around our many stalls and enjoying a drink in the sun while listening to live music, not to mention sampling some of the best seafood in the country.#This atmosphere is not something we could compromise for , but the  Tarbert Seafood Festival will certainly be an event worth waiting for.#He added: #We very much look forward to meeting friends, old and new, in September for this year#s music festival.

Before the end of the service, the church roof collapsed in what would have been a tragedy, however, all the congregation, being outside, were unharmed.The site is also home to the Clan MacDonald of Largie family crypt. Inside the locked mausoleum, above which the words #Here rest the bones of the House of Largie# are inscribed, are the carved grave slabs of several members of the MacDonald family, including founder Ranald Bane MacDonald, a th century warrior.The stones, featuring Celtic patterns, animals, swords and ships among other things, are said to be some of the best preserved examples in Scotland.Nature has taken hold in many areas of the graveyard but the Killean and Kilchenzie Churches Preservation Association, established in , is working to preserve the buildings that remain from further ruin.According to the charity#s Facebook page, its main aims are: to preserve and make safe the historic churches and the carved stones of Killean and Kilchenzie, by approved conservation techniques, so that these items are available for view and for study by future generations to advance education and encourage interest in the architecture, social and religious history embedded in the sites of the churches, carved stones, and the historical heritage they represent and to preserve and restore the surrounding graveyards so that the headstones are secured and their data recorded so that the genealogical records are preserved."},{"url":null,"title":"easter egg competitions cracking entries","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

In - the figure was closer to ,.It is said that damaged ied from #localised root pulling# to heavy grazing of root crops and pasture.Geese were also blamed for creating large puddles.The report suggests that one reason for geese becoming an increasing problem was the fact that they were being attracted by improved grazing work done by the farmers.The president of the Kintyre branch of the NFUS, Rory Collville, said the survey backed the case for a compensation scheme.The branch is due to discuss the survey next month.He told the Courier: #Two-and-a-half-thousand birds may not sound like much.#Butyou were a farmer with that number in your field you#d want compensation for the damage they cause.

We were blown away by the talent of the young people and it was hard to choose the winners.#Fellow judges were Finlay MacDonald, director of piping at the National Piping Centre, and composer, broadcaster and musician Gary Innes.The event was played out over three nights last week on the Pipe Bands for Pupils Facebook page, attracting thousands of viewers, who also got a chance to vote for their favourite band.The championships are run by the Scottish Schools Pipes and Drums Trust which has supported piping and drumming in  local education authority areas with thousands of pupils getting lessons each week.The trust helps expand piping and drumming in Scotland#s state schools with cash grants for tuition. It also runs a free bagpipe and concert chanter lending service, and supports paid internships for aspiring tutors."},{"url":null,"title":"leader april 2 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

It underlines the fact that it is communities who know best what is best for them.Argyll and Bute Council was at the centre of ensuring our resilience teams got support and Scottish Government funding dispersed quickly and efficiently.That is why I find the decision of the Tory Lib Dem Independent ruling administration to remove the recycling service from Kintyre Recycling Ltdand taking it in-house as short-sighted. And giving them only six months notice is disgraceful.KRL has provided a reliable service for the community since  and given employment opportunities to people with barriers to work. It has a committed board and management team who have ersied the projects it does to ensure sustainability. But this decision leaves a gaping hole in its business plan and a workforce unsurethey will still have jobs.There is a projected increase in cost of £, to supply recycling bins across Kintyre. But this does not take account of the possible social and welfare cost of the impact on the workforce. This is yet another blow to the community already hammered by unemployment.I urge the council to work closely with KRL to find a solution that ensures that all of the KRL employees at risk of redundancy are found suitable employment and that this valuable organisation can continue to employ vulnerable people providing services from which everyone benefits.In , the SNP published a coloured map showing options for the route of the A at the Rest and Be Thankful. Nine years later, all they have done is colour in the map slightly dferently. We are no further forward.Whoever is in government after the election must stump up the money needed to construct a road protected from landslides. This must be done a lot quicker than the  years the SNP say it will take them.Without urgent action, many businesses in Argyll will not survive.Across the Kintyre and the Islands ward I continue to receive complaints about the rather shoddy condition of road signs.In some cases the signs are faded and covered in dirt and in many other cases they are falling to pieces.One example of this is the road signs above the footpath outside of Port Ellen Primary School on Islay and sadly there are many other examples.In my opinion, in the future, Argyll and Bute Council must be more diligent in maintaining our signs. Road signs help regulate traffic, provide crucial visual guidance and give drivers important preview especially during night-time conditions.I will continue to campaign for more frequent road sign maintenance for every corner of my ward.Following the Scottish Government#s pay offer of four per cent across the board for all NHS workers, Unite will ballot its members on the offer over the next few weeks.Unite represents workers in every pay band across the entire NHS structure and recognises that while this offer will put money into the pockets of our members, any monthly pay uplt will y considerably between iniduals. For this reason, Unite will be putting this offer to our members without recommendation.The offer includes an opportunity to revisit any settlement including an intention by the Scottish Government to allocate additional funding through Barnett Consequentials. Unite will demand that any additional payment made to the Scottish Government by Westminster through this formula, is passed on to our members.Workers across the NHS have been described as #heroic# in what has been an exceptionally challenging year.Now is the time to reward those workers with the pay uplt they deserve, not just for their work during the Covid pandemic, but also for the pay cuts they have endured through years of austerity.For Unite, other pay potential remains on the table in the form of additional Barnett Consequentials and we will pursue any additional pay that is intended for our members through further negotiation with any future Scottish Government.I work for a television company called Five Mile Films and we are making a new documentary series this year for Channel .We are looking for people to apply to take part who want to live a simpler le. The filming will take place over a number of months this year in rural Britain.The idea behind the series is about saying goodbye to smartphones, Zoom calls, social media # all the distractions and pressures of normal le # to go and live a simpler le, experience the #good le# fantasy and think about what our modern le and its multitude of choices has really given us. We will explore the idea of whether, in fact, less is more.We are looking for people of all ages to apply families, couples, single people # to take time out from their normal le and step into a dferent way of living.If any of your readers are interested in finding out more, they should email simplele@fivemilefilms, telling us briefly why you would like to live a simpler le.Since the UK was first officially plunged into lockdown, we have lived through what is probably the most extraordinary year in most people#s letimes.Blind and partially sighted people have had to adjust like everyone  to the daily challenges this has created. Thankfully, there#s now light at the end of the tunnel. But some ongoing measures could continue to be barriers to their independence and confidence.People with sight-loss can sometimes find it dficult to judge space, so we#re asking everyone to maintain their own distance, be patient and be helpful.Just getting out and about can be more hazardous for those without sight. The government#s #Spaces for People# initiative has already transformed many of our streets and thoroughfares.We must take care that this doesn#t inadvertently create new obstacles for those with disabilities.The Covid crisis has given all of us a sense of uncertainty and vulnerability, of what it#s like to depend more on others.

It is not depression it is more subtle and has spiritual overtones – I would say it is most profoundly a spiritual phenomenon.Looking into it, I clearly identied aspects of it in myself today! It appears to be the most #underdiagnosed# and unacknowledged spiritual illness of this age.I found that Pope Francis also came across it. Commenting in the context of healing the paralytic by the pool, he said the #first illness# is the one afflicting the paralysed man. He had #resigned himself to it,# the Pope said, #perhaps saying to himself: #Le is unfair, others are more fortunate than I am#. There is a plaintive tone in this way of speaking # there is resignation but there is also bitterness.#He added that it is an attitude reminiscent of #many [Christians] who lack enthusiasm and who are bitter#, who repeatedly say to themselves: #I go to [church] every Sunday but it is better not to become involved! I believe for my own sake, but I don#t feel the need to give it to others: each one peacefully at his own home.#These people, the Pope added, also take the attitude that # you do something well in le, they#ll reprove you: so, it#s better not to take the risk#.Good Friday, Easter Sunday # excellent days to take the risk and resolve to do something well in le, to set sensible goals to be better than I am now.

with East Lothian residents electing their new representative next month.Four candidates - Euan Davidson , Craig Hoy , Paul McLennanand Martin Whitfield- are in the running for the role.Each week, the East Lothian Courier will give each of the candidates the chance to speak about what theyve been up to and why you should vote for them.Euan Davidson I SPENT last weekend in Dunbar and Haddington with local activists highlighting local issues of concern.The theme running through all of the problems we discussed is a lack of local empowerment.Too often, services are centralised and decisions are taken out of the hands of local people for example, the running down of services at Belhaven Hospital by the Scottish Government.If the SNP Health Secretary had agreed to a small upgrade grant back in -, signicantly more services could have been retained.Across the county, we see the same lack of joined-up thinking, with vast new housing estates lacking the essential additional infrastructure to support them: GP surgeries full, schools at capacity and non-existent public transport provision.A centralised police force has seen officers disappear from our streets.The closure of Haddingtonrsquos court forces victims and witnesses to travel into Edinburgh where there is a signicant backlog in cases.Liberal Democrats want to empower our communities to make decisions for themselves.The SNPrsquos centralising tendency damages our local services.Repeatedly, local decision-making is overturned by the Scottish Governmentrsquos reporters.Of course, media attention is focussed on the launch of the Alba Party and Kenny MacAskillrsquos defection.Mr MacAskill has said thatelected to Holyrood, he intends to stay an MP.Personally, I believe this is unacceptable.East Lothian deserves full-time representation at both Holyrood and Westminster.The other concern is that the SNP and Alba seem determined to turn this election into a referendum on independence.Itrsquos almost aswersquore not pinned down by a frightening pandemic asour economy is not on its knees aswe are not struggling against poverty and climate change emergencies asour education standards are not careering down international league tables.Letrsquos spend the next five weeks talking about what matters rather than a constitutional obsession.Craig Hoy NO SOONER was the election starting gun fired than blows were traded.Unlike normal campaigns, it wasnrsquot the cut and thrust of argument between parties hitting the headlines.Instead, Kenny MacAskill MP arrogantly turned his back on his SNP colleagues ndash and betrayed the trust of voters in East Lothian ndash by defecting to Alex Salmondrsquos Alba Party.I will fight this campaign positively, asking for the support of every pro-UK voter in this constituency.While campaigning canrsquot take place in the usual way, I have already spoken with hundreds of constituents by telephone and have delivered thousands of leaflets.Two clear themes have emerged.Firstly, people are sick of the sleaze, ision and incompetence of this SNP Government.And they no longer trust Labour on the Union.Residents donrsquot want to be dragged back to the ision of another independence referendum.Instead, they want the MSP who succeeds Iain Gray to be a strong voice for the interests of local people.Thatrsquos why I have announced five-point plans for towns and villages across East Lothian.We need to create more jobs, improve education, stop overdevelopment and tackle problems such as drugs and anti-social behaviour.The issue of tactical voting has also come up on the lsquovirtual doorsteprsquo.Labour is weak on the Union and can no longer win this seat.Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has refused to rule out giving Holyrood power to hold another independence referendum.Labour wonrsquot agree to form a pro-UK coalition in opposition to the separatists.Voters fear that Labour simply canrsquot say no to Nicola Sturgeon.Anas Sarwar helped Nicola pass the Hate Crime Bill and sat on the fence over her misleading Parliament.I am clear that a vote for any of the smaller fringe parties will only split the pro-UK vote.In East Lothian, there is only one way of using your two votes to stop the SNP.By voting for me in the constituency vote ndash and Conservative on the party ballot paper ndash we can block an SNP majority and another referendum.By doing that, you will guarantee the next parliament will be focussed on rebuilding the economy and our communities.Paul McLennan AFTER meeting a number of environment groups in the past few weeks, Irsquove taken time this week to reflect on how we transform how our economy operates with improved stewardship of our environment.Societyrsquos underlying health and a sustainable environment need to be measured by more than just figures on a balance sheet.The Wellbeing Economy Allianceurges transforming how the economy operates, warning that unless we rethink who wins and who loses out ldquowe wonrsquot have a chance of delivering that goal: social justice on a healthy planet.We can explore immediately green jobs for economic development, protect wild spaces for animals to thrive and iniduals to enjoy, and sustain our landscape.The Trossachs and the Cairngorms are renowned as Scotlandrsquos only two national parks as your MSP, Irsquod work with agribusiness, rural communities, environmental and other groups to investigate the feasibility of the Lammermuirs becoming a third national park.This echoes the call by the National Trust for Scotland to explore further options for national parks in Scotland.A natural boundary between the Lothians and the Borders, the Lammermuirsrsquo stunning landscape and history would attract locals to access nature and enhance wellbeing, boosting the rural economy.Other measures specic to East Lothian are achievable, realistic and right for now, including engaging in Scotland as a recognised lsquoRe-wilding Nationrsquo.As MSP, Irsquoll also support a feasibility study for Haddington train station a planning bill overhaul to ensure new-builds include electric car points and  per cent of transport budgets designated for active transport.As a government, the SNP has introduced world-leading climate change policies.We have pledged net-zero emissions by  and are on course to meet that target.Last year, we generated . per cent of our electricity demand from renewables.This is displacing millions of tonnes of carbon a year, bringing jobs and enormous socio-economic impacts to our communities.Iceland and New Zealand, successful small democracies led by women, joined Scotland as Nicola Sturgeon pioneered the lsquoWellbeing Economy Governments Grouprsquo.Highlighting the inter-connection of personal and national wellbeing, Nicola argued ldquothe goal of economic policy should be collective wellbeing: how happy and healthy a population is, not just how wealthy.I want East Lothian to lead on the transformative change our environment needs ndash we can be the change we all desire.Martin Whitfield I WAS joined by Scottish Labourrsquos new leader Anas Sarwar and local party members at the launch of my campaign.Its key message is that Labour will focus on what unites us and on recovery ndash not another isive referendum.Mr Sarwar told the virtual meeting that a lsquonational recovery planrsquo for Scotland would be the centrepiece of Scottish Labourrsquos election campaign, covering key priority areas for recovery from Covid, including jobs, the NHS, education, climate and communities.Speaking after the launch, Mr Sarwar said: ldquoScottish Labour, under my leadership, will make a national recovery our only priority. Itrsquos only by voting for us that you can guarantee that we have a parliament focused on recovery.I have also hit the ground running with key local campaign calls, including reiterating my support for the reinstatement of a rail service and station for Haddington, and calling for a staffed shared banking hub to be piloted in Prestonpans to bring banking services back to the town.This election is all about how we recover and rebuild after the pandemic and the fairer future that local people can havewe work together to focus on recovery.East Lothian needs a recovery plan that will deliver local jobs, remobilise our NHS, provide children with a comeback plan, deal with the climate emergency and support communities to rebuild.These are the issues I will focus on over the coming weeks to ensure that East Lothianrsquos people, communities and organisations have the support they need to come back stronger after Covid-.While I am keen to have as much contact with local residents as is allowed under the current public health restrictions, these constraints mean it mostly needs to be online at the moment.I am also continuing my work as a teacher for the early part of the campaign, so my availability is restricted.Anyone who would like to speak to me either by phone or video call should email contactus@eastlothianlabourparty to set up a meeting.More information on my campaign is at facebook martinwhitfieldeastlothian or www.eastlothianlabourparty"},{"url":null,"title":"four-candidates-confirmed-scottish-parliament-election-2021-midlothian-north-musselburgh","story":"Colin Beattie , Stevie Curran , Charles Dundasand Iain Whytewere confirmed as the four candidates for the seat at the Holyrood election when nominations closed yesterday afternoon.Mr Beattie has represented the area in Holyrood since .

for our constituency.Words canrsquot do justice to the sense of pride I feel knowing that I have the opportunity to represent the constituency where Irsquove lived my entire le.I live in Dalkeith,

and Fire board.I have extensive experience working in the public sector, which includes over  years of employment with Lothian and Borders Police Police Scotland .My hobbies are golf and IT.Itrsquos strange that our Holyrood constituency crosses county borders, with Musselburgh, Wallyford and Whitecraig on the east side of the boundary.There are similarities between Midlothian and East Lothian, we have many shared values, but in other ways our counties are very dferent.East Lothian being a coastal authority attracts much more tourism, with a wonderful array of golf courses which I particularly enjoy.Irsquove been a member at Musselburgh Golf Clubfor over  years.Now for some of the politics of this election.I opposed independence in  and I oppose another referendum.We canrsquot risk having a parliament that focuses on old arguments or settling old scores. Scotland deserves a better government and a better opposition.Our focus must be on delivering a national recovery plan so we can build a fairer and stronger Scotland.I will be a strong voice for our communities.I will focus on a recovery plan, a health recovery, an education recovery, a jobs recovery.I will fight for opportunities for our young people and I will campaign for fairer funding for our councils.There are also local issues that require urgent intervention, probably none more so than the very poor patient experiences at Riverside Medical Practice.I cannot accept that it is not within the gt of your MSP to resolve these problems.This will be my very first task.Charles Dundas WHILST some people seem to have been distracted during the first week of this election by the fuss around a new party and defections from the SNP, Irsquom very pleased to report that Willie Rennie and the Scottish Liberal Democrats have kicked things off on a really positive and constructive note.Our campaign has been launched with a needle-sharp focus on putting recovery from the pandemic first.For communities like Musselburgh, that means prioritising the creation of jobs, cutting NHS waiting times, boosting mental health services and seriously tackling the climate emergency.In the first week of the campaign, our Lib Dem focus has been on setting out our plans to boost Scottish education for every stage and age: to get a good start in le to excel at school and to help people retrainthey need to.At the heart of our ideas for education are an Education Bounce Back plan to tackle the attainment gap, because we believe it is an essential investment which allows everyone in Scotland to achieve their potential.Back in , the SNP called our proposals for extra money to be allocated directly to schools and targeted at closing the poverty-related attainment gap ldquodangerous and ldquoridiculous, but we didnrsquot give up, and during the last Parliament the Scottish Government created a Pupil Equity Funding scheme to do just that on a year-by-year basis.Then in the last Scottish budget, the Lib Dems were able to secure an extra  per centto boost that scheme and do more to close the attainment gap.Now, Willie Rennie and the Lib Dems propose to make this targeted extra money for the schools who need it most a permanent feature of Scottish education, and start offering it on a long-term basis to schools so that they can make plans to invest it over multiple years with confidence.That should allow the  teachers currently employed on temporary contracts because of the uncertainty around the PEF scheme to be given more security and allow Scottish education to bounce back the way that it needs to.Iain Whyte WHILE campaigning this week, I have been investigating the car parking provision in Musselburgh.I do not agree with the suggestion from East Lothian Council of introducing parking charges at coastal car parks at Back Sands and Levenhall Links.The council is considering introducing charges here on an experimental basis in line with existing arrangements at other coastal car parks.The council has also mooted the possibility of a further review of parking charges in a much wider Musselburgh Town Centre Parking Review.The introduction of parking charges at coastal car parks further down the East Lothian coast has been deeply unpopular and I am disappointed that East Lothian Council are considering expanding the arrangements to Musselburgh.The waterfront area has seen an increase in visitors throughout the pandemic.This has been a really good thing, as people have needed that break in the fresh air to exercise and maintain their mental health.But it isnrsquot enough just to think about what happens during the remaining lockdown.We need to encourage visitors to keep visiting the area once lockdown is over.This will help to rebuild the Musselburgh economy by supporting local businesses.The same goes for the town centre car parks, which are vital to getting high street businesses back on their feet once they can reopen.Introducing car parking charges would send out entirely the wrong message and will only encourage visitors to park in locations where there is no charging.That could be very disruptive for local residents as their neighbourhood streets would become clogged with cars avoiding the charges, giving them their own parking headache.If elected, I will work with the local Conservative councillor in Musselburgh to oppose this proposal and do all I can to encourage visitors to Musselburgh to help businesses rebuild in line with the Scottish Conservative proposal for a Town Centres Revival Plan."},{"url":null,"title":"dunbar-asssembly-rooms-flat-plan-rejected","story":"Dunbar Assembly

We all know an insatiable Labrador .Labradors will devour everything they can get hold of. Some breeds are more picky and highly unlikely to eat anything other than a tasty morsel.There are some toy breed owners who would love their pet to eat a hearty meal every now and then.This is something to consider when buying a pup.Dogs come in a huge iety of breeds, behaviours, shapes and sizes, so choosing a dog to fit your lestyle can be extremely dficult. It is best to do lots of research before contemplating buying a dog.Many dogs have natural instincts such as herding and guarding, and these should be considered prior to choosing a dog.There are seven main classes of dog, each with their own characteristics. These are only guidelines and all dogs have their own characteristics.Border collies are generally very agile and not especially food-orientated ndash but recently, our receptionist Adele took an interesting call at our Dunedin Vets Tranent surgery, from Mrs Jane Green.She had been playing on the beach at North Berwick with her dog Zed, an exuberant -month-old Border collie. They had been having great fun on a dry, sunny morning when suddenly the ball she threw for Zed disappeared.Mrs Green was convinced Zed had swallowed it whole. There appeared to be no other explanation for the disappearing ball.Adele advised her to come to the surgery as soon as possible after ascertaining that Zed wasnrsquot choking.I have seen cases where hard balls have become lodged in dogsrsquo throats, cutting off the air supply and literally choking the dog. Always make sure the ball your dog is playing with is large enough not to lodge in their airway.Zed wasnrsquot choking and seemed remarkably bright.When he arrived at the surgery, Zed was examined by vet Rachel.She discussed the case with Mrs Green. Rachel could not feel the ball when she felt Zacrsquos abdomen, but Mrs Green was sure he had swallowed it and she showed Rachel a similar one, which was certainly too large to pass through his intestines.At this point, as vets we have to decide how to determineZed had indeed swallowed a ball, so we look to diagnostic imaging. The first thing we may consider is radiography.Only a few years ago,vets wanted to visualise the internal structures of your petrsquos body, a radiograph would be taken using an x-ray machine, which showed the image on a piece of photographic-type paper.The radiograph had to be processed manually in a dark room, using noxious chemicals, and it could take about  minutes to develop one plate.If several radiographs were required, the pet would be under anaesthetic for a prolonged period of time. Pets require sedation or general anaesthetic for radiographs to be taken.The patient has to be positioned correctly and be perfectly still whilst the radiograph is taken. This ensures the best image possible is produced at the first attempt and ensures minimal radiation exposure.Nowadays, we have digital x-rays. The patient still has to be perfectly still whilst the radiograph is taken but the processing is complete in under one minute.The images appear on a computer screen and can be viewed from dferent angles and intensities as required. Fewer radiographs need to be taken and patients are anaesthetised for much shorter times.After light sedation, Zed lay still to have his x-ray taken. This confirmed the ball was in his stomach, with the dense squeaker clearly visible.After discussion with Mrs Green, Zed went for surgery. Vet Rachel, with nurse Jenny, the anaesthetist, performed an exploratory operation to locate and remove the ball.With careful surgical skill, Rachel removed the ball from Zedrsquos stomach and checked to ensure there were no other foreign objects or damage to Zedrsquos intestinal tract.It would not be the first time that one object has been removed, only to find something  in the intestines as well!She closed the wound and Jenny monitored Zed as he recovered. He was given intravenous fluid, pain relief and antibiotics to ensure good recovery and stop infection after his operation.Once he was awake and stable, he was transferred to our out-of-hours carers at the Braids Veterinary Hospital, where he was monitored constantly until he was allowed home the following day.Zed has been examined by several vets at Dunedin Vets since hishome and, although at first quite tender and not his normal happy self, he is improving and should be back to his lively, bouncy self pretty soon.Please ensure you do not give your pets items to play with that they could swallow. They are not aware of the consequencesthey do and they may not all be as lucky as Zed."},{"url":null,"title":"dirleton-tantallon-castles-among-attractions-aiming-reopen-month","story":"The National Trust for Scotland and Historic Environment Scotland have shared plans for opening Newhailes House in Musselburgh, Preston Mill at East Linton, and Dirleton and Tantallon Castles from April  onwards, providing Scotland continues to progress out of lockdown.The grounds at Newhailes and Inveresk Lodge Garden have been accessible for exercise all through the winter.The National Trust for Scotlandhas confirmed that most of its built heritage, as well as estates and gardens across Edinburgh and the Lothians, will be open for visitors from the end of April.Historic Environment Scotlandhas said it plans to open  of its staffed sites on the same day, with more reopening on a phased basis over the coming months.All visits to Dirleton and Tantallon Castles, alongside HESrsquo other sites, must be booked in advance.Social distancing measures will be in place, as will a one-way system in some locations and contactless payments where possible.Parts of some sites, such as indoor or enclosed spaces, will be closed and visitor numbers will be limited for safety reasons.Other sites will be reopened on a phased basis over the coming months.For more information visit historicenvironment.scot our-reopening-plans-and-covid--responseNTS is urging anyone planning to visit to check the latest opening information at nts.org.uk before travelling, as some properties have dferent opening patterns this summer.

This has been the case for some time.ldquoThis means that some people are being left without the expert support from their GP that we desperately want to offer, and we recognise the depth of feeling in the community about this.ldquoWersquore doing absolutely everything we can to try and improve the situation, including increasing the number of clinical and non-clinical staff we have, and working to improve our phone system and the way we manage calls we receive.ldquoWe need to be clear, though, that all of these changes will take time and will not improve the situation overnight.ldquoOnce all of the recruitment is completed, we will be at the limit of people we can employ at the practice, so the number of calls we can answer and the number of appointments we then have available will not substantially increase without wider health system change.ldquoThe practice met with Colin Beattie MSP last week, along with East Lothian Health and Social CarePartnership, community councils and our patient participation group, all of whom have expressed their willingness to work collaboratively with us to bring change.ldquoWersquove made clear to all the pressure wersquore experiencing and the impact this has for people in Musselburgh and for our staff. Wersquove also made clear the changes that need to happenpeople in Musselburgh are to have their health needs met ndash namely a rapid move to put in place the changes the Scottish Government has already agreed must happen right across Scotland to relieve what was recognised several years ago as an unsustainable workload in general practice.ldquoThese changes include the movement of urgent care, pharmacotherapy , vaccinations and community nursing away from general practice, to come instead under the control of local health and social care partnerships. This will allow GPs to focus on their role as expert medical generalists, working to improve the long-term health of both iniduals and the wider community they serve.ldquoAs Musselburgh continues to grow, we also urgently need to hear from those overseeing the development of the town to hear how they plan to service the primary care needs of the community.The online petition launched by patients says: ldquoPatientsrsquo frustrations are running high as appointments are increasingly dficult and mostly impossible to secure.ldquoWait times on calls to connect to the surgery are often in excess of an hour, only to be told there are no appointments available and the patient needs to call back the following day to repeat the frustrating process, with no guarantee of an appointment at the end.ldquoReports of calls being made every day for a week with no success in securing an appointment are now commonplace.ldquoUrgent change is needed, as the health of patients registered with the practice is being put at risk on a daily basis.ldquoThe staff within the practice are working flat out but it is obvious demand far exceeds supply.The petition will be lodged with the Scottish Parliamentrsquos Cabinet Health Minister and Lothian Health Board Patient Experience Committee.They are being asked to intervene and assist the practice ldquoto analyse their current problems, thereafter equip them with the resources needed to implement an accessible appointment system which will, in turn, provide comprehensive medical care for every registered patient at the practice.The petition is at change.org p patients-registered-with-riverside-practice-riverside-practice-appointment-systemThe practice said it was pleased that its patients were adding their voices to the calls for change.A spokesperson for the East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership, said: ldquoELHSCP is already delivering a wide range of self-referral services that offer patients sameday access to specialist clinical, mental health and MSK supportin Musselburgh and across the county.

This panic can be easily averted by oiling your barbecue ndash but make sure you do it before lighting up, as you donrsquot want to get oil on an open flame.Solution: Soak them beforehandKebabs are a staple of any good barbecue, but nothing is worse than wooden skewers burning before the meat and veg has had time to cook. Therersquos an easy fix for this: soak your skewers in water for at least  minutes before sliding your veggies on, so they donrsquot catch on fire.If you always forget to pre-soak your skewers, it could be worth investing in metal versions instead.Solution: Watch your flameItrsquos easy to fall into the trap of nurturing as big a flame as possible, but this will likely result in overly charred food you canrsquot guarantee is properly cooked all the way through. Instead, slow and steady wins the race ndash you want white hot coals and to build up the heat gradually for better control. Pro tip: stop unnecessarily opening the lid of your barbecue ndash oxygen feeds the flames, giving you less control. Also, investigate bbq lsquozonesrsquo ndash YouTube will sort you out on this front.Solution: Really consider veggies and sidesWhen many people think of a barbecue, their mind immediately turns to meat. While you really canrsquot go wrong with a good grilled burger or steak, yoursquore missing a trickyou forget about vegetarian options and sides.Evenyou donrsquot have any veggie friends coming over, meat-free options will elevate any barbecue. Corn on the cob is always a great shout, and you can kick things up a notch with jerk marinated aubergine or barbecued feta and pesto.Solution: You guessed it ndash rest itThis onersquos a very easy fix. Instead of serving your meat fresh off the barbecue, let it sit off the heat for a few minutes so the juices can redistribute, the heat can level out and itrsquos as tender and juicy as possible."},{"url":null,"title":"aldi-lidl-middle-aisles-best-easter-bank-holiday-deals","story":"From baby products to power tools, youll be able to pick up a bargain from the supermarket chains on Monday, April  while enjoying an extra day off work.Weve rounded-up some of the highlights to look out for in each supermarket.AldiThis week, Aldi are offering a range of baby and toddler products offered at discount prices.These include:\" alt\"East Lothian Courier: Hauck Sport Pushchair. \" class\"editor-image\"Hauck Sport Pushchair.

You wonrsquot know just how fearful farmers are about this until you see the results of a devastating dog attack on livestock hellip it can be horric.With sunshine forecast across the country from Friday, the masses are gearing up for a great big green escape to the countryside. But therersquos a major change this spring and that has been the explosion of new dogs over the last year which are about to be unleashed for the first time.Glancing down at my familyrsquos rough-coated Jack Russell terrier gnawing loudly on a Nylabone chew at my feet, I realise what a salvation our furry canine friends have been during this dficult time but am equally struck by the enormity of responsibility which comes with owning a dog and the training involved.My hat goes off to new dog owners who have invested in online training classes over the last year, but in the coming weeks, for many, it will be the first time their dogs will be let off the lead in an open space ndash putting their recall training into practice. That open space is likely to be on farmland, and our fields are quickly filling up with new-born lambs as farmers and crofters embark on one of their busiest seasons of the year.  Right to roam is a wonderful thing, but with unfettered access to the countryside, comes the duty of responsible access. So, in short, keep your dog on a lead around livestock and be wary of ground nesting birds and other wildle.This might seem mind-numbingly obvious to most reading this column, but the fact is, there are more than . million households in the UK who have brought a new pet into their families since the start of this pandemic. This includes a lot of new dog owners who may not be aware of the devastating consequences their cute fluffy pet could have on new-born lambs.I will never stop reminding people about the fact that any dog has the capacity to chase, maim and kill livestock, as every day I am confronted with painful stories and devastating images of farmers who have suffered the horric consequences of an out-of-control dog savaging their sheep.This past week, South of Scotland MSP Emma Harper received unanimous support for a Bill which sought to toughen the penalties on offer to the courts when convicting irresponsible dog owners involved in livestock attacks. Now, guilty iniduals could serve up to  months in jail and or a fine of up to pound,. For years, farming organisations and the police have been running educational campaigns warning dog owners of the consequences loose dogs can have on livestock, but now this new Bill will add further weight and deterrence.Since I started my job with the Scottish Farmer in , I have supported Emma Harper with her proposals and have followed her journey as she met up with farmers across the country, listening to their concerns and promising to bring them justice, so I felt a huge rush of emotion on Wednesday night when this Bill was debated for the third and final time in Holyrood and will now proceed for royal assent before passing into law in six monthsrsquo time.This is a huge moment for Scottish farming and offers much hope for the future that these incidents are being recognised and will be dealt with more fairly. The whole industry is indebted to Emma Harper and her team who have campaigned unreservedly on this over the past four years and these tough new penalties will hopefully send a strong reminder to dog owners of what is at stake,their dog chases or kills livestock. Keeping your dog on a lead around livestock isnrsquot the only thing that should be a no-brainer, but so should picking up your dog poo. This isnrsquot just a responsibility reserved for walking on our beaches or our streets, but also in our fields.Neosporosis is one of the hidden diseases which can be carried in dog faeces and poses a serious risk to livestock and other dogs. More dogs are being infected by the parasite neospora as a result of the growing trend for feeding dogs raw meat. The parasite sheds eggs passing out in dogsrsquo poo andleft behind in a field, can remain infectious for up to six months. If consumed by cattle, in contaminated water, grass or in hay this disease can cause abortions and is responsible for more than  per cent of abortions in cattle.I spoke to a local farmer from Ayrshire this weekend who told me that  acres of one of his silage fields was so saturated by dog poo that he was unable to use it to feed his cattle this winter. He had to accept that  bales ndash equating to around pound, ndash had to be discarded. He told me that despite there being a woodland running alongside the field with a route for dog walkers, that the public preferred to walk through his field and were oblivious to what their dogs leave behind. He is rightfully worried, that from this Friday, the hordes are about to descend, and his field will be ruined once again, and his livestock put at risk.We all should exercise our right to enjoy our beautul countryside, but be mindful of whose workplace you are passing through, and afford it the same respect you would ask for in ."},{"url":null,"title":"scots-word-week-preen-tail-day","story":"YESTERDAY was preen-tail dayndash traditionally the day after April Foolsrsquo day, or Huntegowk, in Scotland.

Hence the spellcheck-taxing title. Unsurprisingly given the premise, Leersquos adaptation is a black comedy.Stallworth is played by future Tenet star John David Washington. We first meet him in the early s as hersquos reassigned from menial duties in the records department to a job keeping tabs on civil rights leader Stokely Carmichael while hersquos in town. This brings him into contact with Patrice Dumas , a young black activist, and the two are soon an item though understandably Stallworth keeps the fact that hersquos a policeman under wraps.But itrsquos when he begins to investigate the local Ku Klux Klan that things take a turn for the truly absurd. Stallworth rings up the local branch, pretends to be white, says he wants to join and gradually inveigles his way into their confidence. He manages the same trick with David Duke , the notorious Grand Wizard of the Ku Klux Klan, when he rings him at KKK HQ in Louisiana. Problems arise, of course, when it comes time for him to go and meet his new confreres ndash which is where colleague Flip Zimmermancomes in handy. And so Stallworth pretends to be white during the y telephone conversations, then Zimmerman, who is white, pretends to be Stallworth for the purposes of the meet-ups. The fact that Zimmerman is Jewish and the Klan members hate Jews almost as much as they hate blacks does complicate matters slightly, especially when one of them tries to make him take a polygraph test at gunpoint to prove his Aryan worth. The two elements of the story ndash the civil rights movement and the far-right racist reaction to it ndash eventually come together in a KKK plot to bomb a rally being held in the city, which puts both Stallworth, Zimmerman and Dumas in danger.Spike Leersquos strengths are many but subtlety isnrsquot one of them, though the set-up here is so preposterous it matters little ndash and it didnrsquot stop the film picking up six Oscar nominations, including Leersquos firstBest Director nod.

Pop promo veteran Russell Mulcahy delivers one of his finest movies - not dficult when you consider he also made atrocious Kim Basinger vehicle The Real McCoy and yawn-tastic The Shadow.

Through those inter-connections and a series of randomoccurrences on two continents, we finally learn what it is that happens to Evelyne on that lonely road. And how. And why.

That monastery later moved two miles inland to become Coldingham Priory in the th century and is still in use as a church, though the oldest surviving parts date from the th century.AEligbbe was later made a saint, with a feast day of August . Curiously, however, what we call St Abbs today was known as Coldingham Shore until the late th century when the village came into the ownership of North British Distillery co-founder Andrew Usher, and the bulk of the houses circled around the harbour were only built in the th century. Usher funded the building of a church, a new school and a village halland extended the outer harbour wall.St Abbs Head is where the renowned St Abbs Lighthouse now sits. It was designed by the Stevenson brothers David and Thomas, went into service in  and was commissioned by the Northern Lighthouse Board in the aftermath of the sinking of the paddle steamer Martello in November  in the Outer Forth Estuary. In  a siren fog signal was added, the first audible foghorn in Scotland. The lighthouse was fully automated in  and is still in service, flashing white every  seconds to a range of  nautical miles.Ships still pass heading north and south but St Abbs is also a big draw for scuba ers thanks to the preternaturally clear waters ndash nearby Coldingham beach is a popular attraction for the same reason ndash and on August ,  it became the UKrsquos first Voluntary Marine Reserve in a ceremony which involved the naturalist David Bellamy jumping into the sea from the harbour wall.What to read ...The Lighthouse Stevensons by Bella Bathurst tells the story of the lighthouses built by the Stevenson family, among them St Abbs Lighthouse.

HUGH: Museum of memoriesWe are a tribe that speaks to the notion of the lucky generation: fully pensioned, partially fit and liberally endowed with the blessing of free time. My grandparents worked until death.One grandparsquos idea of free time was to arrive home on a Friday to hand over his wage packet, retrieve his pocket money, pick up a towel and head to Shettleston baths for his weekly soak. The other grandfather did the same but complemented this in a spectacular show of bravado by finishing his evening at Ashfield dugs.They would be mildly amused by the antics of their grandson. Walking was something the poor did. And all of it on the way to and from work.Yet now we pensioners march continuously. Covid has not deterred us. Indeed, spring has sprung and so have the old wayfarers. We have, though, awoken to a new world.Early Covid jaunts were restricted to circuits of my local park. The slight loosening of restrictions means the city centre is within my field of exercise.I advance from dferent angles. I am joined by others trekking the same routes. There is a continuous, consistent band of marchers heading towards the city centre asbidding to put it under some sort of benevolent siege, aswilling it to be once again revitalised.It is a destination that invites sober reflection whatever the weather. The urban landscape has changed, perhaps irredeemably. The walkers can resemble the Viggo Mortensen character from The Road, though with better hair care and the reluctance to push a shop trolley anywhere outside of Waitrose.But there is a quiet but awful devastation in the city centre. Stripped of people, bereft of energy, the empty streets whisper a warning. Nothing is going to be the same.My jaunts are predicated on the wisdom that the best way to walk though Glasgow is looking up. This reveals the beautul architecture of the city in the most unlikely of spots. Famously, the corner of Union Street and Gordon Street is a place to tilt back the head and sigh in wonder. In the time of the plague, this can be done without being trampled to death by a wave of commuters. It is impossible, though, to avoid the conclusion that other dangers are pressing.The city centre has now been left to the dispossessed, the conscripted zero hour worker and the curious pensioner. It cannot be sustained by these cohorts.My route the other day was from the western approaches, down Sauchiehall Street and then on to Buchanan Street before looping back home though Anderston.It is impossible to imagine these areas being revived without an industrial-sized defibrillator. This resuscitation has to include bold thinking and the sort of money we normally reserve for unused nuclear weapons.The problem is stark in Glasgow but it exists in every city centre. There has to be a strategy to make cities attractive to commercial investors and to potential residents. There are straightforward ways to address this crisis. The first is that the economic regeneration in retail has to be financed by taxes on online companies. The disparity in prices means that the traditional retailer faces extinction with the battle flags of Debenhams, Jenners and others already in the hands of the online forces who are laying waste to the High Street.There is, of course, an acceptance that the old days cannot . There is no hope, for example, of seeing a line of retailers march back on to Sauchiehall Street. But this space offers opportunity.Can affordable housing, aimed at the young, be provided where once there was a department store  Could le be breathed into the city centre by encouraging families to set up there and create all the ancillary benefits and facilities that this would require Covid has had its unremitting awfulness. But it has shown us that there is, indeed, a magic money tree and it can be shaken to provide the fruit for economic renewal and sustenance. HUGH: Nuisance calls drive me madThe city centres are in terminal declinebold action is not taken now. They should be the hub of the community, the centre of commerce and the host to visitors from near and far. They are in danger of becoming husks, testying only to decline and fall.This generation of politicians must heed the warnings or the pensioner army might be the only invading force, now and in the future, for our traditional heartland.Our columns are s for writers to express their opinions.They not necessarily represent the views of The Herald"},{"url":null,"title":"wake-up-call-scales","story":"It sneaks up on you, a pound here and there.

He is generally credited with steadying the listing ship of devolved governance. by Brian taylor: Strugeons inquiry performance was controlled and capableNow Nicola Sturgeon is seeking re-election under that same Additional Member System. Devised, remember, to thwart her party. An exercise which has not been entirely successful in that the SNP has held sway at Holyrood since Mr McConnell demitted office in .But she faces an additional challenge. In addition to her customary opponents, she has to contend with a former chum. Her erstwhile mentor Alex Salmond is seeking to confound that Holyrood voting system by seeking regional list seats to supplement the constituencies he expects his former party, the SNP, to retain or gain.Mr Salmond describes that as a super-majority for independence. For that sum to work, however, there would have to be an almost universal transfer of list votes from the highly competitive SNP to Alba, presumably eclipsing the pro-independence Greens while, at the same time, the pro-Union parties fail to take advantage of this apparent contention on the Nationalist side.To say the least, that is asking a lot. Still, it is feasible and Mr Salmond remains a persuasive campaigner, despite the poll suggestions that, after years of controversy, accusation, acquittal and inquiry, he is rather less popular than was formerly the case.In passing, one might also note that his concept of vying up the independence vote was not discussed with or ratied by Nicola Sturgeon in any way. Further, it runs precisely counter to the message Mr Salmond himself delivered when he won majority power in . Then, the endlessly repeated mantra was ldquoboth votes SNP.Again, though, it remains a possibility in pursuit of what Mr Salmond has called the ldquonoble cause of independence. Contrary to claims that he is intent on vengeance, he insists he is only too eager to help that broader aim, as he has always done.Alex SalmondWhich presents Nicola Sturgeon with a dilemma. Could she conceivably work with a man who told a Holyrood inquiry she had breached the Ministerial code  A man who, she informed the same inquiry, had recounted behaviour towards a woman which she regarded as ldquodeeply inappropriate Before we arrive at such hypothetical post-election scenarios, however, there is the small matter of winning popular support from the voters.This lands Nicola Sturgeon with a more elemental conundrum. To be clear, she yearns for independence. She craves it, like a gourmet treat, all the more appealing for being kept at a distance, and denied by rivals.How, though, to achieve it  Strategically, she has three good reasons for focusing more in this election upon other policies, other issues, while retaining independence as the over-arching aim, through a referendum. In the BBC Scotland debate this week, she said such a poll should be held in the first half of the new Holyrood Parliament, once coronavirus had subsided.Those reasons for caution  Firstly, just like Jack McConnell promoting devolution in , she knows that independence lacks universal popularity. Many remain to be convinced.Even some who ultimately favour or would acquiesce in an independent Scotland might prefer to concentrate for now on other matters, notably this hideous plague and the attendant economic challenge.So she couches independence not as a concept in itself but as a potential answer to those financial woes a solution to be adopted when the time is right. Not immediately. For now, the SNP mot is that Scotlandrsquos problems need Scottish solutions, not a recipe advanced by Boris Johnson.Simultaneously, she is aware that this approach, which she judges to be necessary to sustain widespread popular support for her government, with its range of policies and objectives, is scarcely calculated to enthuse the more zealous of her adherents in the wider nationalist cause.That partly explains the lingering disquiet in the SNP over strategy. It, partly, explains the creation of Alba, although that is very largely down to Mr Salmond.Which brings us to Ms Sturgeonrsquos second reason for caution. An over-emphasis on independence might serve to energise Mr Salmondrsquos offer, to her dismay. In her mind, she sees an all too familiar figure, with an all too familiar grin, offering to help.Thirdly, every time she talks up independence or is asked so to do, we can expect an intervention from Douglas Ross of the Tories or, indeed, from Labour or the Liberal Democrats.Mr Ross is simply itching to make this election a quasi-referendum, to make it a straight fight between independence and the Union, hoping that he will, thereby, cajole indy-sceptics from other parties to vote Tory.A further thought disturbs the Sturgeon sleep pattern. She accuses Mr Salmond of gambling, of seeking to trick the electorate into a referendum. What , she asks, that leaves a residue of discontent and disquiet, even among potential independence supporters, so that any subsequent referendum is lost Mr Salmond denies this would happen and argues that Ms Sturgeon would, eventually, see the advantage of collaboration.Read more by Brian Taylor:Sturgeon versus Salmond.

But in the current circumstances they are surprising, and deeply disappointing.Everyone recognises the remarkable dedication shown, and the extraordinary challenges faced, by NHS staff over the past year many will also have sympathy with the claim that a substantial increase is not only an acknowledgement of that, but an attempt to restore their position after several years of pay restraint. But that impulse, no matter how widely shared, is not the sole consideration.The argument that strict limits on public pay rises were a necessary response to the financial crisis is disputed only by a few there is no plausible case for maintaining, after a year in which much of the nationrsquos economy has been entirely shut down, and in which the Government has borrowed more than  times as much as usual, that the economic challenges now are not even graver.The public sector pay bill, even in normal times, accounts for around half of all day-to-day government spending and though of course public sector workers pay taxes, all that money ultimately comes from those parts of the economy that generate revenue, productivity and growth. Yet in raw terms, public sector workers were already paid more than their equivalents in the private sectorbefore the pandemic, which has sent many thousands of businesses to the wall, and looks certain to have cost millions of jobs.Those are the people ndash some in frontline, though private sector, professions that have required sacrices similar to those of NHS staff, but who are worse paid and less secure in their jobs ndash who will bear those costs. Part of the blame for that must rest with the Scottish Government, which has distorted the expectations of public sector employees by giving the impressionthat there will always be more money available.In fact, as the Institute for Fiscal Studies pointed out this week, the Scottish Government has  per cent per person of the equivalent funding of departments in England and Wales, almost all of it provided by block grant from Westminster, and has been insulated from many of the cuts implemented there. And those figures do not include almost pound billion of additional Covid funding, some of which Holyrood has earmarked for spending, such as free school meals and bus travel, not directly related to the pandemic.Suspicions that announcing continued liberal use of taxpayersrsquo money for, inter alia, laptops for schoolchildren , are designed for political gain may be cynical, but at the least it demonstrates that the Government has not acknowledged, let alone bridged, the chasm between public sector spending and the challenges facing a struggling private sector that must ultimately foot the bill.Despite its refusal to admit as much, the Government must secretly know it to be true, however. The GMBrsquos reluctance to recognise that reality when presented with a pay settlement that is, in the current climate, so generous as to be arguably reckless is of a dferent order of denial. Its response is not merely disappointing it is irresponsible at a time when building recovery should be everyonersquos priority."},{"url":null,"title":"ive-agricultural-college-can-smell-bull-100-yards---week-douglas-ross","story":"As imagined by Brian BeacomDID you hear what Anas Sarwar, the new Labour kid on the block, had the nerve to say to me this week ldquoGrow up! he yelled, seething about my election priorities.Honestly, just because Irsquove spent my adult le at weekends wearing short trousers, a tight little black top and waving my arms in the air like a Second World War schoolboy learning semaphore, doesnrsquot mean Irsquom immature.Grow up  You grow up, Anas, or Irsquoll tell my twin sister what you said about me and shersquoll be really cross.OK, as a linesman Irsquom a little power crazed.

Indeed, in rejecting Salmondrsquos idea of a two-party supermajority as ldquogaming the system she may have skewered indyref.After May ,her pro-independence majority is composed, as looks likely, of SNP constituency and Green list MSPs, it will be hard to claim this as a new mandate for a referendum.Boris Johnson will just quote her own words back at her. Holyroodrsquos AMS system was designed precisely to prevent any one party securing an overall majority. Alex Salmond was able to beat drsquoHondt in  only because of a unique set of circumstances.However, I do not subscribe to the view that the First Minister has given up on Scottish independence. It is in her DNA as much as it is in Alex Salmondrsquos. However, her body language in last weekrsquos BBC debate, in which she was hectored and harried over the timing of indyref, indicated her discomfort with the whole question.She clearly has other things on her mind ndash the pandemic for one ndash and has now shted the rhetoric on independence totake that into account. Independence is no longer to be seen as a necessary condition for a successful recovery, but something only to be considered ldquoafter the crisis is over, as she put it. That crisis could last for some years yet.The Scottish economy was lagging behind the rest of the UK before Covid. Structural problems are going to be revealed as UK Government support is withdrawn.As they say in America, when the tide goes out you find out whorsquos not wearing a bathing suit.In those circumstances, with unemployment rising, would the First Minister really want to ignite a isive referendum campaign evenshe could  As I say, itrsquos too soon to write off Alba, but one message could be that, while Scots may be increasingly attracted to the concept of independence, they may not be in the market for it right now. Lord make me free, but not yet.Onlyyou are a radical, an insurgent, a risk-taker ndash yes, a gambler ndash does independence really makes sense, at least right now.A politician like Alex Salmond doesnrsquot care about polls or the precautionary principle he makes his own history. Salmond is right that only a mass, popular movement could make the independence cause become unanswerable. It would require big street demonstrations, court actions, civil disobedience. History would need to be placed on fast forward, as it was in Ireland at the start of the last century. Thatrsquos a risky road.Nicola Sturgeon is not arisk-taker, not a revolutionary, and recoils from fighting talk and ision. Itrsquos all too testosterone-fuelled for her. Most middle-class Scots share her risk aversion.One of the abiding themes of Scottish politics over the past  years has been votersrsquo enthusiasm for gradations of home rule that always stop short of actual independence.It might be that Ms Sturgeonrsquos very caution is part of her popularity. She is intensely Scottish, hostile to English Tories, but she can be relied upon not to do anything daft.The independence case is anyway in deep trouble. In , Salmond managed to persuade  per cent of Scots to vote Yes but only after it was made clear that it would not mean a border with England, or losing the pound, or even losing the Queen. Both Scotland and England were assumed to be remaining in the EU. That has all changed.Nicola Sturgeon has avoided discussion of the mechanics of independence post-Brexit, preferring to stick to generalities about how Scots need to take their own decisions and not be under dictation from Brexit Tories.But she knows, and everyone in her Government knows, that the situation is very dferent to . Last weekrsquos report from the Institute for Government underlined in red dficulties that simply canrsquot be ignored.It is true that the act of joining the European Union might only take two to four years ndash the blink of an eye in Brussels terms. But disaggregating the UK would take much longer. Scotland would have to be fully independent of the UK and that would take at least five years going on the Brexit experience.The Institute reckons that wersquod be looking at a decade of complex negotiations before Scotland became a member of the EU.The idea that Brussels might allow some kind of halfway house, letting Scotland join while it was still part of the UK, is a non-starter. It was something the EU refused to consider even before the Northern Ireland Protocol.Recent problems with that mean Brussels will run a mile from Ireland-style anomalies.So there would inevitably be a hard trade border. Scotland may not have to join the euro, at least not immediately, but it will have to be fully independent to fulfil the terms of EU accession.It could not be an independent countryit kept the pound and had monetary policy decided by the Bank of England.Nicola Sturgeon is one of the most gted politicians Scotland has ever produced. She is a trained lawyer and has watched the manold dficulties that followed the Brexit vote.She knows that for independence to succeed it would require a huge level of commitment from the Scottish people ndash a commitment that doesnrsquot as yet exist.Evenshe could secure the essential Section  Order from Westminster, therersquos no guarantee that Yes would win.At best, it might be a ided result, perhaps the inverse of , with a narrow victory for Yes. But that would land her with the nightmare of negotiating independence for a ided nation. The Unionist minority would demand a repeat referendum after the separation agreement with the UK is negotiated. Since that was what Nicola Sturgeon called for on Brexit, it would be hard for her to refuse.All these issues crowd into the mind of a politician like the First Minister.She is too aware of the downside, too conscious of the damage of ision and conflict. That is her great political weakness, but it is also her electoral strength.Her aversion to populism and civil disobedience makes it dficult for her to make history. On the other hand, it may be that Scots are happy for her not to ndash at least for now."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/12475801.jpg?type=article-full","title":"ten-blooming-garden-centres-opening-post-lockdown","story":"Tinnisburn Plants, Canonbie, Dumfries  GallowayIf what you want is tough plants for tough places, then Tinnisburn is where to go.

It is a depressingly all-too familiar sight.“Stagnation” was the term Mr MacKinnon used, and he was spot on.As lives become ever more disconnected from the land, it’s quite understandable why people no longer have the inclination, or time, particularly when there is no great financial . But how it must frustrate those desperate to work the land to see all these crofts going to waste.Survey after survey has demonstrated a huge interest from people wanting to get a foot on the ladder, but they can’t because the traditional avenue of family inheritance is not open to them.The croft tenancies that do come on the market go for astronomical sums, way beyond the reach of young families and completely out of kilter with agricultural potential.And this is the problem, the reason that so many people hold onto non-working crofts is because they can see the pound signs they can see what it might fetch in terms of its housing potential, with estate agents only too happy to downplay the fact that every croft tenancy sale and every de-crofting application has to be approved by the Crofting Commission. It’s not proved too much of an impediment in the past.In fairness to the commission, they have made improvements. As much as the law enables, they do now try and prevent housing speculation – although one recent case in Lochalsh suggests there may be still some way to go. And they have at least made the right noises about dealing with neglect, which has prompted an increase in formal sub-leases and tenancy transfers.But as Mr MacKinnon noted, it is dficult for them to really stamp their authority without the proper resources.So an impasse remains, young families are unable to get access to land while countless crofts go to waste.But there is a solution, evenit will make for an uncomfortable journey: remove the ability to trade tenancies on the open market and at the same time get rid of the right to buy a croft. At a stroke, those motivated purely for monetarywill disappear their incentive gone. Then arm the commission with the necessary resources to properly tackle neglect —rather than the current practice of gentle encouragement without force — and those who have crofts but can’t do the work will have to quickly find a solution. Step forward new entrants.Granted, the opposition to such an approach will likely be signicant. Denying people the opportunity to do with an asset what they please will be seen as anti-libertarian, a curb on personal freedom, and you can easily predict the outrage.But the responsibility of a crofter is not to do as you please. You are part of a unique system of land tenure which was established nearly  years ago to keep people and communities alive. That is still very much of relevance today. Denying those fortunate enough to have crofts from lining their own pockets and ensuring everyone lives up to their duties doesn’t seem an unreasonable expectation in that context.It is expected that, Covid recovery depending, the new term of the Scottish Parliament willto the matter of crofting reformand there is an opportunity here for a proper radical approach which addresses the needs of crofting today but, crucially, with the principles of old at its heart.It will require politicians and leaders of strength and conviction who are able to make a compelling case in the face of undoubted opposition, who can the see the vision that a new, radical approach will bring and who can reject pressure from all sorts of vested interests. The trouble is: there is precious little evidence of that calibre of inidual in Scotland’s political landscape of today.IT SEEMS like only yesterday I was talking about preparing for the winter and here we are with spring on the horizon.

Not a disaster by any means, particularly in this part of the world, but my own lowest tally ever, as usually I’m looking at somewhere around the  to  per cent mark.I suspect an underlying issue with fluke at tupping time. Fasciola hepaticais a tiny mud snail which is ingested through grazing and attacks the liver. It thrives in wet conditions and is re in Scotland.There are routine treatments, but it’s now recognised that the parasite is developing a resistance to some of the products on the market. As a result of that, the advice is to constantly use dferent ones and I probably wasn’t as meticulous in this as I should have been, although I know that others too have had increased problems with fluke in the early part of the winter – and it was horrendously wet in November through to December.So the dry, hard frost of a couple of weeks ago was a godsend and it was on such a bracing but beautul morning that we gathered for the scanning, the ground underfoot like uneven concrete. You could have gotten away with your trainers.Once the work was completeI linked up my iPhone with the scanner and a detailed breakdown of the results popped up on the screen. A couple of pings later and it was out in the ether, all the way out to the North Sea where it was downloaded by someone not able to be in attendance to view his own results almost instantaneously.It was a lovely symbiosis of tradition and technology, though goodness knows what the bodachs of yesteryear would have made of it all."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/John_Purser-202030713-edited.jpg","title":"tobar and dualchais pure escapism among the fenian","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThat may explain why story-telling and mythology were so highly prized.

Daniel Kane found herself in Malawi - the fth poorest nation in the world. Malawi, with a population of almost million and only a handful of ventilators and very little PPE, was totally unprepared for the pandemic. Charlotte assisted in the initial response to the first surge of the coronavirus as it spread throughout Malawi. Currently, however, a second and more deadly wave is gripping the country with devastating consequences. Charlotte said: “There are ten times more cases than during the first wave and a projected exponential increase in the infection rate. “Access to hospitals and modern health care is extremely limited. Many covid- patients are being treated in temporary wards in carparks with oxygen cylinders and . “There is no ability to give patients ventilatory support and take them into intensive care. Frontline healthcare workers risk their lives every day without adequate PPE and basic essentials such as hand gel.”Another huge contrast with the UK is that it may be some time before poorer countries like Malawi can get the vaccine. Here in the UK, the vaccine rollout has been a massive success with every person eligible for a free vaccination on the NHS. In poorer countries it will take much longer even for the vaccine to reach frontline health workers and the most vulnerable. The “Economist” reckons that it will be  at least before there is widespread vaccine roll out. “This means that Malawians have at least two years to get through before there is effective vaccine cover. As the vaccine rolls out in advanced economies and many of us are starting to see a glimmer of hope that normality willsoon, the story in Malawi couldn’t be more dferent,” says Charlotte.For health systems which are already woefully under-resourced, dealing with a second wave and a new strain of COVID- is a monumental challenge. Hospitals and clinics are operating without the basics to protect their staff and patients. Basic levels of PPE and hand gels are in very short supply. Without this support fragile health systems will be decimated of their most precious resource at this time – healthcare workers as many are at home sick with COVID- or sadly dying. This comes at a time when hospitals are buckling under pressure and desperately need health workers to be able to work.Charlotte now works as a doctor in Liverpool where the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine has launched Bump It Forward campaign to help bring PPE and vaccines to Malawi, Kenya and Zimbabwe in an attempt to redress this massive health inequality. The fund raising campaign actually came about as the result of a dream.A Christian friend of Prof Melita Gordon, who works in Malawi fulltime as part of the Malawi-Liverpool-Wellcome Trust Clinical Research Programme, dreamt about how she was to receive her vaccine free of charge and an idea emerged to ‘pay forwar’d the cost of that doseage to help people in countries who did not yet have vaccines. It was a very direct, personal idea that people in the UK who have had a vaccine get it for free while the people in Malawi don’t. People love the idea of the BumpitForward campaign as it provides the opportunity to give back the cost of the vaccine in the order of pound. which they get it for free to help protect healthcare workers in Malawi, Kenya and Zimbabwe until the vaccine reaches them and save lives.Dr. Kane says she would love to see a local response to the campaign after her experience at the Mulanje District Hospital.Charlotte says: “The hospital is doing a great job, providing quality, safe and dignied care in extremely dficult circumstances.“Just like in the UK, they have had staff shortages related to staff testing positive for COVID which has made things all the more dficult. The senior nurses have designed a protocol to make best use of reusable gowns and are very grateful to receive the PPE donation. “I worked at Mulanje for the first six months of  and they have been brilliantly supportive partners in MLW-led research into reducing deaths from sepsis and HIV associated TB, so it is a pleasure to be able to support our partners when they are in need of PPE at this time. #Bumpitforward is a wonderful campaign which I couldn’t recommend highly enough.Give the equivalent of your Covid- vaccine to protect frontline staff in African countries who will have to wait for theirs. You can help keep them safe by donating the equivalent cost of your vaccine, to protect them until they can get theirs. There has already been a huge response to the Bump It Forward campaign and it continues to grow! It has now raised over pound,.

Its removal was debated in Stormont in , but that debate was informed by outdated research conducted by the Equality Commission two decades ago.The NASUWT said the continued existence of the legislation contributes to the ided nature of the education system.Dr Patrick Roach, NASUWT General Secretary, argued that the time for education in Northern Ireland, and teachers, to receive fair treatment has long since passed. Discrimination is damaging to children#s education and to the wellbeing and careers of teachers, he said.This legislation is compromising efforts to tackle prejudice and hatred and conflicts with the goal of social inclusion which schools should be working to nurture and promote.No teacher should be denied opportunity to teach or to lead schools on the basis of their religious belief.NASUWT National Official Northern Ireland Justin McCamphill said the exemption to the Fair Employment and Treatment Order is outdated and needs to be removed.We are calling on the administration to remove this and ensure that every teacher has equality of opportunity and is able to apply for work in any school regardless of their religion or perceived community background, he said.Removing the teacher exemption is necessary to tackle endemic nepotism and lack of ersity in the teaching profession.The union#s annual conference will be held online this year, but moves to change the legislation have been backed by educational experts who say it continues to provide a signicant barrier in any move towards a fairer system.Recent research from Ulster University#s UNESCO Education Centre has shown that less than % of teachers in the Catholic maintained primary sector, one in , come from a Northern Ireland Protestant background.Around one in  teachers in controlled primary schoolswas a Northern Ireland Catholic.Belfast Most ReadYoung child knocked down in fatal Belfast crash Hijacked cars set on fire and police attacked in Newtownabbey rioting NI political leaders call for calm as  PSNI officers injured in Belfast rioting#Wanted him out a long time ago#: Carl Frampton#s we Christine reacts as tributes pour in on boxing hero#s retirementHeartbreak at death of well-known NI musicianTop VideosPlayPolice have been called to the scene of an ongoing riot in Newtownabbey\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news edc .ece AUTOCROP wh dabacbedeaea.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news edc .ece AUTOCROP wh dabacbedeaea.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news edc .ece AUTOCROP wh dabacbedeaea.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"PlayRioting erupts in the Sandy Row area of south BelfastPlayMan caught in petrol bomb flames as rioting in Northern Ireland continues into a second nightLatest EducationDerry#s Foyle College asks past pupils to help it pay £, debtBelfast council backs calls to include sign languages in curriculumCovid lockdown led to surge in schoolchildren suffering mental health issuesFive more schools abandon the transfer test for next yearLatest from Belfast Teachers not given time off by schools to get Covid vaccine, union leader saysLeeds report losses of £.million as club ed to Premier LeagueRing announcer Michael Buffer praises Carl Frampton as fighter calls time on boxing careerIn Pictures: Spring sun shines for Easter SundaySeven-year-old girl killed in tragic west Belfast collision, police confirm,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It is our view the pandemic only makes this more urgent, not less so, she added. Such a strategy should be not just about services, but also about what we can all do to support each other.People Before Profit MLA Gerry Carroll, a member of Stormont#s Health Committee, said the Executive needs to examine new ways of addressing workplace stress.The scale of these figures is very worrying and really goes to show the pressure and stress that frontline workers are under, he said.Not only do we need to ensure that every worker is supported with access to counselling and other talking therapies but these figures should really focus the attention of Executive ministers on tackling long hours for low pay that many unfortunately face.I would urge ministers to urgently look at the benefits of implementing a four-day week without loss of pay as a way to assist tackling anxiety, depression and other mental health pressures people are experiencing.The Department of Finance, which is responsible for personnel matters in the Northern Ireland Civil Service , said: The health, wellbeing and welfare of all our colleagues is very important and we offer a range of support including a welfare support service access to a free, -hour counselling service access to a health and wellbeing support hub and mental health awareness training for staff and managers.Arrangements are in place to quickly identy colleagues experiencing stress and to offer support including dignity at work mediation services.

Brides and grooms-to-be are now looking to move ahead with wedding plans despite the inability of bridal boutiques and jewellers to fully reopen due to coronavirus restrictions. Rebecca Bryson, the owner of Curvy Chic Bridal in Belfast, is addressing the problem by offering virtual appointments, at-home try-on services and sale dresses on her website. It#s not the exact same experience but we try to make it as nice as possible, she said.It is a similar situation with other retailers.Jewellery designer Mairi Burrow is also offering an at-home wedding ring service for couples getting married. Couples contact her via her website to organise a Zoom consultation and are sent one of five ring boxes with ring sizers, D printed nylon ring samples, magnying tweezers and archive books to go through, along with a price list. I#ve had very positive feedback so far and the Zoom consultation helps solidy any query, Mairi said. It#s admin-intensive organising for the box to be posted out and for everything to be sanitised - before, I would just see people on Saturday. Now we have to organise Zooms and post the box and everything that goes along with it.Try before you buy is essential when making a jewellery purchase, Mairi said. She added: You need to try on widths and thicknesses with your engagement ring so it#s not something you can blindly buy. Seeing the nylon sample on your hand is crucial to making your decision.Wedding ring orders can be fulfilled quickly but she advised couples not to leave it until the last minute.I usually take people with a -week turnaround time. Plain bands can be quite quick but you need to factor that you will receive it a few weeks before your wedding, Mairi added. I#ve had a few people who thought they could hold off until we meet in person but nobody knows when that will be. There#s so much uncertainty there but I have clients in Scotland and London for whom the ring box is a bonus. Now it can be sent throughout the whole of the UK and Ireland. Rebecca Bryson said that for her appointments, she goes by wedding date when deciding which brides to prioritise. The people who are under the most pressure are getting their appointments first, she said. The people who are in the summer months and feeling very stressed have the at-home service where they can try on five dresses after a Zoom call where we narrow down some choices. We also send a tape measure and clamps.The service, which is being offered across Northern Ireland, is also helping to offload dress stocks which had built up over the course of the pandemic. People are able to get a dress in a short time-frame, she explained. Rebecca said she has found the lack of information on restrictions exhausting. She added: Brides will message us and ask do we know when we#re reopening. We get our information from the news and there#s no insider info. Every time the dates have moved we#ve been rescheduling brides who are starting to panic.There are people who are getting married in November or December and have now realised they have less time than they thought.It is recommended that her brides pick a dress around  months before their wedding - but a series of factors have caused issues. Rebecca explained: There are delays in shipping, partly due to Covid and now because of Brexit. The shipping aspect is taking longer than it used to for things coming from outside the UK. What would normally have taken days is taking weeks. We#re fortunate that our designers are ready to go and know they need to hit the ground running and get dresses out as fast as they can. The most urgent cases come via brides who had planned to wait to choose a dress when shops reopened and now need to find something in time for the summer. We just see what we can do with the at-home service. We#ve put a lot of dresses in our online sale that are brand new and that we have to release because people don#t have time, she said. Rebecca sought to reassure brides-to-be, advising them: Don#t panic.She added: I think a lot of brides coming to us at the end of the year and the start of next year are starting to wonder will they be able to get a dress. We are prepared for this and it#s not our first rodeo after last year. Elody in Newry, Petticoat Lane in Hillsborough and La Boda Bridal in Banbridge are also offering try-at-home so you can chat to them about what you want - evenyou try something on, it can help put your mind at ease.Belfast Most ReadYoung child knocked down in fatal Belfast crash Hijacked cars set on fire and police attacked in Newtownabbey rioting NI political leaders call for calm as  PSNI officers injured in Belfast rioting#Wanted him out a long time ago#: Carl Frampton#s we Christine reacts as tributes pour in on boxing hero#s retirementHeartbreak at death of well-known NI musicianTop VideosPlayPolice have been called to the scene of an ongoing riot in Newtownabbey\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news edc .ece AUTOCROP wh dabacbedeaea.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news edc .ece AUTOCROP wh dabacbedeaea.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news edc .ece AUTOCROP wh dabacbedeaea.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"PlayRioting erupts in the Sandy Row area of south BelfastPlayMan caught in petrol bomb flames as rioting in Northern Ireland continues into a second nightLatest Northern IrelandRing announcer Michael Buffer praises Carl Frampton as fighter calls time on boxing careerSeven-year-old girl killed in tragic west Belfast collision, police confirmSeven-year-old girl dies after being struck by car in BelfastThirty petrol bombs thrown at police during Newtownabbey riot  petrol bombs thrown at police in ‘orchestrated attack’ in Northern IrelandLatest from Belfast Ring announcer Michael Buffer praises Carl Frampton as fighter calls time on boxing careerSeven-year-old girl killed in tragic west Belfast collision, police confirmDanny Ings s to inspire Southampton fightback win against BurnleyIT company’s Covid- passport app to be ready in MayBoris Johnson to outline plans for easing controls on foreign travel,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The two men helped plan and lead an IRA escape from the Maze Prison in the s. He is highly unlikely to apologise publicly for being at the funeral.The North Belfast MLA represents the older guard of the party. It is his job to keep the republican base on board, leaving the diplomacy in times of crisis to the newer wing of Sinn Fein.The party is in a tricky position, balancing the anger of those who sacriced family funerals because of the Covid restrictions with not being seen to be subservient to the demands of the DUP.Ahead of the Easter break, when republicans commemorate their dead, sackcloth and ashes apologies will not play out well with their base.What does this mean for the DUP, which needs to be seen as tough on Sinn Fein or face further criticism from Jim Allister, who has the party chasing him around for the working-class loyalist vote Mr Allister said earlier this week that all unionist politicians should walk away from the Policing Board in protest at the decision not to prosecute anyone in relation to attendance at the funeral. Not so long ago, this would have been viewed as a radical suggestion, but his calls appear to be gaining traction with DUP Junior Minister Gordon Lyons, who told the BBC the party was considering its position on the oversight body.Walking away from public bodies may make a statement in the short term, but where does that leave unionism#s long-term strategy going forward,those whose resignations it has called for simply choose to ride out the storm The criticism of the Chief Constable, allegations of two-tier policing and questioning the motivation of the PSNI at a time of loyalist unrest is a very dangerous game for the DUP to be playing.With tensions around the sea border and loyalists in some areas withdrawing cooperation with police on community bodies, any ramping up of tensions could be used as cover by those hell-bent on taking opposition to the Northern Ireland Protocol onto the streets.The announcement by the PPS on Wednesday that the decision on the Storey funeral was to be reviewed by independent counsel may well buy some time for unionists to revise their strategy.Meanwhile, on what should have been a quiet holiday week, the Executive is facing yet another political crisis, leaving many askingthe devolved government is fit for purpose.Belfast Most ReadYoung child knocked down in fatal Belfast crash Hijacked cars set on fire and police attacked in Newtownabbey rioting NI political leaders call for calm as  PSNI officers injured in Belfast rioting#Wanted him out a long time ago#: Carl Frampton#s we Christine reacts as tributes pour in on boxing hero#s retirementHeartbreak at death of well-known NI musicianTop VideosPlayPolice have been called to the scene of an ongoing riot in Newtownabbey\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news edc .ece AUTOCROP wh dabacbedeaea.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news edc .ece AUTOCROP wh dabacbedeaea.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news edc .ece AUTOCROP wh dabacbedeaea.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"PlayRioting erupts in the Sandy Row area of south BelfastPlayMan caught in petrol bomb flames as rioting in Northern Ireland continues into a second nightLatest Northern IrelandRing announcer Michael Buffer praises Carl Frampton as fighter calls time on boxing careerSeven-year-old girl killed in tragic west Belfast collision, police confirmSeven-year-old girl dies after being struck by car in BelfastThirty petrol bombs thrown at police during Newtownabbey riot  petrol bombs thrown at police in ‘orchestrated attack’ in Northern IrelandLatest from Belfast Ring announcer Michael Buffer praises Carl Frampton as fighter calls time on boxing careerSeven-year-old girl killed in tragic west Belfast collision, police confirmDanny Ings s to inspire Southampton fightback win against BurnleyIT company’s Covid- passport app to be ready in MayBoris Johnson to outline plans for easing controls on foreign travel,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Listen to teachers’ concerns about those employers who have felt emboldened to pursue ‘business as usual’.”He added: “Listen to teachers’ concerns about uncaring employers who seek to discipline teachersthey contract Covid, or tell teachers they can’t have time off to receive their Covid vaccine jab.”Ministers must not only listen to the concerns of the profession – they need to act on themDr Patrick RoachDr Roach said reports of school staff being denied time off to get their vaccination were “widespread”.Speaking to reporters, the union leader said: “I wish it was only a one-off but the number of times that’s come across my desk I cannot begin to tell you. It has been pretty widespread.”Dr Roach said the Education Secretary had issued further guidance to schools on the issue after concerns were raised by the NASUWT teaching union.He warned that such practices could play into issues around “vaccine hesitancy” and “slow down the system for everyone ”.In his speech to the conference, Dr Roach launched an attack on the Government over its handling of the pandemic and actions towards teachers.He said staff “must not be coerced into working yet longer hours or delivering summer schools” to deliver the Government’s short-term fixes.Dr Roach added: “Teachers’ commitment and resilience have already been tested to the limit. They don’t need more exhortation and empty words – they need action by Government which puts teachers first.”The challenges of the pandemic have thrown into sharp relief the inequalities that were already embedded in our societySir Keir StarmerHis comments came after the Education Secretary confirmed that a change to the summer holidays and longer school days are being considered as part of long-term recovery plans for pupils who have missed out on lessons.In his speech on Sunday, Dr Roach said: “Government needs to stop looking for quick fixes and grabbing media headlines – instead of catch-up, they need to catch on, catch on to the long-term damage inflicted by their own policies.“Catch on to the need for much greater investment in all those services that will provide the foundation for the education recovery that children and young people need.”He added: “If we are to aspire to have the best country for children to grow up in, we will need more than catch-up and recovery. We need a plan for education renewal. And, we want a recovery, a renewal, that’s teacher-led too.”On Sunday, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer told the NASUWT conference: “The challenges of the pandemic have thrown into sharp relief the inequalities that were already embedded in our society.“That is why there can be noto business as usual.”In a video message to delegates, Sir Keir said he knew “first-hand” that teachers had risen to the challenge as his children have been in school throughout the year due to his we being an NHS worker.He said: “Their teachers’ and all the school staff’s commitment and dedication has been nothing short of extraordinary. And I know that is the case in schools right across the country.”PAMost ReadYoung child knocked down in fatal Belfast crash Hijacked cars set on fire and police attacked in Newtownabbey rioting NI political leaders call for calm as  PSNI officers injured in Belfast rioting#Wanted him out a long time ago#: Carl Frampton#s we Christine reacts as tributes pour in on boxing hero#s retirementHeartbreak at death of well-known NI musicianTop VideosPlayPolice have been called to the scene of an ongoing riot in Newtownabbey\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news edc .ece AUTOCROP wh dabacbedeaea.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news edc .ece AUTOCROP wh dabacbedeaea.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news edc .ece AUTOCROP wh dabacbedeaea.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"PlayRioting erupts in the Sandy Row area of south BelfastPlayMan caught in petrol bomb flames as rioting in Northern Ireland continues into a second nightLatest UKIn Pictures: Spring sun shines for Easter SundayIT company’s Covid- passport app to be ready in MayBoris Johnson to outline plans for easing controls on foreign travelMercury to plummet overnight as Arctic winds bring end to sunny spellLatest from Belfast Leeds report losses of £.million as club ed to Premier LeagueRing announcer Michael Buffer praises Carl Frampton as fighter calls time on boxing careerIn Pictures: Spring sun shines for Easter SundaySeven-year-old girl killed in tragic west Belfast collision, police confirmDanny Ings s to inspire Southampton fightback win against Burnley,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The Redcastle hotel is located in the once proud and independent peninsula of Inishowen. The last of the Irish chieftains with whom this site is associated was Cahir ODoherty. Cahir became chieftain at the age of  in , after the death of his father, Sir John O Doherty. In order to secure his position, Cahir changed his family’s side in the Nine Year War year and swore loyalty to Queen Elizabeth, because of Inishowens important strategic location and the defeat of the Confederates at Kinsale in . googletag.cmd.push The war ended in . It resulted in the Flight of the Earls from Rathmullan in  and the Plantation of Ulster. Cahir thought his reward for his help and loyalty would be great. But apart from being knighted and acquiring the title Sir, he was to be disappointed. In frustration the -year-old chieftain rebelled in , sacking the English held city of Derry and burning it to the ground. He was killed shortly after this in the Battle of Kilmacrennan, just outside Letterkenny. Because of this rebellion King James I ordered the great walls of Derry to be built. After Cahir, the last Inishowen Chieftain, was killed, all his lands in Inishowen were seized by the James I for plantation and ided between The Established church and Arthur Chichester. The two separate entities that were then Inishowen and Tyrconnell were joined and made into one county. It was named Donegal. googletag.cmd.push The first house built on the site of the Redcastle hotel was built by the Carey family. The Cary family were landlords who received plantation lands from Moville to Muff. The family lived here from about  to , almost exactly  years. Unfortunately for the Careys, they had money problems and eventually were forced to sell the Redcastle house and Estate in . Thomas Doherty from Muff purchased the house from the Careys, but because of legal issues it took  years for them to complete the sale. The most famous of the Careys was Joyce Carey. Joyce Cary was listed in the top  writers in English by The Sunday Times. Some of his books were made into film. His son and grandson continued in the creative theme and were involved in TV series such as Dr Who and Captain Pugwash.     Thomas Doherty left the estate to his youngest daughter, Jane, who was married to Dr Richard Doherty, a lecturer in midwery in Queens University, Galway. Dr Richard Doherty died in  and his we Jane in . Richard converted to Catholicism late in his le and left the Redcastle estate to his daughter, Elizabeth and her husband Captain Ernest Cochrane, on the condition that the children be brought up as Catholics. The year before Elizabeth died she was in dispute with the local land league on the reduction of rents. Armed men were employed to secure her crops after locals refused to harvest them. They were unsuccessful at getting the crops harvested, but it is said they did get through quite an amount of Jameson whiskey and food. Captain Ernest Cochrane was the son of the famous and notorious Lord Thomas Cochrane, on which the films Master and Commander and Hornblower are based. Earnests famous bloodline does not end there as he is also a descendent of Robert the Bruce who actually invaded and occupied Northburg Castle in Greencastle for a short period. True love must have been very much in the air as the condition that Richard Doherty left for marriage and inheritance at this time would have been quite a diplomatic feat, given that Earnest was also the high sherf of Donegal. But they managed it. Captain Cochrane went to church in his Model T car. Reg number Hand Elizabeth and her children in their horse and carriage to Drung Chapel. To this day they are still separated, Earnest in a grand monument grave in front of the now derelict Church of Ireland Church in Redcastle. Elizabeth Francis with her children and her parents are interred at the alter area of the old Catholic Church, Drung. After the ious land acts that were introduced after , landlordism went into terminal decline. Lands were sold off and the large houses were either left to rot away or knocked down to avoid taxes on them. Redcastle House survived. Captain Earnest Cochrane died in  and Elizabeth Francis in . The Cochranes remained and turned their hand to farming and in the s opened the Redcastle House as an Hotel. The Cochranes sold Redcastle in  and the hotel is now once again back in the ownership of a Doherty.

There is not a girl woman anywhere who doesnt like a piece of jewellery or an aromatic fragrance. You could include a few men in that, too! Among them are two young Derry girls who love all things glittery and sparkly – and a nice fragrance – so much so, they have used their time during Covid- lockdown to start up their own fragrance business. Sisters Mia, , and Bella Doherty, , from Cornshell Fields in the Ballyarnett of the city, named their enterprise Jewelled Aroma by Mia Bella- a combination of their names – and after almost a year of research, trials and checking out regulations, they have their enterprise up and running. googletag.cmd.push At the minute, they are making wax melts of ious fragrances and shapes along with room sprays to match the wax melts smells. They are also currently looking into other products as well. Mia, who attends St Marys College, said they began researching soon after the Covid- restrictions were introduced in March last year. She added: “We undertook online courses in candle-making tohelp our wee idea become a reality. “We tried out dferenttypes of soya wax andfragrances with our family being thetesters, much to their delight for a goodfew months. “We wanted to be % happywith our product before we decidedthey were ready for purchase.So the launch of Jewelled Aroma by Mia Bella began last month. googletag.cmd.push “We are both currentlyusing our mum’s kitchen but she doesn’tmind as we clean up after ourselves and her house always smells solovely for her. “Also, by law, we have to follow certain regulations, so have to ensure CIP labels are made for every fragranceoil and then bepresently packaged. This can all take a lot of timebut we really love being creative and by adding glitter and colour and trying out dferent designs makes our wax melts stand out compared to others.Having nice packaging and how they are presented is very important to us “We make wax melts by melting soya wax and adding fragrancesoils and pour into moulds, although this sounds very straight forwardthere is temperature taking anda few step-by-step instructions that need to be adhered toin order to maintain a good quality product that will last.”     Despite the success and the enjoyment of making fragrances, Mia said she was looking forward to going back to school. “St Mary’sis a fantastic school and I love getting up to go to school every morning.” She admitted she was a bit concerned about how much catching up she will have to do but said she was sure the teachers would put everyone at ease when they were all back in the classroom. “We definitely missed schoola lot,especiallynot seeing our friends was dficult but starting this business has helpedkeep us occupied and easeanyboredom. “Learning our craft and keeping upwithschoolwork has made the wholeCovidsituation fly in for us. Weare so busy at the minutewith orders for delivery that our mum had to help out as well. She is able to help at the minute as her business is currently closed due toCovid- restric- tions.She was a great help at the start as she was able to guide us in the right direction - we have even roped dad into helping by doing the deliveries.” She added: “I hope we go back to normality as I like the hands on physical activities at school like technology and science experiments.” Bella, who ed to P at Steelstown Primary School on Monday last, said despite the enjoying of producing Jewelled Aroma by Mia Bella products, school work was her priority. “I was a bit nervous about ingto school but it was great. I have a new teacher and she is really lovely. It was great seeing all my friends as well. This is my last year in primary school so I am really happy to be getting backto see everyone before I have to make the transition to secondary school.” Bella said they had been inundated with very positive reviews for their range of products. “Everyone seems to love the product going by the lovely messages we receive.Customers wish us every success andfor more orders so this makes us very happy. “When we are back at school full-time and not able to commitour time as much to the business as school is the priority, my aunties are willing to help out to keep us well stocked up with our products. “The people in our cityand beyondhave been really supportive inshopping local, it feels good to know we’re doing something right.” The girls mother, Maria, is understandably so proud of her two girls, being the owner of Miabella beauty salon next to the car wash on Racecourse Road in Shantallow which has been closed for nine months of the past year. She said: “If there’s one thing I can take from lockdownis that I work too much and the girls missed me, so spending quality time and helping them out with their wax melts was amazing. I’ve learned so much from them and how much of a work ethicis instilled into them, “I am so proud of them both andhow they have juggled both school work and their newly established business. “They both are managing perfectly so farand I can go back to work and know they are perfectly capable of staying on top of orders. “As their mum, though, I will keep on top of the social mediato ensure their safety - their page is linked to my phone so I can keep them safe.” Maria conceded she has found lockdown extremely dficultat times. She added: “I really miss my clients, as a lot of them have become friends over the years. It’s always good to catch up with each other.I’m so looking forward to seeing each and every single one of them when I canalthough trying to fit everyone in will prove to be a dficult task. “Somehow, I’ll man- ageshould I work night and day to get you all beautied again.I don’t like to disappoint anyone when they look for appointments, my clients are lovely and are very understanding.” So Chanel, Jimmy Choo and Gucci, take note of the name - Jewelled Aroma by Mia Bella.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Wesley was born and reared in  Demesne, that terrace of houses overlooking what we still refer to as the “ New Road”, a terrace built a dozen years or so before the Londonderry Corporation initiated the post war creation of the Creggan Estate. Tragically, Wesley passed away alone at his home around January th.

In his early eighties and in spite of the pressures brought by Covid, Wesley still very much enjoyed a thread of conversation and a bit of craic. Before Covid, many’s a morning I’d see him heading down the green slope in front of Demesne to catch the Creggan bus into town. He’d shop a little at TESCO’s, walk over to the Central Library, linger a while there chatting with the regulars, then catch the Creggan bus back up to Demesne enjoying the roundabout route the bus would take, a roundabout that enabled further chat and craic. googletag.cmd.push Other mornings he ‘d head down to William Street Baths for a swim and a chat Simple but precious and le-giving routinesCovid inevitably restricted Wesley’s social le about the town but he rarely grumbled. “How you doing, Wesley ” “Never better” he might reply. Wesley was “separated” from his we of many years, Jean but that word “separated” can mean dferent things in dferent families. Wesley still referred to Jean as “the we”. They certainly remained friends, talked together on the phone and frequently holidayed together. On the morning of the funeral, beautully managed by Adair and Neely’s, a grieving Jean requested that the cortege drive from the Foyle Road up to Demesne and pause in front of the Colhoun family home.     The neighbours who had known Wesley for so many years more than myself came out onto the street to salute Wesley one last time and say a silent prayer. This was a touching, dignied and generous moment. When I first moved to Demesne in , Wesley was to the fore in making me feel welcome. He offered to fix the creaking gate in front of my house. That neighbourly act was typical of him and was the start of our friendship. In , his mother Ethel was still alive though elderly and in need of constant care. Wesley provided that daily care until Ethel passed away in . Caring was part of Wesley’s make-up. For years he had been a psychiatric nurse, first in Gransha and later in Scotland to where he and Jean had emigrated during the ’s. Together they raised four sons: Geoffrey, Andrew, Stephen and Greg. In , as part of the th anniversary celebrations of the Holy Child PS Wesley volunteered to come into the school and talk to the youngsters about growing up in Creggan before the estate was built, before there was a Holy Child’s School or a St Mary’s chapel. The children struggled some to imagine those wide open spaces that Wesley conjured up when he was a child in the late ’s and early ’s. One more recent night in Sandino’s, in the company of myself, singer-songwriter, Roy Arbuckle and our English friend Andy, he protested to the deejay about his choice of music, asking for a few dance tunes that were more “his era.” Of course we “slagged” him plenty about this. Now we have only the gt of that memory. Last Christmas morning, stood in our respective backyards, he and I had a socially distanced celebratory glass of whiskey, Jameson’s of course, and a wee mince pie and then on New Years Day, we had another glass of Jameson’s together. I did not know then that this would be our last drink together this side of the grave. Brian, Nicola and Sean had Wesley in with them for Christmas dinner in  Demesne. As we say here, he was “in good form.” Wesley was buried on Thursday th January in Altnagelvin Cemetery, Waterside. He wanted neither minister nor priest but he loved the psalm “The Lord is my shepherd” and had requested that one of his sons read that psalm by his graveside where he is now buried with Ethel and his father, Billy: “TheLordis my shepherd I shall not want. He maketh me to lie down in green pastures he leadeth me beside the still waters.” Wesley may you rest in peace. I still keep looking around expecting to see you, maybe out in your backyard re-filling your bird feed or heading down to your allotment, your “secret garden” from where you sometimes fetched rhubarb or daffodils for us your neighbours.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Just four weeks after manager Neil Lennons resignation, skipper Scott Brown heads for the Parkhead exit door. Whoever comes in as boss must find a new on-field general. In a -year spell, Brown played over  games for the Glasgow giants, won  league titles and a dozen domestic cups. More than that, he was their heartbeat. Celtic legend Scott Brown.  The road to success is a rocky one and any team navigating such a path needs, among other things, a tough underbelly. Silky skills, lucky. craft, tactics and enough magical players to turn games on their head, any team looking to win trophies need them. But they need leaders too. Without a spine, everything  can horribly fall apart. googletag.cmd.push Having a manager the players believe in and are inspired by is an important ingredient. When the game begins, bar some cajoling from the sideline or a vital switch, the players have to deliver. Thats irrelevantyou dont have a group of players who will commit to the cause. The team with the most leaders, more often than not, will be left standing when the rest have fallen. By a leader, it isnt always the actual captain, though it is important to select well. Managers will suss out their squad. Who wont be under pressure to retain their place  Who wont go AWOL in mid-season  Who will the players follow into battle  googletag.cmd.push It wont necessarily be the person who delivers the killer speech, but someone who would put their head where others wouldnt put a shovel. Or someone who, when the chips are down, who will want the ball. One point up, one point down or staring at a hammering straight in the face. There will be a maverick in the equation, but depending on how unpredictable they are, its unlikely theyll wear the captains armband. This time last year, Netflix unfurled The Last Dance on us and a Chicago Bulls team that included Dennis Rodman. He was colourful in every way. From his fancy hairdos to his fashion and party lestyle. Youd never make him captain, but put him into the white heat of a ball game, he always delivered.     When they dont meet the manager half-way, it is time to cut them loose. But, again,the chemistry is right in the team and a desire to succeed, everyone  will pull them into line. The mavericks way of leading would be to slam the ball in the back of the net to turn a game on its head. Its just a pity Derry werent able to fully manage Eoin Skinner Bradley and channel all he had to offer. That type of magic to strike fear into teams. Every team has an assortment of dferent characters, fusing them altogether is the secret. Like Phil Jackson did with Rodman. Its not easy balancing everything, butit was everyone would be doing it. On the outskirts of any accommodation of a Skinner or a Rodman, there is the core of a team. The leaders that will define it. God rest my primary school teacher Maire Trolan – a real lady – I always remember her telling us about empty vessels making the most sound. The same can be said of a player. Those spoofing around a changing room, buttheir team isnt in control are nowhere to be seen. These types of iniduals are ten a penny. In the games melting pot where tackles need made and breaking balls are there to be hoovered up. A  metre run, despite being second favourite to win possession. Those who deliver in such cases, when the pressure is on, are what I call a championship player. When I think of the scenario, Patsy Bradley comes into my mind. Risking le and limb for the good of the team. He might never say much, but would never ask someone to do what he is not prepared to do himself. And with that comes a respect. Cast the mind back to the Ballinderry team who dominated the senior championship, with seven titles in  years. They are currently in transition, with some of their young guns lighting up the championship last season. Patsy Bradley closes in on Kevin McGuckin  Think of what they lost. Two of the greatest they ever produced, Enda Muldoon and Conleith Gilligan, hung up their boots around the same time. Mickey C Conlan departed the scene, with Kevin McGuckin – their last link with the  All-Ireland team - retiring over the winter . You dont find that type of collective class and experience in a lucky bag. Thats where underage coaching needs to take an important focus in allowing an environment for leaders to blossom. Teaching the skills is of paramount importance, to instil the correct habits from early on. After that, players can begin to play at a faster pace and in games under contact. As well as promoting a use of both sides, coaches need to allow players to take a lead in games. And to openly encourage it. Chatting to Philip Kerr a few weeks back, he was outlining Derrys Games Development Committees focus on getting coaches to observe and let their players...well, just let them play. It promotes communication and an onus to work things out. At the end of the day, when gardens, streets and back fields were a hive of activity and a flurry of games, there were no coaches or referees. It was survival of the fittest and fastest. Philip pointed to the concern of one dominant player being allowed to dictate to his quieter team mates on how the practice games would be played. This type of scenario needs to be managed. Everyone needs the chance to grow as a player and a decision maker. Players managed under a barrage of instruction wont need to think for themselves. When your team is a point down and the fourth official signals two minutes of added time, thats when championships are won and lost. Thats the time for fire in the belly, but an ice-cool persona. For someone youd trust with your bottom dollar. If your team is littered with such players, chances are youll eke out an equaliser and maybe even a winner. While those with the soft underbelly can contrive to grab defeat from the jaws of victory. Celtics new manager will have to choose wisely to replace Scott Brown as captain. Picking the skipper deserves thought. If there are plenty to choose from, its almost irrelevant who wears the armband. They will be like the manager, a facilitator, just a link in the chain.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The decision, taken at a full council meeting last week, came after the council had written to NIAS raising concern over how long constituents were waiting for emergency response. Councillors agreed to facilitate a meeting between representatives and the NIAS to resolve the issue. “They themselves felt the issue with putting numbers at the end of lanes was vital to them, and I would encourage that,” said Cllr Trevor Wilson. “They too are happy to meet us to discuss ambulance services within the district and I propose we take them up on that offer.” googletag.cmd.push  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The shutting of the outlet at Lisnagelvin Shopping Centre is one of  stores earmarked for closure across Scotland, Northern Ireland and the North East of England. The companys other store in the city at Foyleside Shopping Centre on the cityside is to remain open. The closures have been prompted by ongoing challenges to high street trading, which have been exacerbated by the Covid- pandemic. Semichem, which is owned by community retailer Scotmid Co-operative, said it was in talks with landlords in several locations and would make a final decision on a small number of the  stores in the coming months. googletag.cmd.push A total of  Semichem staff have now entered a formal consultation process. Management at Scotmid Co-operative, owners of Semichem, said they were exploring opportunities to redeploy as many as possible within its wider business. Karen Scott, head of Semichem, said: “The high street was already struggling to adapt to the pace of change in shopping habits, including out-of-town developments and the rise of internet shopping. That change has undoubtedly been accelerated by the Covid- pandemic. Sadly, we have reached the point where it is no longer viable to keep some of our stores open. “We are grateful for both Scotmid and subsequent government sup- port, which has undoubtedly prolonged the le of many stores.

The  year-old lock came off the bench in the Boston clubs - win over the Houston Sabercats last Saturday. McCusker, a former Ulster underage player, began his sporting career playing Gaelic football with Magherafelt ODonovan Rossa before opting to pursue rugby with Rainey Old Boys. On opening day, the Free Jacks fell to a - defeat to star-studded LA Giltinis side, in the iconic Los Angeles Olympic Stadium, one that included Adam Ashley-Cooper, Dave Dennis and Matt Giteau among  Wallabies and Canadian international DTH van der Merwe. McCusker won a line-out that led to the Free Jacks final try of the game. googletag.cmd.push “It was a pretty big win so its all good,” McCusker told the County Derry Post of his  minutes of action in Saturdays victory in Texas. “We can still play better, there were a couple of things we didnt take care of, but it shows glimpses of what we can do. I think we will do well in  and try and get our hands on the MLR Shield.” He was happy with his own performance, feeling he was pretty dominant when carrying the ball, winning line-outs, was involved in mauls and made a few tackles. “I was busy with the time I got in the second half,” he added. googletag.cmd.push Both their pre-season warm-up games fell through leaving the Free Jacks on the back foot going into their first season, their first of the new league after  was declared void due to the Covid- pandemic. “The way I looked at it, was that we didnt have any game time and we still managed to score  points on them ,” McCusker points out. “There was room for improvement and we showed that we could be dangerous.” After taking care of some of the smaller details from their defeat, we focussed on their own inidual roles and attacking the Houston breakdown, it left them primed for Saturdays encounter.     “It was a sharpening of the steel, so we were hissing coming into the weekend,” McCusker added. “Physically they couldnt match us up front and then our backs were lethal. We were a doubled edged sword. We were confident with what we had, we just had to pull it off and we did.” McCusker holds dual nationality. His mother Carol is a native of Jenkintown Philadelphia, his oldest brother Philip now lives in Boston and his younger brother is pondering over a move to the Free Jacks next year after finishing university. “I started off playingfor ODonovan Rossa, thats where I got my motor skills, catching and kicking,” Ronan said of his early days. “I wasnt too bad, but rugby suited me better with all the the physical stuff and I was starting to stretch out a bit,” After playing at U, U and U level for Ulster, he ed to play for Rainey while he completed his Building Surveying Degree at Ulster University. “Thats where you learn a thing or two about rugby as you come into the senior side of the game,” he said of his time with Rainey. “Thats where I got hardened up and learned the game.” Ronan made enquiries about joining Boston club Mystic River and playing club rugby while working part-time. “Thats when the ball started rolling,” he adds. “Alex Maglebygot in contact askingI wanted to try out with Free Jacks who were forming. McCusker played in their first ever game against the Ontario Arrows and later signed a two-year deal with the Free Jacks. “After Christmas , I flew out here and it was supposed to be our first season with the MLR, but it was cancelled after five games,” he said. At home, he went into quarantine, he trained and played with Rainey until the season back home came to a halt after the second lockdown last autumn. “I was already in a good place, stayed on top of things and flew out here in January for pre-season,” McCusker added. “Ryan Martinis the best coach I have had, I have learned so much so far and I am learning every day from him at training. He pushed everyone to learn and be better. He has high expectations of everyone.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

It has been almost two weeks since the loss at Longford, the manner of which was surprising and disconcerting to watching City fans, who are hoping that a repeat of last season is not on the cards. Having had a fortnight to get ready, the City players are extremely focused on one thing - making up for the defeat at Longford as the first home game of the season approaches. googletag.cmd.push The disappointment that the fans felt on March  has not been ignored by those representing the club. “I think the while team and the management was quite disappointed with our showing against Longford,” Fitzgerald said. “It’s always going to be dficult in the first game of the season against a newly-promoted team. They came flying out of the blocks and they came with a lot of nervous energy and we just weren’t able to kill that in the first - minutes. “As soon as we thought we were playing our way into it, they managed to ride the wave until the th minute, and they got two good goals in fairness. googletag.cmd.push We’ve just been on the training ground in the last  days working hard and we’re really looking forward to putting that result right now on Saturday against Waterford and showing the fans what we really can do.” Preparations Former Waterford player Fitzgerald admits to being surprised that City struggle don day one, especially after a pre-season od positivity and progress. “I think it was a surprise becauseyou look at all our pre-season games, we really did see a wide iety of what League of Ireland football is all about in terms of Finn Harps, who can go long or play physical, Bohs who like to play through the thirds, Bray who are playing good football at the minute, and Shamrock Rovers ‘B’ who have a young group of talent coming through.     “We really were optimistic about the results and I think it was a bit of a kick in the teeth when the result didn’t go our way against Longford because we were very confident going into it. We knew that Daire Doyle would have his Longford side ready, but we also knew that we would be ready, but it just didn’t go our way.” City are already playing catch up because of their enforced break last week, but Fitzgerald believes that could be a blessing in disguise as it has given the team extra time to gel together ahead of a busy schedule. “It’s been very beneficial,” he stated. “We’ve been on the training ground almost every day for the last two weeks, really working hard and getting the kind of foundations of the way we want to play and the way Decky wants to play. He really impressed upon us that he wants to make the Brandywell a fortress this season, so that when teams step off the bus, they know they are going to be in for a real battle and they can’t take anything for granted against us. “Our full focus is to get our first three points on the board Saturday. There is still a long way to go,  rounds left until the end of the season so I wouldn’t be pushing the panic button just yet. We are going to come ready on Saturday and really give everything we’ve got to get the three points.” Pressure Waterford come to the Brandywell under a bit of pressure themselves after losing their opening two games, but former Blue Fitzgerald believes they will improve signicantly over the coming weeks. “They are a still a relatively unknown quantity,” he said. “Kevin Sheedy came out after the game against Sligo and said they still have one or two boys in quarantine so it will be interesting to seehe will integrate them into the starting eleven. They are a young side so they are going to grow in confidence as the weeks go on, andyou have Brian and Daryl Murphy in your squad, they will be quietly confident in any game they play.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

It is a first win in three for Kevin Sheedy’s team, while it is yet more misery for Declan Devine and his team who have lost both games this season so far, despite a dominant performance here at home.

Waterford were proving vulnerable down that left side and City won another free kick in a dangerous position and Patching again delivered another dangerous ball. This time it paid idends as it found Cameron McJannett completely free in front of goal and he couldn’t miss as he fired in his first Derry City goal. The game swung Waterford’s way yet again on  minutes when Gartside fouled James Waite in the area, giving referee Rob Harvey an easy decision in pointing to the spot.

These affinities were formed all across the globe, from as far away as India, Sri Lanka, Australia and across the island of Ireland.ldquoItrsquos hard to believe that I am  years going to the Meadow at Dundrum Cricket Club and I still get a buzz when going through the new gates, says Jeff.ldquoI can still remember playing in the winning side in the Downshire Cup final at the best new ground in the Northern Cricket Union at Strangford Road in Downpatrick.Jeffrsquos Dundrum side defeated Downpatrick Cricket Club, with his brother Noel scoring  odd to defeat a strong home side that featured superb players, including Alfie Linehan, Noel Ferguson and Jim Patterson, who all played for Ireland, Alfiersquos brother, Hugh, who Jeff believes should have been capped, and superb all rounder Brian Ferris.Jeff reminisces fondly of that game. ldquoI got to play in front of a decent crowd alongside two of the best club players our village ever produced, one being my brother Noel and the other being Alan Neill. I remember going to bed a little tipsy, the true version would not be believed long before the snowflake culture.Jeff proudly captained the first team for seven seasons, winning back-to-back McGready Cup finals at Dundrum after beating North West Cricket Union teams Bonds Glen and The Nedd.ldquoBoth games had a fantastic atmosphere. They brought a full  seater bus packed with refreshments and both teams stayed long into the night at the Bay Inn as they enjoyed the village hospitality.However, there were hard times for Dundrum as Jeff recalls a second arson attack against the club  years ago.ldquoIt simply showed the fighting character of the committee and members. I wrote lots of begging letters and phone calls for help, he recalled.ldquoI got a massive shock when I received a cheque made out to myself for pound, from the Foundation of Sports and Arts. I give special thanks to former Australian player James Burston for his input.The club received a further pound, from Down District Council and used local firm Seamus Walsh and Sons to build the excellent present pavilion at the cost of pound,, signying the start of rebuilding the club in every aspect.Paying homage to the clubrsquos ground staff who Jeff calls ldquothe real stalwarts, he gives praise to Tommy Curlett , who has looked after the square for over  years. Over the last decade, Tommyrsquos brother, Jack, has also been assisting, with Jeff mentioning Jack as ldquoone of the clubrsquos best ever all rounders.Jeff also applauded two more Curlett brothers, Bobby and Jim, who built the superb new electric score box free of charge.Also earning praise is new treasurer Stephen Calvert, who Jeff describes as the ldquodriving force behind the scenes, displaying fantastic forward thinking and planning everything down to the last detail.He continued: ldquoStephen now prepares the wickets, and I have never seen a harder worker in my le. From clearing the banks to planting the hedges and securing grants, he is a very tight treasurer that all clubs need.Not only a celebrated player, it is clear that Jeff has became an influential figure at the Dundrum club.Twelve years ago the club backed his request to employ the first of many successful overseas coaches, Sri Lankan Manoj Fernando.ldquoIt is the main reason the club isthriving, he said. ldquoThe junior section has been very successful with six of the players now playing for the first team and many more playing for the seconds and thirds.ldquoThe juniors have been on tour to Scotland three times, whilst also going to Telford. There is another good crop of kids coming through.Alongside his achievements on the field, Jeff nods kindly to the accolade he received in  when he was presented with the Jim McMorran Waterford Crystal Bowl for voluntary services to cricket from the Northern Cricket Union.ldquoFor my th birthday, I ran a fundraising soft ball fun match and barbecue, which raised pound, towards new set covers. I will remember as much due to the coverage legendary reporter David Holmes gave me on social media.All good things must come to an end as Jeff recalls two operations in  which forced his thoughts on retirement.Jeff decided to run a fundraiser inviting players from dferent clubs to attend. ldquoAs a thank you to a sport that has given me something that money could never buy, I ran two T games with refreshments and a raffle. I could not believe we raised pound, towards a new electric scorebox.ldquoIt was a very emotional day for me as I wandered around the ground with my grandson James. I was amazed at the decent crowd as I bowled the first ball and walked off to enjoy the day. But deep down, it hurt that I could not play.Jeff will be holding his last ever fundraiser this July, with the money going towards new enclosed two bay practice nets. He is set to organise two T games with added barbecue and refreshments as a final swansong to his beloved cricket.ldquoThe game of cricket has been a massive part of my le,  not out and burn the whites declared Jeff.He does, however, look eagerly ahead to the new season, which is planned to start the first week in May.ldquoItrsquos a testament to all the hard work at the club that it can now field three senior teams, with captain James Martin leading a very decent side for the new season. They can, no doubt, be very competitive.Looking to the future, he added: ldquoThe club is also excited about new coach Dan Kearsley, who begins his position after Easter and will be at Shimna Integrated College every Thursday.ldquoThe club is committed to attracting new young boys and girls to the great game of cricket..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/31Mar2021-Conor.jpg","title":"Conor keeps in contention for number one position  ","story":"DOWNPATRICK goalkeeper Conor Hazard gave a very impressive display on his Windsor Park debut for Northern Ireland on Sunday evening.Hazard made a number of fine saves throughout the friendly match, but was unable to stop his side losing -

Itrsquos a point that anglers disagree with.DERA explained the work on the banks of the river created two dedicated disabled parking spaces in the car park where previously there had been none and that it is not satisfactory for disabled anglers to make their way to access current angling facilities located away from the car park.A spokesman for Downpatrick anglers said they are pleased that consideration is now being given to providing two new dedicated disabled fishing stands.ldquoWe welcome DAERArsquos confirmation that officials are also keen to meet with us to discuss our concerns which is an important step forward, he said.ldquoThe fact that the rights of disabled anglers at the Quoile River are now being recognised is also a welcome step forward. Redeveloping the car park and providing disabled parking spaces but no area for those with mobility issues to fish from was an error which now looks as though it is going to be rectied.The spokesman said he hopes that DAERA will also inform Newry, Mourne and Down Council about the plan to now provide disabled fishing stands at the riverbank car park.ldquoWe would hope councillors are informed via email or letter so there is a record of the commitment to carry out this work, he said.ldquoMoving forward, we believe that there is a need for DAERA and the Environment Agency to join forces to develop a training programme for their respective staff on how to handle the needs of disabled anglers in particular.The spokesman said lessons need to be learned from the Quoile River debacle and hopes that everyone involved can now move forward in partnership.ldquoDisabled anglers have been stopped coming to the river to fish for over a year since work to redevelop the car park got underway. Had the needs of disabled anglers been uppermost in the minds of government officials at the planning stage, it would not have taken  months to reach the point we are now thankfully at, he said.ldquoEveryone associated with Downpatrick Anglers is looking forward to seeing the new fishing stands in place soon and the welcomeof disabled anglers. They are part and parcel of the fishing community and must enjoy equal rights when it comes to their support.The spokesman added: ldquoAs we have always said, fishing is very therapeutic and we would strongly argue that the provision of new disabled angling stands on the banks of the Quoile should be a priority and will be of tremendous benefit..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/31Mar2021-Shirley.jpg","title":"Fountain Foodbank thanks public for help in lockdown  ","story":"THE Fountain Foodbank is continuing with its vital role in supporting families across the district.A year after going into lockdown, the cross-community organisation based in Downpatrick mdash staffed by committed volunteers mdash continues to meet a pressing need.In its latest newsletter, the foodbank says it continues to be extremely well supported by local people and organisations and that every penny it receives makes a dference.Shirley Lennon, the foodbankrsquos co-ordinator, has revealed that decisions regarding how the organisation could operate during a global pandemic had to be made quickly to deal with the evolving situation and continually revised as time moved on.She explained that initially, the foodbank operated a lsquodrive-thrursquo service which soon had to be replaced with a delivery service for the first period of lockdown.ldquoWe were grateful to many younger people who helped with both the packing and delivery of these parcels.

with other primaries in an effort to improve facilities for local children.Crossgar and Derryboy Primary Schools and Academy and Ballycloughan primaries in Saintfield are expected to develop close partnerships as part of the collaborative scheme launched by the South Eastern Education and Library Board.Although negotiations are in the early stages, it is expected that all four schools will give the project the green light.SEELB senior education officer, Mr Stanton Sloan, said the scheme was a ldquoimaginative way of pooling resources and a real alternative to amalgamation which was sometimes a choice for small rural schools.Outlining the scheme as a ldquoinnovative way to use resources, Mr Sloan said it had already been successfully implemented in other parts of the United Kingdom.CASTLEWELLAN mdash Local teenagers have once again proven their charitable ability by volunteering to take part in a rigorous programme to help the poor in Romania.Members of staff at St

These workers are not using buses or cars and it is good financially that they donrsquot have to pay for car parking or fuel. And for Downpatrick, there will be dozens more people on the streets in the town, bring lots of benefits.Mr McGrath also acknowledged that the move towards regional hubs could result in empty office space in and around Belfast where a huge number of civl servants were traditionally based.ldquoThatrsquos the challenge mdash to repurpose those buildings mdash but we certainly cannot have vacant government buildings in the city centre being held on to for five,  or  years, he continued.The local MLA also believes that moving civil servants away from Belfast could provide an economic spin-offs for towns like Downpatrick.He added: ldquoIrsquom a fan of decentralisation in the public sector. It guarantees footfall in regional towns and that brings fairness to the rate and taxpayer. They get the benefits of having a workforce near them, especially the hospitality and retail businesses.ldquoIf you have  or  civil servants there they will spend a certain amount of money every week in those businesses while the city centre has a dferent product it can sell to attract those people at weekends.Developing Rathkeltair House as a regional jobs hub has been welcomed by a number of local politicians who say that the opportunity to combine working from home with the traditional office experience, enables civil servants to have a much more attractive work le balance as part of the Covid- recovery.Downpatrick councillor Dermot Curran said he was delighted that Rathkeltair House was one of several new regional civil servant job hubs which will allow public sector staff to work closer from home.ldquoThere are many people who travel from the Downpatrick area each day to Belfast and by reducing this number to allow them to work locally can produce a benefit for local businesses which is timely given the current climate, he said.ldquoThe Downshire Civic Centre is already a public sector hub and perhaps additional civil service jobs could be redeployed there in the

pound.m investment that will create  new jobs.A development proposal for a vacant corner site lodged at the start of the month is seeking full permission to develop a new petrol station featuring eight pumps, convenience shop with deli counter, canopy and underground storage tanks.The proposal also features three electric vehicle charging points, car parking for  vehicles, a jet wash, play area, landscaping and site and access works.Planning papers confirm that the site will be accessed off the Magheraknock Road with the proposed development offering over  car parking spaces, four of which will be reserved for disabled drivers and another two for mothers and toddlers.The papers say that due to the ldquomodest scale of the development and low numbers of cars generated, it is not anticipated that the development will have any detrimental impact on noise and air quality of the surrounding environment.Planning permission for a filling station, shop and car wash was previously granted for the development site in , with the planning papers outlining the proposed play area will be located at the south western boundary of the site and lead to a new pedestrian connection from the site to an existing footpath along the Ballynahinch Road.This has been designed to allow children within surrounding residential developments to use the play equipment.The planning papers say previous planning permission for  square metres of retail space is insufficient to meet the needs of the local neighbourhood which is devoid of local retail provision.ldquoThe application represents an opportunity to redesign the layout to provide a modern style of development on a prominent site at the corner of the Magheraknock Road and Ballynahinch Road which will provide a convenient roadside facility for surrounding rural settlements and a local conveniencefor the immediate residential context, the papers continue.ldquoThe design and layout of the proposal is not uncharacteristic of that of a typical roadside facility and has been designed to to take full cognisance of the sitersquos constraints and to ensure there are limited negative amenity impacts on surrounding residential receptors.A needs assessment document submitted as part of the planning application argues that the area around the proposed development site ldquolacks a local neighbourhood facility to serve existing developments and those that will be developed in the future.In addition, the assessment argues that the proposal will have a ldquonegligible impact on like-for-like development within the catchment and convenience operators in Ballynahinch town centre.The assessment said it has demonstrated that there is a clear quantitative and qualitative need for the proposal to provide a much-needed service station and neighbourhood facility to serve the locality and wider rural

bulldozed.Included in the ambitious development plan are a range of new sports facilities which we will be shared with the Newcastle community.The new school proposal is being supported by the Department for Education and Integrated Education Fund with principal, Kevin Lambe, delighted that formal planning approval will be rubber-stamped by local councillors next week.Mr Lambe says the entire Shimna community is delighted that planning permission will go ahead for ldquoour wonderful new building.He said everyone was ldquoextremely excited that work on the new school will begin in the autumn term and that the new Year  students joining Shimna this September will be able to look forward to sitting their GCSEs and A levels in a purpose built, state-of-the art building.ldquoOf course, we have always been very proud of our current, semi-permanent building, which was begun in  mdash financed by parents on a bank loan mdash and which has grown with us through  years, Mr Lambe continued.ldquoIt will, in many ways, be a sad day to see that building come down. However, important though excellent facilities are, the core of a school is the student, staff, parent and governor body and they deserve a new building to match the commitment, enthusiasm and of course the Integrated ethos which drives this school.Mr Lambe thanked the Department of Education and the technical team behind the new school for the energy and creativity they have brought to the project.He also extended gratitude to Newry, Mourne and Down Council for addressing the schoolrsquos application for planning permission.Mr Lambe added: ldquoWe are particularly excited that the sports facilities for the new school will be shared with our local community and all the community partners who already meet in Shimna.Shimna College currently shares its sports halls, grounds and main building with a number of local groups and in  celebrated its th anniversary with its need for new accommodation one of a number of projects earmarked for financial support in the Fresh Start Agreement.The hugely successful integrated college opened in September  with just  pupils, but has since grown to become of Northern Irelandrsquos leading schools.However, the current school does not meet its needs or the standards specied in the current Department of Education Secondary School handbook.In February , education officials approved a development proposal to redevelop the integrated college to deliver a modern, post-primary school capable of accommodating the increased demand for integrated education in the area.The planning papers due to be formally approved next week outline a proposal to build ultra-modern accommodation to the east of the current school, with new sports accommodation extending to the west, encompassing part of the footprint of the existing school.A new single storey sports suite will extend from the schoolrsquos northwestern elevation of the new buildings and includes a hall, gym, fitness area and ancillary accommodation with the main school building intentionally designed to allow Shimna College to continue operating during construction work on the new-build.It is understood that phase one will focus on the construction of the main school building, excluding the proposed new sports provision.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThe road would link Sycamore Cross on the A with Junction  of the M. A -week public consultation last year raised concerns about the impact on the environment and local communities.Responding to those concerns, the Vale of Glamorgan council has now said transport planners must analyse further how the road would fit in with the new context of Covid- and the climate emergency.In a report to the councilrsquos cabinet, which meets on Monday, March , detailed responses were given to the main concerns raised in the consultation. The cabinet will be asked to approve further analysis, before moving on to writing up a full business case for the road.The case for the road is to improve transport across the region, including to Cardf Airport, St Athanrsquos Enterprise Zone, and new housing developments. It would likely cost around pound million to build, and is dependent on funding from the Welsh Government.However, the proposals have drawn criticism from villagers in Pendoylan whose houses would be knocked down, cyclists using country lanes which could be blocked off, and Coed Cymru which has warned ancient woodland would be felled to make way for the road.Two options for the new road were consulted on: one to the east of Pendoylan and one to the west. The report revealed transport planners are edging towards the western route, as it is better value for money than the eastern one.As well as suggesting further analysis, the cabinet report addressed the main concerns including the impact on the climate, environment, walkers and cyclists, and uncertain future of the financially struggling Cardf Airport.On cycling, the new road would include a segregated lsquoactive travel routersquo for cyclists and walkers, the report said. Country lanes blocked off could have bridges or underpasses for walkers and cyclists to cross the new road.     MORE NEWS:The report said: ldquoThere is currently poor infrastructure and local connectivity by walking and cycling through the study area, and there is potential to implement new cycle connections. An active travel route is an integral component of the concept options.ldquoShould a preferred option progress to the next stage of assessment and a need to block the lanes confirmed, access for non-motorised users to safely cross under or over the bypass would be accommodated as part of the design.On climate change, campaigners raised concerns a new road would increase private car journeys and carbon emissions.Both the Welsh Government and the Vale council declared a climate emergency in , pledging to reduce carbon emissions in an effort to prevent catastrophic increases in global temperatures.A big part of the plan to reduce emissions in Wales is changing how people travel: fewer journeys in private cars and more by walking, cycling and in public transport.The report said further analysis would include a lsquocarbon assessment and climate resiliencersquo report, and would explore how to reduce the carbon impact of the road.It did not mention what these methods could include.Several areas of ancient woodland would have ldquovery large adverse impacts according to the report. But further assessment would examine the exact effects of the loss of that woodland.The report said: ldquoThe environmental assessment would examine the loss of woodland in terms of its use in flood retention, water quality, social value, carbon capture, landscape value and cultural heritage value, as well as its value to bioersity.If the ldquovery large adverse impacts canrsquot be avoided by redesigning the road, new trees could be planted where to compensate for the loss of ancient woodland.This would include moving and replanting some of the old trees and soil.The next stage would also include a wider, detailed environmental impact assessment, and recommendations on how to mitigate potential impacts on the environment surrounding the proposed road.Another concern raised has been the uncertain future of Cardf Airport, which was recently bailed out by the Welsh Government with a pound. million grant.But transport planners pointed to plans to make it easier to get to the airport on foot, by bike, bus, train, and in private motor vehicles.The cabinet report said: ldquoWhile recognising that the basis of future studies would increasingly need to consider the emerging trends and patterns resulting from Covid-, it is understood that the long-term vision of the airport remains at this present time.Responding to the report, campaigners have renewed calls for the Vale council to scrap the plans for the road altogether.A spokesperson for Vale Communities for Future Generations said: ldquoWhy the Vale of Glamorgan council is persisting in wasting public money on keeping this outdated road plan alive is hard to understand. The sheer volume of recent objections to the proposal clearly indicates the public has other priorities.ldquoThe original  Vale council assumption was that the road was needed for better vehicle access to Cardf Airport mdash which was denied by the airport management.ldquoSince then the airportrsquos passenger numbers have shrunk, millions of pounds of public money has been spent by the Welsh Government on propping it up financially and the future of air travel globally is uncertain post Covid  pandemic.ldquoThese are hardly the circumstances under which to continue promoting an expensive and environmentally destructive road building plan that was developed before the Vale of Glamorgan council and the Welsh Government declared a climate emergency in .ldquoIt is time for this plan to be recognised as a prime example of outdated thinking, and finally scrapped so that Vale of Glamorgan council can prioritise spending on environmentally sound projects. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

One year on, what does the data tell us about how Covid- has hit the Vale of Glamorgan Cases and deathsSince the early days of the pandemic, we have been provided with regular updates on the number of new positive cases and, sadly, reported deaths.Inthe Vale of Glamorgan, , people had tested positivefor Covid- by the morning of March , Public Health England data shows.According to the Office for National Statistics,  deaths involving the viruswere provisionally registeredin the areaup to March .Of those,  occurred in hospitals, while there were  deaths in care homes and  at private homes.A further six deaths occurred in hospices, other community establishments or where.It means deaths which happened outside hospital settings accounted for % of the overall toll.Health experts have repeatedly said \"excess deaths\" ndash the number of deaths above the annual expected numberndashare a better measure of the overall impact of the coronavirus pandemic than simply looking at mortality directly linked to Covid-.ONS figures on this show that , people died of all causes inthe Vale of Glamorgan between March  and February ndash the latest available data.That was % above the , deaths which occurred over the same period a year earlier.The labour marketAs well as being the biggest health crisis in decades, the coronavirus pandemic has also brought rapid change to the UKs jobs market.Unemployment rates have surged along with a rise in job uncertainty, and many more people are seeking support from unemployment benefits.     One of the defining elements of the Governments response to the spread of Covid- was the launch of emergency income support schemes to protect jobs.Back in March last year, Chancellor Rishi Sunak announced the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme, or \"furlough\" scheme, to help firms struggling with the impact of the virus.By the end of May, just two months later, businesses had already put around , employments on furlough in the Vale of Glamorgan.At the same time, people in the area had made roughly , claims made under the separate Self-Employment Income Support Scheme.MORE NEWS:In January, , jobs were on furlough in the Vale of Glamorgan, with , reliant on the SEISS scheme.ONS figures show that in early March last year, ,people in the Vale of Glamorgan were claiming out-of-work benefits.By mid-January, that figure had risen nearly double to ,.The figures include those aged  to  on Jobseekerrsquos Allowance and some Universal Credit claimants, who are unemployed and seeking work or employed but with low earnings.The ONS has regularly cautioned that changes to Universal Credit in response to the virus mean more people can get the benefits while still being employed, which mean the figures cant be used to measure unemployment on a local basis.It also said a small number of people who can claim both JSA and UC could be counted twice.What about house prices The property market has also felt the impact of the pandemic, withthe average UK house price rising to a record pound, at the end of last year.The ONS saidGovernment support schemes, particularly the stamp duty holiday, may be a factor behind the national rise.But not everywhere saw a growth in house prices, however.Inthe Vale of Glamorgan, the average cost of a property was pound, in February, just before the Covid- crisis hit, according toLand Registry figures.By December, that had fallen to pound,ndasha decrease of less than .%.VaccinationsAfter an extremely dficult year for many of us, the vaccine rollout is providing a glimmer of hope for a le not bound by restrictions.Public Health Wales data shows , people in the Vale of Glamorgan and Cardf had received their first dose of a Covid- vaccine by March .More than  million people across the UK have had their first jab. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

That passing trade is something we rely on, and wersquore blessed to be in a great location.ldquoThe problem is, when people have a drink they forget about social distancing.\"Asked what he thinks of the latest changes, he said: ldquoItrsquos so important we try and get open outdoors as quickly as we can, more so for people in more remote areas where people are unlikely to drop by for a takeaway.     ldquoFor the good of the industry we need the beer gardens to open as soon as possible. I canrsquot see any reason why that wouldnrsquot be being spoken about now.ldquoPerhaps therersquos something we donrsquot know. If that is the case, then come out and say it because none of us want a third wave ndash that would kill businesses. The critical thing is we can have an uninterrupted summer.Is he expecting the high numbers some of his customers are predicting this weekend ldquoYes, probably ndash there has been a buzz since they let people travel locally, so Irsquod expect another rise in numbers again.ldquoWe need to be careful for our residents. We are a public service and we donrsquot want to cause trouble. Traders have got to remember that.Residents and friends Tracey Scott and Debra Cooper have enjoyed visiting the unusually quiet beach at weekdays through the pandemic, but said they will avoid the seafront this weekend.ldquoI hope people continue to be weary, Ms Scott, who lives alone at her home in Llandough, said. ldquoBut it seems to me recently people have stopped social distancing as much.ldquoI come here with friends and family sometimes three times a week, but I have to avoid it on weekends now.ldquoThere are just hordes of people not keeping to social distancing rules. Itrsquos a great shame.ldquoI walked with my mother here not long ago and was being bumped into by people. I canrsquot put myself at risk, and I canrsquot put others at risk.ldquoItrsquos so dficult because I live alone and I keep away from people Irsquod very much like to hug. Then someone comes and brushes past me. I know it sounds odd, but you do feel almost violated when that happens.ldquoItrsquos dficult, because I really do want the businesses to thrive here and I would like to support them on the weekends.ldquoMy message to people would be lsquogive it time, and letrsquos play it safe ndash donrsquot all rush at oncersquo.Ms Scottrsquos son and his partner, in their twenties, are also avoiding weekend trips to the seafront due to her son having asthma.Ms Cooper said: ldquoFor months now Irsquove only gone out in the week because it gets so busy. Itrsquos strange ndash the nice weather comes and the residents keep out the way.Hugh Pickford, who owns Pickfordrsquos Gallery and Bar With Rooms on the seafront, says he feels for residents, and itrsquos become dficult for traders to police overcrowding.ldquoItrsquos probably bred by us not being able to open indoors and police the situation ourselves, he said.Social distancing signs remain after the road had to be temporarily closed due to people packing the Esplanade over ChristmasldquoAt the moment people come and get a takeaway and go across the road. The problem is thatrsquos what everyone is doing. It doesnrsquot look great at times. But what can we do ldquoOver Christmas it looked almost like a carnival atmosphere to be honest.ldquoIrsquod like to look on the bright side. The seafront has really seen a revival in the last couple of years. Even at am now Piotr at Stol Coffee draws a crowd here. Itrsquos nice to see.That revival is continuing this weekend too as a new cafeacute opens inside the Pier Pavilion.The new rules mean the Pickfords can open their rooms to all people in Wales again.Hugh PickfordldquoWersquove not had much interest at the moment in the rooms, he said. ldquoPeople booked for April and then cancelled when they realised it was room service only. People donrsquot seem to want to eat off the premises or in their rooms, so thatrsquos hitting us a bit.ldquoWersquore looking forward to the summer. With staycation season likely to be ahead of us, it should be a great place to be.What you saidResidents have been responding when asked what they thought of the new changes.Jo Broad, from Blackwood, predicted: ldquoPeople will go crazy. Of course we need our lives back or at least some sort of normality. The beaches will be full again.ldquoLetrsquos hope people will be sensible, not go crazy, and letrsquos hope for safety, or I think there might be a summer lockdown coming.Newport resident Lisa Edwards said: ldquoPeople need to stop hiding behind the government. We are in charge of our own destiny and we have to resume some normality.ldquoTo do this, we need to be allowed to resume living, but sensibly. Itrsquos people flouting new rules that will cause a second wave.Claire Dunning said: ldquoWaiting for the next lockdown. People will take liberties.

Photo Kirsten McTernanDiscussions about the opening of an arts centre in Cardf started in  and were part of a vision for a space where artists could produce and present work, free from commercial pressures. Experimental work was seen as key to its identity, and the needs of artists were at its heart.The venue was formerly Canton High School, and the initial period of set up was a demanding time. The founders, and a gang of enthusiastic and dedicated volunteers, lovingly cleared, restored and adapted the building to make it fit for purpose as Walesrsquo first arts centre.The first official Board meeting was held on  April  and in July that year Chapter opened its doors with a temporary cinema, gallery and bar, and with former classrooms used as studios, workshops and offices.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityDr Patrick Roach, general secretary of the NASUWT teaching union, has called on ministers to act and ldquostep in when employers refuse to listen to teachersrsquo concerns amid the pandemic as he said they ldquodeserve better.Addressing the NASUWTrsquos annual conference, Dr Roach highlighted ldquoshoddy practices where he said some employers have not put teachersrsquo safety first.He said: ldquoMinisters mustnrsquot only listen to the concerns of the profession ndash they need to act on them. Listen to teachersrsquo concerns about those employers who have felt emboldened to pursue lsquobusiness as usualrsquo.He added: ldquoListen to teachersrsquo concerns about uncaring employers who seek to discipline teachersthey contract Covid, or tell teachers they canrsquot have time off to receive their Covid vaccine jab.Dr Roach said reports of school staff being denied time off to get their vaccination were ldquowidespread.Speaking to reporters, the union leader said: ldquoI wish it was only a one-off but the number of times thatrsquos come across my desk I cannot begin to tell you.It has been pretty widespread.Dr Roach said the Education Secretary had issued further guidance to schools on the issue after concerns were raised by the NASUWT teaching union.He warned that such practices could play into issues around ldquovaccine hesitancy and ldquoslow down the system for everyone .In his speech to theconference, Dr Roach launched an attack on the Government over its handling of the pandemic and actions towards teachers.He said staff ldquomust not be coerced into working yet longer hours or delivering summer schools to deliver the Governmentrsquos short-term fixes.Dr Roach added: ldquoTeachersrsquo commitment and resilience have already been tested to the limit. They donrsquot need more exhortation and empty words ndash they need action by Government which puts teachers first.     His comments came after the Education Secretary confirmed that a change to the summer holidays and longer school days are being considered as part of long-term recovery plans for pupils who have missed out on lessons.In his speech on Sunday, Dr Roach said: ldquoGovernment needs to stop looking for quick fixes and grabbing media headlines ndash instead of catch-up, they need to catch on, catch on to the long-term damage inflicted by their own policies.ldquoCatch on to the need for much greater investment in all those services that will provide the foundation for the education recovery that children and young people need.He added: ldquoIf we are to aspire to have the best country for children to grow up in, we will need more than catch-up and recovery. We need a plan for education renewal. And, we want a recovery, a renewal, thatrsquos teacher-led too.On Sunday, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer told the NASUWT conference: ldquoThe challenges of the pandemic have thrown into sharp relief the inequalities that were already embedded in our society.ldquoThat is why there can be noto business as usual.In a video message to delegates, Sir Keir said he knew ldquofirst-hand that teachers had risen to the challenge as his children have been in school throughout the year due to his we being an NHS worker.He said: ldquoTheir teachersrsquo and all the school staffrsquos commitment and dedication has been nothing short of extraordinary.

Speaking ahead of the Easter Holiday weekend, Councillor Armstrong said: As chairperson of Fermanagh and Omagh District Council, I would like to take the opportunity to wish you all a Happy and Safe Easter. As we mark our second Easter season in a period of restrictions, I would encourage everyone to continue to adhere to the Covid- restrictions currently in place to help curb the spread of Covid- and help continue to protect our NHS. We have been Stronger Together throughout this pandemic, however, the increase in cases in recent days in the Fermanagh and Omagh District has demonstrated that we are not there yet and we cannot become complacent. Easter and Spring are signs of rebirth and new beginnings and the successful roll out of the vaccination programme at this time has provided us with much needed hope and encouragement in what has been a dficult time for us all. I believe that we will emerge from the signicant challenges posed by Covid-, stronger as a District and we will continue to work together to support each other and our local businesses by following public health advice to keep our distance from others, wear a face covering and wash and practice good hand hygiene. We can still have a ‘cracking’ good Easter and find alternative ways to celebrate at home. If you are looking for some egg-citing Easter activities to do at home, please visit the social media pages for the Council, the Ardhowen Theatre and Strule Arts Centre for where you will see a whole host of fun activities to keep you entertained over the Easter break. If you are taking advantage of the better weather over the holiday weekend and visiting your local park or public space, please continue to follow the guidance in relation to Covid- guidance. Please also remember to try to avoid busy times and also use the designated car parking spaces and Leave No Trace to ensure we can protect our environment for the enjoyment of all. I would like to pay tribute, once again, to our residents who have, throughout the pandemic, exercised restraint and adhered to the myriad of regulations and restrictions. Your continued efforts, coupled with the vaccination programme, have got us to where we are now. The light at the end of the tunnel is getting brighter. We are nearly there and one final push will get us over the line.  addthis,     Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_cabfdbfbe   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_adfadcbcdebcfa   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]      []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"},{"url":"http://www.tyronecon.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1617379713897.jpg--covid_19___fri_2nd_apr_figures.jpg?161737971400","title":"covid  fri nd apr figures ","story":"The NI Department of Health dashboard shows One further coronavirus related death and  positive test results.

But I would appeal to people not to let their frustrations affect their judgement. These restrictions are in place to protect us from a vicious virus that has brought great tragedy to so many families. “When we are following them, we are helping keep ourselves and others safe – and helping our community get to a better place. “We are continuing to make good progress. The statistics on COVID- have been moving steadily in the right direction and more than three quarters of a million people in Northern Ireland have received their first vaccine dose. “We are on a pathway towards gradually easing restrictions. Theof schools and expansion of outdoor activities are the first careful steps on this route map. He added: Some regulations have been eased this week, and more welcome decisions will steadily followwe can keep COVID- infections down. “But it’s still important to follow the basics. That includes maintaining social distancing, wearing a face covering and washing hands frequently and well. Stay at home as much as possible and stay local when you are enjoying the great outdoors.
