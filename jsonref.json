Moscow must find ways to continue selling its oil, otherwise there is the risk of an even bigger oil-price shock.\u0027The unthinkable would be if fresh measures are introduced that would directly target oil and gas exports from Russia, or if the latter retaliates by turning off supplies of these commodities to its western neighbours in Europe.\u0027An energy-dependent Europe will want to avoid this situation, nearly at all costs. But traders are not taking any chances as fighting in Ukraine intensifies, while international payments to and from Russia become increasingly very difficult with the West\u0027s decision to exclude several Russian banks from the Swift global financial messaging system.\u0027Talks with Iran over its nuclear ambitions remain ongoing and there are some hopes that the country could re-enter the oil market, which would stabilise prices.Ryanair boss Michael O\u0027Leary said the West must work on getting oil prices down.Speaking to Sky News, he said: \u0027We would still believe, hopefully, that the Ukrainian situation will be resolved in favour of Ukraine in the near to short term, but there\u0027s no doubt that if oil prices remain high, around 100 dollars a barrel, we are going to see a dramatic increase in supply.\u0027The Iranians are talking to the Americans about resolving the nuclear discussions... They\u0027re already loading up tankers to export oil.\u0027The most important thing that we in the West can do is drive up oil production, because what hits Russia hardest is low oil prices and low gas prices.\u0027       "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/24f530d3f78a97b552fb0a8f891cb4874d7bb935/0_1786_6245_3746/master/6245.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=4954e68ce4bbc4d182b00b0353caf15a","title":"artworks as floral installations in pictures","story":"Parry hopes her works will make viewers pause, that they will fire their imagination. “I try not to make something identical to the original, I leave room for a new work to exist which sits uncannily next to the original, oh-so-slightly off.”"},{"url":null,"title":"college","story":"Options to consider \u0026ndash and reasons to be cheerful \u0026ndash when selecting your move after the examMaking important life decisions is never easy - but there are tools to helpJunior Cycle and Leaving Cert exams to commence on Wednesday, June 8thThe fairness of some aspects of the college application system is open to questionMinister for Education confirms move for Leaving Cert and Junior Cert studentsSudden shift to pre-pandemic standards is not expected, says Department of EducationYou need to register now to apply for college through the CAO, but you have until July 1st to make a final decision on your course choiceCAO 2022: Most applicants get an outcome which enables them to successfully progress to the next stage of their educational journeyFrom nursing to engineering and environmental studies, there\u0026rsquos plenty of choice"},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"\u0026ldquoWindthrow is now the greatest threat to economic forestry in IrelandStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"covid rules for passengers arriving into the state to be scrapped from sunday","story":"Arrivals will no longer be required to show proof of vaccination, recovery or a negative PCR test upon arrival nor will they be required to fill out passenger locator forms .

If the war continues to escalate and continues into the medium term, Ireland will be expected to host about 2 per cent of all refugees who have been forced to leave their home country.On that basis, the Government has begun scenario planning based on a minimum of 20,000 Ukrainian refugees arriving in Ireland.Last night Taoiseach Micheál Martin said the Government is discussing opening an online portal or register where people can pledge how they can help the new arrivals, whether this is through providing accommodation or other skills,.Any Ukrainian people arriving in Ireland will need support, especially young children who will attend Irish schools, according to Mr Martin. “This will be challenging. The first wave of those coming into Ireland are meeting friends and staying with friends.”This will result in the biggest displacement of people on the European continent since the second World War, he added, and Irish people who want to help should make cash donations to the Irish Red Cross. He was speaking on the Late Late show where more than €3 million was raised for the charity. The Government donated €10 million last week to United Nations organisations at the front line and another €10 million will be donated this week, said the Taoiseach. Speaking on Friday afternoon, Minister for Higher Education Simon Harris said he would not be surprised if the figure coming in would easily exceed 1,000 by next week.Government sources said it was not expected that a large number of refugees would arrive in Ireland in the coming weeks and the figure of 600 fell within expectations.There are an estimated 4,000 Ukrainian-born people living in Ireland at present and, in the initial stages, Ukrainian refugees arriving into Ireland will go to relatives.A source said virtually all of the 621 people who have arrived have support networks of family and friends in Ireland and have not sought any help from the State so far.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"over one third of north s population hold irish passport","story":"Observers have suggested the surge in Irish passport applications, against a decline in British, was due to pragmatism among the North’s unionists since the UK withdrew from the EU.  More than a third of Northern Ireland’s population hold an Irish passport, according to latest official figures.While applications plunged amid overseas travel restrictions during pandemic lockdowns, fresh data from the Department of Foreign Affairs shows numbers rebounding.Already this year, 24,643 people were issued with Irish passports in the North through Northern Ireland Passport Express (NIPX), which is available at post offices in the North. This is more than 400 every day. The figures do not include Irish citizens in the North who apply for their passports directly from Dublin.If the trend continues it suggests more than 150,000 Irish passports would be issued in the North by the year end.This would eclipse, dramatically, the 107,937 issued through NIPX in 2019 – the last full-year figure before coronavirus prevented international travel for most.Issued passports during 2019 in the North soared 27 per cent from the previous year (84,855). This continued a pattern of rising Irish passport applications in the region against declining British applications following Brexit. Official figures show there were 110,506 applications from Northern Ireland for a UK passport in 2019. This was down from 119,298 the previous year, in a continuing 15 per cent slide in such applications from people in the North over a five-year period.LockdownDespite the virus grounding most of the world’s aircraft since the outbreak began, 56,709 Irish passports were issued in the North last year, up almost 16 per cent from 48,911 in 2020, when the first pandemic lockdown was imposed in Ireland.Aggregate figures for the decade 2012 to 2022, to date, show 660,427 Irish passports issued in the North, about 35 per cent of the region’s 1.8 million population. Under the Belfast Agreement, Irish and British governments recognise the birthright of all people in Northern Ireland to identify as either Irish, British or both. There is also a right to dual citizenship and people can carry Irish and British passports. Observers have suggested the surge in Irish passport applications, against a decline in British, is down to increasing pragmatism among the North’s unionists since the United Kingdom withdrew from the European Union. An Irish passport allows them to travel freely within the EU. The Democratic Unionist Party’s Sammy Wilson has previously said he gets “quite a lot” of loyalist voters in his constituency who ask him to sign off on their applications for Irish passports. The East Antrim MP said he encourages constituents going on holidays to opt for an Irish passport as it is a quicker process and negates restrictions imposed on British citizens in the EU as a result of Brexit.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"progress on tackling women s issues much too slow nwci rally hears","story":"The National Women\u0027s Council held their \u0027No Woman Let Behind\u0027 rally in Dublin to raise key issues that women face across Ireland.

Photograph: Tom HonanThe “We know that women are not all impacted in the same way … One parent families are at the centre of our housing crisis, Traveller women continue to have a lower life expectancy than settled women,” she told the crowd.Ms O’Connor was critical that women who were suffering domestic violence were left on “waiting lists” to access refuges in some parts of the country.Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald said women demanded to be “safe on our streets, safe in our homes”. Addressing the rally, Ms McDonald said many women were being forced to make constant choices “between heating the room and feeding a hungry mouth”.She said women had a right to access healthcare “in State provided facilities without the blight of theological dogma”, referencing the controversy over the ownership arrangements of the new National Maternity Hospital.“The political system can choose to listen or not, they may choose to look the other way, but be very clear sisters, that the old Ireland is gone and change is coming,” she said.During her speech, two women in the crowd repeatedly shouted the name of Máiría Cahill, who was raped as a teenager by a senior IRA member, and has been a vocal critic of Sinn Féin over how the matter was handled.In response to the hecklers, Ms McDonald told the crowd that women “demand our right not to be bullied, ever, off any public platform”.‘Disproportionate burden’Patricia King, general secretary of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions (Ictu), said there was a gender pay gap of 14 per cent in Ireland, which she said meant that “for every one euro a man earns, a woman will earn 86 cents”.Ms King said much of this was because “women are often forced to work less hours, because they carry a huge disproportionate burden of caring responsibilities,” due to the lack of affordable childcare.Speaking at the rally, Labour Party TD Ivana Bacik called for the “sexist and dated language about women and mothers” to be removed from the Constitution. It was “appalling” that there were only 37 female TDs in the Dáil in 2022, which amounted to 23 per cent female representation, she said.Several hundred demonstrators gathered for the NWCI rally, held in advance of International Women’s Day on Tuesday.The line-up of speakers had been a point of political controversy, with female Oireachtas members from Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil hitting out that no representative from Government parties had been invited to speak at the event.Responding to the criticism on Saturday, Ms O’Connor said the rally was a “moment for Government to listen”.Fine Gael TD Jennifer Carroll MacNeill, who was in the crowd, said she felt “disappointed” members from Government parties had not been invited to speak, but added they would continue to work “collaboratively” with the NWCI on women’s issues.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"state","story":"State papers: Perception on the Shankill Road in 1990s was \u0026lsquofear of encroachment\u0026rsquo-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":null,"title":"immensely proud orange order unveils stone marking ni centenary","story":" Orange Order grand master Edward Stevenson attending the unveiling of the CentenNIal stone at Schomberg House in Belfast on Saturday.

As colleagues gathered for pints in the Dáil bar with their soon to be former boss, one of them started whispering about “The Great Unclenching”. Stress levels, it seems, were already beginning to subside and our happy confidant reckoned that massage therapists in the vicinity of Labour HQ and Leinster House are in danger out going out of business now that everyone is starting to relax again.The atmosphere in the party on Wednesday was very tense. The Three Horsemen of Alan’s Apocalypse – TDs Seán Sherlock and Duncan Smith, and Senator Mark Wall – had visited Kelly the day before to tell him the game was up. Senator Marie Sherlock was also a key player who “kept things on an even keel”. The plot to take out AK47 was finalised at a secret gathering of TDs and Senators in her Dublin home.During Wednesday’s Leaders’ Questions in the Dáil, Sherlock and Smith sat directly behind Kelly looking distinctly uncomfortable. We would discover why a few hours later. When Kelly took to the plinth that night in front of Leinster House to announce his resignation, he looked and sounded like a man in shock. On Friday morning he did an interview with his local radio station, Tipp FM. He sounded like he was still in shock. Meanwhile, the Labour grassroots are rumbling about being left out of the process to select a new leader with the swift coronation of “Princess Ivana”, as some are calling her, seemingly already a foregone conclusion.Deputy Bacik has been keeping her head down, although she is due to address the National Women’s Council of Ireland rally in Kildare Street on Saturday and will be taking the plunge in Dublin Bay on Sunday at a Labour Women’s Swim to raise money for Ukraine. Co-incidentally, having finally made the breakthrough to Dáil Éireann last July after years of trying, Bacik spent the morning of the Dublin Bay South byelection count swimming off the South Wall with her mother Rina. As for the Three Horsemen of Alan’s Apocalypse, they seem set to form Bacik’s praetorian guard after her (unexpectedly) expected elevation. “Internal discipline will be required and that might not come from those traditionally seen to be closest to her,” said an insider.The drama was watched with great interest by the other parties. Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael politicians were particularly impressed by how the Labour crew managed to keep a lid on their machinations for over a week. In the bar on Wednesday night, requests were made for copies of the manual. Minister on paradeCometh the hour, cometh the Green’s sash. All the legends are going to be in New York City for the St Patrick’s Day parade. Ireland’s loss is the Big Apple’s gain.Eamon Ryan will be the Government’s representative on the big day, joining the proud sons of the old sod (no fresh turf harmed in the making of Eamon’s parade) as they march down Fifth Avenue. The Green Party leader says he’s looking forward to the occasion.Also stepping out is the former tánaiste and PD leader Michael McDowell who has been invited to walk in the parade by the city’s St Patrick’s Day Foundation. He is this year’s recipient of its St Patrick Award “for his service to the Irish nation” and will be presented with a marble “St Patrick’s Swan”. We hope he doesn’t get a swelled head as a result of all this.Senator McDowell will be honoured along with the parade Grand Marshall, James T Callahan (General President of the International Union of Operating Engineers) at a gala dinner on March 15th in Manhattan’s Sheraton Hotel. It’s a swanky affair, with sponsorship packages costing up to $50,000 (about €45,000) for a table of 12 (Diamond Package) and reserved seats at $500 a head. It doesn’t look like Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald – a regular participant – will be marching this time. On March 17th she will be in Washington with Michelle O’Neill at the annual Speaker’s Lunch on Capitol Hill.The 261st St Patrick’s Day Parade in New York will mark the anniversary of 911 and pay tribute to the Irish-American labour movement. It will also recognise the centenary of the formation of the Irish government. Party – of the birthday kindSpeaking of McDowell, that erse half dozen known as the Seanad Independent Group held a surprise 50th birthday lunch on Tuesday for their group administrator, Samantha Long. She is also McDowell’s right-hand woman and he organised the celebration in the Members’ Restaurant. Given the make-up of this technical group (formed to ensure regular speaking slots and the right to publish Bills) it is very possible that Samantha has to control them with a whip and a chair. The other group members are Senators Rónán Mullen, Sharon Keogan, Victor Boyhan, Gerard Craughwell and David Norris. During the recent unveiling of a portrait of Norris, Seanad Cathaoirleach Mark Daly remarked that trying to keep manners on the Independent group is like herding cats. The group admin probably has to wear ear protectors as well.The six Senators and their staff toasted Samantha and unveiled a special birthday cake made by Oireachtas catering queen Julie Lyons. It was a Tuesday party for a Saturday birthday in a busy few days for the popular Leinster House staffer. Samantha, a Magdalene laundry adoptee, was one of the women who featured this week in the first part of RTÉ’s heartbreaking documentary, Ireland’s Dirty Laundry.She said: “My mother was Magdalene Number 322, real name Margaret. Margaret was committed to an industrial school in 1954, age two years and four months. She left 49 years later in a coffin.” Viewers will learn more about Samantha and her sister’s birth mother, Margaret Bullen, in the second part of the documentary which airs on Wednesday. Chips with everythingIf a terrifying war in Ukraine wasn’t enough this week, who suddenly pops up again only George Lee with alarming news about accelerating climate change threatening our very existence. Then along comes a story about false widow spiders trussing up and eating baby bats. And then Alan Kelly is taken out as leader of the Labour Party in a bloodless coup hatched in the home of a first-time Labour Senator. Thank heavens for Leo Varadkar. At least it seemed some small bit of good cheer was coming our way when a press release landed from the Department of Trade, Enterprise and Employment with the encouraging news that the Tánaiste has just launched “a public consultation seeking views on the proposed European Chips Act”. It is built on three pillars. The first – and obviously – most important one is “A Chips for Europe Initiative”. The second one focuses on “A framework to ensure security of supply”. And the final pillar envisages a co-ordination mechanism between member states and the European Commission which will include “monitoring supply and anticipating shortages”.Pillars of chips for everyone. Marvellous. Congratulations Tánaiste for this excellent public consultation exercise we can all get our teeth into. Obviously, there will have to be an expert group on vinegar, a potato symposium in Dublin Castle and a mediation process between the Rooster and Maris Piper factions. This is what real government looks like. Semiconductor chips? Used in numerous everyday products including smartphones and cars in addition to critical applications and infrastructure in health, energy, communications and automation and thus central to Europe’s digital and green transitions?Some women left behindThe Oireachtas Women’s Caucus held a face-to-face meeting in Leinster House for the first time since the 2020 general election. Circumstances could have been better for the occasion and we hear the atmosphere was a tad frosty at times. Feelings are still bruised over the decision by the National Women’s Council of Ireland not to invite female politicians from Government parties to address its big rally outside Leinster House on Saturday. High profile Opposition politicians including Mary-Lou McDonald, Ivana Bacik, Róisín Shortall and Bríd Smith will speak at the No Woman Left Behind event “calling for political leadership and change to truly advance women’s equality”. TDs and Senators excluded from the “Government Women Know Your Place” event seem to have pulled back from the row – but they are still silently fuming over what happened.The dispute over who was and wasn’t invited to speak spilled over to more general criticism of the council for a perceived lack of ersity among the listed speakers. The organisers moved quickly to correct the balance. On the eve of the protest, which is due to start at noon and last for an hour, the NWCI had a list of people who will grace the platform “including” 20 named speakers. That leaves three minutes per person at the microphone. Good luck with that.

Photo: Tom Honan for The .The Labour Party has said nominations for those seeking to become leader of the party will close later this month, with TD Ivana Bacik widely expected to be the next leader. Earlier this week Alan Kelly resigned as Labour Party leader, after losing the support of his parliamentary party colleagues. In a statement, the Labour Party said the nomination process for the leadership will be open until 12pm on 24th March, after which if only one candidate is put forward they will be elected party leader. Speaking on Saturday, Ms Bacik would not comment on the leadership election, only stating she would be consulting with party members over the weekend. Ms Bacik, a long time Senator, was elected to the Dáil last July, after winning the Dublin Bay South byelection.The party statement said a candidate may be nominated for the leadership by at least two Labour Oireachats members, or five party constituency councils. If there is a contested election the party membership will vote, with polling to close on 22nd April. The party’s executive board and parliamentary party met on Saturday, and “affirmed that Alan Kelly would continue in office as acting leader until a successor is elected”, the statement said. Only TDs are eligible to contest for the leadership of the party. Other potential contenders, such as Duncan Smith and Aodhán Ó Ríordáin, ruled themselves out of the running for the position shortly after Mr Kelly announced he was stepping down. Previously Brendan Howlin was elected as leader uncontested in 2016, as he was the only candidate to receive a nomination from the parliamentary party.

Photograph: Eamon WardElected against expectations and thrust into the national spotlight, the election of a mother-of-six and a Protestant voice as a rural Sinn Féin TD should have been a story of triumph against the odds. For Violet-Anne Wynne and Sinn Féin, however, it has ended in tears and recriminations. She has resigned alleging “psychological warfare” and said her most recent pregnancy was used as a stick to beat her with.The charges – serious allegations by any measure – have met, finally, with an apology.As often happens when Sinn Féin are at the centre of a controversy and facing questions it would prefer not to answer, the party’s TDs who are usually regular fixtures on the Leinster House plinth were thin on the ground this week.Yet as with most things in politics, the reality of what is happening behind-the-scenes is much more complicated than first impressions would suggest.Some people were elected in the 2020 general election that Sinn Féin did not expect to get elected. It resulted in something of a culture clash between those candidates and the party, partially because of the centralised command structure.The experience recounted by Wynne shows a discomfort with the level of direction she believes she was experiencing.It has often – though not always – been the case that a person who wants to earn a seat in Leinster House has to spend years working up the political ladder. Such a route has its flaws, but it gives people time and experience to learn the ropes.The outcome of the 2020 election – one that surprised Sinn Féin, never mind other parties in the Dáil – meant that there were Sinn Féin TDs elected who the previous year had failed to secure council seats. In Wynne’s case, she was placed eighth out of nine candidates in the Kilrush district, securing 4.2 per cent of the first preference vote.Coming back into the Dáil on a wave of a victory after the election, Sinn Féin held talks aimed at setting up a government of the left, but this effort fell flat as the numbers were not there, as it rapidly became clear.Then the pandemic hit and the Fine Gael-Independent caretaker government steered the ship for a time. The relevance of this is the following: Sinn Féin was unsure if another election would be called and in some instances they held off on appointing new staff, so certain problems did not become immediately evident to the new rake of TDs.This is the first flash-point.Parliamentary assistantsTwo sources with knowledge of how the party works say that in many instances, parliamentary assistants are chosen for the TD and a choice is not given. Many of them do not rail against it, it’s just the way it is, they reckon.In response to questions from The , Sinn Féin denies that, saying all of their TDs are responsible for the recruitment, employment and management of their own staff, and while some look for help with advertising and interviews, others look after it themselves. “This is entirely a matter for each inidual TD.”Many of the parliamentary staff in question are bright, diligent and experienced. They also work long days and irregular hours.The issue, one source says, is that the staff member may be loyal to the party and feel responsible to the central structure. They are invested in the political project rather than the politician, as is the case in other parties. The effect of this is to disempower the TD by eroding some of their power.On the other hand, one source who has worked at different levels of the party, including as a parliamentary assistant, says there are benefits for new TDs as they may be offered experienced and savvy staff who can help them navigate the difficult first year in the job.Another source said there be can huge ambition among these parliamentary staff and that working in these positions is something of a “school for future TDs”.Housing spokesman Eoin Ó Broin was once a parliamentary assistant for Donegal TD Pearse Doherty, while Louth TD Ruairí Ó Murchú and Cork South-Central TD Donnchadh Ó Laoghaire also worked for a time as PAs.It is all well and good when the politician and their new staff are on the same page. It gets very complicated otherwise.On Clare FM on Tuesday, Wynne touched on this very issue. During her two years as a party TD, she said she had four members of the party at various points working as her staff, though two had to take sick leave.“They left me in a situation whereby I had no staff members for a period of three months. This was two days after I told the party that it was not a workable situation, it wasn’t something I could see being sustainable and I was possibly going to let them go.”The  understands that Sinn Féin was made aware by those same staff members that they had significant concerns of their own. It is understood they felt stressed and over-burdened, and that the working environment was fraught. The two staff members went on sick leave before being let go just before in Christmas of 2020, and the jobs were advertised soon afterwards.Sinn Féin says that the employment relationship is between the TD and the staff member, not with the party.“As their employer, Violet-Anne decided to terminate the employment of a number of her staff members over the past two years. That was entirely her decision and her responsibility. A number of those staff whose employment had been terminated by Deputy Wynne contacted the party for advice. The party advised them if they felt they had been treated unfairly by their employer that they should seek employment rights advice,” The  was told.Local party organiserWynne has also raised issues with the party’s structures on the ground in Co Clare, where there was no local party organiser to address inevitable issues that come up in any constituency.Sources in the constituency – and, again, no one would speak on the record for this article – say Sinn Féin has regional organisers who cover large areas or multiple counties.The organiser has a heavy workload – they are responsible for delivering on political strategy in the area, building membership, making sure constituency meetings between politicians and voters go ahead, attending meetings and providing reports.There are two schools of thought about this role, the first of which is that they are integral members of the party who problem-solve and smooth over tricky issues. The other is that they are overly powerful and dictate to local members.Wynne has raised other issues that the party moved to address on Thursday. She was told she was an “effing eejit” for becoming pregnant again and that she felt anxious about relaying the news. Sinn Féin said that comment was “unacceptable” and that the local member has apologised.The criticisms of structures within Sinn Féin raise many questions. One of these is: will the party appoint advisers the way it does parliamentary staff if it gets into government? When difficult decisions have to be made and defended (and that is the nature of government), how will the new TDs fare if they disagree? Will they find themselves battling against both their staff and more senior party members?Sinn Féin has suffered four high-profile Oireachtas defections in just 4½ years – Peadar Tóibín, Carol Nolan, Trevor Ó Clochartaigh and now Violet-Anne Wynne. That is a high figure for an opposition party. What would it be like in the white heat of government?Then there is the question of how the party approaches the next election, having high ambitions as it does. The strategists (somewhat understandably) closely guard election plans but there have been rumours that so-called accidental TDs could be de-selected in favour of more experienced candidates. One source said another option would be to run that stronger candidate alongside any TD the party views to be weak and push the votes towards the stronger candidate. If the second candidate still holds onto their seat, then that’s a bonus.And when the numbers are in, should Sinn Féin enter Government Buildings, the next conundrum: the difficult task of managing expectations."},{"url":null,"title":"russians brace for big squeeze as rouble loses third of value","story":"Russians buy  furniture and household goods in an Ikea store in St Petersburg, Russia, on Thursday. The Swedish chain had announced its closure  in Russia as of  March 4th. Photograph: Anatoly MaltsevEPA In bright sunshine, a long queue of shoppers snaked outside an Ikea store near Moscow this week. Similar scenes were repeated across Russia as families rushed to spend their fast-depreciating roubles at the Swedish retailer, which is exiting the crisis-hit country.Russians are bracing for an uncertain future of spiralling inflation, economic hardship and an even sharper squeeze on imported goods.The rouble has lost a third of its value this week after unprecedented Western sanctions were imposed to punish Russia for invading Ukraine. The moves froze much of the central bank’s $640 billion (€585 billion) in reserves and barred several banks from global payments system Swift, leaving the rouble in free-fall.Cities across Russia were outwardly calm, with little sign of the crisis devastating financial sector and markets, except for the lines of people looking to stock up on products – mostly high-end items and hardware – before shelves empty or prices climb further.“The purchases that I planned to make in April, I urgently bought today. A friend from Voronezh also told me to buy for her,” shopper Viktoriya Voloshina told Reuters in Rostov, a town 217km from Moscow.Ms Voloshina said she was looking for office shelves and tables, and was also shopping on behalf of a friend from another town. “My heart is breaking,” she added.Dmitry, another Moscow resident, lamented rapid price rises. “The watch I wanted to buy now costs around 100,000 roubles (€746), compared to 40,000 about a week ago,” he said, declining to give his surname.But the spending burst visible this week may peter out. While there is no palpable sign of panic, the wipe-out of rouble savings and the doubling of interest rates to 20 per cent will squeeze mortgage holders and consumers.Financial conditions – reflecting availability of credit in the economy – have tightened brutally this year, which Oxford Economics predicted would shrink domestic demand by 11 per cent by year end and raise unemployment by 1.9 percentage points in 2023.Zach Witlin, an analyst at Eurasia Group, notes sanctions are already hitting consumers via prices hikes and digital payments disruptions.While consumers are not directly targeted, “fear and caution are exaggerating the impact”, with the exit of foreign brands such as Ikea creating a “snowball effect”, he added.Cars, machinery and car parts comprised nearly half of Russia’s $293 billion imports last year, according to the Federal Customs Service.Strenuous import cutbacksThe government’s strenuous import cutbacks in recent years mean 2021 imports remained 7 per cent below 2013 levels, before the first sanctions following Russia’s 2014 annexation of Crimea.It has also beefed up trade with China, which is the only country to boost exports to Russia since 2014.But further declines look inevitable as the rouble plunges, insurers refuse cover to businesses exporting to Russia and shippers back away from Russian ports, whether to export or to import.While only a few Russian companies are targeted by sanctions, “all of them will feel the chilling effect”, said Matt Townsend, sanctions partner at law firm Allen \u0026amp Overy. “This is why sanctions are a very effective measure to isolate a country.”The immediate economic shock will cause a 35 per cent GDP contraction in the second quarter and a 7 per cent decline in 2022, JPMorgan predicted. But “growing political and economic isolation will curtail Russia’s growth potential in years to come”, it added.That may come about if restrictions “limit the acquisition of technology needed to support Russia’s highest value industries”, RBC Global Asset Management warned.The Biden administration is preparing rules to curb Moscow’s ability to import smartphones, aircraft parts and auto components.But multinationals, from tech firms Apple and Microsoft to consumer goods producers Nike and Diageo, have severed links with Russia, meaning shoppers will have limited access to the consumer goods they have grown accustomed to over three decades.Chinese companies, so far staying put, could grab some market share but they too could fall prey to secondary sanctions as many of their products such as smartphones use US origin technology.Some Russians are not staying to find out. Lidia, a freelance worker from Rostov said the money transfer curbs were complicating receiving payments from abroad.“The sanctions have hit me very hard. Prices are already up around 20 per cent ...It’s a fact that you already can’t buy some medicines. Things will get worse,” she said.“Today my family and I are leaving Russia.” – ReutersFull coverage of the Russian invasion of UkraineStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"inside","story":"Decades of progress overshadowed by Putin crackdowns and confrontation with WestRussia\u0026rsquos land of the midnight sun said to have inspired creator of Chanel No. 5Atomic icebreakers and floating power plants to help Kremlin develop Arctic shipping routeMinority nations feel squeeze as Putin\u0026rsquos \u0026lsquopower vertical\u0026rsquo crushes republics\u0026rsquo autonomyHistory of bloodshed and tragedy haunts stunning region shared by Muslims and ChristiansOil wealth and new mosque and churches help keep Tatarstan on Kremlin\u0027s sideOfficials claim West wants to \u0026lsquoGermanise\u0026rsquo and instil special identity in strategic regionNato monitors heavily armed Kaliningrad as locals long for borders to reopenAttack on renowned Memorial rights group deepens opposition anger and international alarmSaint Petersburg Letter: Russia\u0026rsquos old imperial capital celebrates 200 years since birth of Crime and Punishment creatorEnergy giant hopes vast forests will offset carbon costs and ease green transitionCircassian heritage trampled and property rows continue as Winter Olympics city boomsKremlin criticised as most Russians reject vaccination and hospitals face huge strainKremlin changes tack on global warming and looks to vast forests to offset emissionsRussia and Japan co-operate on Sakhalin despite row over nearby Kuril islandsIndustry and struggling communities fear wildlife support could stifle Far East developmentCity with echoes of San Francisco is thrillingly original, yet tarnished by graft and neglectGrowing energy, security and diplomatic links between Moscow and Beijing worry WestDecembrist rebels and their aristocratic wives embraced \u0026lsquoreal Russia\u0026rsquo in Siberian exileFears for permafrost as tusk hunters feed Chinese market starved of elephant ivoryInside Russia: Melting permafrost threatens critical infrastructure and feeds global warmingStalin\u0027s popularity growing as Kremlin focuses on Soviet triumphs, not tragediesInside Russia: Party wonders how far it cane press Putin after years in soft \u0026lsquosystemic opposition\u0026rsquo roleInside Russia: More protests planned as officials reject calls to address e-voting complaintsMoscow Letter: Poet\u0026rsquos statue has been a magnet for generations of Russian dissentersOn the eve of an expected sham election, many of Putin\u0026rsquos political opponents are already jailed or dead"},{"url":null,"title":"israeli president to visit turkey next week in mutual bid to repair ties","story":"Israeli president Isaac Herzog will visit Ankara on March 9th-10th at the invitation of Turkish president Tayyip Erdogan, the Turkish presidency said.

The two presidents will also hold talks on “recent regional and international developments”.Mr Herzog’s spokesman said the visit was being co-ordinated with prime minister Naftali Bennett, adding it will be the first by an Israeli leader since 2008.“The two presidents will discuss various bilateral issues, including Israel-Turkey relations and the potential for expanding collaboration,” he said in a statement.Ankara, which supports a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, has condemned Israel’s occupation of the West Bank and its policy towards Palestinians, while Israel has called on Turkey to drop support for the militant Palestinian group Hamas which runs Gaza.While Mr Erdogan has spoken to Mr Herzog before, Israel’s presidency is a largely ceremonial role. In November, he spoke to Mr Bennett, the first such call to an Israeli prime minister in years.Last month, Turkey said it would not abandon its commitment to a Palestinian state in order to broker closer ties with Israel.

Mr Bryant and his two sons deny the charges. Benjamin Douglas-Jones QC told jurors that Mr Bryant was a surveyor employed by the trust and he held the power to approve payments.Around £1.1 million of the work was purported to have been carried out on farms and cottages on the Arlington Court estate and others at Lynton and Croyde between 2008 and 2013, while a further £700,000 worth of work stretched back to 2000, the court was told. Non-existent companiesSome of the jobs were described as minor repairs to walls or fences which cost just under the £1,000 limit and could be paid without any managerial checks, the prosecutor said. Any invoices for payments between £1,000 and £25,000 required approval, but Mr Bryant had the responsibility of signing off such expenditure, the court was told. The bulk of the payments were sent to companies called JR Construction and SB Contracting, but the cash was actually going straight into bank accounts belonging to his sons, it was heard. Mr Douglas-Jones said of the companies: They did not exist. They were merely artifices created for use in fraud.The National Trust thought they were paying genuine businesses for work genuinely done of genuine value.Mr Bryant is also alleged to have done work on his home in Goodleigh at the National Trust’s expense. Jurors were told that JR Construction was paid more than £1 million by the National Trust between January 2008 and January 2013, rising to £1.7 million since 2000. SB Contracting was alleged to have been paid more than £64,000 by the charity between February 2011 and October 2013. Dozens of invoices were submitted for labour including chimney, roof, fence and wall work, as well as lime repair, the jurors were told. It was only in November 2013 when other National Trust managers spotted an anomaly and realised they had never heard of the two companies, which had received more than £140,000 in the past financial year alone, the court heard. Perverting the course of justiceA separate fraud was allegedly committed by Mr Bryant when he had approved an invoice for work done on his own garden, which was then paid for by the National Trust.He is alleged to have tried to persuade a builder to falsely claim he had carried out the work, for which Mr Bryant is accused of perverting the course of justice.The National Trust operates as a charity independent of government, meaning it does not receive any financial support, but it does bid for state grants from local and central government.Its largest source of income is membership fees, followed by money brought in from properties and estates it owns. More from NewsRussia-Ukraine latest news: Moscow wanted Mariupol ceasefire to regroup forces, says MoDBen Wallace: Vladimir Putin could be toying with Emmanuel MacronGovernment urged to increase defence spending in wake of Ukraine invasionThe UK must learn the hard lessons from the shattering of the West’s illusionsMPs issue eleventh-hour plea to Boris Johnson to reverse fracking banMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"britains covid experts misled alarming models abandoned objectivity","story":"Scientists abandoned their objectivity, misled with alarming models and failed to appreciate the damage lockdown would cause, a government adviser has claimed in a damning indictment of Britain’s pandemic response.Prof Mark Woolhouse, a member of the Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Modelling (Spi-M), said that the Government’s advisory system was dominated by clinicians and public health specialists who “weren’t looking at the bigger picture”.In his memoir, The Year The World Went Mad, Prof Woolhouse claimed that lockdowns “had surprisingly little effect” and just “deferred the problem to another day, at great cost”.He argued that Spi-M was set up to tackle the wrong disease, influenza, and that early models were based on flu dynamics, and so mistakenly thought schools were a major driver while underrepresenting the impact of shielding.Prof Woolhouse says he was “extremely sceptical” about the Imperial College report from March 16 2020 that claimed more than 500,000 people could die without intervention, but The  revealed last week that, at the time, modellers were still “uncertain” of case numbers “due to data limitations”.The figures, published a week before lockdown was announced, led to an about-turn from the Government.Scepticism over figures leading to first lockdown“It was perfectly obvious that no one could predict the course of the epidemic over such a long timescale, so what was the point of publishing those outputs?” wrote Prof Woolhouse.“The worst-case epidemic is one in which the virus is allowed to spread in the absence of any countermeasures at all. It’s useful to know how big that epidemic would be, but it would never happen in practice. It is inconceivable that we would carry on as normal while hundreds of thousands of people were dying.”Imperial College London published an analysis the following June, claiming that lockdown had saved nearly half a million lives in Britain.However, Sweden managed to bring its epidemic under control without lockdown, leaving Imperial College to conclude that it was Sweden’s ban on mass gatherings that played the decisive role – even while arguing it had not been enough in other countries.“The conclusion wasn’t remotely plausible,” wrote Prof Woolhouse. “Analyses by other researchers came up with quite different conclusions that the UK epidemic was already in decline before lockdown took effect.“I expect this debate will rumble on for years, but I doubt anyone would claim now that the Mar 23 lockdown saved anywhere near half a million lives. Anyone who supported lockdown on the basis of the half-million figure was misled.”An inquiry into the pandemic response is due to begin this spring. However, research is increasingly suggesting that lockdown was not needed because the public naturally begins social distancing when they see cases rise, or friends and family becoming infected.This week, modellers told the Commons science and technology select committee that many of the recent models were wrong because they had failed to factor in these behavioural shifts.Prof Graham Medley, the chairman of Spi-M, told MPs: “Human behaviour is very difficult to predict. If you could do it, then you would make a fortune on the stock exchange. We haven’t included that, and maybe that’s an error. But on the other hand, we’ve seen dramatic behaviour changes which were completely unforeseen.”Spi-M first met in Jan 2020, and modelling from the group was frequently cited by politicians to justify imposing new measures.Yet in his memoir, Prof Woolhouse said that scientific advisers had given too much weight to preventing deaths from coronavirus, while dismissing the indirect harms of lockdown, such as damage to education, mental health, the economy and the rest of the NHS.He said that Britain is likely to be paying for the mistakes of lockdown “for a generation or more”.“The public health benefits were overestimated, skewing the argument in favour of that course, however damaging it was,” he added.“Will the cure turn out to be worse than the disease? It is still early days for doing the reckoning but the moments are not good.”BBC accused of ‘over-egging Covid risks’Prof Woolhouse also accused the BBC of over-egging the risks from Covid and that said scientists had abandoned their objectivity by wading into policy.“It became routine during the pandemic for scientific advisers and commentators to push for one policy or another,” he wrote.“As citizens, they have every right to do that. But when there is a constant stream of government scientific advisers in the media calling for a lockdown, as there was during the second wave in Oct 2020, then we have crossed a line.”Prof Woolhouse also said it was an “awkward” truth that the people who benefited most from suppression of the virus, such as the elderly and vulnerable, were not the group that suffered most from the impact of lockdown: young people and low-income workers.“Even before the UK first went into lockdown in Mar 2020, we knew that novel coronavirus was far more dangerous to the elderly, the frail and the infirm than to healthy young adults and children,” he added.“That should have shaped our response. Instead, the UK administrations continued to act as though everyone was equally at risk. They even actively promoted this misinterpretation to try to bolster acceptance to a lockdown strategy.”The Year The World Went Mad is published by Sandstone PressMore from NewsRussia-Ukraine latest news: Moscow wanted Mariupol ceasefire to regroup forces, says MoDBen Wallace: Vladimir Putin could be toying with Emmanuel MacronGovernment urged to increase defence spending in wake of Ukraine invasionThe UK must learn the hard lessons from the shattering of the West’s illusionsMPs issue eleventh-hour plea to Boris Johnson to reverse fracking banMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"buses sit empty mariupols evacuation proved false hope left","story":"The drivers waited for the order all day, their yellow school buses lined up on Zaporizhzhya’s Dnieper embankment facing south, towards the war.They were meant to be the rescue mission: gathered together at short notice to evacuate hundreds of civilians from Russia’s brutal siege of the port city of Mariupol.But as darkness fell, they had moved nowhere.A promised ceasefire had failed. The buses remained stationary. And the civilians remained trapped inside what has become one of the most violent battles of the 10-day old Russian invasion of Ukraine.Videos and witness testimony from Mariupol, which was surrounded by Russian forces on Tuesday, paint a picture of unrelenting brutality.Mangled corpses lie uncollected on the ground. Buildings have been pulverised by salvos of missiles, rockets and artillery fire. There is no water or electricity.Terrified residents boil snow to make drinking water and cower in basements.  But on Saturday, a glimmer of hope emerged. Russian forces announced that they would grant a temporary ceasefire to the city, as well as to the besieged town of Volnovakha, to allow the evacuation of civilians - principally, women, children and the elderly.It was presented as a gesture of humanity in an increasingly merciless conflict that has shocked the world.But within hours, those hopes were dashed. Ukrainian authorities reported that the Russians had breached the ceasefire and were continuing to rain down shells and missiles on Mariupol and Volnovakha. The evacuation was suspended.Vadim Boichenko, the mayor, said in a statement that the Russian ministry of defence promised early on Saturday morning to ceasefire along roads leading to the Ukrainian-held city of Zaporizhia, 140 miles northwest.“Unfortunately at the moment we were ready, the Russian army began a bombardment of the very roads we were meant to take. In other words, there is no ceasefire,” he said in a video address cancelling the evacuation.He promised that he would continue talks and would announce a new evacuation as soon as a ceasefire was secured.Evacuees were already gathering at three designated evacuation points in the city when the move was cancelled. They were urged to return to bomb shelters as local officials said the assault on Mariupol continued.“The Russians are continuing to bomb us and use artillery. It’s crazy,” said Serhiy Orlov, Mr Boichenko’s deputy.“There is no ceasefire in Mariupol and there is no ceasefire all along the route. Our civilians are ready to escape but they cannot escape under shelling.”The Ministry of Defence yesterday said Russia\u0027s offer to let civilians evacuate was “likely a deflection” to reduce international condemnation and gather its forces for a renewed offensive. Those civilians who were able to escape described the horror of enduring cold, darkness and primal fear amid the rubble and twisted metal.Fleeing the city was a “suicide mission”, Diana Berg, who escaped Mariupol on Thursday, told the BBC.It was a “miracle” that she and her husband had survived, she said. They had to drive at speed between Russian armoured vehicles, thinking that at any moment they would be fired on.“We just squeezed between two of them very fast. They pointed their (weapons) at us, but they didn’t fire.”Schools and hospitals have been shelled, there is no heat or running water, and petrol stations have run out of fuel.“Mariupol was a resistance symbol - it was a sign of how Ukraine is not giving up,” said Ms Berg.She believes Russian objectives go far beyond seizing the city, which is home to around 450,000 people. “They don’t want to occupy it. They don’t want it to surrender. They just want it dead.”Even if they had made it to Zaporizhzhya, it would not have meant safety.The Russian army is just 30 miles away from there and is widely expected to try to seize the city’s strategic bridges and helicopter factory in the next stage of its advance.In scenes reminiscent of the Second World War, hundreds queued on the freezing platform at the city’s main train station on Saturday to wait for evacuation trains headed west.The long evacuation trains are free and require no ticket - all you have to do is get yourself to the station and hope there is a space.But there is no telling when one will arrive, and when they do they are often already crowded with refugees from elsewhere.“What is there to say. It’s an absolute nightmare,” said a 69-year-old woman travelling with her 15-year-old grandson and a Yorkshire terrier.When the three o’clock train rolled in an hour late, crowds rushed from door to door looking for a carriage with some space.Women and children screamed as they were separated in the crush.A visibly distressed soldier carrying a Kalashnikov grabbed a mother holding a baby and forced a corridor through the crowd for her.“This way, this way, children first!” He shouted at another young family. They cottoned on and hurried behind him.  “Enough!” screamed a female train guard as she tried to push back a woman clinging to the steps. “I said enough! There is no more room.”She slammed the door shut, and several children burst into tears.Ten minutes later, she relented and reopened the door. She let five more people on before again having to physically push someone back down the steps.“There’s not space! What’s with the suitcase? This is for refugees, not tourists,” she shouted as a man tried to push a large bag on after his family.The rule is women and children first, and able-bodied men are anyway banned from leaving the country.But amid the chaos, it was impossible for fathers to make even painful, hurried goodbyes.It was a horrible scene to watch. And the panic is understandable.  Zaporizhzhya, an ancient Cossack capital on the Dneiper river, has so far been spared the worst of the war.But everyone has seen footage from Kharkiv, Mariupol and Kyiv circulating on the Telegram messaging app.There is no room for illusion about the realities of a modern siege.Video footage posted on social media by inhabitants of Mariupol shows the facades of apartment blocks ripped apart by shells, a shopping mall burned down and a market incinerated.“The shelling is constant and random,” said one woman. “People come out onto the streets to make fires and warm up. When you are on the streets, at any moment a rocket can land next to you.”The grim testimony came as the Russian defence ministry said that a broad offensive would continue in Ukraine, where it denies targeting civilians or invading, calling its actions a “special military operation”.Russian forces were carrying out strikes on military infrastructure and forces from separatist-held Donetsk were tightening the encirclement of Mariupol, Defence Ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov said.Aid agencies have warned of a humanitarian disaster across the country. The number of refugees could rise to 1.5 million by the end of Sunday from a current 1.3 million, said the head of the United Nations refugee agency.Ukraine says Russian forces have focused efforts on encircling Kyiv and Kharkiv, the second-biggest city, while aiming to establish a land bridge to Crimea.Kyiv, in the path of a Russian armoured column that has been stalled outside the Ukrainian capital for days, was again under attack, with explosions audible from the city centre.Mariupol is a key strategic target for Russian forces. It lies between territory held by Russian-backed separatists in the Donbas region and the Crimean peninsula, which was annexed by Moscow in 2014.To open a land corridor from mainland Russia to Crimea, it must be captured.The city has been under attack since the start of the Russian invasion on February 24 and is the last major population centre still held by Ukrainian forces on the Sea of Azov.But despite being surrounded, the Ukrainians have refused to surrender.The defenders trapped inside include a number of British volunteers serving in the Ukrainian marines.“Last night the shelling was harder and closer,” said a member of Medecins Sans Frontieres, who is trapped in the city.“We collected snow and rainwater yesterday to have some utility water. “Multiple grocery stores were destroyed by missiles and the remaining things were taken by people in desperate need. Still no power, water, heating or mobile connection. Pharmacies are out of medicine.”One 16-year-old boy was killed when a Russian shell exploded on the field where he was playing football. The damage to Volnovakha, an ethnic-Greek town between Mariupol and Donetsk, is, if anything, even worse.Inhabitants said that around 90 per cent of buildings had been damaged or destroyed by Russian mortars, artillery fire and missile strikes.Dmytro Lubinets, a local MP, said bodies lay strewn around the town.Denys Tsutsayev, a volunteer who was trying to coordinate the evacuation from Volnovakha, said: “There are problems with water, power. There are so many people without any heating. There is a very bad connection in the area so it’s difficult to reach people.”Marina Gasanova, who lives in a village near Volnovakha, said her husband was driving back and forth trying to evacuate people. “The situation in the city is very scary, there is almost nothing left. My husband said, ‘I drive in, there is a car standing there, when I come back again, the car is on fire.’ There are corpses lying around, torn off arms, torn off legs.”The International Committee of the Red Cross said it understood that the evacuation of civilians from Mariupol and Volnovakha would not resume on Saturday.“We remain in dialogue with the parties about the safe passage of civilians from different cities affected by the conflict,” the ICRC said in a statement.“The scenes in Mariupol and in other cities today are heart-breaking. Any initiative from the parties that gives civilians a respite from the violence and allows them to voluntarily leave for safer areas is welcome.”Those are exactly the scenes that the people of Zaporizhia fear will soon be visited on their own city.As the train pulled out of the station there late on Saturday, the unlucky ones stood crestfallen on the platform. It had started to snow.“Wait for the next one? That’s the second f—ing train we’ve missed,” shouted one mother, losing her temper in front of her children.A man shushed her. A woman in her forties with teenage daughters fought back tears.Kirill Medvedev ignored the screaming and sat on a suitcase, rocking his distraught four-year-old son Roma on his knee.“He’s alright. Just scared by the crowd,” he said when the boy had quietened down.‘What happens next?’He sent Roma off for a walk with his 10-year-old sister Margarita and their grandmother and took the opportunity for a sly smoke.Like most men here, he was resigned to staying behind but hoped at least to be able to take his girlfriend Alisa and their children as far as Lviv before coming back.“It’s women and children first though, so I don’t know if I’ll get on,” he said. “What happens next?

Wages for teachers and NHS staff, benefits and pensions are all set to rise by less than inflation, leaving you with less disposable income. And those paying student loans are hit with a aposstealthapos rise. Tory ministers announced a £ council tax discount this April for people in Band A-D homes in England. But it won’t touch the sides of the energy bills price rise, let alone all other squeezes as the country starts paying for Covid.  Another £ “rebate” is really just a loan that has to be paid back out of future bills and won’t arrive until October. The minimum wage for over-s is rising from £. to £. an hour, but could also be cancelled out by the squeeze. Boris Johnson is currently avoiding much political pain over the price rises due to the focus on the war in Ukraine.But that won’t stop them hitting your wallet or your family… . Energy bills Regulator Ofgem confirmed the energy price cap will increase to a record £, for a typical household following soaring gas prices. Around million Brits on iable tarfs will be hit with a £ rise to the average annual bill overnight on April . Those on fixed tarfs will be hit by rises when their fixed-rate period ends. Rishi Sunak has announced plans to help, which include people living in bands A to D getting £ discount on their council tax in England, and a £ rebate off energy bills in October.But Labour has branded him the loan shark Chancellor as the rebate is effectively a loan which will need to be repaid over five years. The discount will be clawed back from people’s bills in equal £ instalments from . Pressure will build on the Government to act again in October, when a second hike is expected. The Chancellor admitted annual bills could rise more than £, this year.  . National Insurance riseFrom April, a £bn rise in National Insurance will hit working people as the Treasury looks to cut Covid backlogs in the NHS and begin funding social care.It will mean that employees, employers and the self-employed will all pay .p more in the pound for National Insurance from April  - from % to .%. A worker on £, a year pays an extra £ in tax. Someone on £, will pay £ more. People earning under £, a year, or £ a month, will not have to pay National Insurance or the new levy. Those supportive of Boris Johnson argue the levy is progressive as the wealthier pay more. But Tory backbenchers hostile to new taxes baulk at the plans as the tax burden hits its highest in decades. . Inflation and interest rates UK inflation has hit .% and Britons are beginning to feel the squeeze as the cost of food, energy and transport rises at the fastest for three decades. This means the same pound in your pocket buys you less in bread or fuel.And both are products that could rise in price further due to the war between oil giant Russia and wheat-producing Ukraine. Meanwhile the Bank of England hiked interest rates earlier this month to .% in the first back-to-back increase since . This will mean mortgage rates become more expensive, an overnight rise to the monthly payments for people on standard iable rates.Mr Sunak insists inflation is a global problem post-Covid, but whether this line will hold remains to be seen.  . Council tax rise Most of England’s families will be hit with an eye-watering Council Tax rise of % or more in April, Mirror research reveals. The vast majority of cash-strapped town, city and county halls are imposing the maximum possible hike on April . Of  councils that run social care, the Mirror found  were planning rises of .% - the maximum normally allowed this year. And a further  planned rises higher than .%, by using allowances that were unused in previous years. Six of those authorities - Cambridgeshire, Lincolnshire, Sandwell, Oxfordshire, Surrey and Rutland - are set to impose a .% hike. In Rutland that will raise a Band D bill by £, wiping out much of a £ discount that is meant to help pay rising energy bills. Search for your council tax rise by postcode below.  . Covid tests From April  the vast majority of people must paythey want a Covid lateral flow test - eventhey have a cough and fever. No has said spending £bn a month on free tests is not an effective use of taxpayers’ money at this point. This has prompted a furious row with Labour, some medics and the Scottish and Welsh governments - which will get no new moneythey want to continue free tests. It’s not known how much lateral flow tests will cost, but No is seeking a regulated market where each test costs a low single-figure number of pounds. This suggests a box of seven could cost £-.Asymptomatic tests for NHS workers will be made available but not routinely, only as a surge effort where thereaposs an outbreak. But they will be available for care home residents. Exact lists of those eligible are being drawn up.. Student loans aposstealth taxapos Millions will be forced to pay more on their student loans under what has been branded a “stealth tax rise”. Student loan repayment thresholds will be frozen from April  after plans to raise them by .% were scrapped. That means graduates will have to shell out more of their disposable income as wages and prices rise with inflation. The respected Institute for Fiscal Studies warned the freeze will cost £k earners £ a year more than they expected. IFS senior economist Ben Waltmann said it was “a further hit to real incomes”, adding it “effectively constitutes a tax rise by stealth on graduates with middling earnings.” It gets worse further in the future. Students starting university next year will begin paying off their loans when they earn more than £, - down from the existing £,-a-year threshold. And theof time to repay their debt will be extended to  years, up from . The IFS said this will leave poorer graduates paying £, more over their letimes.  . Income tax goes up Rishi Sunak chose to freeze income tax thresholds at a time when inflation is climbing at frightening speed. Youaposll still pay % on earnings over £,, and % on earnings over £,, evenaverage wages rise. According to the Commons library, more than a million more people will be paying a higher rate of income tax by . It will also lead to around . million more workers having their earnings going over the % tax threshold and almost . million more people will be brought into paying the basic level of income tax. The Treasury can expect to net £bn from the move. But, when the impact arrives for Brits, calls from backbenchers for the Government to change course could grow. . Real terms cut to welfare and pensionsBenefits like Universal Credit and pension rates will both rise by .%, £. a month and £. a week respectively.Tory MPs pushed through the plans last month - saying it was in line with inflation. But it’s only in line with what inflation was last Autumn, before prices began to soar at an alarming rate. Meanwhile the pensions triple lock - which would have raised the state pension by more than % - was suspended. Many are warning that this will severely exacerbate the cost-of-living crisis for those who are struggling the most. Foodbank use is expected to climb as a result and the Government is no doubt braced for more interventions from high-profile campaigners such as Man U footballer Marcus Rashford.  . A real-terms cut to childcare help Poor parents will be hit hard by April’s cost-of-living crisis as Tory ministers refuse to raise a crucial childcare allowance - despite soaring inflation. Parents on Universal Credit can claim back % of childcare costs, but only up to a £.-a-month cap - which has not changed since  and is not rising in April. Campaigner and working mum to a four-year-old and Gemma Widdowfield, , told MPs: “We’re all in the midst of a cost-of-living crisis. We’re all feeling the pinch. “My childcare’s going up slightly but the Universal Credit cap isn’t going up at all… that’s going to be passed on to us.” . Real terms cuts to pay - including for NHS and teachers Inflation also means that many planned rises to public sector wages - which are due every April - will be wiped out by prices. Rising prices put huge pressure on the Chancellor to give these vital key workers pay rises above % or %, to avoid hitting them with a real-terms cut. But there are already clear signs the Treasury resisting such big cash rises. The government has spelt out plans to raise salaries for experienced teachers by only % in  . Health unions have also blasted plans to offer NHS staff in England a “miserly” % hike. . Rail fares Okay, we’re cheating here - this one has already come into effect. Rail passengers faced a ticket price nightmare as the steepest increases in almost a decade hit on March . According to industry body the Rail Delivery Group, people in England and Wales are set to shoulder the largest hike in rail ticket prices since January  with fares predicted to go up by .%. Labour has called the price hike brutal and campaign group Railfuture has accused Boris Johnsonaposs Government of “stoking the fire of the cost of living crisis” by enabling the increase.Ministers regulate rises in around half of fares including season tickets on most commuter routes.

Cabinet Office officials insisted it was not possible to reveal the amount spent on the probe because it was buried in existing budgets. Campaign group Unlock Democracy sought to force the Cabinet Office to publish the cost to the taxpayer of investigations relating to lockdown rule-busting parties in Number  and across Whitehall. But the department refused to break down the cost, arguing it was funded from the Cabinet Office existing core administration budget for the financial year  . Tom Brake, Director of Unlock Democracy said: “This smells of a cover-up.  He added: “We will be appealing. The Sue Gray inquiry is a major drain on the Cabinet Officeaposs budget and it is inconceivable that nobody is keeping a record of how much investigating covid lockdown parties will cost the department.” Sources estimated the cost of the probe could be as high as £,, the Sunday Mirror revealed last month. And up to £, more could be being splashed on the Met’s investigation into lockdown-busting parties in Downing Street, as police officers st through hundreds of photographs, CCTV images and other evidence.Mr Brake added: “The refusal to provide this information is about avoiding embarrassment for the PM and other Ministers. “They donapost want the public to know how much the inquiry into their rule-breaking cost the taxpayer. A Cabinet Office spokesperson said: The investigation was carried out against published terms of reference by civil servants in the Cabinet Office, funded by existing budgets.

The result reflects the world’s horror at the illegal actions of Vladimir Putin which has led to the slaughter of countless innocent lives.The words of condemnation must now be matched by a further tightening of the screw on Russian business and finance. The UK Government has acted swtly in cutting off banks and banning Russian planes from our airspace but has lagged behind the US and the EU in imposing other sanctions. Unlike Brussels we have still to freeze the assets of the members of the Russian Parliament. Dozens of Putin’s cronies and high-ranking military have yet to be targeted. The Tories have allowed London to become the world’s laundromat for Russian dirty money. They have also taken millions in donations from people with ties to the Kremlin. If they are serious about putting pressure on the Russian regime they should widen sanctions andthe donations. The longer they take to act, the more the suspicion grows that they are still in thrall to the oligarchs.  The best of us While Vladimir Putin has shown the worst of humanity with his brutal invasion, the public response to his vile actions has shown the best of humanity. Millions of people have donated to charities to help the people of Ukraine and the hundreds of thousands made homeless by the war. Some volunteers have even driven to the Polish-Ukrainian border to deliver much-needed medical supplies, food, clothes and toys for children. Their compassion has never been more necessary. A blood hound Hero dog Arnie is retiring after donating  pints of blood in his letime that have helped more than  other pets. Thankfully this real blood hound was not terrier-fied of needles.

Ukraine will prove the fatal, final mistake by a fascistic gangster who egotistically believed his own invincible propaganda after strategic triumphs in Crimea and Syria, and the  Trump and Brexit blows delivered to the US and UK. Vlad the Invader’s twitchy finger on the nuclear trigger and the offer of Potemkin negotiations are both signs even he fears this is an impending personal Armageddon. This is fuelled by brave Ukrainians fighting heroically and Russians courageously protesting “No to War”, which is inspiring resistance around the world. Supplying anti-tank, helicopter and aircraft missiles strengthens defenders and weakens attackers already suffering punishing losses. Britain, the rest of Europe and the US finally uniting over economic and cultural sanctions will eventually bankrupt the Putin machine and perhaps drive a deep wedge between the tyrant and his billionaire cronies who enjoy opulent luxury wherever they please.  And China abstaining instead of vetoing a UN Security Council motion by the US condemning the brutal invasion emphasised Putin’s isolation, as a new ally quickly distanced itself from an ageing, deranged dictator. The bloody conflict could still belong: reducing Ukrainian neighbourhoods to rubble, inflicting unbearable heartache and costing countless lives. What is becoming clearer, however, is that Putin is also likely to be one of the victims. But let’s not buy charlatan Boris Johnson’s propaganda that he is suddenly an international statesman, a Prime Minister orchestrating the resistance. Johnson let Putin walk all over him and Britain, with oligarchs smirking unconcerned whenever ruling Conservatives, reliant on Russian-linked money, talked tough then acted soft.Charismatic, cool-headed, defiant Ukrainian Volodymyr Zelensky is what a real leader looks and sounds like. Germany’s centre-Left Olaf Scholz is also rising to the occasion, standing up to Putin at considerable financial expense. A European Union that Johnson ripped Britain from as part of a career move was firmer on sanctions until shamed Johnson started running to catch up. Locking out Ukrainian refugees fleeing terror unless they apply to be fruit pickers is disgraceful and inhuman, when Poland, Romania and Hungary open their borders. Why not seize the spacious British properties of Russian oligarchs to house Putin’s casualties  I’ve watched and known Johnson for longer than the  years Putin has misruled Russia. So I’m aware of the cynicism of the great charlatan. From coronavirus to Brexit, our daily politics newsletter is there to guide you these turbulent times. The newsletter is sent out twice daily with the latest UK  world politics news, along with leading opinion and analysis.You can sign up here.  The first casualty of war is Partygate, with Johnson relieved that the shells and missiles are effectively providing a smokescreen. If he’s hit by a fine, the PM will pray it is today. Now wouldn’t be the moment to remove a lawbreaker in Downing Street, his apologists will argue. They’d be wrong, of course. Chamberlain was dumped by MPs to be replaced by Churchill during the Second World War then, before Japan finally surrendered, the country swapped Churchill for Attlee. Labour leader Keir Starmer will inevitably receive less airtime than the PM but should have calculated that he must be constructively critical rather than mercilessly pummelling the Tory rogue. War in Europe might save Johnsonnot an invaded country or Putin.

Is your partner excessively jealous and possessive  Is your partner charming one minute and abusive the next  Does your partner have sudden changes of mood – like Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde  Is your partner stopping you from seeing your family and friends  Do you feel isolated  Is your partner constantly criticizing you and putting you down in public  Does your partner embarrass you, often in front of family and friends, so that you are seen in a bad light  Does your partner play mind games and make you unsure of your own judgment  Does your partner tell you you’re useless and couldn’t cope without them  Does your partner control your money  Does your partner tell you what to wear, who to see, where to go, what to think  Does your partner pressure you to have sex when you don’t want to  Are you starting to walk on eggshells to avoid making your partner angry  Does your partner monitor your movements  Or check up on you via your email, Facebook, Twitter or by looking at your text messages  Does your partner use anger and intimidation to frighten you and make you comply with his demands  Has your partner ever threatened you, or intimidated you by using violent language or smashing up the furniture  Are you forced to alter your behaviour because you are frightened of your partner’s reaction  Are you blamed for their behaviour e.g. they say you were asking for it or deserved the abuse If you answered yes to any of the above questions, then you may be experiencing domestic violence. Abuse is a crime and it is never your fault. You don’t have to deal with this alone. Call the freephone National Domestic Violence Helpline at any time on   . Source: Refuge.org Mr Jones said: She describes him as aposspoiling for an argumentapos. The defendant was pushing his fists together asto intimidate her and eventually, when she was sitting on a couch, he punched her in the face while shouting aposI will f***ing kill youapos. The court heard he punched her another three to four times and she lost count due to her shock. Mr Jones said after the attack, he was still aggressive and wouldnapost let her out of his sight. Eventually, she asked to use the toilet and went to the bathroom and rang the police at .am. The line then went dead but officers arrived shortly afterwards. Davies tried to get Adele to hide, then fled into the back garden. Mr Jones said Davies injured his face while trying to escape over a fence and was arrested. Adele was taken to hospital, where she was found to have a closed fracture of the orbital facial bone, but fortunately her eye was not damaged. Davies tried to lay the blame on Adele and even claimed to be the victim of domestic violence. He initially stated she had fallen, banging her eye due to being in drink, and alleged he had been assaulted by her, causing his injury with a bottle, Mr Jones said. He added: The police were careful to check. There was no blood in the house. It was found on the fence. Davies, of Fishers Lane, Pensby, later admitted wounding. The court heard he has convictions dating back to when he was a boy, including burglaries as a teenager.  He was convicted of assault in , assault causing actual bodily harm in , assault in  and wounding in . In March  he was convicted of causing grievous bodily harm with intent and given the IPP, with a recommended minimum term of three and a half years. In June  he was jailed for  years for the cocaine plot and having a gun. Davies has since been convicted of assaulting an emergency worker in July . Charles Lander, defending, said Davies had been recalled on his Imprisonment for Public Protection order, meaning whatever sentence he received, he would not be released at the halfway stage.He will instead have to convince the Parole Board he is no longer a risk to the public before he is released. There was no victim personal statement or request for a restraining order from Adele, who wrote a letter in support of Davies. Mr Lander said: What she does say, Your Honour, is he has never acted like that with her before. He said when released from jail, Davies made very impressive strides and was determined to lead a law-abiding lestyle. The court heard Davies gained qualications, started working on the railways and was described by his family as a very much dferent man. However, Mr Lander said at the time of the attack Davies - who didnapost drink normally - had been drinking alcohol. He said it was nearly the first anniversary of his mumaposs death and Davies had also been thinking about the tragic death of his then -year-old daughter in , which happened shortly after he was locked up. Mr Lander said: He was let out to attend the chapel. Thereafter heaposs had to suffer and spend many years in prison thinking about the fact he missed the last days of his -year-old daughter. Judge: aposShe was clearly petriedapos He added that clearly Davies was in a relationship with Adele. She says he was kind, he was loving and he had achieved so much, so she was shocked by his behaviour, Mr Lander told the judge. The judge, Recorder Ian Harris, told Davies it was a domestic relationship, which you breached signicantly with your violence towards her. He said police received a call from a clearly petried woman. Recorder Harris said he was sure Davies suffered his injury while trying to escape and there was no evidence to support his claim Adele assaulted him. The judge said he was impressed by the efforts Davies had made since being released from jail, which allowed you to be employed full time by Network Rail. He said: Itaposs of course a tragedy that your offending on this occasion has put paid to all those efforts. Davies was jailed for  months, who replied: Thanks, Your Honour - Iaposm sorry for everything thataposs gone on.

A little-known Highway Code rule bans drivers from snoozing in their vehicle - with punishments ranging from a £, fine,  license points, or imprisonment. The rule - which is part of the road traffic act and the Highway Code - makes it illegal to be inside your car when drunk regardless of what youaposre doing. Evenyouaposre found fast asleep in the car, you could still be considered illegally in control of the vehicleyouaposre over the limit, My London reports.Sleeping in your car when youaposre drunk comes under the Road Traffic Act .  It says a motorist can be found guilty of the offencethey are in charge of a motor vehicle on a road or other public place after consuming so much alcohol that the proportion of it in his breath, blood or urine exceeds the prescribed limit. The rule is in place because there is no guarantee that a person will not try to drive when they wake up still under the influence - the law has to foresee that possibility. Depending on how much alcohol you have consumed you might need to consider spending the night at a hotel until you sober up. Other alternatives include getting a lt home from a friend or family member or trying to get a taxi.  The no-sleeping drunk rule comes under drink driving laws and a recent campaign has been set up to try and limit the damage that drunk driving is causing on our roads. It was made by THINK! and actively discourages the main group of drunk drivers, young men. Liz Brooker MBE, Chair of Road Safety Great Britain, told My London : “Road Safety Great Britain fully supports the THINK! Pint Block campaign. Someone who gets in their car after drinking is a risk to themselves, and all others on the road,including their friends.“This campaign highlights the role everyone has to play in reducing the number of people who drive, using the power of friendship to encourage safer driving and the need to protect those we care about.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON AlcoholDangerous drivingCarsVehicles\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The code states people shouldnapost undertake other motorists for being slow on the motorway. While many drivers do so, you could receive a hefty fineyouaposre spotted. While there is no law about it, undertaking recklessly could see you hit with three penalty points and a £ fine either for careless driving, or driving without due care and attention. Some police forces may offer a driver education course as an alternative,Birmingham Livereports.Rule  of The Highway Code states: In congested conditions, where adjacent lanes of traffic are moving at similar speeds, traffic in left-hand lanes may sometimes be moving faster than traffic to the right.  In these conditions you may keep up with the traffic in your lane eventhis means passing traffic in the lane to you right. Do not weave in and out of lanes to overtake. While there is no specic law prohibiting undertaking, it could easily be a dangerous manoeuvre - which would be illegal. If the vehicle is travelling in the middle lane when the lane to its left is clear, the driver could be given a fixed penalty by police and depending on the circumstances, any driver undertaking that vehicle on the left could also face a penalty. Undertaking is when you overtake on the inside lane. When you overtake a slower vehicle on the road using a lane that is kerb side to the vehicle you are passing. In the UK this would be a lane to the right of the vehicle being passed. This happens usually on roads where there is more than one lane in the same direction, such as motorways. Where traffic is congested and everyone is moving at similar speeds you may be able to undertake to keep up with traffic in your lane even though it means you pass vehicles in the lane to your right. However, you shouldnapost weave in and out of the lanes to get ahead. The Code strongly advises that you avoid overtaking generally and you can get into troubleyou decide to move across three lanes.

Roaring Girls, by Holly Kyte, retells the extraordinary lives of eight women who revolutionised the way we see women today. If these women were men, they would already be household names, Holly tells the Sunday Mirror. Womenaposs history wasnapost written about because it wasnapost considered interesting or important enough to record. Here are Hollyaposs Roaring Girls... . Mary Frith Mary was of the most outrageous and controversial women of the th and th centuries, who made her living as a thief deep in Londonaposs underworld, earning her the persona Moll Cutpurse. But Holly argues Mary is a Roaring Girl for refusing to bow to conformity, using cross-dressing to enrage society, and being an “audacious and irreverent woman”.  . Margaret Cavandish Margaret was a th-century poet and philosopher who wrote in her own name in a period when most women writers remained anonymous, challenging the social belief that men were inferior to women. Holly says it’s hard to “overstate how daring it was” for her to publish her own writing.  .

Charlotte CharkeCharlotte was an th-century actress, theatre manager and cross-dresser, at a time when it was highly unusual for a woman to run a theatre.

Hannah Snell Hannah was an th-century performer who disguised herself as a man and became a soldier. For nearly five years she lived and fought as a man, sailing to Lisbon with the th Regiment of Foot.  For hundreds of years, the aposno women allowedapos rule in the army meant that their role in the forces had to be unofficial or covert. Holly says Hannah proved women are just as capable of fighting as men centuries before they were finally allowed to do so.  . Mary Prince Mary was an th and th-century slave who became the first black woman to publish her le story in Britain - despite being illiterate. Holly says she didnapost just publish her history, but she made history.  . Anne Lister Made famous by Suranne Jonesapos acclaimed portrayal in Gentleman Jack, Anne was the first modern lesbian, with Holly saying she is an LGBT icon who helped reclaim womenaposs bodies and desires.  . Caroline Norton Caroline was a th-century writer and womenaposs rights campaigner, whose work led to the passage of the Custody of Infants Act , the Matrimonial Causes Act  and the Married Womenaposs Property Act.

Known as Urbanexboi, he visited the abandoned site of Mount Wise Nuclear Bunker in February. The bunker, which can be found in Plymouth, has been abandoned for more than a decade but is in surprisingly good condition considering it hasnapost been used for many years. It is thought to have enough space for hundreds of people and is littered with old phones and ancient signs from a bygone era. The -year-old urban explorer said: I think you could easily fit  or more people inside of the bunker.  My favourite part of being able to explore the abandoned bunker was seeing all of the old signs and items, such as wind up phones, that had been left there. I have previously had a tour of the abandoned bunker many years ago as they were closing up operations. It was strange then but to now see it empty with no staff or security at the entrance to check credentials was even more surreal.The structure is thought to have been empty for more than  years and has suffered some damage inside by vandals.The invasion of Ukraine by Putin makes the shelter all the more poignant.And the explorer reckons the MoD may want the bunker back the war were to escalate. The bunker itself is in good condition considering itaposs been empty for over  years, although a few rooms have sadly been trashed by people who have been inside. It wouldnapost surprise methe Ministry of Defence took over the premises againthings escalated.The Mirror told yesterday about another nuclear bunker which had been put on the market by a property agent.The Cold War hideaway has been put on sale for £,.

The district of Hodge Hill, four miles east of Birmingham city centre, is officially the country’s worst-hit area for fuel poverty. It is a place where schoolkids hand over lunchbox treats for poorer, hungrier children. And where even the homeless make contributions to foodbanks. The constituency is home to , people and nearly a third of families live in fuel poverty. It has one of the highest child poverty rates, with an astonishing % of youngsters – nearly , – living below the breadline. Unemployment is .% – one of the highest in the UK.Go behind the Government statistics, as the Sunday People did, and you find desperate families struggling to put food on the table amid a double whammy of fuel bills and price rises at the shops. Many pensioners choose between heating and eating and hordes of families visit foodbanks daily. They include nurses, who don’t earn enough to feed their families.Hodge Hill’s Labour MP Liam Byrne tells us: “It’s absolutely shameful. But it’s not unusual. The reality of Boris Johnson ’s Britain is that we have lockdown heroes who don’t earn enough to feed their families. It makes me absolutely enraged. And it’s always the people with nothing who give the most.“One homeless man came up to us at a foodbank collection asking what we were doing. When we told him, he handed over his own food.  “We literally have the homeless donating their food to us. That’s how desperate the situation is. “We’re in pretty much the poorest postcode in the country and the generosity is incredible. “You see children taking Penguin biscuits out of their lunchboxes to give to a foodbank, saying they didn’t want to see people going without. “We have people with nothing willing to help their neighbours, and a Prime Minister who parties on like there’s no tomorrow, oblivious to what’s going on in real lives.”  Mr Byrne spoke after we uncovered statistics revealing almost one in three hard-pressed people in the West Midlands has had to cut down on essential food items in the past three months. As the UK braces itself for a % energy price hike next month, new research from the Post Office and foodbank charity the Trussell Trust shows huge numbers are in crisis across Britain. Their surveys reveal % of Brits have had to make cutbacks to afford food and household bills. In the West Midlands % have less cash for food and half fear worse is to come. It’s not much better in London where % had to limit spending.What do you think  Have your say in our comments below... Figures from the Department of Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy show . million UK families were in fuel poverty in . Again, the West Midlands was worst hit, with , homes – or % – affected.At Aston and Nechells foodbank, where Suzi Lea is the co-ordinator, volunteers have seen the numbers of people coming through its doors increasing since the £ Universal Credit uplt was scrapped last year. Volunteer Keith Crawford , , and his husband Velta , , have had to rely on the foodbank themselves.Keith says: “That extra £ meant people had dignity. We treat animals better than people in this country. Week in, week out we are seeing broken people come through our doors.  “We see the whole cross-section of society. Since the uplt was removed, we have had starving people coming through the doors who we have had to offer a biscuit and a drink to. “It’s never been this bad. We had so many people through the doors one day over Christmas that we gave out  meals and stayed open longer. “One man who came in had to choose between eating and showering. How can people live in dignity and how can people go to job interviews in an area of already high unemployment when they can’t afford to shower  It becomes a vicious circle of poverty.”Family support worker Atia Parveen , who goes into the foodbank to offer debt advice, says people have become trapped by money problems.The Mirroraposs newsletter brings you the latest news, exciting showbiz and TV stories, sport updates and essential political information.The newsletter is emailed out first thing every morning, at noon and every evening. Never miss a moment by signing up to our newsletter here.  She adds: “Foodbanks are never intended as long-term solutions, so we’re here to help people budget. “But since Covid and now the cost-of-living crisis, we are seeing double trouble. “Helping people budget doesn’t get them out of crisis because they have nothing and prices continue to rise. We are trapped.”Care giver Marlene Taes , , collects food for the youngsters she supports. She says: “There are no opportunities for young people in the city. “We are seeing more and more vulnerable young people who don’t have jobs to go to, the ­training to support them or the services to help them get out of poverty so they can find work.”At Welcome Change Community Centre and Cafe, which helps vulnerable people and hosts lunch clubs throughout the week, we meet Lin Morris , . She is reliant on the centre and her grandchildren, who also provide her with food.Lin, who is registered disabled and is in assisted living, tells us: “I am one of the lucky ones, but without the extra support and help I get from my family I think I’d be dead within the year.” Married PatandTony Flynn , , fear the impact of “skyrocketing” prices on fuel and groceries.Their daughter’s food bill for her and her -year-old son has gone up from £ to £ a week. Of fuel, Pat, , says: “We are really worried because our pensions aren’t going to reflect the price hike. “It would mean us having to choose between heating or eating.”Full-time mum Jenner Gadson , , who has Ruby, eight, and Jack, four, has also seen her food shop more than double to over £. “There isn’t any extra support coming in from the Government to help,” she says. Childminder Karen Watson , , is struggling to meet weekly bills of more than £. She tells us: “All of the families I help are telling me worse and worse stories every week – and are even struggling to pay childminding fees.”Despite the bleak outlook, community spirit is, thankfully, alive and well in Hodge Hill. Pat Woolridge , , has been volunteering at the foodbank since it opened nine years ago.She says: “I am astonished by how much worse it has got over the pandemic. We have seen homelessness go up in the last few months too.” But amid a pile of donations, Pat packages toys, gts and books donated for local children. It brings a smile to her face. And she adds, with stoicism typical of Hodge Hill folk: “We’re really lucky to live here.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Trussell TrustEconomic crisisFuel povertyPrice risesUnemploymentBritish economyHomelessnessPoliticsSunday MirrorSunday People\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Ahead of this year’s International Women’s Day on Tuesday, we’ve asked some of the UK’s most inspirational women what being female means to them – and why women are still being held back today. STEF REID, PARALYMPIAN My mum Carol was always ahead of her time. I will never forget, we were away on a weekend with my dad and his friends. The men were playing a golf competition to see who could get closest to the hole. They all took a shot, they were about to see who the winner was, when my mum said, ‘Hang on, I want a go.’ She took a shot and won. It proves gender doesn’t matter. I can go out and compete with men, it’s not a barrier.  It’s happened a few times when I’ve felt like people were more interested in working with a male. It makes you feel small and want to shrink. My biggest female inspiration is Chantal Petitclerc – she is widely regarded as the best wheelchair racer of all time. She told me there is no one path to excellence. You have to forge your own path and be brave enough to do that.  GLORIA HUNNIFORD, TV PRESENTER WHO IS TEAMING UP WITH FELLOW ITV HOSTS TO PROMOTE INTERNATIONAL WOMEN’S DAY An elderly woman in Dublin stopped me last year and whispered, ‘I love that Loose Women... you talk about sex and we were never allowed to!’ These days, we can discuss any subject – and that’s a big change. I grew up in a conservative house in Ireland watching my mother desperate to do something, but Dad wouldn’t allow her to have a job. It was dferent for me. I liked the independence that work gave me. I thought I was going to be a singer until I met a forward-thinking BBC producer who convinced me otherwise.It was  and the start of the troubles in Northern Ireland. He said, ‘Remember, as a woman you’re not coming here to do knitting and sewing and recipes. You will be as good as ANY man reporting on bombs, bullets and barricades just like them.’ He was the key to making me feel like I could do this job.  JESS PHILLIPS, LABOUR MP AND SHADOW MINISTER FOR DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND SAFEGUARDINGThe women of the  general election changed my le. I wouldn’t be hereit wasn’t for them – they knew young mums needed support with childcare. They built a ladder for women like me. My mum was like Erin Brockovich.She was a freedom fighter. She sued the biggest pharmaceutical company in the country because they blinded my nan. She still inspires me every day. Women face many of the same challenges in  that they did in . They are still lower paid, they are still not safe in their homes, in their workplaces and on the streets.  On International Women’s Day, I want women to know they should never be grateful for progress made – they should always be desperate for more. KATIE PIPER, ACTIVIST The survivors and volunteers I have met through my charity, The Katie Piper Foundation, are the women who have taught me I can do anything. I have felt discriminated against – not only because I’m female, but because my appearance isn’t society’s ‘norm’.  Gender-based discrimination happens every single day, in so many dferent circumstances. Conversation helps and we need to keep having open, honest conversations. My mum Diane is my biggest female inspiration – she is the definition of a strong, resilient woman. I’ll teach both of my girls that the world is their oyster, and I’ll do what I can to make that path easy for them – as a mother and as a woman. ANGELA RAYNER, DEPUTY LEADER OF THE LABOUR PARTY Women are just brilliant, aren’t they  I am incredibly lucky to be surrounded by a huge iety of wonderful women in every part of my le. It is because of the encouragement of the women I worked with that I became their Trade Union rep. And it was a woman, my mum in the movement, Sue Forster, that dragged me into becoming so involved with UNISON and ultimately becoming an MP.My best friends from school, the women that I caused mischief with as a teenager are still some of my best friends today. They supported me through a teen pregnancy when none of us had any money and absolutely no clue.My women MP friends are brilliant and I am proud to be able to navigate the weird world of Westminster alongside them. We celebrate each other’s successes and we protect each other when it gets rough.What do you think  Have your say in our comments below... When I was younger, I donapost think I never saw feminism as something for me. I was a social carer raising a tiny child on my own, feminists were white middle-class women asking for a place at the boardroom table. But I learnt that wasn’t the case. Feminism is creating the space for each of us to authentically be ourselves, without fear of discrimination or harm. Feminism has plenty of space for gobby northern gingers. I am only where I am because of the love, encouragement and kindness I was shown by women for many years.Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here. International Women’s Day is a moment for us to celebrate what it means to be ourselves and commit for another year to be there for each other. If you do nothing  this International Women’s Day, please join me in sending a postcard, a note or a text to woman you think is wonderful and telling them why - it might just be the little boost they need. JESSICA-JANE APPLEGATE, PARALYMPIC SWIMMER AND MENCAP AMBASSADOR I come from a single-parent family and my mum has been the biggest influence in my le, she has taught me so much. My auntie also taught me cheeky, naughty things when I was younger but that was to wind my mum up! My nanny also used to take me out into the garden and teach me about flowers and butterflies. I struggle with my mental health and I love being in nature - I find it helps. My learning disability affects me daily in everything from my organisation skills, reading and writing abilities to my training at the pool. I rely on the support around me for so much and my coach Alex is amazing. Before a race, she used to make me flip charts of small pictures to take with me to keep me calm.  For many years I havenapost been able to compete at the Commonwealth Games, not because Iaposm not fast enough or because my classication wasnapost included - but because men were included but women were not. This made me angry to start with and I had to watch my teammates get all their lovely kit and go off to competitions I wasn’t allowed at. In the end I had an opportunity with Mencap to raise the issue in Parliament. Never did I think the rules would change in my career, but only two weeks ago I raced in Aberdeen and got the qualying time. International Womenaposs Day is important to me because I try to campaign for inclusion for everyone and women in sport is really important, so this day is the day we can celebrate and promote all the fantastic female role models out there as well as share stories of inspiration. I would say to young girls who have a learning disability: you can achieve anything, anything is possible! DR SAGIDA BIBI, SENIOR POST-DOCTORAL RESEARCHERAT THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD AND MEMBER OF THE OXFORD VACCINE GROUP I am first generation born in the UK after my parents arrived here from Pakistan. Education in Pakistani communities across the UK was not seen as a priority for girls at the time. I didn’t know any Muslim or Pakistani female that had gone to university or into science. There are still many girls that don’t have strong female role models in their families and communities but that should not deter them.  When I looked around when I was younger it seemed like success and careers weren’t for people like me. You never felt quite good enough and this is reinforced through dficult experiences like racism and prejudice that you face growing up. I don’t think I ever thought I would be going to university because the concept was never instilled either at home or school. If you keep striving for the next step evenyou don’t have your whole future mapped out, then you quickly realise that you are on an uncharted but exciting path. I didn’t get my PhD until I was  – but I didn’t give up. Even when people told me I wouldn’t make it – that it was too late, too dficult or my grades weren’t good enough. It’s important that you remember your strengths not your weaknesses and don’t let anybody ’s expectations for you define your future path. It is important to recognise that barriers for people of colour – let alone women – in educational and employment workplaces still exist and we are still striving for better representation in the scientic fields. I am part of a fantastic group and a scientist that helped develop the Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid vaccine and still get amazed that the girl at school who wasn’t even sure she should do A-levels made it this far. I get to work alongside some of the greatest researchers in the world and help some of the poorest to get the vaccines that they should – and that’s a privilege that I never take for granted. My message to all girls and women out there that might just be thinking they are not good enough – you are more than good enough and will excelyou just keep moving forward towards your goals. SAS GRANVILLE, FOOTBALL COACH AND MENCAP AMBASSADOR  Growing up I was always taught the importance of being respectful and caring of everyone. I have cerebral palsy and a learning disability and so have to adapt many of the things I do that most people consider to be ‘normal’ or ‘day to day’. I have been very lucky to have some great female role models around me both in my immediate family and some of the kind people who have supported me. My older sister, Roxy, has taught me some invaluable le lessons. Most notably, the importance of taking time to appreciate yourself for who you really are, and to embrace being dferent. My mum has also helped me to grow into a confident and independent young woman. Without her support and encouragement, I would not be where I am today. I work hard to make sure my disability doesn’t limit me and view it as a part of my le that I live with. I really appreciate it when people acknowledge and consider this and ask how they can help, rather than making assumptions or sometimes not seeing and noticing. From a young age, I always looked up to my grandma who taught me some of the most important le skills. She was a kind, patient and lovable person who always had time for everyone. International Women’s Day is a great opportunity to highlight fantastic achievements and the importance of dference. I would say never give up on your dreams and don’t let anyone bring you down. Keep doing what makes you happy and build strong relationships with female role models around you. But most of all, don’t let anyone ever tell you that you can’t do something because of your disability or your gender. DR MAHESHI RAMASAMY, SENIOR CLINICAL RESEARCHER AT THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD AND MEMBER OF THE OXFORD VACCINE GROUP It is a really extraordinary time for women in science. In many ways the pandemic has impacted adversely on women in terms of increases in domestic violence, women seeing their careers impacted and women having to bear the brunt of childcare.  But I am grateful that women’s roles in healthcare and science have been highlighted and celebrated. When I started out as a junior doctor  years ago, there were very few female consultants and female role models. It’s been incredible to see how much the situation has changed. There has been a real sht in the numbers of women in my specialty, but we still have a long way to go when we look at senior management. I hope in ten years’ time it will change again.  I am very lucky to come from a family that celebrates female education and where working women have been the norm. My great-grandmother was a real trailblazer of her time - she was the first woman to be a school principal in Sri Lanka. And my mother was a scientist. That’s quite unusual in an Asian background like mine. It has never occurred to me to not pursue the career I wanted because I have been surrounded by these amazing women who have always done what they wanted to do. And there are so many women we can look up to now who are reaching those peaks - Baroness Hale was incredible as President of the Supreme Court. For a woman of her generation to have got to her level is an extraordinary achievement. And to see a woman of colour like Kamala Harris become US Vice President is pretty remarkable. I hope we can reach the stage where we can talk about them not because they are women, but just because they are amazing people. I am glad International Women’s Day exists - but it’s a shame we need to have an International Women’s Day at all.Sas and Jessica-Jane are Myth Busters for the learning disability charity Mencap.

Our heartwarming photo shows a beaming Denise Fergus cradling tiny Peyton, who has turned her le around. Denise sees tiny flashes of James in the tot, who is now  months old. And when the toddler visits, she is always drawn to the picture of a smiling boy on the mantelpiece. The little boy she sits and stares at is two-year-old James, who was tragically abducted and ­murdered  years ago by two evil killers, both aged .In an exclusive interview, Denise told the Sunday People how her granddaughter has “helped remind her of the happiness in the world”. She said: “Peyton has been a power of strength for us and helped the light come back into our lives after James. “Her dad Michael looks so much like James and I can see him in Peyton, too. It’s lovely.” Denise will tell Peyton about her uncle James one day but said her granddaughter “is a reminder to try to focus on the happiness in our lives, not the tragedy”. She added: “There is not a day I don’t think of James and now having Peyton in our lives gives me even more strength to fight in his name.” And Denise needed all that strength last month when it was revealed Jon Venables, , one of James’ killers, is bidding for parole. He will appear at a hearing later this year. She said: “I’m living an amazing le and most the time I’m flying with ­happiness but when this comes up it drags me back down again. “It just ­deflates me, it’s just so hard. It’s been never-ending. “But I will fight with everything I possibly can to keep him in prison. It is a le battle. I’ve done it from the ­beginning and I’ll do it until the end.”  Denise, , who has three other sons – Thomas, Leon and Michael – will ­never accept an ­apology from Venables, or speak to him, saying: “I don’t believe he’ll ever be sorry. He should never be allowed back on the streets.” She and husband Stuart are also battling to keep the James Bulger Memorial Trust alive after fundraising was blighted by Covid and they received no Government help. The charity foundation helps young people affected by a crime or bereavement by ­offering them stays at a ­holiday lodge. James’ brutal torture and murder in  at the hands of Venables and Robert Thompson shocked the nation. The twisted pair snatched James from Denise as she was out shopping in Bootle, Merseyside. They were jailed but also given lelong anonymity and new ­identities following their release. Venables was first released in  but then recalled in  and  for possession of child abuse images. Thompson, also , is now free and is living under a new identity. Denise said: “What happened to James is something I think about every day. It has got easier over time but especially when something comes up like it just has, it comes back. I don’t think I’ll ever be able to sht that off. “I’m hoping and praying he doesn’t get ­released because he’s still capable of evil. He’s proven to everyone that he’s still got it and that’s why he’s locked up again.  “I thinkhe comes out he will do something ­because he’s so used to ­being looked after now. He’s a danger to society. I don’t want another family to go through what my family has been through – you’re on a rollercoaster ride from the beginning. He knows where I live, he knows what I look like. I’m not getting told where he lives and I don’t know what he looks like. “Now the lads are older and we’ve got the new baby I’m going to be ­worried. I don’t knowhe’s going to be standing outside my house while we’re all sleeping. “I’m hoping to God he doesn’t find out where Michael lives.” Denise was told by her lawyer that Venables had askedhe could speak to her and say sorry. She said: “I wouldn’t accept his apology. What would he expect me to say. It’s OK  When you murdered my boy in the worst possible way  You can apologise over saying something wrong, but not taking someone’s le.” She also hit out at the criminal justice system, saying: “How much money has he had spent on him  “New identity, new le, protection, yet we live on the edge of our seat. They always look after the one who taken someone’s le and not the victims. It’s wrong on every level, the law should be changed on that.” Denise and Stuart have taken solace in their family. Thomas, Leon and Michael lived at home with her until recently. In November , Michael and partner Leanne had Peyton, Denise’s first grandchild.Denise said: “She’s an absolute doll. She’s such a good baby, she hardly ever cries, she’s walking everywhere, she’s just a joy. She’s at that stage whereyou give her a chocolate bar it doesn’t stay in her hand, it’s all over your furniture.” Leanne thinks Peyton looks a lot like Denise but the new gran said: “We can see Michael more in her. It’s more her eyes than anything. Of course, you have moments when you remember James at that age. “Having our family has helped so much. You could be having a down day but then the front door opens and in they come, that gives you the lt then, it changes your mood and changes the day for you. “It’s just lovely to have them around and we’re always there for them as well. “The years have gone so quick it’s just unbelievable. You see them as babies but now they’re grown men and we’re ­grandparents now.” Last month, the family went to James’ grave, which they call his “resting place”, to mark the th anniversary of his death. But Denise said Peyton’s presence the past two years has altered the ­atmosphere around the date for the family. She said: “She changed the mood on James’ anniversary last year and this. We talk amongst ourselves and we talk about James, but when Peyton came along – it’s still about James – but Peyton takes our attention. Although there’s the grim side, we still give our time to Peyton. She takes me back to when we had James and our lads. We’ve got this new baby in our lives and we absolutely adore and treasure her.”  Michael said: “When it was the anniversary of James in February they came to ours. You could see the smile on the face from Denise having the baby there. It just took her mind off what the day should have been, this little bundle. It was really nice to see.” The family have cleaned the ground at James’ resting place, laid new grass and got a new wrought-iron frame made. Denise said: “Michael brings Peyton to James’ resting place and it’s nice he makes her a part of it. At Christmas Eve we go and put up a Christmas tree for James. We always have a star that goes on top of the tree at Christmas Eve and that’s always been Michael’s job. Maybe it’s something he and Peyton can do ­together this year.” They also have a quiet place in honour of James behind their home in Merseyside – James’ Garden. Denise said: “Because James isn’t here to spend the money on, we put the money into our own ­private little garden. “We’ve got a fish pond out there we’ve got a ­waterfall fountain thing with Christmas lights. “It’s a constant reminder of him for us.” Later this month, Denise and Stuart are hosting the Black Tie and Tiara Ball for the James Bulger Memorial Trust. Denise said: “It’s so good to be fundraising again in James’ name and for his trust. Lockdown made it really dficult and we seriously had to consider whether to close the trust, such was the upkeep of the lodge and other things. “We also had to cancel on the eve of a big charity ball which would’ve marked James’ th birthday because of Covid. “Since then we’ve struggled – we’re not the only ones. But now we’re back. We have got a good line-up – Claire Sweeney and a Jersey Boys tribute act. It will be a great night.” Denise added: “Sometimes I feel like throwing my cards down and saying I’ve had enough. But then I speak to Stuart and the lads, and look at Peyton. “And I did make that promise to James and I will stand by it. I’ll always keep ­going for him.”The Black Tie and Tiara Ball in aid of the James Bulger Memorial Trust is on Saturday, March , at the Crowne Plaza, Liverpool.

The mystery was deepened further by the fact both cars are silver and appear to be the same model, although pictures show one of the vehicles has a dent in the rear bumper. A quick search on the DVLA vehicle checker shows that the number plate is registered to a silver Mercedes and it is taxed until February , with an MOT due in the same period.John Gargett, a lelong resident who has become a crime-fighting crusader on the troubled estate, first spotted the two vehicles, reports YorkshireLive.

Putin raised the awful spectre of nuclear confrontation because he’s losing, or at least not winning as easily as he expected. His calamitous miscalculation in invading Ukraine is backfiring badly now, and the world is uniting against him. He faces a battle at home too, as anti-war protests swell in Moscow and other cities. The pressure on Putin must be intensied, never relaxed, until he has withdrawn the last of his forces from the country he attacked.  And then he must face judgement. He must be held to account for an unforgivable assault that will cost many lives on both sides, including civilians. Many more are being forced to flee their homes in terror. Britain has sent military equipment and is picking up speed on sanctions but much more can be done to help Ukraine. Oligarchs close to Putin must be pursued relentlessly. And we should take in our share of Ukrainian refugees.

Tweeting about her shock, she said: “I am shocked to find out that the oranges I was trying to buy all day are not vegan. Pfft.” She had been searching for the Tesco Finest Emperor Oranges  Pack, but couldnapost buy them due to her choice of diet. Non-vegan fruits were also found in Marks and Spencer and Morrisons. The fruits themselves are of course vegan, but they are classed as unsuitable due to the chemicals sprayed on them as they grow. Farmers often use pesticides to make the fruit look better, and grow larger. Imazalil - banned in all but tiny amounts - is the common non-vegan item used by growers on their fruit and veg.  The E version of the chemical, as it will be shown on any label, is a wax made of shellac. There are also other versions of the same wax which are made up of beeswax to give fruits such as oranges a shine. Vegans don’t eat shellac or beeswax as they come from animals and therefore aren’t part of a plant-based diet. The added chemical also drew attention to the hazardous pesticide Propiconazole, banned apart from tiny amounts by the EU as it is hazardous to health. Now that the UK has left Europe, Propiconazole is no longer regulated as harshly and is being used as a pesticide on fruit and veg. It is known to have cancer increasing qualities. There was widespread criticism of the use of pesticides, especially the two listed above. One social media commenter said: “Propiconazole banned by the EU because of risks to fertility and to the health of the unborn child. Propiconazole is now on fruit in the UK. Important work done by the EU in assessing safety of chemicals - now ditched by Govt.” Another said: “When fruit isnapost suitable for Vegans you know something bad is happening.” With one explaining: “Imazalil  propiconazole are fungicides  are the reason why we shouldaposve been scrubbing citrus fruits before using the peel  washing hands after peeling  before eating treated fruit. Better to buy organic, untreated fruits when available.”Tesco told MyLondon that all their oranges are suitable for vegans but some oranges are labelled ‘non-vegan’ due to the wax applied post-harvest which contains shellac which helps keep fruit fresh.They said it is a common treatment for conventional citrus packing in the industry. They are also working with growers to develop a vegan-friendly alternative.

Bitterly cold conditions are expected for Saturday morning as a weather front comes in from the east and the wintry conditions are expected to continue well into the middle of March.People are being warned to wrap up warm over the coming days while the weather becomes more unsettled by the middle of next week and less predictable. Maps from WXCharts show the icy conditions continuing for the next couple of weeks and the Met Office is warning of snow and gales. Met Office forecaster Alex Deakin said that a high pressure is trying to push in from the Atlantic which would mean clear skies and sunshine but another weather front is sticking on the east of the country that is bringing cloud and rain.  The temperatures will be cold especially overnight. “It will turn frosty, patchy frost for north west England, Wales and maybe even south west England as well, said Mr Deakin. Under the cloud and rain with that weather front the temperatures will hold up a few degrees above freezing but where certainly getting close to freezing even in towns and cities, and in rural parts we will be well below, maybe -C in one or two locations across Scotland and Northern Ireland.  There is likely to be a east-west ide with cloud and rain to the east of the country where a weather front persists. Mr Deakin continued: A cold start hereto the weekend, a frosty old start but we should see plenty of sunshine, maybe a little bit of morning fog in a few spots. Sunny spells too for Wales and western England.  It’s further east where we are going to have this cloud and rain. Now some uncertainty about how far it is going to creep, whether the rain is going to come and go all day or whether it will be stuck under persistent rain but there is the threat of that certainly for east Yorkshire, Lincolnshire, East Anglia and the South East. It looks pretty damp here. He added: Under the cloud in the east  or C maybe squeezing up to C in Norwich and London, that is going to feel grim for the time of year. It is a similar picture for Sunday although there is likely to be more sun in the east with the high pressure finally taking over.  For next week the icy conditions remain with the threat of wind and snow as the weather becomes less settled. The Met Office states: Sunny spells with some cloud for most at first during this period, with generally stronger winds than previous days and the ongoing risk of gales in the far west and northwest. Temperatures looking to be rather below normal and perhaps feeling cooler in the wind. Through the period, frontal systems push eastwards which are likely to bring strengthening winds in addition to potential snowfall. The main impacts are likely to be from heavy rain and gales during this time. Nearer to the end of this period, there is looking to be a transition from these rather cold conditions to near normal and milder conditions. This is likely to include clearer weather with showers across all areas. UK forecast for the next  days Today: Cloud and occasional rain in the southeast moving into central areas of England. Drier and brighter for parts of East Anglia later. Mainly dry with sunny spells where. Tonight: Dry with clear periods and widespread frost in north, with some freezing fog patches. Cloud and outbreaks rain extending westwards across central and southern Britain. Sunday: Dry and sunny in north. Rather cloudy across central and southern areas with outbreaks of rain across West Midlands and southern Wales. Isolated showers possible in southeast during the afternoon. Outlook for Monday to Wednesday: Rather cold with overnight frost but largely dry with sunny spells for most on Monday and Tuesday. Turning windier and potentially milder into Wednesday, rain possible in the west.

Weaposre all trying to looking after the pennies right now, butyou want something special for good value it could be right up your street. The supermarket giant allow you to choose two meals and four sides at a great price. But the big question is how does the family feast stack up - and is there enough to satisfy everyone Rebecca Astill, the Reviews  Affiliates Writer at Birmingham Live, decided to test taste their offer for herself. Hereaposs what she made of it, andshe thinks youaposre getting value for money.  Two meals and four sides all for £. Sounds pretty nty on the tin, no  I thought so too at first, she penned. There was one problem right off the bat, being I live with a family of five. Every single family deal is always targeted at families of four, will nobody think of the bigger families  I decided to give the deal a go anyway, and bought the sausages in onion gravy and Scottish breaded scampi as mains, with halloumi fries, stonebaked garlic bread, crispy breaded mushrooms and mighty peas as sides. I have two slightly awkward allergies in my family to take into account, being fish and lactose so I had to ensure everyone had enough to eat. I thought the choices were quite limited in all honesty, it was a lot of breadcrumbed this, breadcrumbed that, which one might suggest was to cut down on quality and volume of products underneath. For one of your sides you could opt for a dessert, but with the only vegan option of cookies and cream sundaes sold out, I stuck to savoury. Also, the burgers were sold in twos, sothree people wanted burgers they would have to be split. The burgers were also not sold with their buns which needed buying separately, which I thought a bit cheeky. The cooking was chaotic  Cooking the meal was a nightmare. No two dishes of the whole six items could be put into the oven at the same time, according to package instructions, and I found the whole experience quite stressful despite a plan in the notes app on my phone of when to put what in. Eventually pm rolled around and I pulled everything out of the oven, and the peas out of the microwave. It all looked appetising although the garlic bread needed a touch longer. I loaded each plate up and we were good to go. My first impression was that everything looked a bit beige. Were it not for the peas, everything was pretty much the same colour. The eating was much more fun  The actual meal was very tasty, with the highlight being the halloumi fries. They tasted like posh mozzarella sticks from McDonaldaposs. The peas were seasoned well, but could have done with a stronger hint of chilli to my taste, and the sausages were hearty and juicy, with a good helping of gravy. I also enjoyed the scampi, although it did not quite crispen up. The garlic bread and breaded mushrooms fell slightly short. The garlic bread was in the form of a thick, stodgy flatbread which I found a bit filling to have alongside a main meal. The breaded mushrooms lacked any real flavour. The breadcrumbs did not add anything and tasted bland, I would have liked there to be more of a herby crust. What my family thought  My mum, who is lactose intolerant, had been left with just a sausage, scampi, peas and the crispy bread mushrooms, which left her hungry. She noted MS might do well to consider allergens next time they produce a meal deal. Although there were a few dairy-free products, most had sold out by the time I went to buy the deal, which was only around pm. Most options were also breadcrumbed or involved pasta or bread, which would make it hard for anyone with a gluten intolerance to find a good selection. My brother, who is allergic to fish, was also left hungry having missed out on a main. . My dad and sister who are the least fussy of the bunch ate the entire meal but agreed the portion sizes could have been bigger. My dad made the point that although he was full, it was because everything was breadcrumbed. He would have much preferred the mushrooms, at least, in their raw form, and said it would also have brought some much needed colour to the plate. I have to agree. Final verdict I thought although the meal deal was overall tasty and filling, it lacked any feeling of luxury I would expect from it. Plus, MS need to hugely expand the options and consider that between four people, you might have a range of allergies. Having one or two dairy-free options, particularly, will not cut it and someone will be left hungry. There also needs to be less breadcrumbs and more colour. Having said that, I think £ to feed four is a good deal from Marks and I imagine it will save many a parent on a day when they just cannot quite bring themselves to cook. Although it is missing any feeling of luxury, it would cost you a fortune more to take four out to eat at a restaurant.

Michelle Edwards, , claims the council even offered to provide a van to help her with the move, although she says this never happened.She has lived in her London flat for more than  years and says she hasnapost been able to stop crying since she was handed the unexpected notice last week, reports MyLondon. I’m incredibly stressed out, I can’t even quanty the level of stress and anxiety, and it’s just been relentless, she said. I’ve been crying non-stop, my sleeping has been affected, it’s the first thing that’s on my mind when I’m drting off to sleep, it’s the first thing on my mind when I wake up.”  Although Michelle says sheaposs happy to move into a new flat, she claims she should have been given adequate time, information and resources to make the move. She believes the way Waltham Forest Council has treated her has even bordered on harassment, claiming they have been calling her repeatedly throughout the days encouraging her to move. Michelle was left infuriated further when she claims she discovered friends on the estate knew more about the situation than she did. There had been talks of a regeneration project in the area for a number of years after the council found the flats were “unfit for purpose”.Michelle claims the council had plans to move her into a new property since before , but complications brought about by the pandemic and Brexit meant it was delayed.“We received one eviction notice, and nothing happened. It fell through,” Michelle explained. “Then we received another eviction notice in  and a letter last year saying we would be moved out in November .” Michelle began to pack up a letime of possessions, but claims she was never provided with a specic move-out date from the council. A neighbour told her she had heard sheaposd be moving in January  rather than November, and she started to put things in place for the new move-out date. But Michelle claims the date was changed multiple times, leading to increased uncertainty and worry about when she would be placed in her new flat. “I’ve had ious dferent health complications over the years,” Michelle said. “I dislocated my left arm, I detached my left foot from my leg [...] I’ve got metal plates and rods holding everything together. That’s always given me problems. Walking is quite problematic, and then I have backache from where I’m not walking properly and have chronic pain.” Michelle also underwent treatment for fibroids, which meant roughly three quarters of her stomach was surgically removed and she is still dealing with the effects of this treatment. On the late afternoon of Thursday, February , Michelle received an email from the council. She claims she was invited to move into her new property on Monday, February , when her new tenancy would begin. This would give her only three full days to pack up her flat, view the new property, agree to the move and arrange logistical arrangements.  Michelle claims this situation has left her “essentially homeless”. She added: “To drop an email late Thursday, start my tenancy on Monday - and then you tell me I’m liable for rent on a property I haven’t even seen  How am I supposed to move  years’ worth of possessions and move into a new property, that I wouldn’t have even had the keys for, andit by the Sunday  Nothing makes sense.” Waltham Forest councillor Simon Miller, cabinet member for economic growth, said: “The regeneration of the Marlowe Road estate has been ongoing since , and residents have been kept informed at all times. “The project will deliver  much-needed high-quality new homes, including  for council rent and a further  for shared ownership, and an on-site energy centre alongside a new plaza, children’s play area, and commercial outlets. In a consultation held prior to the regeneration commencing,  per cent of residents indicated that they were in favour of the area’s redevelopment and we are working with tenants to ensure all moves into their new homes go smoothly. “We invite any residents who feel they do not have the adequate support they need to contact us so we can work together constructively to find a solution.”Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON DisabilityHousingWaltham Forest Council\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Mauricio Damian-Guerrero, reportedly became obsessed the woman, who he met online, and tracked her moves. He observed her from a distance and crept down in the dead of night to film her on his mobile phone, police said. Itaposs claimed he acquired her keys and made identical versions which meant he could enter her property when ever he wanted. The -year-old reportedly hid in in her upstairs loft in New Hampshire, US and waited for her to sleep, before creeping downstairs and filming her.  His creepy behaviour was only discovered when the womanaposs mother heard noises in the attic. The victim, who is only identied only as NR, twigged that something was wrong when her mum began realise someone was in the overhead space. Court papers say Damian-Guerrero entered the -year-old womanaposs home on at least four occasions. During this time he is said to have used his phone to covertly film her. Video clips were found on his mobile phone which were taken as she slept naked.Deputy Strafford County Attorney Emily Garod told WMUR in New Hampshire: He was released with pretty strict bail conditions.But it is an ongoing concern of ours, the safety of the victim during the pendency of this case, so that is why we asked for him to be held pending trial.  Damian-Guerrero first claimed to have broken into the home to retrieve a TV and fireplace he bought as a present for her. He claimed the OnlyFans model had “wanted a man to be obsessed with her and stalk her.” Damian-Guerrero was charged with four felony counts of burglary. He was released from prison last week and made to wear a tracking tag to ensure he didn’t breach his restraining order.

But, despite a promise by Home Secretary Priti Patel to stand “shoulder to shoulder” with the Ukrainians, many are being refused visas as they are not “immediate family”. We can reveal refugees in Calais are being told to apply to other European countries instead.Tonight Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper branded it “a disgraceful situation” and demanded an explanation from Ms Patel. Refugee charity CareCalais, which is trying to help families enter Britain also reacted with fury.Follow all of of todayaposs news on the war in Ukraine as it unfolds with our live blog  A spokesperson said: “Our Government must do more. If they want to show solidarity with Ukrainians it will take more than words.” Ukrainian-born British citizen Victoria Perebeynis, , who teaches English, travelled to the Polish border at Krakowiec to collect four members of her extended family. She planned to take them to her home in Oxford, but said: “The British Embassy told us to fill out application forms, which were rejected. And they have been told they need to apply for other countries.”  The relatives Victoria wants to help are her cousin Valentina, , her daughter-in-law Maiia Magda, , Maiia’s son Glib, , and her mum Ekateria Pergat, also  and disabled.Maiia’s husband stayed in Ukraine to fight the Russians.The terried family, from the shelled Energodar region, travelled for four days to reach France. Victoria said: “Valentina is so distraught and depressed. We couldn’t open the windows on the drive as she was terried someone would shoot at her. She and Ekateria still think they are being attacked. They have lost everything. They travelled across Europe with one sock between them and one piece of underwear. That’s all they had when they got to the border.  “Their whole lives have fallen apart.” CareCalais is helping the family appeal the visa rejection. There are around  Ukrainians at the Centre Europeen de Sejour in Calais. More are expected.

Priti Patel needs to explain this disgraceful situation. People need help now.” The Home Office said the sponsorship route is “opening soon”. But they could not tell us when it will start. Meanwhile Ukrainians working here as fruit and veg pickers are panicking over confusing changes to their visas.

At Ennis District Court, Judge Mary Larkin has directed that Geraldine O’Loughlin deliver her German Shepherd-like dog to the dog warden, due to the continual noise disturbance on a neighbour in Ennis, Co Clare. Judge Larkin made the order in response to an application by Ms O’Loughlin’s neighbour, Shane Shannon of Gort Rd, Ennis, under legislation concerning the control of dogs.Judge Larkin concluded that the barking dog is interfering substantially with Mr Shannon’s le, The Irish Mirror reports. Judge Larkin made the order under a little known provision of the Control of Dogs Act  where a judge can make an order requiring the elimination of a nuisance caused by the “excessive barking” of an unwanted dog. In evidence, Mr Shannon said that the “large dog has been barking for as long as I have been there and that’s  years”.  Mr Shannon said that the dog’s barking would go on all day “for two and a half hour periods at a time”. He said: “The dog has been barking a hundred times a day.” Mr Shannon said that he spoke to Ms O’Loughlin about the dog but the barking continued. In response to his ‘barking concerns’ Mr Shannon said that Ms O’Loughlin told him that is what dogs do. Sure what harm is it” ” He told the court: “She laughed into my face.” Mr Shannon said that he works in horticulture and has a potting shed at the end of his garden but was forced to abandon working there due to the dog constantly barking from the garden next door. Mr Shannon said that the dog meet the definition of an ‘unwanted dog’ under the Act stating that the dog “hasn’t got much affection and I would say he is lonely and not cared for”. He said: “To be honest it is immensely upsetting to listen to an animal like that. He is fed twice a day when food is thrown out the back door to him. I never hear anyone playing with the dog or saying hello to the dog.” Mr Shannon said that the dog was never brought outside the garden over the past  years and never brought into the home. Asked by Judge Larkin what the dog’s name is, Mr Shannon said: “I never heard the dog being called by its name or heard anyone being nice to the dog.” At the outset of the case, Judge Larkin said that the court registrar received an email from Ms O’Loughlin stating that she wouldn’t be coming to court as the dog has been put down. However, Mr Shannon said that he would prefer to press ahead with the case stating “I don’t trust anything she says”. After hearing Mr Shannon’s evidence, Judge Larkin ordered that the dog delivered to the dog warden to be dealt with by him in accordance with Control of Dogs Act as it is an unwanted dog.

Putin was snapped with singer Paul McCartney before a concert in Moscow in , sat with actor Jack Nicholson at the Moscow International Film Festival in  and was even in correspondence with Pamela Anderson. He had drinks with Hollywood star Leonardo DiCaprio at the International Tiger Conservation Forum in Saint Petersburg in  and shook hands with British supermodel Naomi Campbell at the same event.As well as these celeb acquaintances, Putin has actually developed close friendships with a few Hollywood stars, who have been reacting to Russiaaposs war on Ukraine. Around the world, Putin is losing allies fast with many condemning his terrying invasion and attacks on defenceless civilians, with the Russian leader promising worse is yet to come.So how has this changed the way his famous friends think about him  Steven Seagal Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here. Hollywood actor Steven Seagal has a surprising friendship with Putin - and has even been to his home. The Under Siege and Hard to Kill star, who received his Russian citizenship in , first bonded with the Russian leader over a shared love of martial arts. The Michigan-born actor has previously described his father as pure Russian, as his paternal grandparents were Russian Jewish immigrants, and he still has some relatives in the country.Unsurprisingly, Seagal did not put any blame on Putin over the Ukraine war and has claimed an outside entity is provoking both countries into fighting.The -year-old martial artist told Fox News Digital that he looks at both Russia and Ukraine as one family. Most of us have friends and family in Russia and Ukraine, he said on Monday as he refused to take sides. I look at both as one family and really believe it is an outside entity spending huge sums of money on propaganda to provoke the two countries to be at odds with each other. My prayers are that both countries will come to a positive, peaceful resolution where we can live and thrive together in peace.  Seagal has spoken out in praise of Putin on several occasions, including in a  interview with Russian TV channel RT when he said Putin was one of the greatest world leadersnot the greatest world leader alive today. He went on: The first time I went to his home, I walked in and saw a le-sized statue of Kano Jigoro, who is the founder of judo, so I was immediately taken and impressed and really wanting to get to know this man deeper and deeper. In , Seagal met with Belarusan president Alexander Lukashenko to eat carrots and chat about that yearaposs harvest. That year he was also granted his Russian citizenship, resulting in him being barred from entering Ukraine. This [was his] desire, he had really applied, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov announced to the press. He had been really persistent for a long time and been asking to grant him citizenship, he is actually renowned for his quite warm feelings toward our country. He never made a secret out of it, at the same time he is quite famous, as you know, actor. In , Seagal appeared on Good Morning Britain live from Moscow to defend Putin amid claims he had influenced the American election.  Speaking about his Russian citizenship, he said: I have lots of relatives in Russia and you know I love Russia, I love the country, I love the people and, you know, I think that one thing that’s sort of not widely known, there are millions and millions of people in America who have dual and multiple citizenship so this is not an uncommon thing. The thing that makes it controversial is all of the propaganda flying, particularly from America about Russia, therefore it becomes kind of a controversial situation. He told Piers Morgan and Susanna Reid heaposd had many direct dealings with Putin as he lavished praise on the Russian leader. Seagal said: As I’ve said many times I think he’s one of the great world leaders, he’s brilliant, he’s articulate, he’s a great tactician. Him and I started out becoming friends over the martial arts. The martial arts has to do with a lot of things. It’s a philosophy, it gets into the history of tactics and the history of the world and the world in conflict and the world in peace and so him and I basically, we don’t have a political relationship, we really talk about the martial arts and the philosophy and people and dilemmas in le, that kind of thing. American podcaster Joe Rogan recently shared an image of a fake CNN report depicting Seagal wearing special forces unorm and holding a gun. The fake news report tried to claim Seagal was among Russian special forces positioned around the outskirts of Kyiv. Gerard Depardieu  French actor Gerard Depardieu has been one of Putinaposs closest celebrity pals - but their friendship could be coming to an end as he has somewhat surprisingly denounced the fractricidal war. The -year-old, who has starred in Cyrano de Bergerac and  Dalmatians, actually received Russian citizenship after turning his back on his homeland.Depardieu annoyed many of his fellow countrymen by running off to Russia, which was apparently to avoid paying large taxes in France after a highly publicised tax row.Putin himself signed the decree granting Russian citizenship to Depardieu, who described Russia as a great democracy, and not a country where the prime minister calls one of its citizens shabby. The actor responded by writing an open letter saying: I love your country, Russia - its people, its history, its writers. I love your culture, your intelligence. Depardieu travelled to Russia in  to be officially given his Russian passport and had an audience with Putin. The pair shook hands and hugged each other at the meeting in Sochi, although the presidentaposs spokesman said he did not hand over the document personally.  The actor was later invited to set up home in the central Russian region of Mordovia, known for its Stalin-era prison camps. Local governor Vladimir Volkov said Depardieu could choose an apartment or a place to build a house, Interfax news agency reported. After arriving in Mordoviaaposs main city of Saransk, the actor showed off his new passport, saying: I am very happy, itaposs very beautul here. Beautul and soulful people live here. In , Depardieu caused outrage in his native France by appearing in a aposnauseousapos advertisement in which he boasted about shooting a deer and being a Russian. Proud to be Russian said the actor, who was then seen kneeling over a dead dear and blowing a kiss. , the online French news outlet, meanwhile called the advertisement vulgar, while GQ magazine said it was a mixture of nauseous wordplay and pathetic production quality. But now the love-in between Putin and Depardieu may be coming to an end as the the actor denounced Russiaaposs war with Ukraine. In a shock move, the film star posted a photo on Instagram with the message: Russia and Ukraine have always been brother countries.Although he did not call out Putin directly and called on both nations to start negotiating for peace. I am against this fratricidal war, he added. I say, Stop the weapons and negotiate.apos However, the Ukrainian people are unlikely to change their opinion on Depardieu because of his past links. Back in , the Ukrainian government included the French actor on a list of cultural figures who were a threat to the countryaposs security. While no specic reason was stated, it is believed the decision is linked to controversial comments he made questioning Ukraineaposs independence. At the Baltic Pearl movie festival in Latvia in , Depardieu said that he loved both Russia and Ukraine, which is part of Russia.

In the last week alone, it is believed there have been three attempts to take out President Zelensky.Last week, the assassins were said to be awaiting a green light from the Kremlin to move on Mr Zelensky, however the plan was said to be abandoned as they reached the upper echelons of the Ukrainian government. For all the live updates from the Russian invasion follow our liveblogThe assassinations were reportedly foiled when double agents within Russiaaposs Federal Security Service, The Times reported.The underground assassin group are said to have infiltrated Ukraine with a -name aposkill listapos targeting the entire Cabinet - including the mayor of Kyiv Vitali Klitschko and his brother Wladimir.It is widely believed that the group is at the beck and call of Vladimir Putin, although the Kremlin has repeatedly denied this. The force is said to be heavily involved in supplying weapons, experienced operations personnel and military training to pro-Russian militias in eastern Ukraine. The group has previously been deployed by the Kremlin outside of Russia, to carry out black ops operations that Putin wants done while avoiding direct responsibility.  After Moscow invaded last week, Zelensky addressed the nation, claiming that Russian special forces were in the capital searching for him as “target No ”. However when he was offered the chance to flee by America he said: “I need ammunition, not a ride.” Zelensky vowed to stay and fight for his country in the face of Russian aggressions.Yesterday, president Zelensky urged Putin to sit down with him and talk in order to bring an end to the now eight day invasion.In an address to the Russian leader, Zelensky said: Get off our land. You donapost want to leave now  Then sit down with me at the negotiation table. Iaposm available. Sit. Just not  metres away like with Macron or Scholz etc. I am your neighbour. You donapost need to keep me  metres away.  I donapost bite. Iaposm a normal bloke. Sit down with me and talk. What are you afraid of  We arenapost threatening anyone, weaposre not terrorists, we arenapost seizing banks and seizing foreign land.It follows the Ukraine presidentaposs earlier comments, in which he warned Russia would pay for their invasion of the country.He said: We will restore every house, every street, every city and we say to Russia: learn the word of reparations and contributions. You will reimburse us for everything you did against our state, against every Ukrainian in full.

But by the time I was on the case, the disease was spreading closer to home # in forests near Loch Carron, Ross and Cromarty.Phytophthora, ominously meaning #plant destroyer#, is a genus of fungus-like organisms containing around  known species with a worldwide distribution.The genus, which includes the pathogens that cause potato blight and sudden oak death, has been responsible for massive crop failures, economic loss and environmental damage.Phytophthora are called #fungus-like# since they behave like fungi but dfer from them, and from all animals and plants, in several key features of their reproduction and chemical makeup.This places them in an ill-defined group of misfits called protists, which also includes amoebae, kelp and slime moulds.Phytophthora pluvialis was discovered in Oregon USA in , where it resides in soil and watercourses, and mainly infects Douglas fir.Its recognition in Cornwall during  was the first identication of this particular Phytophthora species in Europe.Thought to have arrived here on imported live plants, its spores germinate in water and can be spread, for instance, on shoes, tyres and animal paws.The pathogen infects a iety of trees, including western hemlock, Douglas fir and several pine species, causing needle shedding, shoot dieback and lesions on the branches, trunks and roots of infected trees.Forestry and Land Scotland and its policy section Scottish Forestry took rapid action # surveillance to detect infected forests, restrictions on the movement of timber and trees, and asking the public to report suspicious tree lesions.But since the European climate is ideal for P pluvialis to thrive, and its favoured trees are commonly grown here, like so many other plant pathogens, it seems likely that this one is here to stay for the long term.Forestry and Land Scotland asks foresters and the public to be vigilant for signs of Phytophthora pluvialis.Anyone who thinks they might have spotted signs of the disease should report it using the online TreeAlert system on the on www.forestresearch.gov.uk website."},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures february 11 2022","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Subscribe NowA misty Argyll castle is the subject of this week#s featured photograph by Sharon Hiley.Sharon captured the atmospheric scene at Tarbert Castle, a much-loved historical site looked after by Tarbert Castle Trust.The castle has ancient royal connections, dating back to the th century.

This is particularly good advice for anyone with a veg plot.A sowing plan of what seeds and how many to sow each month is key to successful growing and means you won#t be throwing out unwanted seedlings and that your flower and veg beds will be full all year round.A word of warning about sowing direct into the ground at this time of year there may be a few sunny days to enjoy outside but the soil can still be chilly, making germination and survival hard.Sowing indoors is a better option. Not only does it provide a warm environment for germination, but seeds and seedlings are easier to protect from pests. If you can find some environmentally sound sowing trays and containers, rather than using plastic, that#s even better. Paper and cardboard pots can be packed snugly in a tray which avoids over handling and makes them easy to water.Small seeds should be scattered sparingly on the surface of compost filled seed trays then covered with a sprinkling of sieved compost. If the seeds are big enough to handle, you can sow them inidually into cm pots. The quantity should be according to the instructions specied on the seed packet, but usually for small seeds between five and  seeds per pot. For plants that grow long roots, such as peas or beans, you can put them into a compost filled cardboard toilet roll tube and, once ready, they can be planted outside, tube and all.Most seeds will germinate and grow in a warm setting such as a greenhouse, cold frame or on a sunny windowsill. You should keep them damp by using a mist spray to start with before moving onto a watering can with a fine rose nozzle.Once the seedlings have grown their second pair of leaves and before they get too squashed in seed trays or pots, pot them on into small pots. Simply ease out a clump of seedlings with an old cutlery fork or dibber and # handling only the leaves to avoid damaging delicate stems and roots # gently tease them apart. Drop inidual seedlings into a five-centimetre compost filled newspaper pot ensuring the lower leaves are above the compost level. Once you see roots appearing from the bottom of the pot, it’s time to pot on to a bigger pot before planting outside once the weather and soil warms up.If you are growing your own veg, now is a good time to sow first early potatoes. These can be planted from mid-March, however planting times will y across the country according to temperature and risk of frost. Early potatoes grow well in the ground and in containers such as potato grow bags or old compost bags. You should plant your chitted potatoes with the shoots facing upwards in soil with plenty of well-rotted organic matter, approximately cms deep and cms apart.Once stems are about cms tall, they will need earthing up by drawing soil around them to create a cm high ridge, to protect against frost and keep growing potatoes covered.

Russell converted.Scotland then missed a great chance when Chris Harris threw a miss-two pass to Stuart Hogg but, agonisingly the ball spilled it forward and a golden try chance was lost for Scotland.Just before the break France extended their lead when Fickou beat the tackles of Price and Haining to touch down at the corner flag and Jaminet converted from the touchline.France extended their lead shortly after the break when a kick forward bounced awkwardly into the path of Jonathan Danty who ran in for the bonus point try. Jaminet grabbed the extras..removePenaud then romped in for try number five and although Jaminet missed the conversion everyone knew the game was lost.France added a sixth try in  minutes after Romain Ntamack’s cross-field kick, found Penaud who had a simple task.Scotland did pull back a try at the death after Blair Kinghorn’s break was rounded off by van der Merwe, who dotted down his tenth try for his country.

The mine was finally rediscovered by HMS Bicester early last week.Bad weather made it impossible for the crew of the Bicester to attach a surface riser to it and the mine was left to a Navy ing team to bring it up.Led by Lt Adrian Dann, the four-man Northern Diving Team from Faslane finally pinpointed the mine on Tuesday morning and brought it up later that day.The two-tonne mine is currently lying on the New Quay waiting to be picked up by the mine laying team from Cromby, Fe.FIFTY YEARS AGOCampbeltown churchgoers, in common with other congregations throughout the country, are being asked to sign petition forms calling for an end to public filth in television and literature.Already many people, including non-churchgoers, have appended their names to the forms which are also in several businesses in the town.The forms are headed: ‘Petition for public decency.’It states: ‘Being concerned about the effect on society – particularly on the young – and of the increasing exploitation of sex, the public portrayal of intimate or unnatural sexual behaviour and violence and brutality, we the undersigned call upon Her Majesty’s government: to note the concern of the public about this matter. to ensure that the law as regards of sanity stops this public affront and is so designed as to be an effective instrument for the maintenance of public decency.Some church congregations in the town have already begun signing the petition and others planned to follow suit in the near future.All of Campbeltown’s ministers are in agreement that the obscenities on television and in literature are going too far, and hope that the petition has the desired effect.The Reverend James W Hood, of Lorne Street Church, commented yesterday: ‘I think it is perfectly right that the church should be given the opportunity of speaking its mind.’SEVENTY YEARS AGOThe majesty and pomp of King George VI#s funeral procession through London, and later its journey to Windsor Castle, was seen and heard by people in Campbeltown and Tarbert on Friday, in the history-making experimental television broadcast.In both places, reception was remarkably clear and those who were privileged to see it saw this royal journey of dignied and poignant pageantry in a much greater detail than the vast crowds in London and Windsor.At both places, the sets, with -inch screens, were shown by radio dealers to parties of friends.Mr Anthony P MacGrory, Campbeltown town councillor and housing convener, had his set installed in the radio showroom of his firm’s shop in Main Street.At Tarbert, the set there was arranged by Mr Douglas C Smith, Electrical and Radio Engineer, Harbour Street.Earlier last month, Mr Smith informed us that he was getting surprisingly good results from the test from the Scottish television station at Kirk o’ Shotts – the Scottish station which is using only low power transmission.Scottish TV reception of this historical occasion was the previous day viewed with serious misgivings and doubts by BBC experts, who pointed out that the Kirk o’ Shotts station was not due to open until March  and that this is the first-ever television radio link up, connecting Scotland to London, through Manchester, was merely an experiment and the Scottish transmitters were still undergoing adjustment.So, until the TV programme went onto the air on Saturday, the BBC could give no guarantee that the venture would be successful.It was a great success and thousands of Scots over a wide area, from Dumfries to Aberdeen, saw clear pictures of the funeral processions.At Campbeltown and Tarbert, the pictures were almost as clear as everyone was looking at them on the cinema screen, the detail in some of the pictures being unbelievably perfect.One local businessman, who saw it, described it as ‘uncanny’.But, throughout the years, this has been the descriptive of all great inventions when they first made their impact on the public mind.It was a pity, of course, that this great moment in Scottish television progress should have been heralded in with such a sad event as the funeral of our King.Considering that Kintyre was not regarded as a good reception area and that this  miles relay was the longest ever attempted by the BBC, the result was truly amazing and will no doubt mean the booking of many orders from this part of the country.Already, Mr McGrory has been receiving enquiries from ious parts of Argyll.We were privileged to see the screening in Mr MacGrory’s premises that afternoon. The scenes from Paddington to Windsor were impressive, especially the arrival at Windsor and the unforgettable journey to St George’s Chapel.To those people in Kintyre, so far from the television network, it must have been an unforgettable experience to have this outstanding London ceremonial brought hundreds of miles to before their eyes and to be taken in imagination straight to Windsor to watch the Royal coffin being carried out and upon it the Imperial State Crown, the orb and the sceptre and the white wreath of orchids, camellias and lilies of the valley from Her Majesty, the Queen

What#s inside the singing kettle # # which Artie still uses today.While this principle was always central to the action, plot lines and stage sets were built around imaginative story lines, transforming the original concept into a spectacular musical for the whole family.The Singing Kettle turned children’s theatre into an art form and the troupe#s unique performances became the bench mark for fellow professionals everywhere.They performed in hundreds of venues, from the Palladium in London to the Town Hall in Campbeltown, from the Palace Theatre in Kilmarnock to the Royal Palace in Jordan.BAFTA-award winning and decorated with MBEs for services to children’s entertainment, audiences worldwide were hooked on their madcap musical adventures flavoured with cheeky Scottish humour.Adults and children alike found themselves singing the songs together long after the performances were over.The company closed in , with the final line-up forming Fun Box and with Cilla retiring.Artie continued performing solo shows as Artie#s Tartan Tales but since the beginning of  his show is now Artie#s Singing Kettle.There is a £ one price ticket for the show, plus booking fee.

Staff went on strike on the first day I started. In the days of Teletext, it came up the night before ‘library staff are going on strike to meet the new director.’ For a moment I thought what a shame, but that was me,” said Dr McConnell.Read more: Glasgow aid for Ukraine appeal is launched - how you can help“Glasgow has always felt special to me and when I got the job here I couldn’t believe it.

That was quite a shock and took quite a bit of getting used to.“What I did know that in the city, politically, all the political parties really did want the city to succeed and that’s what I wanted to work with – that whole thing of widening access.”  After  years at the helm of it the city’s culture and leisure services, firstly under Glasgow City Council and then as chief executive of arms- organisation Glasgow Le, Dr McConnell is due to retire in May.However, she is not winding down just yet and has the small matter of the £million revamped Burrell Collection to reopen later this month. It is the latest high profile museum to open under her tenure following on from the refurbishment Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum, and the opening of the Riverside Museum. Under her leadership culture and sport attendances have grown by a third to more than  million in the year before the pandemic. Glasgow Le Museums became the most used and visited museums service in Scotland, but it’s not all been plane sailing.Losing tens of millions of pounds during the local government shake up meant services were competing for any cash they could get. Library staff were on strike for eight months in the late s and venues were open for just a couple of days a week to lend books and it was looking grim for the future of those services.Read more: Craig Mallon murder: New twist as appeal made for mystery callerHowever, an opportunity to work with the then Glasgow Development Agency who had money to invest in technology began to turn things around.  Mrs McConnell, who is married to former First Minister Jack McConnell, added: “Performance indicators in our libraries were among the worst in the UK at the time, but we got through it and persuaded the council and GDA to come in and develop learning suites with computers, train up staff and in some places co-locate, which for some people is still an issue, but it was fantastic. There was objection at the time, but within weeks uncertain staff became the biggest advocate and more people were using the service.“There was no library in the Gorbals it had been shut many years before and we reopened that. We ended up extending the library service. In Pollok the library was literally falling down so we located it in the leisure centre. In Springburn we had problems with the old library building and eventually we created a two-level library with a computer suite. With co-location we had more people using the service.”An element of Mrs McConnell’s role was look at future partnerships and who  they could work with and it is how she first met the late Lord Macfarlane, who was a passionate patron of the arts in Glasgow and helped them raise £millon for the £m Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum refurbishment. He also helped the council buy the handwritten original Robert Burns manuscript of ‘Auld Lang Syne’ in  for around £,.“It came up for sale in New York and one of the library staff said to me this was happening,” said Mrs McConnell. “They said we have this amazing Burns collection but you never buy anything in Glasgow for the libraries and I thought why not “We went out and we got that manuscript at auction in New York and it is now in Glasgow. That has been at the heart of what we have been able to do. It has been about working with others and seeing opportunities as they arise. In the face of it when I started in  having lost all that money from Strathclyde and sadly we did have to make a lot of compulsory redundancies at the time, the reality iswe hadn’t gone into partnership with others and hadn’t changed how we did things we wouldn’t have had the credibility or the partners to do a lot of what we did.”It was former city council chief executive George Black who recognised that the halcyon days would not last forever and understood what was coming down the line in terms of the scale of investment for services and reductions in local government funding.In  that it was felt for culture and leisure to be successful a new way of working had to be looked and also to reduce the burden to the council given increasing demands on the likes of social care and education budgets.  This led to the setting up of Glasgow Le in , a charitable organisation that could run culture and leisure on behalf of the council, and brought an immediate saving to the council of tens of millions of pounds just in rates, along with VAT benefits.“We also recognised it would be a way of bringing in people like Lord Macfarlane on to our board,” added Mrs McConnell. “We saw this as an opportunity immediately to save money year in year out – one off saving isn’t enough and we needed to bring in people who could help us bring in additional money.”Read more: Architect behind Burrell Collection redesign says it has opened up the heart of the buildingGlasgow’s cultural and sporting successes propelled the city’s global reputation as a first choice leisure and business tourism destination. In , before the pandemic struck, Glasgow welcomed some . million domestic and international visitors boosting the city’s economy by a record £m and supporting thousands of jobs across every part of Glasgow’s tourism and hospitality sector.However, the pandemic meant the doors to Glasgow Le’s venues were closed and it was facing a financial black hole. It lost £m due to the pandemic and estimated revenue for   was £.m. With services and cultural attractions at risk, it led to The Herald launching A Fair Deal for Glasgow campaign calling for both the UK and Scottish government to support a new way of funding these treasures.So how does she think Glasgow can best funds its cultural offering in the years ahead.“Glasgow isn’t just like any other local authority. It is dferent. It is the biggest city and is home to so many cultural services and resources that it directly funds through Glasgow Le, but the whole ecology whether it is support for the Royal Scottish National Orchestra, based in one of the city’s venues or the Glasgow Warriors playing at Scotstoun, it goes beyond direct funding. I believe there needs to be recognition that some of these services are nationally and internationally signicant and should be funded accordingly,” said Mrs McConnell.“I think we need to look at a dferent view of public health. It can’t just be about campaigns to stop smoking, it needs to be about how can you live a healthy le in your community and that means local resources, services whether it is libraries, sports, or development staff. We need advocates to look at ideas for the future and there needs to be a sense of urgency that we need to do something more.”  Her passion for culture and widening access, she says, stems from its ability to change people’s lives and goes back generations for Mrs McConnell whose inspiration was her grandmother Bridget Airlie, whose name appears on a remembrance plaque in Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum.“My grandmother was a miner’s we, had seven children and her father before her was a miner. She had six daughters and one son who was killed in the pits.“She was born in  and lived until she was . She had a huge family who were involved in the pits. Relatives had died from having lung disease – I had great uncles who were like demi-gods - grumpy and gruff - but I loved them and the stories they would tell as boys being in a pit at the age of  crawling in areas which were ft high.“Her passion was for education and my memory of her was stick in at school as this was the way out of the pits for her. For me history from  right through the th century wasn’t just in a book. I heard it and lived it listening to these people. I can remember my Uncle Thomas, who was killed in the pits when he was , his we was pregnant at the time and lost the baby, he would listen to opera such as La Traviata.“I remember during the miners’ strike, I had a lot of relations who were involved in that, there was always this dilemma – there was the pride of the mining communities but actually they didn’t want that for their kids. They wanted somewhere where they could breathe, live and they could use their brains. The thing that really struck me about my gran, who was in service as a young girl, was her teacher trying to plead with her parents about to let her stay on at school, but they were poor. Being in service wasn’t like being in Upstairs Downstairs, I think it was pretty miserable, but here was this bright woman who could recite Wordsworth and there was this sense of a great mind not challenged enough so she lived it through her children and grandchildren. The mantra for her was education, education, education. There was a passion about access to arts and that it should be there for everyone and that still drives me to this day.”  While she recognises she is extremely privileged now, she was brought up in a room and kitchen with her siblings and an outside toilet shared with another family, but she said she never once felt poor.“I felt rich and it was rich in community, the church was a big thing for us and lot of the social le, entertainment and arts experiences stemmed from there. I ended up playing organ in the Twechar Church for six years from the age of  because my gran had bought the organ in memory of her late son. I can remember the opportunities there were growing up. If I hadn’t had a full grant when I went to university I wouldn’t have been able to go.”Her first job after leaving St Andrew’s University was with Fe Council’s travelling art gallery in .  Despite the headline grabbing achievements of multi-million pound museums opening and her role in helping to bring the Commonwealth Games to the city in , which she is immensely proud of, it is some of the initiatives that have been le-changing that mean the most.“For me it is the little things. We were doing some work at the library in Bridgeton and one man talked about how the library saved his le.

Over the past week,  cases were recorded, bringing the case total since the pandemic began to ,.Following a meeting of the Orkney Local Emergency Co-ordination Group , on Monday morning, vice-chair of the group and corporate director Neighbourhood Services and Infrastructure, Hayley Green, said:“As the UK and Scottish Governments move forward with their plans for ‘living safely with COVID’, which includes a lessening and doing away with restrictions depending on whether you are north or south of the border, we, in Orkney, are facing something of a dilemma given that we are behind the curve.“We are seeing very high rates of transmission, and this is impacting heavily across our services – most notably within the care sector and our schools and nurseries – but really most areas are now being affected given the level of positive cases and the requirement for isolation.“We have reached the point in schools and nurseries whereby we have exhausted supply staff as a contingency and middle and senior staff, including head teachers, who were helping to keep classes open by teaching themselves or taking on janitorial or cleaning duties for example, are now also off due to COVID and other sickness.“Not only are children off due to catching the virus, but others are having to stay home due to a lack of staff – this is having a negative knock-on effect on working parents who are having to either work from homethat is possible or take time off when it is not.“It has also become apparent that we are now witnessing children in schools who have become infected for a second time.”The council stressed that schools are trying to ensure remote learning can be provided when possible – and there are enough staff to make it happen.Within adult care services, many are now feeling the impact and as a result two of our older people’s day care services on the Mainland will be closed from Wednesday as staff are deployed to assist within residential care homes. Those affected are being informed. There are further staffing challenges in adult social work and Occupational Therapy.Ms Green continued: “The closure of any service is as a last resort, but we have no choice to ensure we can safely manage to run our residential care facilities. The situation will be monitored closely and as soon as we are in a position to reopen safely then we will let everyone know.“Our care staff and the families of residents have done an outstanding job in keeping this virus at bay and out with our care facilities up until recent times but given the widespread transmission and the reduction in restrictions it has meant it was almost inevitable that this was going to happen at some point.”Staffing challenges are also being felt across the Leisure and Culture service, with some gym and swimming pool sessions and exercise classes being cancelled. The council-run St Magnus Café, Community Centre, and Town Hall have also been affected by closures and reduced opening hours.A plan has been agreed to ensure some level of service continues at the popular cafe during this challenging period and is being trialled this weekuntil the end of March, opening from .-. Monday-Friday with an amended menu.Given the infection levels, the council will be maintaining all current related COVID  restrictions for the time being, including working from homeyou can, and this will be reviewed again during March.A spokeswoman for NHS Orkney added: “We praise the community for their continued, regular use of lateral flow tests and urge everyone to continue using these.

Scotland can choose not just to oppose the Tories, but to replace them with a Labour government.”Claiming he had “no ambition” to remain leader of the opposition, Sir Keir added: “Throughout our history, our leaders have been driven by our love for our country, but also full of passion for what more it can be.“Each time, Labour has built a new Britain – Atlee, Wilson, Blair and Brown, each has sought office to change this country.“That is my ambition too, not just to oppose the Tories, but to replace them.”Starting now!

February  at Flesherin, Point, Dolan worked with his dad making Harris Tweed before getting an apprenticeship with a bakery in Stornoway.However, his ambition was always to join the Merchant Navy, which he did in  in Glasgow.Not long after, he joined the crew of the British-India ship SS Manela which sailed to South Africa during World War Two.Dolan said: “I also went to America, Canada and Australia while at sea and could be away for up to two years at a time, but it was always great to get on the boat in Glasgow and head home to Lewis.“I ed to Lewis for a time after the war and spent many happy years living with my sister Mary Ann down in Back. I loved going down to the pier and watching the ferries come and go when we went to town, many a journey I enjoyed with CalMac.#I have a small picture of the #Sulivan# in my room # the sea and boats have always given me so much joy.”Master Mackenzie added: “It was a pleasure to help Dolan mark his special birthday, we were delighted to welcome him on board.#He is a really interesting character who has travelled the world, and me and the crew were privileged to talk to him and listen to his wonderful stories.#I am from Aird, a nearby village in Point, and it was my pleasure to present the hat and goodies to a fellow rubhach.”Last Sunday , Dolan enjoyed his birthday party in An Acarsaid, surrounded by family and friends and delighted members of staff.

FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueThe Wolfe Tones during a previous performance in Falls Park.Michael Kenwood, Local Democracy ReporterMarch   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailThe DUP and Sinn Fein have clashed over the Wolfe Tones Féile concerts in Falls Park, after Belfast City Council agreed to give events in public parks an annual review.At the recent monthly meeting of the full council, elected members agreed that events in city parks that seek multiple year approval will be subject to a review after each programme is finished.The agreement by elected members is a pre-policy position, in advance of the council agreeing a more structured framework and policy for events, which is currently being prepared by council officers.During a restricted discussion, away from the public and press at the council’s People and Communities Committee last month, elected members moved away from a proposal for equality impact assessments to be undertaken in regard to inidual events on council land, specically in relation to the Féile an Phobail Festival. During a party group leader meeting later it was decided to move towards an annual review for all recurring events.DUP councillor Brian Kingston said at the City Hall meeting this week: “We are happy for these recommendations to go through as approved at committee. But we will say again regarding Féile An Phobail and the use of Falls Park, that for a number of events, despite the vast majority being positive, there does continue to be a problem.”He referred specically to “the use of a council park where there is a concert, and from the stage, there is singing, and the leading of young people, and the chanting of support for paramilitary organisations”.He said: “I am referring to the Wolfe Tones concert in Falls Park, in our park. There is nothing  on the same scale as this.”Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up He added: “We will continually ask what steps are being made to change the nature of this event. People can look at the nature of the footage and judge for themselves, and decideit is acceptable in a council park.”Sinn Fein councillor Matt Garrett told the chamber: “Whenever we moved from committee we moved from having an equality impact assessment carried out on particular events, and in particular Féile, to having all organisations holding events being reminded of their good relations policy.”He responded to Mr Kingston: “You make reference to Féile all the time, and while you say every time you will get up and make that point, we will also remind yourself, as a party, that all events across the city have to enter a contract. All the good relations and impacts are discussed in that.”He said: “If we are going to move to the point of having equality impacts on every inidual, we can’t support that, and we would call for them across all.”Mr Kingston asked Mr Garrett: “Do you not accept there is a problem  This event is on a scale unlike any other, where there is chanting for paramilitaries, young people being led from the stage. Chanting for the organisation that caused Bloody Friday, that we have agreed to commemorate this year.”Mr Garrett replied: “Would you equally agree there are events that are happening in parks and spaces in this city, owned by the council, that are equally as annoying to other members of the community ”Mr Kingston said: “If this was happening not on a council park it wouldn’t be our business. We can’t please all of society. If we have to challenge people’s behaviour, so be it. But there is nothing in parallel with this event. I will say again, we want to see progress being made, it being accepted by the organisers, and the parties on this council, that this is a stain on the council and the Féile.”Until the finalised policy is agreed, after the annual review of each event, the council’s Director of Neighbourhood Services will decide on appropriate changes to event management where necessary, including the removal of permissionrequired.Agreed at the council were the AVA Festival Bespoke Campsite on June  and  at Victoria Park, the Féile an Phobail annual events programme at Falls Park and Dunville Park, the Circus Extreme from October  to November  at Boucher Road Playing Fields, and the Belfast Beer and Cider Festival from May  to  at Botanic Gardens.Most ReadRevealed: The cheapest quotes for heating oil in your Northern Ireland postcode area as prices expected to remain high for two yearsDays into £,-a-day job, NI’s most expensive council boss goes off sick, plunging council into fresh turmoilSam McBrideOpinionMLAs ‘mistakenly’ vote to force % cut on rents in latest Stormont shamblesEdwin Poots strongly tipped for South Belfast co-optionMagherafelt man who filmed woman performing sex act on him in toilets found guilty of voyeurismTop VideosPlayVideo: Inside Northern Ireland#s only non-ROC Nuclear bunkerPlayFuel prices in Northern Ireland are at an all time high following the Russian invasion of UkrainePlayUkrainian national Antinina Aleksieva at the anti-war protest in BelfastLatest Northern IrelandPeople gather in Belfast to condemn Russian action in UkraineOrange Order leader says unionists can be confident in future of NIAlliance Party can herald end of binary system at Stormont, says LongAndrew MaddenOpinionThe Weekly Political Spin: From climate change April fool#s and #winging it#, to anti-Nato rants and the crisis-that-isn#t-a-crisisFermanagh will be determined to build on first victory in rescheduled clash with LaoisLatestCaroline Weir applauds “top performance” as Manchester City lt League CupNorthern Ireland estate agents Simon Brien offers relief to Ukraine crisisLiverpool close gap on Manchester City after edging past West HamMan City lt Continental League Cup after come-from-behind win against ChaKemar Roach surprised England left James Anderson and Stuart Broad at home,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

In a Facebook tribute posted later, he said: “I had so many good times with Christopher when we had great laughs, taking the hand out of each other, fighting battles for unionism side by side.“Today I was by his family asked to carry his coffin. That was an honour but so desperately painful.”Related topicsEdwin PootsChristopher StalfordMore On Edwin Poots PremiumAndrew MaddenOpinionThe Weekly Political Spin: From climate change April fool#s and #winging it#, to anti-Nato rants and the crisis-that-isn#t-a-crisis PremiumCourt rules Sinn Fein member challenging DUP Minister Edwin Poots’ order to halt Irish Sea border checks to remain anonymousDecline in renewable energy in Northern Ireland blamed on not enough windMonday deadline for DUP decision on who will replace Christopher Stalford in South Belfast seatAlliance MLAs believe recorded vote was required for key climate bill amendmentMost ReadRevealed: The cheapest quotes for heating oil in your Northern Ireland postcode area as prices expected to remain high for two yearsDays into £,-a-day job, NI’s most expensive council boss goes off sick, plunging council into fresh turmoilSam McBrideOpinionMLAs ‘mistakenly’ vote to force % cut on rents in latest Stormont shamblesEdwin Poots strongly tipped for South Belfast co-optionMagherafelt man who filmed woman performing sex act on him in toilets found guilty of voyeurismTop VideosPlayVideo: Inside Northern Ireland#s only non-ROC Nuclear bunkerPlayFuel prices in Northern Ireland are at an all time high following the Russian invasion of UkrainePlayUkrainian national Antinina Aleksieva at the anti-war protest in BelfastLatest Northern IrelandPeople gather in Belfast to condemn Russian action in UkraineOrange Order leader says unionists can be confident in future of NIAlliance Party can herald end of binary system at Stormont, says LongAndrew MaddenOpinionThe Weekly Political Spin: From climate change April fool#s and #winging it#, to anti-Nato rants and the crisis-that-isn#t-a-crisisFermanagh will be determined to build on first victory in rescheduled clash with LaoisLatestBelfast Giants take second game of Flames triple-header as Jackson Whistle, Ben Lake lead them to victoryJurgen Klopp felt Liverpool’s last-ditch defending was ‘like scoring a goal’Caroline Weir applauds “top performance” as Manchester City lt League CupNorthern Ireland estate agents Simon Brien offers relief to Ukraine crisisLiverpool close gap on Manchester City after edging past West Ham,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":truePeople watching the horse racing at Down Royal.Andrew MaddenTwitterEmailMarch   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailA representative body for racecourse chiefs has warned that proposed new gambling laws for Northern Ireland could put them out of business.The Association of Irish Racecoursessaid amendments to the legislation could impact racecourses to such a degree it could call into question their continued existence.In Northern Ireland, gambling — except for the National Lottery — is regulated under the Betting, Gaming, Lotteries  AmusementsOrder .According to Stormont#s Department for Communities , the legislation is old and complex and has not kept pace with emerging technologies and other changes”.As part of new proposals is a new Code of Practice for gambling firms, however racecourse owners have issues with some of the tabled amendments to the code, specically those relating to: gambling securities and credit protection of children and young people and customer care problem gambling and spending.Read MoreRegional rates for Northern Ireland businesses to be frozen for another yearConor O#Neill, chair of the AIR, explained: “Although the principles set out in this draft are positive in theory, much of what is being proposed for implementation at our member#s racecourses is completely impractical.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up For example, the proposed ‘affordability checks’ set out in this draft would require a full review of a client’s personal credit score, income, the number of dependants and any loan commitments they have. This proposal suggests this review would be triggered and full implementation required for any punter placing a bet in excess of £.Can you imagine the implications of such a proposal  It’s simply not practical and that is just one example of the proposed Codes of Practice our members have raised firm opposition to.”Representatives from both Downpatrick and Down Royal racecourses have written to the DfC expressing their specic concerns. In it#s submission to DfC#s consultation, the AIR said members have “concerns that the adoption of the draft Codes of Practice would have a drastic effect on the income that they currently receive from bookmakers which, in turn, comprises such a signicant share of their funding that it could call into question their continued existence”.Down Royal Racecourse chief Emma Meehan said horse racing is in a unique sporting position, in that it and betting are inter-dependent with most of their revenue streams linked to betting.Whilst we agree the act needs modernising and developing to ensure it is fit for the modern age in a sector that has been transformed through the rise of mobile and online gaming, we are gravely concerned over the potential impact this proposed legislation will have upon the future of horse racing within Northern Ireland a sport that is still recovering from the financial implications of Covid-,” she said.DfC said: The Minister is currently bringing a Bill – The Betting, Gaming, Lotteries and AmusementsBill through the Assembly.“The Bill includes a power to allow the Department to issue Codes of Practice. A pre-design engagement consultation was conducted on a draft Code of Practice and closed on February .The department is currently analysing the responses with a view to revising the Code of Practice and issuing for a further formal consultation later in the year.

How we build our homes also needs a step change.Commitment from all political parties is required to invest in Modern Methods of Construction to ensure the delivery of energy-saving homes at speed.

They help to develop the museum and its collection and act as its ambassadors within the community. Members organise relevant activities as well as supporting the museumrsquos own programme of events.These activities include lectures, tours, literary and musical events, for social, educational or fundraising purposes. The Friends make grants, from their own funds or by acting as a conduit for other grant-aiding bodies who are unable to give money directly to the Museum. Such grants are for curatorial or educational purposes.At the inaugural meeting of the Friends in  the curator, Dr Brian Turner, spoke briefly about the work of the museum and plans for the future.He emphasised that community support and participation was vital and was at the root of everything the museum stood for.The first committee was elected with Patrick Forde as chairman, Dr Maurice Hayes as vice-chairman, Conac Hanna as treasurer and Noel McCann as secretary. Other committee members included Professor Ronald Buchanan, Frank Maxwell and Wendy Osborne. Since then, many other local people have given their time and skills through the committee.The Friends come from all parts of our community and even further afield. The main source of income is through annual subions, with occasional gts. However, there is also some capital as a result of a direct grant from the Northern Ireland government in . This was given in recognition of the Friendsrsquo potential for improving community harmony through peaceful exploration of our common cultural heritage. It is estimated that they have given the museum about pound, towards a great iety of projects during the last  years.However, perhaps more important is the long-term commitment the Friends have shown to the museum. They give their time, goodwill, skills, knowledge, experience and advice, on a voluntary basis, to help the museum in many ways. With their close association to the Museum they have witnessed the reduction in staff and understood the impact of the proposed restructuring.Friends in the art world, such as Richard Croft, Betty McCord and Jim Manley, have supported the museum by generous donations of their own work. Some have used their contacts to acquire works with large discounts whilst others have been able to alert the Museum to items for sale in auctions.The Friends donated Mixed farm, Slievenaman, an oil painting by Tom Carr, to mark the th anniversary of the museum, in . In , they donated Mourne Hayfield, a watercolour by Chris Dearden, to mark the th anniversary of the museum.They also purchased Silent Valley, a watercolour by Jim Manley, in , Landscape, Tyrella, an oil painting by Daniel OrsquoNeill, in  and part funded Down Cathedral and Southwell School, tempura on board by Patric Stevenson, in .The pieces of glass made by Alison Lowry, and which can now be seen at the entrance to the Cell Block, was part funded to mark the th anniversary of Friends. The inidual pieces are representations of objects associated with the lives of prisoners held in this building. The Friends also supported a residency for Australian artist Christina Henri commemorating women prisoners transported from Down Gaol.Friends with musical connections have organised tin whistle classes. The Friends also paid for a local harpist to play in galleries on summer Sunday afternoons and for the choral society at a Christmas event.Keen gardeners have brought plants into the museum to sell and opened a private garden to visitors to raise money.Car boot sales were another popular method of fundraising and the museum courtyard provided a useful venue for several organised by the Friends.Technical, photographic and conservation projects have benefited over the years from the Friendsrsquo assistance. Equipment and materials included a laminator, scanner, digital camera and archival storage. A drone pilot course was funded.The loan of St Patrickrsquos Head shrine from another museum was only made possible by its prior conservation, which the Friends paid for. One of the most important projects was the initial cataloguing of the D J McNeill Collection, by means of a placement, largely supported by the Friends.Young people have been encouraged to enjoy learning about history by Friendsrsquo funding for prizes for school competitions, poster packs for schools, and programmes for The Young Archaeologistsrsquo Club. The Education Service was assisted by the purchase of a photocopier and replica pots for children to handle.Publications have always been an important part of the museumrsquos work, in disseminating information about the collection, for setting objects in their historic context and most importantly, their relationship to people. To this end, the Friends have match-funded the annual Down Survey, - and .They assisting with the publication of two townland maps, which were freely distributed to schools and community groups. Books included A man stepped out for death, Thomas Russell and County Down, a collaborative publication to mark thebicentenary of the United Irish Rising of  and Aspects of Audleystown by Brian Turner, a book designed to help iniduals and groups study their townlands.

Stormont is broken and she will help lead the fight by Aontuacute to make the democratic institutions work.ldquoRosemary will also stand strong for the human right to le for everyone. She fully supports the integrated education sector but will fight for equality and parity of esteem in the education system, especially for rural schools and will oppose the Integrated Education Bill. All students mdash Catholic, Protestant and Integrated mdash should be treated equally.

The conversion took UCD into a -point half time lead.The second half was dominated by Ballynahinch with the wind at their back and a big crowd roaring them on.Their maul was proving to be a real weapon and Kyle McCall was again the beneficiary with a try after  minutes after a superb maul.Tommy Donnan then had what seemed a certain try disallowed after another excellent maul, but when flanker Olly Loughead barged over on the hour mark to close the gap to eight points the home faithful could sense a famous win.However, UCD scored with their only attack of the second half through scrum half Richie Fahy to give the students some breathing space.Despite laying siege to the line, all the home side had to show for the last quarter was a penalty try with two minutes remaining and the students held on for victory and virtually assured their Division A status for -.Ballynahinch look destined for a nail-biting two-legged play-off against UCC to decide who goes down, but will hope to play themselves into better form over the final few weeks of the season.All support welcome at Garryowen this weekend.Ballynahinch : Nacho Cladera Crespo, Tom Stewart, Kyle McCall, Cormac Izuchukwu, Tom Martin, Tommy Donnan, Olly Loughead, Bradley Luney, Conor McAuley, Greg Hutley, Aaron Cairns, Ryan Wilson, Rory Butler, Ronan Patterson, Conor Rankin, David Cooper, John Dickson, Kyle Gill, Gareth Gill, Ruari Meharg, Yasser Omar..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Dougan goal cancels out Sam’s strike in derby  ","story":"THE local derby between Drumaness Mills and Killyleagh YC ended in a stalemate in quite horrendous conditions on Saturday.The Mills, who are currently on the back of a strong run of form and had won well at the reverse fixture a few weeks ago, would have been confident when welcoming old rivals Killyleagh for their Premier Division clash.The match at Meadowvale began at a high pace with lots of commitment shown by both sides in an effort to secure an early foothold in the game.In the early exchanges Rory Mason, Adam Keaney and then James McGivern all had half chances which they would have expected to have done better with.Somewhat against the run of play and with  minutes on the clock, Killyleaghrsquos Sam Carson rled the ball high into the top right hand corner of the net from the edge of the box with the home goalkeeper, Marc Reid, rooted to the spot. A fine goal at any level.Killyleagh were noticeably revitalised and buoyant following their goal, however, clever work from Callum Dougan on halfway sent Adam Kearney through in search of an equaliser with  minutes on the clock but he blazed over with the goal at his mercy.Killyleaghrsquos Conor Hamilton was becoming more and more influential in the game and continued to probe and prompt throughout, although he will be rueing his miss when he seemed better placed to score to put his side further ahead.On  minutes Rory Mason broke at pace and found Dougan, who forced a smart save from Aaron Carberry in the Killyleagh goal. Kearney, following up, trickled the rebound towards goal before it was hacked to safety before crossing the line.The Mills continued to press and a surging run down the right from Ben Campbell resulted in a fine ball across the face of goal but without anyone reacting it went out for a throw on the far side.Killyleagh had a corner in the th minute and in an example of the conditions, the now swirling wind took the ball directly out of play and with that the referee blew his whistle and brought the half to a close.Half-time: Drumaness Mills FC  Killyleagh YC .Clearly unimpressed with his sides first half showing, Drumaness manager, Mark Kerr, made two changes at half-time. Off went Rory Mason and Adam Kearney to be replaced with Eoin Rooney and Keegan Domican.As the game settled after the restart on  minutes, Campbell blazed a half chance over when well-placed following a corner for the home side.The next attack did bring the equaliser the home outfit craved. The ball fell to the feet of Callum Dougan after a Mills attack down the right looked like coming to nothing and he despatched it to the back of the net with aplomb. The clock ticked by with  minutes gone and both sides were now level.On  minutes Daniel Bell replaced Conor Carew in the engine room for The Mills and as the game heated up and became quite frantic around the  minute mark, McGivern was booked for two strong challenges in quick succession.As the game entered the final few minutes, Marc Reid made a top level save with an acrobatic reflex to push the ball onto the roof of the net when it didnrsquot seem possible showing shades of Gordon Banks.The away team were now pushing hard for the winner they craved and were blown up for an offside call on  minutes with Naseem Ouldhamiat through on goal.As the dust settled and a level of calm was restored the referee blew for full-time.A local derby which was keenly contested throughout and a draw was probably a fair result on the balance of play..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"First half nightmare for Ballynahinch at home  ","story":"BALLYNAHINCH lost out to Portrush on home soil in their latest Ulster Intermediate League encounter at the weekend.lsquoHinch began strongly and on the attack from the first whistle as Alex Millar was quickly able to play the ball out from the back and up to Matthew Martin.The Ballynahinch player played the ball up to Kyle Patterson on the left wing, who was able to slot the ball in off the back post to put his side on the scoresheet.Portrush were quickly on the counter attack down the right-hand side only to be stopped by Ashley Brown and lsquokeeper Aaron Donnell.Portrush were determined to level the game and were able to slip the ball from the baseline through a crowded circle before putting the ball in at the back post.Leslie Harrison played the ball out to Scott Leetch on the right, who was able to pass up to Craig Harkness and over to Michael Carney and Jason Campbell up front.They were able to create chance after chance, but were denied by the Portrush lsquokeeper and their defence.lsquoHinch came out in the second quarter looking to add to the scoreline.

The part of the track closest to the residents will be some - metres away.But Shan Slieve Drive householders say that is too close. In their petition to planners they say that the nearest gardens to the track are just  metres away and  dwellings and two major residential homes for the elderly are within  metres of the site.ldquoThe noise generated by the use of the track is likely to be highly detrimental to residents over a wide area, they claim. ldquoSuch a track is likely to operate from Easter until the end of September at least at weekends and almost certainly daily from am until pm during July and August.

She said items are even thrown at passing cars in the townrsquos main streets.The discussion centred on the possibility of including Killyleagh in any further council bye-laws to prohibit drinking in public.The councillors urged the committee to contact the council to make them aware of the need for the bye-laws.BISHOPSCOURT ndash The owners of the former Bishopscourt airfield have outlined their plans to turn it into an international standard motor-cycle race track.Owners David Beattie and John Grfin believe the track can become one of the best circuits in Britain in the next two to three years.They pledged the former RAF base will be transformed over the coming weeks into a circuit as good as any in Ireland.And they have promised to bring over some of the top names in world motor-cycle racing, with the eventual target a world championship grand prix race.The duo gave a detailed outline of their proposals at a special press conference held in Strangford on Thursday night. It was ostensibly geared towards announcing the first race meeting at Bishopscourt for  years on March  ndash but as a result of the local controversy which has surrounded the project, they took the opportunity to answer many of the criticisms.Mr Beattie said: ldquoWe believe racing at Bishopscourt will put this end of the county on the map.ARDGLASS ndash A claim has been made this week that Ardglass fishermen will not benefit from a trawler decommissioning scheme announced by the Government.Local SDLP councillor Mr Dermot Curran says Ardglass trawler men will be allowed ldquovery littleany of the pound million which has been earmarked for the scheme.The pound million is intended to over the entire UK fishing fleet over a two-year period. The money will be paid to owners wishing to leave the industry, therefore reducing fishing capacity.Mr Curran said the money on offer is too little to help local fishermen.ldquoThere are  boats in Ardglass. A number of owners want to leave the industry, but this will not let them get out, he added.Mr Curran said Northern Ireland fishermen were in dficulty, with some living on the breadline.Accusing the

budgets then staff may be laid off.Addressing his schoolrsquos annual prize distribution on Wednesday night, Mr Hanna said it was wrong for schools to have to make the decision on how many teachers should be employed and their levels of pay.ldquoOn introduction the Government was at great pains to assure us that the purpose of LMS was to enable schools to decide their own priorities in the allocation of funds and thus enrich the educational experience offered to our pupils, said Mr Hanna.ldquoWhat was not said, of course, was that the Government had tired of the antics of the teaching unions and their demands for better promotion prospects and smaller classes, and it decided to off-load the problems, via LMS, on to inidual schools who now have to take the decision about class size, the number of teachers to be employed and their levels of pay, he added.SEAFORDE ndash A new phase in the drive to plant one million new trees in Northern Ireland was officially launched at a

the pandemic, organising this yearrsquos event would not be possible.DUP councillors Glyn Hanna and Kathryn Owen said confirmation that the festival would not take place this summer was ldquodevastating for local businesses, thousands of people who regularly attend the event and aviation enthusiasts.They said they were ldquohugely disappointed that the event would not go ahead, given its massive popularity and the contribution it makes to the local economy.ldquoWe understand the timeframe between the Northern Ireland Executive lting the Covid restrictions and the proposed date for

consulting one of its key partners.The Ulster Aviation Society mdash which has played a major role since the inaugural festival mdash has described its disappointment at the cancellation decision.Regularly attracting in the region of , people to the resort in the summer, the flagship tourist event has been a major success for over a decade.The Ulster Aviation Society said it was ldquodisappointed and dismayed about the cancellation of the air show and the fact that the organisation had not been consulted.Society chairman Ray Burrows said it was ldquoastonishing that the event had been ldquoshot down in secret, with no reasonable explanation.He said the Society would be pleased to meet with the council to discuss the matter and to help Newcastle demonstrate in a powerful, popular way, how important aviation future and heritage are to Northern Ireland.Mr Burrows suggested that unless the councilrsquos decision is reversed, or at least re-assessed, he expects there will be tremendous disappointment from the public.The international festival was cancelled in  because of bad weather and in  and last year because of the Covid- pandemic it was also grounded.A council spokeswoman, who did not respond in time to meet last weekrsquos production deadline, said proposals for the local authorityrsquos - tourism events programme have not yet been considered.She added:

Land at the rear of Russell Park is not deemed a flooding risk.Late last year, politicians said they are keen to see a wide-ranging development plan for the town centre location and while they accept that it may not be possible to deliver everything that will be in the blueprint at the same time, they want to aim high and also target potential funders to finance what will be an ambitious project.Downpatrick area councillors met with senior council officials last week to discuss proposals for the development of the park with the focus on maximising the opportunities that Dunleath offers.It has been agreed that a paper detailing plans for the new skateboard park and pump track will be outlined at a forthcoming meeting of the local authorityrsquos Active and Healthy Communities Committee.A working group has been set up to oversee the future of the park and its members have taken a close look at the existing sports pitches, with many keen to provide at least one G or G pitch which would provide a facility that could be used all year round.Downpatrick councillor, Oonagh Hanlon, described the development plans for Dunleath as ldquoexciting and praised the local authorityrsquos sensible approach to maximise its potential.She also conceded that while parts of the park present challenges as they are included within a flood plain, there is agreement aiming local politicians on the way forward.ldquoWe need to press ahead with what is achievable in the short term at Dunleath Park, whilst keeping an eye on a longer-term strategy. I am pleased that Downpatrick area councillors can work collectively for progress in the area, she added.Itrsquos understood that details of Downpatrickrsquos first ever parkrun event are being finalised and that once the date of the K event has been confirmed, the event will become an annual event for runners of all abilities.Hugely popular across the globe, those working to bring the event to Downpatrick say it has the potential to provide the local economy with a boost, bringing in many competitors from outside the town.Downpatrick Town Committee is behind the ambitious plan for the new parkrun which it believes will bring the local community closer together and may encourage people who have never run before to get out and enjoy themselves in an event where there is no time limit and no one finishes last..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Recovery is possible to restore bond with you and eating food  ","story":"WITH the pandemic dictating to us over the last two years, there has been an increase for those struggling to manage their dficult feelings, sudden le changes, isolation and trying to gain a sense of control mdash which has resulted in an increase of cases for the treatment of eating disorders.Eating disorders, or a disordered pattern of eating, can arise when a person uses food to cope with painful situations or uncomfortable feelings.Problems with food develop when it is used for emotional rather than physical reasons, such as feelings of anxiety, anger or guilt. The food serves as a stress reliever and in many cases initially the person is not aware of what they are doing.In this day and age of dieting, health and fitness, it is sometimes dficult to ascertain the dference between someone who has an eating disorder and a person who is simply weight conscious.The main ingredient present in a person with an eating disorder is the use or abuse of food to cope with dficult feelings, whereas a weight conscious person may simply want to lose weight for a wedding, an occasion, to fit into an outfit.It is the psychological and emotional implications that separate the weight conscious person from the person with an eating disorder. Unfortunately, some embarking on a weight loss trail start out innocently to lose lsquoa few poundsrsquo, however over a period of time a personrsquos brain and body chemistry can be affected by the diet they have chosen and as a result the brain and bodybecome impaired.Possible causesThere is no single cause for eating disorders, as there are many factors pertaining to them. The common thread seems to be a supersensitive nature, low self esteem and an inability to respond appropriately to uncomfortable feelings.The good news is recovery is possible and a person can restore their relationship with themselves and with food. All iniduals have their own unique personal issues that contribute to their eating disorder, so treatment has to be tailored to the iniduals specic needs, personality and lestyle.Who develops disorders Anyone can develop an eating disorder, regardless of age, sex cultural background, etc, and it is not unusual for an eating disorder to surface in middle age. Research suggests that there may also be a genetic disposition to eating disorders and a link to certain personality types.However, there are certain factors pertaining to eating disorders and anyone can develop a disordered pattern of eating. A traumatic event, disordered perception, being abused, being bullied, a long term illness, a death, negative influences from a family member or a friend can all have a part to play in the symphony that can create issues around food.What are the categories There are several categories of eating disorders. However the main culprits are anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, binge eating disorder and other related disorders.These disorders centre around extreme or potentially dangerous eating and weight control behaviours which include binge eating, starving, purging, chewing and spitting and over exercising.There are two less known eating disorders mdash night eating syndrome and orthorexia nervosamdash as well as further categories under the title of EDNOS , but today Irsquod Like to explore the three most common types of eating disorder.AnorexiaThe first case of anorexia was in  in France and the first paper on anorexia was written by Sir William Gull in .Anorexia is the relentless pursuit of low body weight either by curtailing food intake or restricting particular foods thought to be fattening. This can result in emaciation and the risk of collapse or death.Some people exercise compulsively to burn off the lsquoperceivedrsquo excess of calories from the small amount theydo manage to eat. The focus based on food is an attempt to cope with control and to feel some sense of power in their lives.It is not about simply wishing to be slim like models in magazines. Starvation causes the disorder to take control and this alters brain and body chemistry that results in further distortions, in thinking and emotional reasoning. As the illness takes more of a hold, a person starts to become exhausted as their energy levels are compromised due to lack of nutrition. This, together with an increase in negative energy, may account for the heaviness they feel.In all cases this heaviness is mistaken for fatness, hence they engage in a constant struggle to keep losing weight. It is a war on food that must be maintained despite the already severe weight loss that the person has incurred.Anorexia checklist:Weight loss in a short space of timeLoss of periods for womenFeeling cold all the timeDizzinessDry, rough, pale discoloured skinSevere restriction of foodFood rituals, such as chopping food into small pieces, counting bits of foodBloated stomach Loss of bone massMood swingsPerfectionistic attitudesInsecuritySelf-worth becomes based on what is eaten or not eatenIntense fear of gaining weightDistorted perception of body shape, weight, personality and amount of food eatenRigid and obsessive behaviourWearing baggy clothesAvoiding companyIn some cases some take laxativesBuzz from starving ndash sense of power or worthConviction that they are OK despite concerns of otherAs you can see, the above have far reaching effects on a personrsquos health and well-being, and as suchleft untreated can be fatal.The long term effects can lead to women becoming infertile or have dficulty getting pregnant. There is also a high risk of developing osteoporosis for both men and women.BulimiaThe term Bulimia nervosa literally means lsquoox hunger of nervous originrsquo. This hunger is driven by an emotional need that food cannot alone fill. Usually this person feels this void or gap or emptiness and they seek to use food to fill it. Unfortunately, as many find out, the emptiness cannot be filled by food, as it is emotional, physical and spiritual.Sufferers characteristically binge eat or over eat and end up feeling bloated, worse, too full. After their eating episode they then vomit and or take laxatives in a bid to prevent themselves from gaining weight. Others also over exercise in a bid to burn unwanted calories. As with anorexia, control and the abuse of food to cope are also present.Bulimia usually follows dieting and starts later than anorexia mdash in late adolescence. It may follow anorexia. It can continue for many yearsleft untreated, thus many older women have the illness. The period after childbirth is another time when women are at risk.Bulimia is also associated with low self esteem, lack of confidence and over-evaluation of weight and shape, and a need to control weight. Bulimic behaviour is very addictive as, while vomiting and exercising the brain releases endorphins, chemicals which are the bodyrsquos natural pain killers.The ritual confers a sense of emotional release, so what starts off as a way of controlling calories, becomes a way of getting this emotional release ndash which will be repeated whenever a person feels emotional or physical stress.Bulimia checklist:Frequent weight changes.Sore throat, swollen glands, tooth decay, bad breath.Preoccupation with an overestimation of body shape and weight.VomitingLaxative abuseRigid and harsh exercise regimesFear of putting on weightDepressionMood swingsElectrolyte and fluid imbalancesPoor skin condition and hair lossLethargy and tirednessHeart palpitationsInternal organs damageUncontrollable urges to eat vast amounts of foodAnxiety, guilt and shame attached to self and behaviourFeelings of isolationBuzz from vomiting, sense of release reliefBuzz from perceived weight lossEasy weight gain.Again, like anorexia, the above can have a far reaching effect on mental, emotional, physical and spiritual well being. In extreme cases bulimia causes heart failure because when a person induces vomiting, they lose potassium from the body.Potassium is a mineral which regulates the sdrenal glands, the nervous system, the heart and energy levels of the body. The adrenal glands in the body are responsible for handling stress effectively. Other dangers include rupture of the stomach, choking, drying up of saliy glands.Binge eatingLike bulimia, binge eating disorder has only recently been recognised as a distinct condition. It was in  that it was first acknowledged as an eating disorder in its own right.BED is very similar to bulimia in all respects, except that the person does not purge to dispose of unwanted calories. It is believed that there are more people suffering from BED than anorexia or bulimia.People who binge or overeat and who do not purge usually struggle with their weight, although not all are overweight. Being overweight , of course brings with it the risk of a host of other physical illnesses and most sufferers feel depressed, out of control and ashamed of their behaviour.Binge eating checklist:Binging in secretEating very rapidlyEmotional eatingCanrsquot stop when had enoughSensing the eating behaviour is not normalEating despite feeling very fullsometimesFeeling out of control when eatingShame, depression, guiltCompulsive eating when not hungryFantasies about being a better person when thin.As many people with weight issues are judged by society, a supportive and nurturing environment is necessary in order for the inidual to feel safe. Here again, education is a vital component of recovery from any eating disorder. Therapeutic interventions work at both physical and emotional levels to deal with the urges, cravings, to change eating habits, look at thought patterns and rules, becoming more emotionally resilient. Ultimately treatment is available that helps each inidual become empowered, recover and move forward with their lives.If you have any queries or would like to arrange an appointment please call   or email empower@post www.empowercounsellingni.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Top dancer Anna qualifies for World Championships  ","story":"LOCAL Irish dancers have proven themselves to be a step above the rest once again.Members of the Crossgar-based Scoil Rince an Chroiacute dance school enjoyed plenty of success at the Kelly Hendry Feis in Newcastle upon Tyne and the Mid-Ulster Grades Feis in Dungannon.Thirty-five dancers from the school took to the stage at both locations with dancers excelling in both the grades system and championships.The school ed home with  first places,  top five places and a host of trophies and sashes.The schoolrsquos success comes of the back of a very successful Ulster Championships in Ballybofey in October.Anna McGlew qualied for the World Championships to be held in Belfast at Easter and Sean Gordon achieved fth place, reaching a podium place at his first Ulsters, having only started to compete four months prior.Teacher Briacuted McKinney said: ldquoWhilst acknowledging the ious pandemic-related challenges brought to us in  and early this year, the great class spirit and support for each other helped drive our ious success both last year and this year to date.Co-teacher Maura Davidson commented: ldquoThe results are down to the commitment, dedication and support from our dancers and families.The school now prepares for their first championship feis in Downpatrick later this month and the World Championships at Easter.Classes continue weekly at the studio in Crossgar.

Teaching, and hence learning, relies on communication, the essential verbal and non-verbal communication between child and teacher cannot take place behind a mask. All those non-verbal cues which teachers use to gauge understanding are being lost.A child’s capacity to express feelings and emotions is being affected by being masked. Some children cannot make eye contact and can’t sleep, clear signs of psychological distress and of course, impacting on their capacity to learn. Referrals to schools’ counselling services have rocketed.How can it be healthy for a child to wear a mask six or seven hours per day How can we justy a measure which has no benefit to children and accept the damage to their education, mental health and social development It is long past the time to end this abuse of our children.Hugh McCarthy, , Newtownabbey——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

Prior to being in Lurgan, the organisation’s administrative base was located in Dublin and Belfast.The Royal Black moved out of Brownlow House in  to temporary premises in Loughgall, beside the Museum of Orange Heritage at Sloan’s House.Now, the institution is looking forward to taking up residence in their own purpose-built administrative centre.“The opening of our new headquarters will be a landmark day in the history of the Royal Black Institution,” said Rev Anderson.“This project has been one of the biggest and most important ever undertaken by the Imperial Grand Black Chapter of the British Commonwealth.“The need for our own headquarters was discussed and agreed in , we purchased the Loughgall building in , renovation work began in May , and I’m delighted to say we’re ready to cut the ribbon on Saturday, April .“It has been a long road to get to this point, and there have been many challenges along the way. “We had originally hoped to open the building in , so that the unveiling would form part of our celebrations for the centenary of Northern Ireland. However, the Covid pandemic wreaked havoc with our work schedule. But we were fairly relaxed about the delay as our focus was always about completing the building to a high standard rather than rushing to a completion date.“There are so many people to thank for all their hard work but I would like to take this opportunity to pay special tribute to the contractors, Weir Bros Construction, for their professionalism and attention to detail, and to our own clerk of works, Edgar Patterson, and quantity surveyor, Keith Anderson, and the entire Royal Black HQ project team, for their passion, commitment and expertise over the last few years.“Thanks to the efforts of everyone involved, we now have modern headquarters from which we can proudly maintain our stand for the Reformed Faith and strengthen our Christian and charitable outreach.”The building itself has an interesting history. At one stage it was a public house known as the Rock Tavern. Afterwards, a temperance advocate, Cecilia Cope, turned it into a coffee house. A later inhabitant was Field Marshal Sir Gerald Templer, a senior British Army officer and former chief of the Imperial General Staff, who fought in both world wars. In more recent times it housed a popular antiques business.The grand opening will also include the opening of a ‘Leaders’ Legacy’ exhibition on the lives of past sovereign grand masters, and the unveiling and dedication of a bust of Sir Norman Stronge.

They were quite humorous, talking about not stealing, but borrowing, a pony and taking it for a ride, it was probably quite normal back then.”Isaac continued: “When he passed away, I took the recordings and combined them with music and sound design and put it into a small personalised wooden box to give to my mum as a gt. “She had no idea that I had done any of this, and her reaction was an indication of the enormous potential that personalised listening experiences could offer to family members and patients in a similar situation. That’s when I had the idea for the ‘From My Perspective’ project.” Isaac is studying a PhD looking at ‘Creative Arts for Palliative Care’ based at the Sonic Arts Research Centre, a project which involves recording interviews with day hospice patients. He said: “The main hospice I was working at was Marie Curie, I was able to do this with  participants over the summer, it was a great experience.“I combine elements of their voice, music, and sound design into a memory box which can then be played back through the device’s in-built speakers.“My aim was for the recording to last around  minutes to an hour, so I’d maybe record up to two hours and I’d edit it down to the best bits and cut out the bits where I was talking.

They say that the beach is a sand and shingle beach and has a reputation for being one of the cleanest in the region. There is a coastal walk, chance to go fishing, surfing and views of Tusker Rock.For those owners who may not yet have ventured to the beach with their pups or are concerned about behaviour while at the beach, Wood Green’s dog behaviour and training specialist, Wendy Kruger, has provided some tips to prepare your dog for the beach.• Ensure your dog’s microchip and collar tag details are up to date – just in case.• Get used to checking ground surface temperatures before you take your dog out, as dry sand can be too hot for dogs’ paws on sunny days. To check the ground temperature, place the back of your hand on the ground. If its too hot to hold comfortably for five seconds, it’s too hot for dogs’ paws..remove• Practise basic, reward-based training when out and about to help your dog to maintain focus and engagement on walks.• Recall is also an area that needs particular attention. Evenyour dog has a great recall at home, its not something that can be guaranteed in unfamiliar environments with exciting new distractions. Games with toys are a fantastic way to help your dog engage with you when there are other distractions around. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

Picture: Huw Evans Picture Agency “All appropriate measures to provide care for the inidual and to reduce the risk of transmission to others are bring taken,\" the Argus reported him as saying that day.\"I’d like to take this opportunity to assure the public that Wales and the whole of the UK is well prepared for these types of incidents,\" he added. \"Working with our partners in Wales and the UK, we have implemented our planned response, with robust infection control measures in place to protect the health of the public.\".removeStrict lockdown measures followed, and in the past two years we have spent months, in total, following stay-at-home rules and unable to meet others.That changed with the discovery and rollout of the ious Covid vaccines, and in Wales the jab rate became one of the best in the world after some initial delays.But coronavirus has taken a huge toll on society and has led to many people becoming ill and dying.Newport city centre during the coronavirus pandemic in .

Secondary impacts on healthcare have been profound: shutting down non-essential services during lockdown has meant demand for NHS services hit record levels, with more than , people on treamtent waiting lists in Wales.And there is growing recognition, too, of the other harms caused by restrictions, such as the impact isolation can have on peoples mental health.Presently, the situation in Wales is more settled, after the Omicron iant wave receded in the New Year. But the virus continues to do harm:  more Covid deaths were reported in Wales on Tuesday.The next Welsh Government Covid review will take place this Friday, and there are hopes the nations remaining Alert Level Zero restrictions can be scrapped by the end of March.A government survey last week found public attitudes to the pandemic are at their lowest point since the virus was first discovered here.Some  per cent of people think the pandemic poses a high or very high threat to the country, and just  per cent think it poses a high or very high threat to themselves.The economic effects of Covid continue, however. That same survey found around one in four people are concerned about paying their bills a month from now, meaning the pandemics wider impact on society is unlikely to go away any time soon. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentsComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

CCR says it is committing £. million to the project in total, which includes the purchase price.The other £. million will be spent on \"demolition, remediation, and re-development\".The contracts have now been exchanged between Cardf Capital Region and energy giant RWE, the seller. The distinctive Aberthaw Power Station as seen from the air. Photo: Siriol Grfiths The Cardf Capital Region have released a proposed \"master plan\" for the redevelopment of the site, which they say \"will take several years to come to fruition given the nature of and complexities involved in the transitioning process\".In sum, CCR says it will:Support the production of renewable and green energy projectsProvide an accompanying battery storage facility to support the green energy projectsProduce a zero-carbon manufacturing cluster which will include green hydrogen production facilitiesProvide a green energy innovation centre to promote innovation, growth, knowledge and community interaction with the zero-carbon future of WalesBe responsible for the development and maintenance of a bio-erse ecology park which will include a visitor centre, providing amenities to the local communityCreate the correct conditions to support industrial de-carbonisation and future giga-plant facilities.Cardf Capital Region also says the project has \"the potential to create thousands of direct, indirect and induced jobs, along with local supply chain and upskilling benefits\", though no further details were supplied as to what that means in practical terms. An artists impression of the Aberthaw Power Station site created by London real estate giant, Reef Group for Cardf Capital Region The master plan of the site produced by London real estate giant Reef Group on behalf of Cardf Capital Region The CCR goes on to say that it will \"maintain a strong commitment to engage and involve local community stakeholders in order to develop an open, inclusive and participative ethos as soon as the commercially sensitive considerations have been addressed.\"There are areas of the site which require ongoing custodianship, in respect of nature, bioersity and managing the overall ecology of the site, which will be best achieved in partnership with community.\"The Aberthaw nature reserve. The lagoon is where the ancient Aberthaw harbour was situated before it was destroyed to make way for the power station. Photo: Siriol Grfiths The group also says that its redevelopment plan will \"commit to safeguarding and developing the Nature Reserve, working with colleagues in the Vale of Glamorgan Council to ensure effective plans are put in place. In the interim, whilst plans are worked through, commitment is given to ensure this ecologically valuable component of the site is protected and, wherever possible, further enhanced and augmented\".However, Cardf Capital Region, despite promising to work with local residents in the future, stops short of making specic reference to concerns raised by members of the nearby community recently. Those concerns centre around what will happen to the  metre high pulverised ash mound, the sea wall being breached by the tide, and problems with traffic due to poor local transport infrastructure. The long Aberthaw Power Station ash mound, m high. The smoke stack can be seen in the background. Photo: Siriol Grfiths \"Well believe these plans when we see them,\" Paul Turner told The National. He has been living in the shadow of the power station since  and says that since then, he and his we Sara have seen many ideas come and go, including nuclear power and tidal energy. \"Everybody who lives near that site knows how toxic it is. The ash tip is full of asbestos from when they demolished the original A power station. And the site gets flooded whenever theres a spring tide or a storm, ask anyone who has worked there. Thatll only get worse as the years go by.\"Will £ million keep the tide from drowning that site  Id say RWE are laughing all the way to the bank.\"The Climate Central Coastal Risk Screening Tool predicts that the site will be under water by , with flooding reaching as far inland as St Hilarys There are similar concerns from Barry Town Councillor, Dennis Clarke: \"The ambition for the Vale to access clean, green, high value employment is commendable but this site could not be sold to private industry. The likely reason the site was regarded as unsaleable might be the cost of dealing with tidal flooding, clearing the signicant level of contamination, removing the slag heap, identied as dangerous by RWE.\"Its well known that the road access is completely insufficient, especially bearing in mind the Vale and the Welsh Government persist in supporting a too large, unviable development at Model Farm\"I hope the CCR releases the papers that will show why they believe this site is suitable for any development beyond reinstating what was in place before the power station was built.\"A map produced by London real estate giant Reef Group in  depicting so-called major assets nearbyIn its statement, the CCR describes the Aberthaw site as having \"strong strategic links with other major assets, including Bro Tathan Business Park, Cardf Airport, and the overarching St Athan Enterprise Zone – one of the few sites in the UK capable of accommodating large-scale lithium-ion battery production\".Last month, the Welsh Government was accused of having let a proposed gigafactory project at St Athan \"slip throughfingers\" by Welsh Conservative South Wales Central MS Andrew RT Davies. It followed an announcement by car battery manufacturer, Britishvolt, that it was creating a factory in Northumberland, whereas St Athan had been its original preferred location. March  : Aberthaw Power Station as photographed from the Wales Coast Path. The site is currently badly flooded in the wake of recent storms and spring tides. Photo: Siriol Grfiths CCRs plans make no specic reference to tidal energy at Aberthaw either, despite the group having earmarked the site as being \"perfect for that type of facility\" last summer. By October , it was also reported that a new commission was being set up to explore building a barrage across the Severn estuary for tidal energy CCR is a part of that commission. However, a statement supplied by Welsh Government Economy Minister, Vaughan Gething, does moot the possibility of tidal energy: \"The proposed plan for Aberthaw is positive news which fits well with our commitment to develop tidal lagoon projects and support ideas that can help Wales become a world centre for emerging tidal technologies\".Mr Gethings enthusiasm is echoed by the UK governments Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Wales, David TC Davies, who is the Conservative MP for Monmouth: \"The UK Government’s investment in the Cardf Capital Region will deliver thousands of jobs at Aberthaw and help put Wales on course for an economic recovery from the pandemic.\"The current s of the Cardf Capital Region - including any activity at Aberthaw - will eventually move into the new South East Wales Corporate Joint Committee .Three other Corporate Joint Committees will cover the rest of Wales in the south-west, the north, and the central area of the country.This article originally appeared on our sister site The National. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

I can’t wait to hear what the children think of it.“This new school building will provide a modern teaching and learning environment for staff and pupils, as well as a range of facilities for the local community.”The design includes solar  with battery storage, an air source heat pump, electric vehicle charging points, storage space for bicycles and scooters, and green habitat areas.Contractors ISG began building the school in January last year, which forms part of the council’s wider £ million programme of new school buildings across the Vale.Cllr Burnett added: “The council has made a climate commitment through our Project Zero initiative, which aims to make the organisation carbon neutral by . Delivering schools like this, which are extremely environmentally friendly, is a key part of that pledge.“This is the latest project in our Sustainable Communities for Learning programme, a far-reaching body of work intended to transform educational facilities across the Vale.”Protests were sparked by the decision to relocate Llancarfan Primary School from its village setting five miles down the road to Rhoose, with some parents opposing what they saw as the closure of a rural school. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityFlammable cladding was found on Lydstep Flats in Llandaff North in March , following concerns about fire safety in the wake of the Grenfell Tower fire.Cardf council removed the cladding in December later that year, leaving residents suffering from cold flats, poor insulation and black mould.Now contractors ISG have started to replace that cladding, with the work expected to last until summer next year.Councillor Lynda Thorne, cabinet member for housing and communities, said: “I’m so glad, as I know all the Lydstep residents are, that contractors are now on site to begin replacing the cladding that was removed because it didn’t meet current fire safety standards.“The cladding we’re using to overclad the three blocks is of the highest level of fire safety.”The work includes new windows and upgrading balconies for the  flats. Meanwhile, residents in council flats in Butetown are still waiting for contractors to begin installing replacement cladding, with no start date announced yet.Flats at Loudon House and Nelson House in Butetown were also found to have flammable cladding in the wake of the Grenfell fire.Delays to both the council flats in Llandaff North and Butetown were due to inflation caused by Brexit and the pandemic, according to the council, as well as changes to the safety testing rules for new cladding. The estimated cost of replacing cladding at Lydstep doubled from £. million to £ million.Cllr Thorne added: “Progress on this work has been affected by signicant cost rises due to Brexit and inflationary pressures in the building industry, as well as the impact of the extensive testing and regulation framework for cladding solutions.“Throughout this time, we have been so grateful to the residents for their patience as we worked on finding the right solution for the three blocks, and it’s great to see contractors on site and work underway.” article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

We do have systems in place already, but they are not integrated, and many are coming to the end of their le, as they have been superseded by newer technology.“We want to reduce harmful emissions, improve air quality and make Cardf a healthier city to live and work in.

To achieve this, we need better infrastructure which is managed by an integrated, intelligent transport system.“It would act as the nerve centre ensuring bus corridors, cycleways and improved pedestrian crossings and pavements are recognised as a key part of the network, and helping to make travel on Cardf’s roads as efficient as possible.”One goal in the new policy is integrated ticketing, which would see people taking public transport be able to use the same ticket for a train and a bus, similar to in London..removeA new traffic control centre would be built for council staff, emergency services, bus and train companies, and enforcement officers. The new control centre would help monitor traffic across the city, respond to incidents quicker, reducing congestion.The A will pilot a ‘smart corridor’ scheme with buses given priority over cars. If successful, these could be rolled out on other main roads in Cardf.A public consultation on the intelligent transport system is expected to take place in summer, before getting signed off by the cabinet in autumn.Cllr Wild added: “Through the development of the transport user app, integrated ticketing and smart technology, residents and commuters will be better informed, so they themselves can make informed decisions on the best way to travel on any given day at any given time.“Our draft strategy looks at the use of data and technology to reduce congestion, incentivise active travel to make our highway network more efficient, and will help deal with incidents on the highway more effectively.“The opening of the bus station in  will act as a trigger point to implement new services and technology, so it is important that we do this work now.” article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.
