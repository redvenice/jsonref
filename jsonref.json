I felt quite emotional to be able to gift the second chair to him and meet him in person.\u0027It all started because a former staff sergeant from the barracks near where I live asked us if we could use his uniform to create a chair, so we took it on and sent it out to them in Australia, where they had relocated to.         The father-of-two made a wingback armchair for former staff sergeant Ben Parkinson, who suffered a broken spine and pelvis when his vehicle hit a landmine in Afghanistan in 2006\u0027I posted pictures of the chair on our Facebook page and it\u0027s been crazy ever since.\u0027I\u0027m on my eighth chair at the minute but there\u0027s many more customers waiting.\u0027Although a talented craftsman, it takes Mr Smith several weeks to complete a customer\u0027s chair and depending on size and specific design requests he may even need two uniforms to complete the job. He enlists the help of his son, Lee, 29, his fiancee, Nicola Marsh, 47, his mother, father and their partners - Cherry Barnes, 70, Barrie Barnes, 67, Eddie Smith, 72 and Gill Smith, 70 - who all help to source and collect the chairs as well as offering a hand in his workshop.The upholstering of the first chair was completed in partnership with Vicar Lane Shopping Centre in Chesterfield, as part of the Centre’s initiative to raise money for the Pilgrim Bandits via a ‘Charity Chair Draw’. But despite the long and laborious work they require, Dougie says the end result is worth it and believes he has found his most rewarding line of bespoke lounge furniture yet.

Critics have said the power plant is like a \u0027nuclear titanic\u0027 and fear another nuclear disaster similar to the recent deaths at Nyonoska. They fear that the Lomonosov could be \u0027additionally vulnerable to storms.\u0027 Greenpeace have protested the use of the reactor ship, saying that the pristine Arctic could be contaminated by an explosionSpokesman Rashid Alimov warned: \u0027Any nuclear power plant produces radioactive waste and can have an accident, but Akademik Lomonosov is additionally vulnerable to storms.\u0027A fear is that the pristine Arctic could be massively contaminated by a Chernobyl-type explosion and radiation leak.Rosatom says the new power station will offer \u0027clean, green, and stable energy supplies in harsh and remote conditions\u0027.         Deputy General Director of Rosatom, Pavel Ipatov, can be seen here taking a selfie in front of the Akademik Lomonosov before its departure for Pevek.

Neither solar nor wind could ensure uninterrupted electricity supply during the polar night when there is no wind and temperatures are well below zero. \u0027Scaremongering only boosts the continued reliance on fossil fuels, causing harmful emissions and air pollution which is, according to the UN, responsible for one premature death every five seconds. Anti-nuclear bigotry comes at a price of climate change and the damage to the Arctic becoming irreversible\u0027.          Five nuclear specialists died after a mysterious explosion at a missile range in the Russian ocean territory of the White Sea in the village of Nyonoksa on August 8 and radiation spiked 16 times higher than normal in a nearby town. Activists fear that the Lomonosov could be another Chernobyl-like disaster waiting to happenThe deployment follows an horrific accident in the sub-Arctic White Sea when five died during an explosion and radiation release on 8 August during a \u0027doomsday weapons test.\u0027 Russia was later accused of covering up a significant nuclear accident.The Akademik Lomonosov is due to supply heat and electricity for 12 years before it is towed to Rosatomflot\u0027s base in Murmansk, or a shipyard such as Severodvinsk close to the site of the weapons test horror.Here, spent nuclear fuel can be unloaded and other maintenance work carried out.  "},{"url":null,"title":"Nurse hunts bears deer wolves Idaho South Africa posts pictures Instagram","story":"Share this article \u0027Hunting helps these animals combat spread of disease and competition for food.

Speaking about it publicly for the first time, Atwood said that there had been “many requests for a sequel” over the intervening years, but she “always said no”.“However, as time moved on, instead of moving further away from Gilead we moved towards it, particularly in the US, and I re-examined that position,” said the 79-year-old novelist, who attended a midnight launch for the novel in London the previous evening.“I decided that although I could not continue with the story of Offred, I could continue with three other people and tell the story of the beginning of the end. We know from The Handmaid’s Tale that Gilead vanishes, it’s no longer present 200 years later because we’re having a symposium on it … So how did it collapse? How do these kinds of regimes disappear? I was interested in exploring that and also what it would be like for the second generation.”She sent a two-paragraph summary to her publishers in February 2017. The acclaimed television adaptation, which the novelist reads scripts for, but claims to have “no actual power” over, began in April that year.The Testaments follows three characters: two young women, one who grows up inside Gilead and one who has been brought up in Canada and Aunt Lydia, a fearsome and opaque figure in The Handmaid’s Tale, who reveals how she survived during the earliest days of the regime. “What these restrictive laws about women’s bodies are claiming is that the state owns your body. There is a parallel occasion for men and that would be the draft: the state owns your body and you have to go to war. But when they do that, they pay for clothes, lodging, food, medical expenses and a salary,” said a deeply sardonic Atwood.“I say unto them, if you want to conscript women’s bodies in this way, you’re forcing women to deliver babies, forced childbirth, and you’re not paying for any of it. It is very cheap, amongst other things. For a society claiming to value inidual freedom I would say to them, you evidently don’t think those freedoms extend to women.”Until the cold war ended, Atwood said, “the US was selling itself as the alternative to the cold war evil empire. They were the land of freedom, democracy, opportunity for all, and therefore they were not showcasing their shadow side … once that opponent was gone, everything could come out of the cupboard that had always been there. Out it has come.”With protesters around the world adopting the red costumes of the Handmaids to silently campaign for women’s rights, including demonstrations in Ireland, Argentina and recently in Texas, where an all-male council voted to ban abortion in June, Atwood said her creations worked as a form of civil protest.“You’re not making a disturbance, not saying anything ... you’re all covered up, no frightful bare shoulders,” she said. “None of this would be happening if countries were not putting other people in charge of women’s bodies. If everything were fair and equitable, and government really was by consent of the governed, only potentially pregnant women would be able to vote on these matters.”With The Testaments shortlisted for the Booker prize – judges called it a “savage and beautiful novel” which “speaks to us today, all around the world, with particular conviction and power” – and readers so desperate to get their hands on the book that they were queueing up for it at midnight, Atwood gave a wry smile to suggestions that she is a literary rock star.“Considering the lives rock stars lead, I hope not. I haven’t yet died of an opiate overdose, not yet, but there’s time,” she said. “This kind of thing could be quite ruinous for a 35-year-old because where do you go from there? But in my case we kind of know the answer.” One thing she refused to rule out was whether she would ever return to Gilead again: “Never say never to anything.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/23e59ec0e125f88fda2cf1245db989d4e0f541ff/0_165_4626_2776/master/4626.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5f9dc6b7e75180ef07d4dfe3df6c1fde","title":"share your reviews of the testaments by margaret atwood","story":"Whether you’ve been waiting decades for the sequel to The Handmaid’s Tale or you’re new to Atwood, we’d like to hear from youIt is the literary event of 2019 and 34 years in the making: The Testaments, Margaret Atwood’s sequel to her dystopian feminist classic The Handmaid’s Tale is finally out in the world (a week after Amazon’s embargo-busting snafu.)

WeWork, the office space pioneer, is reportedly forging ahead with plans for a $20bn share sale despite being urged by SoftBank, its largest private investor, to delay it.Concerns over WeWork’s massive operating losses, pricey lease agreements and executive payouts have mounted in recent weeks. But according to CNBC, the company is still planning to start its investor roadshow and will start marketing itself to investors next week.Pressure to shelve the offering began last month after the company, now known as the We Company, released a prospectus that showed the company has lost about $3bn over the past three years.SoftBank, which has invested more than $10bn in WeWork, is believed to have been spooked by a substantial drop in the company’s valuation and, according to the Financial Times, its bankers have discussed putting the initial public offering (IPO) on hold.WeWork’s IPO underwriters at JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs are testing the appetite for a valuation between $15bn and $20bn – a substantial drop from the $47bn valuation SoftBank gave the company earlier this year.Their apparent hesitation, said Dan Ives at Wedbush Securities, speaks to a “fork in the road” in investor willingness to support profit-free tech companies.That concern, he said, is reflected in the weaker than expected investor demand for Uber and Lyft – both companies’ valuation has fallen since their public listing.“It’s about profitability and the nature of the business model,” Ives said. “The math doesn’t lie and investors are saying enough is enough with these valuations. We’re seeing a more valuation-sensitive investor and it’s having an impact on companies that lack profitability.”MKM Partners’ Rohit Kulkarni said in a note last month that investors would “have to take a big leap of faith in order to believe that WeWork would show signs of a sustainable economic model” given mounting losses and ambitious expansion to plans that could grow them further.But WeWork suffers from further complications, not least about its management. WeWork’s CEO and co-founder, Adam Neumann, has taken $700m out of the company ahead of its IPO, an unusual move for a founder. He also owns properties that WeWork rents, a potential conflict of interest.Neumann is also keen to expand WeWork beyond office rental. According to a recent blogpost from Neumann, the company’s new “guiding mission will be to elevate the world’s consciousness”.That, he continued, “means being a student of life, for life, where we accept that we are always growing and in a constant state of self-discovery, self-growth and change”.Under the rebranding and expansion efforts, which largely focus on unpredictable growth in China, Neumann has also said he sees WeWork as a “global platform” for things like “space-as-a-service”.For investors, who note that not a single woman will serve on the company’s seven-member board, investing in the company means having confidence in Neumann.Under a complicated share structure, Neumann controls the majority of the voting rights through the company’s class B and C shares. Neumann’s holdings could increase under the IPO, and WeWork’s leases include four buildings owned in part by him.Since founding WeWork nine years ago, Neumann has spent more than $80m buying at least five homes, as well as commercial properties and stakes in startups, including a medical cannabis company.According to corporate governance expert Charles Elson, the problems WeWork is having with its valuation and the prospect that it may be forced to shelve its IPO come down squarely to problems often reflected when a company offers a dual-class stock that in effect offers investors no accountability.“The common shareholders have basically no power – it’s all concentrated in the founder,” said Elson, director of the John L Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance and Edgar S Woolard Jr chair of corporate governance at the University of Delaware. “Given the conflict of interest transactions that took place there over the years, it’s problematic. When you combine those actions with the dual-class structure, the concern is, could this happen again?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/45b7aedbc89cff918918041e460d67700450b3d4/0_49_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=10bf76368e47dbf6ca024f55d73ff5fb","title":"wework looks like a bubble waiting to burst","story":"Wall Street isn’t playing ball with the shared workspace landlord’s inflated valueOne way not to recognise a potentially heavy investment loss is to close your eyes, ignore the evidence and pretend nothing has happened. This seems to be Masayoshi Son’s approach at WeWork.The SoftBank tech investor wants WeWork to abandon its flotation, reports the FT (£), for reasons that are not hard to guess. A listing in New York would expose the horrible truth about the allegedly hip workspace landlord. It ain’t worth $47bn, the value at which SoftBank injected the last portion of its $10.5bn investment. Try $15bn-$20bn, suggests Wall Street.Even the lower range looks rich. The problem with WeWork runs deeper than the teeth-grinding corporate mission statement (“A place you join as an inidual, ‘me’, but where you become part of a greater ‘we’”). First, there’s the losses – $1.9bn last year – with more expected into the middle distance.Second, there’s the unflattering financial comparison with London-listed property group IWG, which has been in the same marketplace for years and makes real profits, but is worth a more sensible £3.6bn.Third, there’s an obvious risk in taking on long leases on big buildings and offering tenants short, flexible rents. In a recession, tenants may decide to trade down and forgo WeWork’s funky murals and cheese-tasting events, but the landlord’s lease costs would remain fixed.Fourth, and perhaps most seriously, there’s WeWork’s breezy style of corporate governance. Co-founder Adam Neumann wasn’t obviously living up to the spirit of collective endeavour when his investment vehicle was paid $5.9m by the company for the right to use the trademarked word “we”. The sum has been repaid but how was the arrangement ever approved?Fans may counter that the sleepy world of shared office spaces was overdue a dose of innovation and global branding. Maybe, but WeWork remains a bricks and mortar company. It is not Alibaba, the Chinese online retailer where Son made a fortune.The flotation conundrum sets up serious tension. WeWork needs to raise $3bn-plus to keep expanding and unlock further investment. SoftBank, on the other hand, won’t want to record a formal loss on its punt while it’s looking to raise $100bn for its next Vision fund. It will still be in money on the early portions of its investment but any valuation for WeWork below $25bn looks likely to imply an overall loss. Even SoftBank’s normally reliable Saudi backers would be unimpressed.The rest of us, though, can cheer Wall Street’s refusal to play ball. It suggests rational analysis is returning to a stock market where, for a while, it seemed any over-hyped mega-venture with famous private equity-style backers could name its price. WeWork always looked like a bubble. Deflation had to happen.Advice for the CBI: damning all Jeremy Corbyn’s economic proposals with equal fury doesn’t work. Sometimes the Labour leader will produce ideas that big business might live with happily, or even come to applaud.A ministry for employment rights and a workers’ protection agency – the central pitch in Corbyn’s address to the TUC Congress in Brighton on Tuesday – should not frighten any responsible employer. Enforcing employment laws vigorously might even benefit companies who would not think of breaching rules in the first place. Free-riders would find life harder and competition might be made marginally fairer.It is not a revolutionary idea – and certainly not a case of “turning back the clock decades”, in the CBI’s excitable catch-all language. Sports Direct was obliged to reform working practices at its Shirebrook warehouse after this paper’s investigations in 2015 and a Commons select committee’s report. The affair struck a chord because workers – and, most fair-minded bosses – can recognise grubby behaviour.The biggest beneficiary, by far, every year would be the Treasury since idends for employees would be capped at £500-a-head. There is nothing inclusive about second-class share ownership, especially when workers’ existing pension schemes would suffer from the share dilution. If Labour wants to boost employee share ownership, cleverer approaches are available.But not every Labour idea is as radical as the CBI seems instinctively to believe. Ensuring that employment rights are respected should not be controversial. It would do the CBI no harm to say so."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a07d41b3dfc1f06670c5f77a5f90841204c66502/1677_493_2992_1795/master/2992.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ff464248316957ada444b7ec17bbdd9b","title":"zero waste shops and sustainable fashion meet the new breed of small business owners","story":"Frustrated by the effects of plastic pollution, Kate Robertson and her friends decided to take positive action. The self-styled “mums on a mission” set about creating a zero-waste shop in their home of Bridport, Dorset, launched a crowdfunding campaign and exceeded their £16,000 target by raising £17,000. But, by that point someone else had opened a zero-waste shop in the town, so instead they decided to create Dorset’s first mobile zero-waste shop, The Green Weigh. The women make seven stops a week in their repurposed van (affectionately named “Gertie”), visiting different markets and villages each day so people can top up on everything from beans and pulses to household goods and personal items.The aim is to reduce single-use plastics by refilling jars and containers. Customers go along with their own containers and fill up from those on board the van. “People love it, they enjoy learning a different way to shop,” says Robertson. “It’s a huge change of habit, you have to really think about how you shop. It’s not like going into a supermarket and picking up a bag of pasta, it takes longer, but many people think it’s worth it.” And while perceptions are often that zero-waste shopping is more expensive, they work hard to keep prices down by ordering in bulk and selecting suppliers carefully.The shop has proved so successful that they now also sell online, operating a click-and-collect service. For a shop with no set location, being able to operate on the move is vital, says Robertson. From using iZettle to take card payments to keeping customers posted on where and when they will be in places thanks to social media, they rely on technology to run the business. “We want to make it as accessible as possible,” says Robertson. “Ideally, we want to see everybody shop this way and everywhere to have a shop like this.”When Lucas Barrow-Townsend left university, he knew he wanted to do something worthwhile. Rather than work for a charity or someone else’s business, he decided to start his own. “I saved up a bit of money and went to Gambia, and that was where it all started,” he says. Continent Clothing sells garments made from traditional African wax print fabrics, working directly with local Gambian tailors, seamstresses and fabric merchants in Ghana, Senegal and Ivory Coast.Barrow-Townsend, 29, started selling at Camden Market and went on to have a shop on Brick Lane. Seven years later the business is still going strong and he now has a shop in Reading, as well as selling at festivals, events and online. Barrow-Townsend calls Continental Clothing a “socially responsible business”. “I know every single person in the production chain,” he says. “I know the person who sells the fabric, I know the tailor who makes the clothing, I know the people who send it to the UK. For every single thing, I know where the money is going. I know how much they’re getting paid, which is much more than the average.”When it comes to running a business that deals with people across the world, connectivity is vital, he says. “It enables me to FaceTime my tailors in Gambia, take card payments at festivals, and keep an eye on things wherever I am. Without mobile connectivity there’s no chance this would happen, or it would have been a much slower process. All of my tailors have access to phones now, even when I first started it was a lot harder to get hold of them, but now 3G and 4G is spreading across Africa so it’s a lot easier.”After bringing up four children single-handedly, Yvette Curley learned to take on pretty much any practical job at home. So when she decided to set up her own business, doing the same thing for other people seemed a no-brainer. “I cared for my nan for the best part of 20 years. I used to think: ‘what would she do if she didn’t have me if, say, her lightbulb went?’ She’d probably call an electrician and then get charged a huge call-out fee.” Cue the creation of Tilly the Handylady just 12 months ago. “Tilly”, who sees no job as too small, will take on anything from painting and lopping trees to carrying out repairs and even defrosting freezers. She charges a modest hourly rate and once the job is done she will often see if there’s anything else that needs doing to make sure the hour is met. “I try to keep my prices as reasonable as I can,” she says. “I don’t charge for call-outs, I don’t charge for quotes. I do all sorts – I paint, decorate, hang shelves, and if it’s not on my list I always tell people to call me anyway because I can probably do it.”A lot of Tilly’s customers in Rugby, Warwickshire, tend to be elderly, and she gets much of her business via word of mouth. They like having someone they can trust, she says, right down to being able to pay her by cheque that she can bank via an app in front of them. “I use my phone for pretty much everything,” she says. “Once you organise yourself and get everything set up, you can do everything from banking and payments to booking jobs in your calendar and obviously being contacted by people.”Stay one step ahead with Vodafone Do you run your own small business?

From sliding into people’s DMs to creating knowledge-sharing groups on WhatsApp, here are the tips to knowRunning a business can be lonely at the best of times, but when virtual assistant Chris Heron was struggling with back pain two years ago, she felt very isolated working alone in her rural Devonshire home office. “I was thinking to myself if I worked with other people in a normal job, I probably wouldn’t have gotten so low because there’s interaction with other people,” she says. “With small businesses, there’s often nobody to brainstorm or collaborate with. I realised other women must be going through this as well.”Her solution was to start a WhatsApp group. Now 21-strong, the group of professional women working in the south-west includes event managers, web designers, financial advisers and business coaches. They try to meet in person quarterly, but it’s often the virtual support day-to-day that has proved most helpful. “I think because we work on our own, it’s nice to be able to touch base with somebody else during the day,” says Heron. “We’re there to support everybody.”With the widespread use of social media by business owners, such virtual networking opportunities are increasing in number today’s entrepreneurs must be ready to build meaningful connections at all times. Here’s how to do that effectively, according to the experts.Build connections naturallyOnline networking may be possible 247, but many of the old rules about how to interact still apply, social media expert Paul Sutton says. Most importantly, entrepreneurs must avoid spamming people with a sales message as soon as they’ve connected with someone new. To that end, Sutton advises against sending a direct message straight away. Instead, engage with the content they’re posting, interact with what they’re talking about, and grow the relationship with consistent, regular contact points that build to something bigger over time.Look for relevant groupsLike Heron’s WhatsApp group, the use of private messaging as a networking tool has risen in prominence in recent years, says Sutton. It reflects a shift in how social media is being used more generally, with users more inclined to share content with friends via closed groups rather than engage with content publicly. Entrepreneurs will find relevant groups on platforms such as Facebook and LinkedIn – these might be industry specific, linked to a local area, or bring users together through some other common ground.Sutton has set up a Slack channel with almost 100 members for people in his industry off the back of his podcast, and has found it’s a medium that works well. “In a networking sense, rather than broadcasting information and content to the world … it’s very relevant people getting together in this private space, where we can give each other advice, disseminate lots of information about the industry, and share news.”Anne Sheehan, director at Vodafone Business UK, points out that these kinds of platforms can also boost productivity. “Whether it’s task management apps or collaboration tools, technology offers a huge opportunity to supercharge productivity. The key is to connect people, processes and information in a way that unlocks a workforce’s ability to do their best work.”Add valueRather than trying to sell your business while networking online, Lucy Hutchings Hunt, founder of digital development agency Systemyzed, believes entrepreneurs should give content away for free to build a reputation. “People do not make a buying decision at their first point of contact,” she says. “It’s all about building up that real sense of trust and nurturing your own tribe of raving fans who really believe that you’re the person to help them move forward.” That could be by making introductions if you have a contact who could support a new acquaintance, for example.Your business unlimitedTransform your small business with unlimited data, texts and minutes.

The deadlock means we are almost certainly heading for a general election, but the route towards one offers only stark options for both government and opposition – and risks putting severe strain on our constitution.Parliament has spoken unambiguously on its opposition to a no-deal Brexit by passing a new law mandating an extension. However, Boris Johnson has repeatedly insisted that he will not ask to delay Brexit beyond 31 October. At the same time, he has also said he will adhere to the law. This is an obvious contradiction.Meanwhile, the opposition parties (which, with the newly independent Conservatives, form a majority in parliament) won’t vote for an election until the Brexit deadline has been extended. So what happens next?With parliament prorogued, no election is possible before Halloween. The next few weeks will see a continued hunt for a deal, party conferences and the start of a long campaign until the election proper is triggered.Whatever doubt exists over how serious the government is about finding a deal, this outcome is still a possibility. But even if the UK and EU could agree a deal, it would still need to pass in parliament – as would the ensuing legislation. Getting such a contentious piece of legislation through its many stages looks like a near-impossible challenge for a prime minister who leads a ided party and has a working majority that has gone from three to minus 43.The competing narratives from the extraordinary parliamentary battles will be rehashed at the party conferences and throughout an election campaign that will not wait for the formal starting gun. The Conservatives will push their line that parliament is against the people. The Liberal Democrats have come out in favour of revoking article 50. Labour will focus on the incompetence and chaos of the government.Parliament will return on 14 October. The government’s Queen’s speech will be about electoral positioning, but there’s a good chance that it won’t even pass the Commons. This effectively means that a government has lost confidence, and Johnson might even try to bring about a vote of no confidence in himself – a route set out in the Fixed-term Parliaments Act – to get to an election. But the first votes on the Queen’s speech are due on 21 October, two days after the date when it is required that an extension be sought. And this type of no-confidence vote triggers a 14-day period – during which an alternative government could be formed – that will last well beyond 31 October. Opposition parties will be wary of giving him any mechanism to force no deal.If no extension had been agreed, then the pressure would be back on the opposition parties. To prevent a no-deal Brexit, they might have to vote no confidence in the government and show the Queen that they have a cross-party majority for an alternative government. A clear majority for an alternative meets Buckingham Palace’s test for appointing a new prime minister.If opposition parties can agree on an alternative caretaker government – and that is still a big if – then they could oust Johnson, request an extension and trigger an election. Perhaps the current PM would be happy with this outcome if he believes it can help a “don’t let them stop Brexit” campaign narrative. But defeat in a vote of no confidence also means Johnson is out of No 10 and power could be handed to Jeremy Corbyn. If this outcome is unacceptable to the government, then it must return to the question of whether it accepts parliament’s demand to delay Brexit.The government has said it will test the new law on extension “to its limits”. This suggests that it wants a court case, with the PM perhaps keen to portray the courts, like parliament, as part of the Brexit-blocking establishment. It ought not be conceivable that a government would drop hints about defying the law. Yet that is what has happened.The official line is that the government will adhere to the law. Finding some way to test that law, or implying that every option has been exhausted, could allow the prime minister to argue that he has tried every means possible to get Brexit through but is being thwarted by this parliament, the opposition parties and the courts. At this point, does he reluctantly extend and then ask the people to elect a parliament that would deliver Brexit? If so, expect the rhetoric on parliament versus the people to heat up even more in the coming weeks.This October showdown risks placing the constitution under huge strain. For a government to defy the law, and therefore undermine the concept of the rule of law, is unconscionable – and the civil service will have repeatedly warned about the gravity of such a situation.And if a government refused to relinquish power after losing the confidence of the House, and despite an alternative government waiting in the wings, then the Queen would be dragged into the mess. The palace would strongly urge the government to resign.The idea of that happening while the government is being challenged in the courts ought to be unfathomable.

I’d been in South Africa filming Zulu Dawn and got some sort of disease. I looked washed out. When the director Franc Roddam saw how sick I was, he told me to go home, but I was asked back for a screen test. When I heard that Johnny Rotten was no longer being considered for the lead role, I thought: “Well, this is it.”Roddam had us hang out for a month before filming started. He encouraged the depraved side of our nature – he was not one for tucking us into bed at night. We wore authentic clothes and were given lessons in how to dance and ride a scooter – and we got to hang out with some original mods. We were living it, doing all sorts of stuff to get us into the mood. That’s why it looks like we aren’t acting.We shot the end of the film first, at Beachy Head. Riding along the clifftop, I got a lot closer to the edge than I was meant to and fell off the scooter a couple of times. I remember the first assistant director, Ray Corbett, telling me: “Listen, it’s the third day. If you fell off that cliff, d’you know what would have happened? They would have recast you tomorrow.”Jimmy’s not a hero, he’s just a normal boy next door, and that’s what makes him work. He ultimately rejects the whole ethos of being a mod – making your whole life revolve around sitting on a silly scooter. In the end, he had to jack it in to move on. He couldn’t take it any further.Quadrophenia’s a difficult one to live down. Over the years, it’s filled me with horror – and joy. At the time, a friend warned me: “If it’s a hit, they may only ever remember you as Jimmy.”When I was asked to audition, I didn’t know much about mods or their music, but we were all given a copy of the Who’s Quadrophenia album, which I really loved. I was 17 and a bit of an airhead, so I didn’t appreciate what a remarkable crew we had working on the film. It was a fairly small unit and there was not much of a budget, but we couldn’t have asked for a better director in Franc.They’d asked scooter clubs and mods from all over the country to come down for the Brighton part of filming. The moment we walked out of the hotel to start shooting, we saw all these scooters and hordes of mods lined up against the seafront. It was amazing. Filming the riot sequences was really scary. It was supposed to be staged but it was chaos, with police and members of the public getting involved. It was like a real riot – health and safety didn’t come into it at the time. When Franc shouted “Action!” everyone started running. They made sure Phil and I were at the front so that we didn’t get trampled on, but it was so frightening. I actually got knocked to the floor.It was shot at the end of September and it was very cold. There were no Winnebagos in those days and we all used to huddle together in someone’s car or a shopfront. If you look at the pictures of me during the Brighton shoot, I’m sitting on the beach wearing a coat with woolly gloves on and smoking a fag. We worked from eight in the morning right to about midnight. I think I was paid about £500. The film company really got their money’s worth.At the screen test I was just given a story outline, but when I saw the full script I was devastated because there was a nude scene. I said: “There’s no way I am going to do that!” I was quite prepared not to do the film. They gave me a rewrite of what is now known as the famous alley scene where Phil and I were to stage a love-making sequence. There’s been loads of speculation over the years with people saying: “Oh, apparently they really did it.” Well, I can honestly say, no, nothing happened – it was all acting. It’s just a bit embarrassing to watch. It’s the only sex scene I’ve seen where both actors are fully clothed.”Interviews by Simon Wells, author of The Making of Quadrophenia, published by Omnibus Press £20.

Its chair, Suzanne Jeffery, said: “We congratulate delegates at TUC conference who have unanimously backed a historic motion to support the school students’ global climate strike on 20 September and for all TUC unions to take action on the day. All unions must now turn words into action and build for a huge turnout … standing with students to demand urgent action on the climate emergency.”The leaders of all the main opposition parties in Westminster have backed the climate strikes. An early day motion tabled in the Commons by the Green MP, Caroline Lucas, and supported by the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, and the leaders of the Scottish National party, Plaid Cymru and Liberal Democrats, said urgent action was needed to tackle the climate crisis and called on adults to join children on the streets on 20 September."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/13f5664148331eed6f72359be1d33d1314b7d863/0_178_1917_1150/master/1917.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bf58b62817569b69d2c5a94cdc5f6b7e","title":"cerys matthews i wear my driving gloves to go round the corner to the shops","story":"The singer and presenter talks about feeling adventurous, hiding bad hair days and her favourite ever suit and hat comboThis is the kind of outfit that I feel comfortable in, and comfort is up there for me. I’m not big into dresses and skirts, but I love a good suit. This was taken at the Asian awards a few years ago – I love saris and all the extraordinary silks in traditional clothes, but I think that, for my heritage, a suit and a panama hat suits me just fine. When it comes to clothes, I think it’s important to feel like yourself, more than anything. I have become a little bit attached to hats, but I don’t have that many. I had always been a big fan of Clint Eastwood, the suffragettes and Bob Dylan, and they all seem to have hats on in their best photos, so I just started wearing them, too. I find it cuts corners in terms of not having to worry too much about your hair. You don’t even have to worry too much about your outfit if you have a good hat on.I’m also wearing my driving gloves they are ace. I’ve worn them so often I need to replace them. There are so many iconic films where actors wear driving gloves – I put them on just to drive round the corner to the shops and it makes it feel a bit more adventurous and exciting. The pearls were just next to the door, so I put them on, too.In the 90s, I used to wear clothes just for the ironic fun of it. It was often the most bizarre concoctions I could find. I had a gold cowboy hat and massive flares, with “Tommy” written down one leg and “Hilfiger” down the other, in three different colours, red white and blue. I’d wear it with a tiny silk top. My favourite quote is from Vivienne Westwood: “When in doubt, overdress.”At the time, the fashion was for understated looks, just one or two colours or cargo trousers, but I just liked to throw it all on: kaftans, turbans, just to have fun with the clothes, rather than wear anything sleek or serious. As a result, I do look back at loads of photos and go: “Oh my God, what in the heavens was I thinking?”Cerys Matthews is the co-founder of the Good Life Experience, 12-15 September 2019.

Which designer is making Made in Bangladesh a label to be proud of, and who the are the rising stars of Italian tailoring? We have the answers for autumnwinterRahemur Rahman’s chat is rapid. He has a lot of ideas and talks quickly to cram them all in. Hailed as a breakout star from London fashion week men’s, his naturally dyed, organic fabrics, and the jackets and trousers he tailors them into, are winning the 28-year-old fans from the UK to LA.He found his way to Central Saint Martins via a youth arts organisation, and at first his work “rarely touched on my culture”, inspired instead by “the London scene I grew up in – grime music, the contrast between rich and poor in Canary Wharf, the history of Brick Lane and tailoring”. But when Rana Plaza happened, Rahman had “an awakening” and became set on creating designs that spoke to the craft and heritage of his parents’ homeland. Inspiration comes from the mishmash that is his dad’s personal style, with a colour palette taken from old family photographs.Last year, he took his first ever trip to Dhaka – “I was like, mind blown,” he says. He now markets his brand as made in Bangladesh: “The textiles are made there and I’m made there, too.” EVBSerena Bute’s louche clothes may be airport style goals, but people will, she hopes, “do more than travel in them. Go to lunch, to yoga, dress them up for dinner.” Versatility and ease are key to an eponymous collection that can be worn by Bute, by her kids, her mother and, of course, by you. EVBBottega Veneta’s creative director Daniel Lee is to 2019 what Gucci’s Alessandro Michele was to 2016. If that doesn’t mean much to you, suffice to say he’s this year’s most hyped man in fashion. The 32-year-old Brit, a former Phoebe Philo protege at Celine, started the year by teasing an ad campaign that saw Philo worshippers immediately herald him as the natural successor to her understated minimalism. For autumn, however, he confounded expectations with a collection that combined men’s and womenswear, and added far more rock’n’roll swagger than the upscale normcore look Philo fans would have expected. Tailored pencil dresses, motorbike trousers and belted, oversized coats came in leather of all finishes – from a cushioned version of the label’s signature Intrecciato weave to an open loop design similar to chainmail. The shoes and the bags were instant hits.“I haven’t felt like this in years!” said influencer and shoe enthusiast Sandra Hagelstam on her Instagram account as she posted a picture of five box-fresh pairs of slip-on square-toe heels. The outerwear items will no doubt be hit items when temperatures drop. With waiting lists already amassed for much of this inaugural collection, let the Lee effect commence. SCNanushka has won over its female fanbase with its vegan leather and super-sleek silhouettes, but this season it’s widening its horizon to menswear. “It was always there in the back of my mind,” says Sandra Sandor, who founded the Budapest-based brand in 2006. “I was just waiting for the right time to launch it.” The transition should be a smooth one: the cut of signature pieces has always been unisex, and a recent overhaul has seen Nanushka enjoy the hype of a new label, with Yara Shahidi, Sienna Miller and Hailey Bieber all fans.Echoing its promise to deliver “a modern, versatile, day-to-night wardrobe for the modern human”, Sandor says she wants “to explore the fluid relationship between men and women, creating a genderless wardrobe with pieces that are beautiful but functional”. The new collection features relaxed suiting, workwear-inspired shackets and a good line in wide-leg trousers, peppered with paisley prints and a pastel palette. “Inclusive and effortlessly modern is the best way to describe it,” Sandor says. SCNew womenswear brand Ssōne puts an emphasis on organic cottons, reduced water usage and the “humanitarian side of working in fashion”. It is important to founder Caroline Smithson that as much work by hand as possible goes into the brand’s clothes – but that it doesn’t come across “too make-your-own-yoghurt”.Shunning the seasonal model, Ssōne instead hopes to develop a kind of uniform. The aesthetic is utilitarian with moments of romance – Smithson is inspired by 70s feminists “who were super-glamorous, but wearing overalls and picketing”. And designers may well use their leftovers on their clothes: one jumper has been naturally dyed using everything from foraged nettles to avocado stones from the team’s lunches. It looks good enough to eat. EVBWhen Naomi Campbell walked in little-known Nigerian designer Kenneth Ize’s AW19 show, he was little known no longer. “Everything is always Naomi’s idea,” Ize says. “We love her for her support.”The attention, if sudden, is a long time coming. Lagos-based Ize (pronounced e-zay) has been honing his craft since he started his eponymous menswear brand in 2015 after studying at the University of Applied Arts in Vienna under Bernhard Willhelm and Hussein Chalayan. Championing Nigerian craftsmanship, Ize uses local weavers to make the fabric for his multicoloured suiting, hoping to redefine luxury and shine a light on the country.“There is an increased awareness of the nuances of Nigerian fashion,” says Ize, who caught the eye of this year’s Louis Vuitton Moet Hennessy (LVMH) prize judges. “Younger designers are finding ways of reinterpreting this heritage and increasing its exposure, and I am very excited to be part of it.” SCEffortless, intelligent, liberated, political, sexual: that’s how Lulu Kennedy, founder of new talent initiative Fashion East, describes designer Mowalola Ogunlesi. Let us add one more: brave. In the last year, the Nigerian-born, Surrey-raised designer left Central Saint Martins mid-MA to get to the frontline of fashion her own way, designing clothes for Skepta to wear in a video and kitting out the likes of the Nigerian football team after gaining notoriety with her BA collection.The Mowalola brand celebrates what the designer has called “fluid masculinity”, with hand-painted leathers her MO. No wonder Kennedy nabbed her for Fashion East’s AW19 show – Ogunlesi’s catwalk debut. “Her singular vision comes from her heart,” Kennedy says. “She’s the punk queen and inspiration we all need.” SCWhat do you get when one of fashion’s favourite style curators teams up with a brilliant business brain and a talented designer? Deveaux New York. Not to be confused with the world’s oldest leather goods brand Delvaux, the label, founded by Matthew Breen and Andrea Tsao in 2016, brought street-style photographer Tommy Ton on board as creative director in 2018. Ton’s photography was a major instigator of the fashion industry’s current obsession with street style, so who better to consult on what the brand calls “street style reimagined”?The result – a mix of cashmere crew-neck jumpers, double placket shirts and tailored “architect trousers” – pricked the interest of matchesfashion which is stocking the brand for AW19. “The team have told me how they always consider the ‘real life’ factor – they wear the samples to see if they work on the morning commute and they’ll wash pieces, walk their dogs in them and so on,” says Damien Paul, head of menswear. “This allows them to develop a fairly minimal aesthetic but create best-in-class product.” SCYou, like 994k people on Instagram, might well have heard of Peggy Gou – the South Korean DJ sensation who plays to sell-out crowds from Berlin to Rimini – but for music, rather than fashion. This season sees Gou branch out and launch her clothing label Kirin, named after the Japanese word for her favourite animal, the giraffe. All head-to-toe prints, athleisure accents and jolty colour palettes, it was launched at Paris fashion week in February and smacks of the energy she emits from the DJ box – as well as what she herself wears for those gigs.The Italian look – either power dressing or power glamour, right? Not any more. A new generation are finding their power by revisiting traditional craftsmanship and adopting a more conscious approach.In Milan, Sunnei designers Loris Messina and Simone Rizzo use their brand to bring together creative communities (its last menswear show was staged in an urban regeneration project it funded on the outskirts of Milan), working with artists, musicians and charities on its critically acclaimed collections. Further south, Giuliva Heritage Collection, run by husband and wife Margherita Cardelli and Gerardo Cavaliere, champions the lost art of traditional Italian tailoring, designed from Rome, where they will open their first shop next month. “Special talents need to be nurtured as they define a nation,” Cardelli says. “It’s our duty to keep alive this great Italian talent.”The common thread with this Italian new wave? Authenticity. “Being totally transparent is something truly inspirational,” Cardelli says.“Our approach to life reflects what we do.” SC This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

This picture goes straight ahead for two and a half.Based on a true story, it is crammed with unearned emotional moments and factory-built male characters whose dedication to their sport we are expected to find adorable and heroic by turns. This is a standard-issue, middleweight biopic-type film, which comes complete with the now mandatory three factual sentences over the closing credits and the black-and-white photographs of the real-life people involved looking less attractive than the Hollywood stars who played them. James Mangold directs, from a serviceable original script by playwright Jez Butterworth, John-Henry Butterworth and Jason Keller.A relaxed Matt Damon brings his familiar, untroubled boyish charm to the role of Caroll Shelby, the racing-driver-turned-designer who was hired by Ford in the late 60s to put together a car and a team that would defeat Ferrari, those arrogant Italian artisans who presumed to think that their tiny little outfit had an artistry and flair superior to the corporate mass production of Ford.Christian Bale plays Ken Miles, the difficult, impulsive, grumpy but brilliant Brit hired by Shelby as his star driver – to the irritation of the pointy-headed, bean-counting suits at Ford, who want an obedient team player. Tracy Letts plays Henry Ford Jr with gusto and Josh Lucas plays Leo Beebe, his creepy assistant. Jon Berthal does what he can with the underwritten and underimagined role of Lee Iacocca, the Ford executive whose idea it evidently was in the first place for Ford to go into the glamorous but costly world of motor racing.The person with the most thankless role is Caitriona Balfe, who has to play Miles’s adoring wife, Mollie. She doesn’t have that much to do, and this is very much a guys’ film. At one stage, an irritable Beebe tells Shelby that Miles has the wrong attitude to be their driver and Shelby derisively replies that they could get some poster boy if he’d like and adds: “Hell, we can set up Doris Day behind the wheel if all you wanna do is lose!” That’s a rather ungallant line that reveals a little bit more about the film’s attitude to women than it intended.Bale’s performance is the polar opposite of Damon’s laid-back impersonation of Matt Damon. It is an actorly display: a spiky, gawky, angular and borderline-ridiculous collection of mannerisms, an accent that mixes Pete Postlethwaite with a bit of Noddy Holder and some body language that at times reminded me of Jack Douglas from the Carry On team. Bale drives along muttering, “Giddy-ap!” (Jodie Kidd did something similar behind the wheel when she was on Top Gear.)The film comes to life briefly in the sudden jolts and crashes that occur when fiercely competitive drivers bash into one another, and we realise that, unlike most other sports, motor racing is life-threateningly dangerous and was especially so in the 60s. So why are they doing it? Why is Miles pursuing something that could widow his beloved wife and make his son, Peter (Noah Jupe), fatherless. What has it all been for? The glory of the Ford motor company? Selfish speed thrills? It’s a mystery that is unsolved at the end of this blandly sentimental movie, which can’t reach out beyond the petrolhead fanbase."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e6d48be5519394ceb341c9684f24af98fdef704d/0_761_5126_3074/master/5126.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=514450b1b2fe0e76be4e8300483b6121","title":"nigel slaters midweek recipe sweetcorn chowder soup","story":"Capture the last days of summer with this simple soup, made from the season’s sweetest, sunniest vegetablePeel and roughly chop 2 medium onions, then let them soften with 30g of butter and 2 tbsp of olive oil in a deep pan over a moderate heat.When the onions are soft and sticky, slice the kernels from 5 heads of sweetcorn, then set those from 1 head aside.

On Saturday Manchester City charged £7 for adults’ tickets to the first Manchester derby of the WSL era – albeit with the first three kids’ tickets free – whereas Chelsea gave away all the tickets for their game against Tottenham on Sunday. There is no right or wrong way here there are positives and negatives to both approaches and valuable lessons to be learned.That more fans chose to pay to watch WSL football in Manchester (31,213) than attended for free in London (24,564) is perhaps the clearest indication that ascribing value to the product matters. Making a financial commitment – even a token one – has a big effect. Numerous pieces of research have shown that free events lead to a much bigger drop-off than paid-for ones.For Manchester City there was a somewhat cautious approach to talk of ticket sales. With days to go before the curtain raiser, with the numbers having been a closely guarded secret in the preceding weeks, we were told that more than 20,000 tickets had been sold. There were rumours of 25,000-26,000 and, as kick-off ticked closer, the press box buzzed with quiet talk of a possible 30,000. When the figure dropped, mid-game, there was a celebratory mood. It was higher than expected. Public caution, in that respect, paid off. People went away feeling a part of history and not disappointed with a failure to come close to filling the 55,000 capacity.Any figure under a sell-out becomes a disappointment and the conversation beforehand is not about how many they can get but how many no-shows there will be. And Chelsea knew it they announced the crowd as “just under 25,000” and did not put the actual figure on the big screens.If the record-breaking crowd at the Etihad created a buzz, it was trumped in south London. The more intimate and traditional environment of Stamford Bridge compensated for the smaller crowd and then some. Chelsea v Tottenham was a partisan derby but with a refreshingly youthful feel. They had clearly worked hard at it. The pre-match pyros used for the men were readied, the Liquidator was played (City did not break out Blue Moon), clappers were distributed and Marvin Humes took to the decks at half-time. One may scoff at the props but to get an unfamiliar and young crowd buoyed and loud, it was effective.Outside, independent traders were out in force and, if ever there was a sign that there is money to be made from women’s football, loathed half-and-half scarves were touted to the public.The matches at clubs’ main stadiums, particularly Chelsea’s (where fans had to be registered to pick up tickets), give the opportunity to collect hard data on the audiences interested in attending women’s football and their other spending and match-going habits.That the opening weekend of the WSL took place on a non-Premier League weekend shows that work is being done to trial the best ways to drive attendances. The Women’s Football Weekend on 16-17 November will also be clear of men’s top-ision fixtures, taking a lead from Non-League Day. The Manchester derby being played, and broadcast, at 3pm on a Saturday was another experiment at finding a place to fit women’s football into a busy schedule.Attitudes have changed. The narrative has changed. On the whole, fans, managers and players believe that games should be played in larger stadiums. There may be debate about where, when, how, which fixtures, how often, etc, but there is no doubt that, in some form, these games are seen as the next step in the development of women’s football domestically. Instead of worrying about rattling around in big empty stadiums or losing a somewhat mythical home advantage, we are thinking glass half full, that this is a process.In addition, regardless of the methods, what is clear is that Manchester City’s Etihad test, Chelsea’s Stamford Bridge foray and the smaller-scale affair at Ashton Gate, where Bristol City hosted Brighton in front of a respectable 3,041 fans, should be applauded. The clubs have been brave enough to test and experiment their way to club record attendances. The fans at City and Chelsea made up the bulk of the 62,931 who attended WSL matches over the opening weekend.

The former Liverpool and England striker is at the Alderley Hotel in Cheshire to discuss his new book, Even Heskey Scored. The title was chosen because, he laughs, this is “what everyone said”.Yet if his career numbers are low for someone who played most of his career as a No 9 – seven goals from 62 caps, 110 in 516 Premier League games – his 53 assists in the top flight is a clue to his real worth. The figure stands at only two fewer than the vaunted master-creator Paul Scholes. And when Heskey’s seventh place in the all-time appearance chart is factored in, alongside a 21-year, seven-club career that ran from 1995 to 2016 and took in Leicester City, Liverpool, Birmingham City, Wigan Athletic, Aston Villa, Newcastle Jets and Bolton Wanderers, there is further evidence of why he was so successful.The international match cited is the 5-1 victory over Germany in Munich in September 2001, Heskey scoring the fifth, before performing a mock DJ-style celebration.This highlight has top billing in what was, as he says, an impressive career. Heskey was only 18 when he was in the Leicester side that beat Crystal Palace in the 1996 First Division play-off final, drinking a full bottle of champagne afterwards, which, he writes, “finished me”.Sven-Göran Eriksson, the England manager from 2001 to 2006, was the same. “I liked him,” Heskey says. “Very meticulous in preparation. I can’t remember him coaching. But when you go on that pitch you knew everything.”After Alan Shearer retired in 2000 Heskey’s pace and presence made him Owen’s strike partner for three years until Wayne Rooney’s emergence. He expresses surprise at Owen’s recent spat with Shearer - which centred on loyalty and their time together at Newcastle United – given how close they were, “laughing and joking all the time with England”.When Heskey joined Liverpool in March 2000 the club paid a record £11m for him. By then Heskey had claimed two League Cups – in 1997 and 2000 – and been given his England debut by Kevin Keegan in a 1-1 draw with Hungary.Yet homesickness marked his beginnings on Merseyside. “It lasted six months,” says Heskey. “I had to grow up very quickly because I had kids, I had a girlfriend. I literally laid on the floor and started crying. I was like ‘What have I done? I don’t know if I have done the right thing’. But the weirdest thing was I’d go to training and I would be all right.“Then like a drop of a hat I found a barber, I found friends, a routine. Yes, it was a tough time but it was weird, I was silly and, looking back, you think: why didn’t you just go and sit with mates?”Heskey, now 41, played with a glittering array of footballers that included Scholes, David Beckham, Rooney, Ashley Cole, Sol Campbell and Steven Gerrard. While he nominates the latter as the most talented and Campbell his toughest opponent, he rates Cole the “finest” footballer of England’s so-called golden generation.In the book there is an intriguing picture of Cole as an incessant “chain-smoker” who could still keep Cristiano Ronaldo in “his pocket”. Heskey laughs again. “I don’t know what it feels like to smoke but I couldn’t imagine that it helps you a lot,” he says. Heskey is thoughtful on the issue of racism. His paternal grandfather was from Antigua, his maternal side from the nation’s other island, Barbuda. He writes of how his father, Tyrone, and mother, Albertine, arrived in Leicester aged 10 and had to deal with ugly discrimination which included having to read a sign that stated: “No Black, No Irish, No Dogs allowed.”While Heskey himself was “chased from a bar” as a teenager, this season Manchester United’s Paul Pogba and Marcus Rashford, Chelsea’s Tammy Abraham and Kurt Zouma and Reading’s Yakou Méïté have all been abused on Twitter.Heskey, too, still experiences racism. “Recently I was at an airport on the way to France and I sat down there with my drink. A woman was there with her bag on the chair. She picked it up and left. You just take it with a pinch of salt and you move on,” he says. “You can’t let it affect you.”Heskey has seven children – Jamaal, Micah and Liyah with his former partner, Kylee, and Jaden, Reigan, Milanna and Mendes with his wife, Chantelle. All will have been amused to watch the YouTube clip of him meeting Rod and Emu when their father was 11. “It was a great experience,” Heskey says. “I was on television with one of the biggest stars back then. But he kept calling me Emily.”What, then, of the future? Heskey may have no “burning desire” to coach yet he says: “I do want to have a go.” With his relaxed demeanour and deep well of experience Heskey would surely be an asset to the game.Even Heskey Scored is published on 16 September 2019 by Pitch Publishing (£19.99)"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0130acd3a85098b6668482d271d29f86b4b62d79/0_0_4069_2442/master/4069.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a83cd8ea56407f06801a06de0fc560ad","title":"england v kosovo euro 2020 qualifier live","story":"This match has been prorogued for 15 minutes.They don’t survive them. Chilwell clips a pass down the left for Sterling, who knocks it past Rrahmani and zips into space. He makes it all the way to the left-hand edge of the six-yard box, then carefully dinks the cutest of crosses over the outstretched Muric towards Sancho, who can’t miss from six yards.45 min: Kosovo really need to hear the whistle. They’ve got another three minutes to survive, though.Rice breaks up a Kosovan attack inside his own half. The ball breaks to Henderson, who immediately slides a pass down the left to release Sterling into acres. Suddenly England are four on two. Sterling slips the ball right for Sancho, who scores his first goal for England by taking a touch before sliding it past Muric in the fuss-free style. England are lovely to watch in full flow.42 min: Aliti is good to continue, by the way, so no concerns there.41 min: I’m not even sure England were aware of Aliti’s plight. Especially as the defender eventually got up again before the goal was scored. But on the touchline, manager Bernard Challandes isn’t too happy about it, and talks himself into the book.Aliti and Alexander-Arnold come together on the halfway line. Aliti comes off worse, and goes down. England don’t put the ball out - they’re not obliged to - and off goes Sancho down the right. He reaches the byline, amid a cacophony of irate Kosovan whistling, and fires a low cross across the face of goal. Vojvoda, a couple of yards out, is taken by surprise, can’t sort his feet out, and erts the ball into the net. Oh dear.37 min: Vojvova drives with purpose down the right and smacks a low shot towards the bottom right. It billows the side netting with Pickford sliding across in a panic. He probably had it covered.36 min: Some space for Chilwell down the left. His cross, intended for either Kane or Sancho, is wayward.34 min: Sterling jinks and jiggles down the left to win England another corner. This one finds Chilwell at the far post, but the header’s no good. Miles over.33 min: Now it’s Kosovo’s turn to play a little keep-ball. They don’t really go anywhere, but that’s not really the point. A statement of their collective confidence, the sort you’d expect when on a two-year unbeaten run. They look a really tidy side. And on that subject, here’s our old pal Simon McMahon. “A plucky underdog raising their game and performing with heart and skill against a footballing superpower. It’s enough to bring a tear to a glass eye. Makes me proud to be Kosovar.” Satire, there, ladies and gentlemen, coming at you live from Dundee.31 min: Berisha drops a shoulder and drifts in from the right. He sends a speculative effort goalwards. It’s deflected, and heading out for a corner on the right, but Pickford does extremely well to slide over and stop the ball crossing the white line.30 min: Henderson bursts through a little gap down the middle and very nearly finds Sterling just inside the area with a cute chip. It’s read well by Aliti, who intercepts and clears.28 min: England play keep-ball in the middle of the park. So composed, so very continental these days. Properly European, if you will.26 min: Barkley is bundled over 30 yards from goal. He takes the free kick himself, sending a high floater towards Maguire, loitering on the right. But the big defender is beaten to the ball by Hadergjonaj, the lack of pace on the free kick England’s undoing.25 min: The Kosovo fans continue to make a hell of a noise. This match has been wonderfully entertaining, with a soundtrack to match.23 min: Sancho busies himself down the right and lays off for Barkley, who sends a shot-cum-cross harmlessly over the bar. England look dangerous every time they go forward.21 min: You’ll not be surprised to hear that Kosovo aren’t finished yet. They respond to falling behind by causing more bother in the England box, Berisha chesting down a pass to the left of goal and sending an overhead kick past the confused faces of Keane, Chilwell and Pickford. Nobody gets a touch, but English hearts were in mouths there. There was enough confusion, that could easily have been deflected in.This is a wonderful goal. Sterling turns and wriggles out of trouble in the centre circle, an electric eel, then barrels down the middle. He slips a pass to Kane on the left. Kane enters the area, takes a touch to get rid of Vojvoda, and slams a low shot between Muric’s legs and into the net from a tight angle!18 min: Muric miscontrols a simple backpass and for a brief moment it looked like the ball was going to apologetically trundle into the empty net. But despite Sancho applying pressure, the keeper runs back and hacks clear.16 min: Barkley turns Voca with indecent ease on the halfway line, and burns off down the inside-left flank. He tees up Sterling on the edge of the box. Sterling uncharacteristically gets his feet in a tangle, and Hadergjonaj is eventually able to clear. But for a split second there, Sterling’s eyes had lit up.15 min: Sterling romps down the middle of the park and is inches away from releasing Kane on the right with a cute diagonal pass. Up the other end, Vojvoda is granted a little bit too much space out on the right. He can’t find anyone with a looping cross, and Alexander-Arnold clears.13 min: Kosovo aren’t taking this lying down, though. They promised to attack, and having already delivered, here they come again. Voca slips a ball down the right for Muslija, who can’t get his cross past first-man Maguire. Muriqi was lurking in the middle. This isn’t going to end 1-1.12 min: Chilwell takes the corner he’d earned, hanging it high, and it’s easy pickings for Muric in the Kosovo goal.11 min: England have responded marvellously to that early nonsense. They’ve absorbed the shock in the professional, proactive style, and are dominating right now. Maguire Beckenbauers his way down the middle and very nearly slips Kane free down the left channel. Not quite. Then Chilwell comes down the left flank, his low cross hysterically hacked out for a corner by the Kosovo captain Rrahmani.9 min: Can England play at Southampton all the time, please? This is great fun.... Keane does indeed make up for his dreadful error! Barkley hits the corner long. Keane rises high above Rrahmani, heading deliberately back across goal, where Sterling is able to expertly guide a header into the top left from six yards. What a start!7 min: Sancho tears off down the right and earns the first corner of the match. Keane comes up, looking to atone. Barkley takes, and ...6 min: England stroke the ball around the middle for a bit. A chance to clear their heads. Keane gets a couple of touches, which he probably needs after that San Marinoesque opening blow.4 min: Sterling scampers down the left in a let’s-sort-this-out style. He nearly gets past Voca but the Kosovan stands firm, refusing to budge, eventually clearing.2 min: Goodness knows what Keane was thinking about then. He had been played into an awkward spot by Barkley’s pointless backpass, it’s true, but the pass to Maguire was never on. But never mind! Let’s think of the greater good: St Mary’s is bouncing as a result, and we have a game on here!He’s played a piss-poor pass towards Maguire, easily intercepted by Muriqi. Suddenly Kosovo are two on one! Muriqi slips a simple ball down the inside left for Berisha, who opens his body and sidefoots powerfully past Pickford and into the bottom right! Wow!And we’re off! Kosovo get the ball rolling. A fantastic atmosphere in St Mary’s. And what’s Keane done here, 34 seconds in?The teams are out! Kosovo - bedecked in blue and black - stand for their anthem, hands on heart. Then the English one. You know how it goes. We’ll be off in a minute!A party atmosphere ahead of the game. Both sets of fans appear to be getting on like a house on fire. Here are a couple of Kosovo supporters politely jigging around to the racket made by a local brass band. Well, you can’t be rude to your hosts, can you? Some nice late-70s retro kit on show, there, as well. Saints should bring that one back. Or any other of the McMenemy-era shirts, really, they had a run of crackers back then, Rank Xerox, Draper Tools, all that. An imperial phase of clobber.And now a word with the equally amiable Gareth Southgate. “We were pleased with the performance of Marcus Rashford and both of the full-backs, but we have some good players to come in. The wide areas are a heavy load, and we freshen the group. Jadon Sancho is a very exciting player in an area of the pitch where we have a few. We love taking games on the road, we want the rest of the country to see the team, it’s a different type of atmosphere. This will be a proper test for us.”Kosovo boss Bernard Challandes drips with charm as he’s interviewed by ITV. All smiles and passionate rhetoric, his energy is infectious. He’s given a bit of a hospital pass with the first question - is he disappointed to play England as they go on tour around the country? - but deals with it admirably. He admits a pang of disappointment for his players, many of whom will have long dreamed of playing at Wembley, but adds diplomatically: “For me as coach, it’s a game for qualification, and perhaps to play here is better, I don’t know! But we play against England, the pitch is very good, and the stadium is very nice. Why not a surprise? One chance, it’s football! But I am realistic, I see England score five, five and four. We must play and take risks!” You’d need a heart of stone not to wish his side well.England’s young guns have already done their bit against Kosovo. The under-21s won 2-0 in Hull last night, Phil Foden the star turn. Those desirous of more detail can slake their raging thirst for knowledge by clicking below.The inner sanctum. Hats off to Southampton for giving the dressing room at St Mary’s a bespoke makeover. England will play in their famous white shirts this evening. Kosovo will therefore be good for their first-choice blue, though nothing’s certain these days, we’ll get back to you if the folk from their marketing department have forced them into second-choice yellow or third-choice black.Meet tonight’s opponents. Kosovo face England for the first time in their history this evening. They make two changes to the side named against the Czechs, with Florent Muslija and Valon Berisha stepping up. Goalkeeper Arijanet Muric, on loan at Nottingham Forest from Manchester City, midfielder Bersant Celina of Swansea City, and Huddersfield Town defender Florent Hadergjonaj all start.No surprises there. England boss Gareth Southgate makes three changes to the team that swatted Bulgaria aside on Saturday. Jadon Sancho comes in for Marcus Rashford up front, while the full backs are rotated: Trent Alexander-Arnold replaces Kieran Trippier, while Danny Rose makes way for Ben Chilwell. James Maddison and Tyrone Mings sit on the bench, hoping to make their debuts tonight.The way things have been going recently, you’d expect England to do well at St Mary’s tonight. That’s because they’ve won their first three Group A qualifiers to the aggregate tune of 14-1 they’ve won 33 of their last 42 qualification matches, drawing the others in a ten-year unbeaten run and they’re unbeaten in 29 competitive home fixtures staged away from Wembley, a sequence that stretches back to 1936.Then again, opponents Kosovo are on a pretty decent run of their own. They’re unbeaten in 15, a stretch that goes back nearly two years. Having just beaten Bulgaria 3-2 and the Czech Republic 2-1, they’re looking to make it three wins on the bounce in Group A. And they might take a little historical comfort from the result of England’s one previous visit to Southampton in the Euro qualifiers, a 2-2 draw with Macedonia in 2002.Kosovo boss Bernard Challandes isn’t making any bold claims, mind. He’s of the opinion that England are “the best team in the world”, though he is hoping that his “very young team ... show what is a very, very high level”. Gareth Southgate’s similarly youthful side won’t be taking this one lightly, but they will hope to make it four wins from four and consolidate their position at the top of the group. It’s on!"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/69cf5660dfc343fb5f13e754fbbc74040d34e996/0_101_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8c8957378ccce189fe5fcba942bdd2bc","title":"x cross playstation joypad button dualshock controller players","story":"Sony has confirmed ‘X’ button on Dualshock controller should be called ‘Cross’ and players are freaking outIn a week filled with furore and controversy in British politics, do not make the mistake of thinking you can escape to video games for respite. There is outrage brewing here, too, and it concerns the X button on the PlayStation controller.A fortnight ago, Twitter user @drip133 asked a seemingly innocent question above a photo of the joypad: “Do you say ‘x’ or ‘cross’ button?” There were hundreds of contradictory responses, which became increasingly furious as the week wore on. Some insisted that because the other buttons are named after shapes – Triangle, Square and Circle – logically, the “X” button must be called “Cross” others pointed out that as ‘X’ was the common usage, this was the only acceptable pronunciation.Many began to bring maths, design and etymology into the debate. With the likes of:Weighing in against tweets such as:Then, in a shock move, Sony itself became involved. On 5 September, the official Twitter feed of PlayStation UK stated:The scrap is a rare event in the world of video games as console manufacturers usually name buttons after numbers, unambiguous letters of the alphabet or colours. The groundbreaking Nintendo Entertainment System pad, for example, went with A, B, while the SNES added X and Y (a configuration also used by Sega and Microsoft), and in this context, it’s clear that “X” is X.The only other major console controller to utilise symbols was the disastrous Apple Bandai Pippen, which featured raised dots on its four main buttons as well as a sequence of buttons on the front of the pad, which in turn featured three shapes: “square”, “circle” and “diamond”. There was little controversy over what to call any of these buttons, however, because a), Apple avoided the contentious “X” symbol and b), no one bought an Apple Bandai Pippin.Years ago, in an interview with the now defunct video game website 1UP, Sony designer Teiyu Goto explained how the buttons came to be named:We wanted something simple to remember, which is why we went with icons or symbols, and I came up with the triangle-circle-X-square combination immediately afterward. I gave each symbol a meaning and a colour. The triangle refers to viewpoint I had it represent one’s head or direction and made it green. Square refers to a piece of paper I had it represent menus or documents and made it pink. The circle and X represent ‘yes’ or ‘no’ decision-making and I made them red and blue respectively.Sadly, this doesn’t really help because in the quote he has characterised the “X” button with an “X” symbol and who knows whether that was actually him or the journalist who wrote the piece. Also, what is the symbol you put on a piece of paper when voting? Do you call it a cross or an “X”? Surely it’s a matter of opinion?Certainly, in common gamer vernacular the “X” button is very much pronounced as “X” and not ”cross” – it’s quicker to say and the sound of “press X” is smoother and more pleasing than “press cross” with its awkward stuttering repeat of the “s” sound. When you’re trying to shout instructions to a team mate in a fraught online gun battle, you want the instruction to be as brief, seamless and audible as possible and “X” fulfils this role.As lexicographers know, language is a fluid concept and no meaning or intention is ever immune from common variation and usage. If people want to misuse “literally”they will if they think “disinterested” is synonymous with “uninterested, they’re wrong, but if you point it out, it will be you who is judged. In this burning dispute, Sony’s intervention is irrelevant because the players have spoken. X means X.Or as @Arbiterwarpig eloquently put it: “Anyone who says cross is a cop”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d972580ee3335bee23011864e73e5fa930f315a1/0_0_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=23f43bd2fdfd716ce035b8c86e7cc38d","title":"ulla smart hydration reminder can a blinking device make me drink more water","story":"I know I could be better hydrated, but I find water so boring. The question is whether this nagging white light is more powerful than my stubbornnessThis may be an ironic question, but what does “smart” mean these days? We are surrounded by devices described as such, but do they all qualify? This week, I am trying a “smart hydration reminder” called Ulla (£30, ulla.io). It is a Tamagotchi-like bullet that clips to the side of any water bottle and flashes every hour or so, to remind you to drink. Hardly an iPhone, is it? It sounds more on a level with Glacéau Smartwater (Coca-Cola’s bottled water that is distilled, removing minerals from the water, before having minerals added. Amazing times.)In fairness, there is more going on here than meets the eye. A proximity sensor, to be specific. It detects when you leave the bottle and then return to the area around it, at which point a little white light blinks furiously. There is also an accelerometer that knows when you have lifted the bottle for a sip, marking the event by pulsing the light once. I like this feature, which feels like appeasing a beast. The device knows when you last drank before an hour is up, it will blink again, reminding you to take another sip.Do we need smart devices to remind us to attend to basic biological imperatives? In short, yes. Ulla could have been designed with me in mind. I drink a thimbleful of water a day, as a byproduct of eating gummy bears. There may also be water in cheese who knows? No one has been able to confirm whether tea is hydrating or dehydrating, so I am in the dark on that one. The fact is that I find drinking water boring, so I don’t. I confuse thirst with hunger or tiredness, the upshot being that I am a slugabed with bad skin who can’t cry. I know I should drink more, but it is no use telling me. I make bad decisions, because I am dehydrated. I would love to be an athletic type, who wears his Chilly’s bottle slung low when not swigging from it. Can this device turn me into such a hero?In short, no. Ulla is more suited to office types, who keep a bottle on their desk. The motion sensor and timer work best when less portable and more visible. I did try it on the go and occasionally was aware of a flash in my tote bag, but most of the time I missed it. It is far more effective sitting next to a computer, in your field of vision – the blinking capturing your attention without disrupting others. If I leave a room and re-enter, the device bats its lashes, and I take a dutiful sip that I wouldn’t otherwise. The Ulla is hardy, too, surviving an overnight chilling in the fridge and flashing me as soon as I open the door.To my surprise, I appreciate how relatively lo-tech it is. It comes with a rubber band that fits around any water bottle, on to which it clips. There is no app, no tedious tracking of my water intake over time, no leaderboard where I can compare hydration stats with friends. Unlike every smart device I own, it is largely content to leave me alone. I am pathetically grateful for it. Are these … tears? Of happiness? What a journey.My drinking problem, though, is stubborn. Despite Ulla’s demure presence, I grow tired of the nagging. I start to take smaller sips, eventually picking up and setting down the bottle without removing the cap, to fool the sensor. How is everyone drinking water with this frequency? I don’t know if the sensor is sensitive enough to detect such peevishness. I feel bad for tricking it.Eventually, there is no point pretending. I take Ulla off the bottle and leave it on my desk. Unfortunately, the battery life is excellent – approximately six months. Mine sits abandoned for weeks, blinking sadly, until I put it in a drawer, to die alone. Next to my old Tamagotchi, in fact.My refusal to drink water has become so entrenched that I can actually feel my kidneys. I guess Ulla isn’t the least smart thing in the room, after all."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/721380ab7084fb1bfa874ad4bbb1e11c6fffb057/27_0_1173_704/master/1173.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=629e488d3413d44046293aa17afc4208","title":"marie claire uk cease print publication after 31 years","story":"Women’s title will continue online and overseas print editions are unaffectedThe UK edition of Marie Claire is to cease publication after 31 years as the monthly women’s title joins a growing list of magazines that have succumbed to the shift to digital reading.A version of the magazine – which is published by TI Media, the owner of titles including Country Life and Wallpaper – will continue online. The company, formerly known as Time Inc, has entered into consultation with the approximately 35 members of staff affected by the closure.Marcus Rich, the chief executive of TI Media, said: “For more than three decades, Marie Claire UK has led the conversation on the issues that really matter to women, from campaigning for women’s empowerment to climate change, while providing a premium fashion and beauty positioning that reflects their everyday lives.”The company, which operates the UK edition of the magazine through a joint venture with Marie Claire Album, will focus on moving the publication’s website into areas including Marie Claire Edit, a shopping platform that aggregates partners including Farfetch, Net-a-Porter, Selfridges, Topshop and Asos.In June, the fashion retailer Next bought the online premium beauty and wellbeing retailer Fabled, a joint venture between Marie Claire and Ocado.“The success of Marie Claire Edit and Fabled by Marie Claire are good examples of how, at TI Media, we can extend our unrivalled content and expertise into the digital space,” Rich said. “There is enormous potential for us to drive our ongoing transformation through growing our digital business quickly and it will continue to be a key focus for us.”The closure of the UK print edition does not affect Marie Claire in other markets where it continues to be published, such as Australia, Argentina, France and the US.TI Media pulled Marie Claire UK from the most recent Audit Bureau of Circulations figures, covering the period from January to June.TI Media is one of the biggest magazine publishers in the UK, with more than 50 titles, including Horse \u0026amp Hound and Woman’s Weekly.The magazine market has become increasingly tough as readers turn to digital media, where Google and Facebook dominate online advertising.Earlier this year, TI Media closed the print edition of the celebrity gossip title Now, a mainstay of the weekly magazine sector since launching in 1996.In March 2018, TI Media shut NME as a print publication after 66 years to focus on its reinvention as a weekly digital franchise. However, a little over a year later, TI Media sold the title to the Singapore-based music media company BandLab Technologies, along with the rock magazine Uncut.TI Media is looking to streamline its portfolio of titles after being acquired for £130m by the private equity group Epiris in February last year.At the time of the acquisition, Chris Hanna, a partner at Epiris, said the company would bring “clarity and simplicity” to focus on the most profitable titles.In 2017, rival Condé Nast decided to cut the print edition of the fashion title Glamour, one of the biggest sellers in the UK, to twice a year in a shift to a digital-first strategy."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4e1103e93280e33c08134f910288350995e4f973/0_1105_5344_3206/master/5344.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4bd89060af8b8115d0f2da0ff2669506","title":"s club 7 paul cattermole interview","story":"Paul Cattermole found stardom with 90s pop kids S Club 7, but says being in the band brought him only pain and povertyPaul Cattermole is explaining what it’s like to be famous. “I’ve been on stage and seen a bra swirling in the air, coming to land on my head,” he says. “I tended to duck out of the way.” He chuckles at the memory – surreal now, 20 years later, as he sits, untroubled by undergarments. “I’m not saying it happens all the time, because it doesn’t.

S Club 7 were presented to the world by impresario Simon Fuller – looking to repeat his success with the Spice Girls – as a fully formed pop package: four girls, three boys, singing, dancing, acting. (The “S” is rumoured to stand for “Simon”.)The public got to know Jo O’Meara, Bradley McIntosh, Hannah Spearritt, Jon Lee, Tina Barrett, Rachel Stevens and Cattermole playing versions of themselves on their CBBC series, Miami 7, about a British pop group trying to break America. “The Monkees for the next generation” was one comparison.When the show’s bouncy theme song, Bring It All Back, was released at the end of the season, it shot to No 1 in the UK. Between 1998 and 2002, the group scored three more No 1s – as well as hits in Europe, Australasia and the US – and recorded four albums. There were four more TV series and, in 2001, a spin-off group: S Club Juniors.Promotional press introduced the seven members, aged from 16 to 21: their roles, traits, favourite colours and foods. Bradley was cheeky Hannah, hyper. Jon was the joker. Jo: raucous. Rachel: fiery. Tina: chatty. Cattermole? “Enthusiastic.” (And liked guacamole.) They were central to what was being bought and sold – often quite literally, as Hasbro dolls or in lyrics namechecking various brands. You might remember the G-funk jam S Club Party, my personal favourite, in which – as Tina did her dance and Jon looked for romance – Paul was getting down on the floor while Hannah screamed out for more.Though O’Meara and McIntosh shouldered most of the singing, and Stevens seemed to have the most commercial potential, no one member was a standout star – their success was symbiotic, dependent on being a gang anyone could join.I was seven in 1998, and there really was no party like an S Club Party. “The style and energy that was portrayed was coming from us, entirely,” Cattermole says. “There was no management in that. The actual thing that people were buying into came from us. And to see people get hundreds of millions of pounds, and all the credit – no. We created that sort of fun energy on our own, despite the pressure they put on us.”Cattermole had very nearly not joined S Club 7. “I honestly was very unsure,” he says. “I’ve been asked so many times, ‘Were you sitting by the phone, just waiting?’ But when they did phone me up and offer it to me – ‘Hi, we’re so pleased to …’ – I remember putting the phone down and going: ‘I don’t know if I want to do that.’ I turned to my friends and said: ‘If I do this, my life is never going to be the same again.’”As a teenager in St Albans, Hertfordshire, he had dreams of making it with his rock covers band or as a character actor. Performing came naturally, he says. Other members of S Club 7 had been chosen from thousands of applicants at “cattle calls”, what we think of today as X Factor-style Cattermole never even auditioned. Once in the group, he never had to sing. “That got me down.”He was told it would be at odds with “the alchemy”, he says sarcastically, imitating a showbiz suit: “‘We have picked certain people to do certain roles.’ I can only assume that mine was to answer questions in interviews. I was never asked to show, in the audition process, my singing, my ability to dance – my ability for anything, other than talking.”And not much talking, at that. “Top of the Pops magazine, Smash Hits, all this sort of stuff was massive: ‘So Paul, what’s your favourite colour?’” He puts his face in his hands in mock desperation. “Please! Ask me about the theory of relativity!” (Those bios from 1998 did say that his favourite subject at school was physics.)Cattermole paints pop stardom as a boring, thankless existence: a lot of “schmoozing at parties” and being driven around in the back of Chryslers, looking at magazines. “I’m as down for flicking through Heat magazine as the next one: ‘Ooh, yeah, look at those shoes.’ But not day after day, hour after hour.”The perks of plush restaurants and hotels wore off “immediately” – not that there was much of that. “We did everything ourselves, as far as I can remember, from laundry to food preparation.” And mostly to make other people money. Cattermole says that Fuller was signed to Polydor as S Club 7, while he and the other six were just affiliates: “the worst situation to be in.” He remembers being unable to afford a £100 bottle of wine even as he was in “one of the world’s biggest pop groups”, and seizes on my mention of the Hasbro dolls: “We got a pittance for that.”But they had each other. Cattermole says he got on with McIntosh (his closest friend) and Lee and Spearritt (“the nucleus” of the group) in particular. “We were closer than many pop groups – people that used to work with us said: ‘Wow, you guys actually speak, you actually stay in the same room.’ Most of them don’t.”In March 2002, Cattermole announced that he was leaving S Club 7, ostensibly to pursue his old band, now named Skua and doing nu-metal. “It had got to the point where things were being handled so badly, I had to go.”S Club 7 were riding high with their second Brit award for Don’t Stop Movin’, named Best British Single and the seventh-bestselling single of 2001. It was a new, more sophisticated sound for the group, more Billie Jean than bubblegum (in fact Michael Jackson was given a co-writing credit). S Club 7 had never not been successful, but this was the first time they had come close to having street cred. Then they were told the follow-up single would be You, which was saccharine by even their own standards, drawing more from golden oldies than the then-current trend for two-step and garage.The group argued for a song to cement their new contemporary sound, one that would be “just a little bit of a move away from stuff for eight-year-old kids,” as Cattermole puts it – but were shot down. “We had absolutely busted our butts off to get the band where it was. The band never disliked You, but it was just like: ‘Wait a minute, we’re just making this crossover – we have wanted this for years. We have wanted to be perceived as cool since the very beginning, and you’ve given it to us, but then you’ve taken it away.”No one in the group resented him for leaving – but no one asked him to stay. He would have stayed, he says. “I don’t mind admitting, I was upset.” The years that followed were difficult. Skua was stop-start and never signed to a record label. In hindsight, Cattermole says, he wasn’t up to being in the public eye – but taking a break didn’t seem possible. S Club, as the group was known post-Cattermole, hung on for one more year, announcing their split on stage in April 2003.For all the No 1s, the world tours, the multi-million-pound merchandising and endorsement deals – including one with Pepsi – S Club 7 saw very little of their success in monetary terms. Cattermole, O’Meara and McIntosh formed S Club 3 in 2008 a rotating lineup from the group continues to perform, including Spearritt for the first time last month.The extent of Cattermole’s money troubles came to light last year after he was found to be selling his Brit award on eBay for a reported £60,000. In an appearance on Loose Women that some criticised as exploitative, Cattermole said that he owed some £30,000 in taxes and more in legal fees. His share from the 2015 S Club 7 reunion tour went towards clearing his debts.Explosively, Cattermole tells me that his five-year relationship with Spearritt was written into their Hollywood 7 TV show – “and because of that, it sort of happened”. Reports at the time said they had been secretly dating for six months, necessitating their on-screen kiss, but Cattermole says that was not the case – it did not happen organically.He was forced into the relationship? “Yeah, but like I say. It didn’t feel like that because I had totally grown into the idea, quite quickly. I thought she was great.” In 2017, Spearritt lashed out at Cattermole online for speaking publicly about their relationship.For the past year and a half Cattermole has lived in Swanage, in Dorset, where his family are based he has been working odd jobs, most recently as manager of a community radio station. This Thursday he makes a heartwarming appearance on Channel 4’s First Dates Hotel, where he grapples with how to disclose to his date his background as “an entertainer”.“It was five years of my life,” he says. “I definitely thought, when I was 20, that by the time I was 40 it would be a done thing. And it’s not … I’ve been answering S Club questions for 20 years. It will be great – it will be bliss – to one day not have to, but it’s part of it, and I totally accept that.”In July, Stevens teased a reunion on the Lorraine Kelly show to mark the 20th anniversary of their debut album but Cattermole seems to think it unlikely. “The other guys know I’m up for doing it, but I don’t know what’s happening.”A manager had approached him about it but was “rude and offensive” – typical, he says, of his experience of the industry. “It’s such a shame that the whole thing has been crushed and crushed and crushed … I’ve been in meetings and they’ve said, ‘No but Paul, legacy, legacy, legacy, you’ve got to do the gig because it’s the legacy.’“The music’s there, the TV shows are there – that’s the legacy.” He still gets approached by fans wanting a selfie, who say that S Club 7 helped them through a difficult period in their lives or their GCSEs. “That is nine times out of 10 the way it goes.”It is hard to think of any contemporary music, or even culture, that is as wholeheartedly upbeat. As we’re wrapping up, I tell Cattermole that I still associate their music with the optimism of the millennium. He leaps on the word.“It is so important to remember how great so many things about the band were and, like you said, that time in people’s lives. That optimistic time.”Paul Cattermole is on First Dates Hotel on Thursday 12 September on Channel 4.

His then girlfriend, Margaret Moore, was left with bruising to her forehead and black eyes.A French court fined him £5,000 and handed down a three-month suspended jail sentence. He has always denied the charge, maintaining her injuries were sustained in an accidental fall. At his trial, the public prosecutor Jean-Yves Duval rejected this claim, saying the injuries were “absolutely incompatible” with an accident.Claire said: “Celebrating a man who was convicted for assaulting his partner sends a dangerous message that domestic abuse is not taken seriously as a crime.“With increasing awareness of domestic abuse, and a domestic abuse bill ready to be taken forward by government, it is extremely disappointing that a knighthood has been recommended for Geoffrey Boycott, who is a convicted perpetrator of domestic abuse.”May, who introduced a landmark domestic abuse bill to parliament earlier this year, gave Boycott a knighthood for services to sport.A spokeswoman from the Woman’s Trust said: “It’s disappointing to see Geoffrey Boycott included in Theresa May’s honours list, given her vocal support for domestic abuse survivors and the domestic abuse bill.”In an extraordinary exchange, Kearney asked why Boycott had not been given the honour sooner, and suggested one reason could be the conviction. The former cricketer proclaimed his innocence and cited the conviction as a reason for his outspoken support for Brexit.He went on to say, “You can take your political nature and do whatever you want with it”, and claimed the presumption of innocence was reversed in the French legal system. In France, as in Britain, defendants are presumed to be innocent until proven guilty.“Most people in England don’t believe it. I didn’t do it. Move on. It’s a cross I have to bear, right or wrong, good or bad, I have to live with it. And I do, because I’m clear in my mind and I think most people in England are that it’s not true.“I don’t care a toss about her, love. It was 25 years ago. You can take your political nature and do whatever you want with it. You want to talk to me about my knighthood. It’s very nice of you to have me, but I couldn’t give a toss.She also spoke to BBC Radio 4’s Woman’s Hour, where she expressed her disappointment in May, describing Boycott’s honour as a “misstep” that undermined her record for tackling domestic abuse.She said women were in limbo as they waited to hear whether Johnson’s government would continue to move May’s legislation forward.Dawn Butler, the shadow women and equalities secretary, said the honour was “an insult to victims and survivors of domestic violence.” She added: “Honouring a perpetrator of domestic violence just because he is the former prime minister’s favourite sportsman shows how out of touch and nepotistic the honours list is.“Boris Johnson should rescind his knighthood today. The whole honours system needs radically overhauling, alongside peerages, so that our political system works for the many not the few.”David Challen, a domestic violence campaigner added his voice to those calling for the knighthood to be rescinded. Challen, whose mother, Sally Challen was recently freed from prison after killing her husband following decades of abuse, tweeted: Reacting to Boycott’s radio appearance, the Women’s Equality party called for a “Boycott boycott”. The party’s leader, Mandu Reid, said: “The contempt shown by Boycott on the Today programme this morning highlights precisely why he shouldn’t be celebrated by the British establishment or anyone, and why he shouldn’t be given airtime by the media. Putting men like him on a pedestal is indefensible and sends a message that violence is normal and acceptable.”The Yorkshire-born former Spice Girl Melanie Brown, who has accused her ex-husband Stephen Belafonte of domestic abuse, also criticised the decision, saying Boycott was “a disgrace to Yorkshire”. The shadow policing minister, Louise Haigh, who is the MP for Sheffield Heeley, labelled the BBC pundit “an embarrassment to Yorkshire” in a tweet.Boycott was forced to apologise in 2017 for suggesting he would have to black up to be awarded a knighthood. He is alleged to have said the honour was handed out like “confetti” to West Indies cricketers, saying: “Mine’s been turned down twice. I’d better black me face.”An estimated 1.3 million women and 695,000 men experienced domestic abuse in the year ending March 2018, according to Office for National Statistics figures from November 2018."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bf965f9da7146141ebc42d9843ea7fbd8e625734/766_36_2405_1443/master/2405.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=36c862651cbfdcf8a3594da63ce6646f","title":"jeremy corbyn extension workers rights labour tuc congress","story":"He tells TUC Congress a Labour government would ‘put power in workers’ hands’Jeremy Corbyn has promised to introduce the biggest ever extension to workers’ rights and create a ministry and government agency should he get into government.Announcing his envisaged shake-up of Whitehall departments at the TUC Congress in Brighton, the Labour leader pledged to “put power in the hands of workers” not the “born-to-rule establishment” by establishing a ministry for employment rights and a workers’ protection agency if he secures a Labour majority.A new secretary of state for employment rights would ensure “the voice of working people will be heard at the cabinet table, exactly as it should be”, he said.The workers’ protection agency embedded within the new ministry would enforce rights, standards and protections. It would also give powers to inspect workplaces and bring prosecutions and civil proceedings on behalf of workers.Under the plans, all workers over 16 would be entitled to a statutory “real living wage” of £10 per hour by 2020, while a new civil enforcement system would be established to ensure gender pay commitments were upheld.The Labour leader said: “We have witnessed a deliberate, decades-long transfer of power away from working people. The consequences are stark for all workers, whether members of a trade union or not. Pay is lower than it was a decade ago in real terms.”He told delegates too many employers were flouting existing laws and failing to pay the minimum wage. “We will put a stop to that. We will create a workers’ protection agency with real teeth, including the power to enter workplaces and bring prosecutions on workers’ behalf,” he said.Other changes to workers’ rights would include a ban on unpaid internships and zero-hours contracts, he said.Sectoral collective bargaining would be introduced by establishing a councils of worker and employer representatives to negotiate agreements with minimum terms, conditions and standards for the whole of a particular sector.Corbyn also pledged to repeal the Conservatives’ Trade Union act, which had severely restricted the activity of unions and their ability to organise against bad employers, he said.Addressing the political turmoil in Westminster which ended on in the early hours of Tuesday morning with the proroguing of parliament, Corbyn said he wanted to maintain focus on the real issues affecting workers’ lives.“Today parliament stands empty, shut down by a prime minister running away from scrutiny. We mustn’t mistake the drama at Westminster for what real politics is about,” he said.“What truly matters to people isn’t resignations, defections and late night votes in parliament. What truly matters is the reality of their everyday lives – in their community, on the streets, at their workplace.”In a rallying cry to some of his closest allies before an anticipated general election, Corbyn predicted the establishment would come after Labour because they were trying to take on those with vested interests in maintaining the current imbalance in the UK.“We’re going after the tax avoiders. We’re going after the bad bosses. We’re going after the dodgy landlords. We’re going after the big polluters destroying our climate. Because we know whose side we’re on,” he concluded before a one-minute standing ovation.In a speech to the TUC on Tuesday afternoon, fleshing out the plans in more detail, the shadow business minister, Laura Pidcock, is expected to say: “Under Labour, the voice of working people will be heard at the cabinet table, exactly as it should be.“Despite working some of the longest hours in Europe, millions of people in this country – one of the richest in the history of the world – cannot afford to make ends meet and are living in poverty.“It is sickening that the 14.3 million people currently living in poverty includes 9 million living in families where one or more adults is working.”Union leaders welcomed Corbyn’s latest proposals. Dave Prentis, the general secretary at Unison, the UK’s biggest union, said: “It’s become far too easy for unscrupulous bosses to treat their staff unfairly, safe in the knowledge their bad behaviour will never be challenged in the courts.”Mick Whelan, the general secretary of Aslef, the train drivers’ union, said: ‘This is a turning point in industrial relations in Britain. Successive Tory governments have stripped away the rights of working people in a bid to take us back to the 19th century when unscrupulous mill owners could hire and fire at will.”About 5 million workers in the UK are represented by union delegates attending the TUC Congress."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0aa58b974ce002db88638edc6df888f0c9348c36/0_274_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cf86d8046f4a219f6c4bccd68d546a93","title":"pms pay tribute paddy ashdown tony blair david cameron john major service lib dem leader","story":"Tony Blair, David Cameron and Sir John Major attend service for former Lib Dem leaderPast prime ministers, present-day parliamentarians, diplomats and armed services personnel filled Westminster Abbey to pay tribute to former Liberal Democrat leader Paddy Ashdown, described as “ a man for ideals, not shabby deals”.Former premiers Tony Blair, Gordon Brown, David Cameron and Sir John Major joined Lord Ashdown’s widow, Jane, their two children, grandchildren and other relatives, at a service of thanksgiving.Ashdown died on 23 December 2018, aged 77, shortly after announcing he had bladder cancer.In an address that traced Ashdown’s life from “boisterous young Marine” to “elder statesman”, Major described him as a political opponent who had become a friend.He was a “national leader, not a political opportunist”. He was “never a typical politician and rarely predictable”. He was “as energetic in private as public”, Major added.“He was always an internationalist, wedded to reason and consensus and dismissive of tribal politics. A man for ideals, not shabby deals. Not one moment of Paddy’s life and time was ever wasted. Your duty is done. At ease, Paddy, at ease.”Ashdown’s career in the Royal Marines, and serving in the Special Boat Section, was remembered as his Officer’s Sword was carried through the abbey to the high altar. Buglers played Last Post and Reveille.His subsequent career as MP for Yeovil, and as Liberal Democrat leader in 1988-99, during which he turned the party into a powerful third political force, was manifest in the presence of colleagues, including the former Liberal party leader David Steel and the party veteran Shirley Williams.Recent Lib Dem leaders Sir Vince Cable, Tim Farron, and the new leader, Jo Swinson, Conservative stalwarts Kenneth Clarke and Michael Heseltine, and Labour’s Peter Mandelson were among the 2,200-strong congregation. The outgoing Speaker, John Bercow, also attended, fresh from the chaos and protests that had engulfed parliament just hours earlier, and just yards away, as it was prorogued.The former Lib Dem leader Sir Nick Clegg read from a funeral oration, attributed to Pericles: “Our constitution is called a democracy, because power is in the hands, not of a minority, but of the whole people.”Ashdown would have wanted the reading, he told the congregation. But “not even Paddy” could have guessed how a speech so long ago “could have so much relevance today” Clegg said.Ashdown’s time as high representative for Bosnia and Herzegovina and EU special representative after he stood down as an MP had been one of the highlights of “an extraordinary life”, wrote Ian Patrick, his former private secretary, in the order of service.He had “rooted out corruption, created multi-ethnic institutions, established the rule of law, brought war criminals to justice, and created a final resting place for those murdered during the Srebrenica massacres”.The grand mufti of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Husein Kavazović, gave a reading from the Qur’an at the service which was attended by Željko Komšić, a Croat member of the presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina.Jeremy John Durham Ashdown was born in New Delhi and raised in Northern Ireland – hence his nickname Paddy. His family chose The Motet by Howard Arnold Walter, set to the Londonderry Air, in tribute to his Ulster roots.“Few people surely have experienced such a variety of careers and opportunities for effective leadership as Paddy Ashdown, the Rt Hon Lord Ashdown of Norton-sub-Hamdon,” said the dean of Westminster, the very reverend Dr John Hall.“It was a magnificent occasion,” said Cable afterwards, pointing to the presence of so many past prime ministers as a reflection of Ashdown’s standing, not just as a party leader but an important national figure. The “slight sadness”, he added, was that Ashdown had died just before his party’s political recovery.Lord Steel described the service as a very special occasion. “He was a fantastic leader, and a very good friend,” he said.David Laws, who succeeded to Ashdown’s Somerset constituency, said: “We have representatives here not just from Bosnia, but from many parties and from the Commonwealth. Paddy was somebody who succeeded in punching above his weight not just in Somerset but across the world.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a9b5ac300f9fadec2a33f9c1e87be04648976813/0_72_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e377d522f87b730b9a5c0906e6da93ed","title":"tell us if you have applied for welfare and benefit payments online","story":"We would like to hear about any difficulties you have experienced negotiating computer and IT systems while making a welfare or benefit claimPublic authorities are using robots, algorithms and machine learning to assess welfare and benefit claims, but the systems are often hidden inside a ‘black box’, away from public scrutiny.

While researchers have issued a number of declarations that demand a global discussion before answering, who actually decides has been left open.One of the earliest statements of how to respond came in 1996 from the International Academy of Astronautics. It said no response should be sent “until appropriate international consultations have taken place”. The line was echoed by Seti researchers in 2015 who declared that a worldwide scientific, political and humanitarian discussion must occur before any message is sent.“It’s a small poll but it’s reassuring that people feel they can trust scientists to make these big decisions,” Hatfield said.Leaving scientists in charge of Earth’s official response would not be a straightforward matter. Despite the speculative nature of the question, whether and how to engage with little green men, or even a genderless conscious goo, has vexed researchers for decades.The late Stephen Hawking warned that contact with aliens would be disastrous for humans given how less advanced societies have fared on Earth. But others believe human society could make dramatic advances if we learn from an advanced civilisation.It may be too late to keep our heads down. Since the second world war, television broadcasts have poured into space to be picked up by anyone with a big enough dish. In 2008, Nasa beamed the Beatles song Across the Universe to the North star, a trip that will take four centuries.

In Kirkcudbright, Kelso and Newcastle, he had been slightly out of position in each of the mass sprints, but Beast Banks in Kendal was the steepest finish so far and, outside the tiny post office that inspired the creation of Postman Pat, the Dutch prodigy finally delivered to snatch the stage win and the race lead.The 24-year-old’s key quality is his explosive jump as he attacks a sprint or a hill. It is almost worthy of a track racer. Beast Banks came after a long day out with a wealth of climbing in the north Pennines and Howgills as the peloton chased a long-range attack by the 2014 winner Dylan van Baarle, France’s Axel Domont and the Irishman Eddie Dunbar, but it did nothing to blunt Van der Poel.As he surged clear he was clearly never going to be recaptured. “It was a bit far, but at 100m to go, the road got easier.” The overnight leader Matteo Trentin was among the riders on Van der Poel’s heels, but the Dutchman earned a 10-second time bonus that gave him a 1sec lead overall and puts him in with a chance of the biggest stage race win of a golden career.Van der Poel is only 24 but he has an illustrious family heritage, a golden past and is tipped as potentially one of the biggest cycling stars of the next few years. The son of the Dutch Classics specialist Adri van der Poel, and the grandson on the maternal side of the most popular French cyclist ever, Raymond Poulidor, he has devoted himself to cyclocross for much of his career, winning two world titles with another at mountain bike cross country.In the last couple of seasons he has turned increasingly to professional road racing, to equally devastating effect. His victory in the Amstel Gold Classic in April was part of a spring campaign which included two other major one-day wins, and he will be a hot favourite for the world road race championships in Yorkshire later this month.Van der Poel goes into Wednesday’s loop up around the Wirral with a slender one-second advantage over Trentin, who may challenge in the intermediate and finish sprints, all of which carry time bonuses, but with the time gaps across the top 20 counted in just a handful of seconds, many will already have their minds set on Thursdaytomorrow’s time trial in Worcestershire."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/14b555dee1ef007ace32f712cb4fd05dddc70a96/48_176_2030_1218/master/2030.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=39e945944429b3659ea28532bba115e5","title":"geoffrey boycott theresa may knighthood","story":"Geoffrey Boycott has always represented Theresa May’s idealised version of herself, and in that sense it is no surprise that the former prime minister has given him a knighthood in her resignation honours. She can see the hero where others can’t, and if only people could look past the social awkwardness, and the thinly disguised selfishness, and the various nasty businesses, then they would surely realise what heroic qualities truly are.Indeed, perhaps this knighthood foreshadows how someone who has herself exhibited these characteristics in her own career could go on to a highly successful second act in the political commentary box, or on the board of one of the better arms firms. Perhaps in retirement, that someone too will become the effervescent opposite of her playing self. Or perhaps she will grind out the rest of her remorseless innings pointing at potholes for the local constituency paper, as Mrs May was doing this week.Anyway, a recap of the facts: in 1998, Boycott was convicted by a French court of assaulting his then‑girlfriend, a verdict off which he continues to smash soundbites with outrageous abandon. Those who regard no morning as complete if they haven’t lost their shit with Radio 4’s Today programme were certainly given what they wanted on Tuesday, as Boycott was interviewed on the news of his knighthood. “I don’t give a toss about her, love,” was his retort to Martha Kearney’s mention that the chief executive of Woman’s Aid had called his knighthood “extremely disappointing”.So as every reader of the sports pages already knows, this is what you’re dealing with. You always were. Apart from Boycott’s forthcoming acquisition of an honour that ghastly businessmen mostly pay for, nothing – to coin a phrase – has changed. Those who don’t trouble themselves with sport seem to be waking up not just to the news that Boycott has received a knighthood, but that he works for the BBC. Even so, it is not 2005 again.His domestic violence conviction is a longstanding matter of record, and frequently written about by many of us. I see I most recently mentioned it at the end of June. But he didn’t honour himself. Of much more immediate concern, then, must be the person who decided to do so, despite the above. We know all about Geoffrey Boycott. What does this knighthood tell us about Theresa May?We certainly know May continued to adore her childhood cricketing hero, even after his conviction, as did many who found themselves disappointed by, say, the plodding commentary of Ian Botham. But even accounting for this, to knight him is something different.Plenty of people couldn’t believe the domestic violence of Boycs. Was Theresa May one of those? She wouldn’t have been alone. Sports writer Ian Wooldridge described Boycott’s assault charge as “a hiccup in his personal life”, adding that he would “be happy to appear as a character witness on his behalf in a court case still hanging over his head in France”. It is at least difficult to imagine a column like that being written nowadays (even if the current parliamentary sketchwriter of the Times does appear to think his job is to be character witness for the prime minister). Yet if May didn’t accept the conviction, it is remarkable. She was not otherwise famously soft on law and order, nor given to believing the best of people.Or did May believe it but not mind? Again, this would not be of a piece with the May worldview, where redemption and second chances were not in ready supply.Perhaps the most realistic verdict is that she preferred not to think about it, just as she seems to have preferred not to think about the impact of her own egregious acts.Many of us turn a blind eye to certain aspects of our heroes May’s ability to overlook such a monumental one as far as Boycott was concerned suggests a deep personal need to do so. Here was a man regarded as socially inept, never mixing with his teammates during his playing years, or his commentary box colleagues thereafter. Here was a man whose guiding principle was a uniquely selfish form of caution allied to a warped yet clearly intense idea of public service. Here was a man who for many was completely unwatchable, and who for all his glaring character flaws never appeared capable of reflection. Here was a man whose brief England captaincy ended in failure and humiliation.Yet here was a man who, despite enduring the slings and arrows of opponents and teammates alike, will nonetheless be regarded as an all-time great, and who will – especially now – regard himself as having won. Looked at like that, the question is not “how could Theresa May knight Geoffrey Boycott?” – but “how could she not?”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/400d5ad08fb2a0bfee913e1ecc22c5b716d1ad12/0_0_5064_3038/master/5064.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fe813d728047d2d56e5b737474894e6f","title":"facebook instagram tighten rules self harm images","story":"Social network and its subsidiary to crack down on potentially dangerous contentFacebook will no longer allow graphic images of self-harm on its platform as the company tightens its policies following criticism of the moderation of violent and potentially dangerous content on social media.The company also said on Tuesday that self-injury-related content would become harder to search for on Instagram, and such images would not appear as recommended content.Twitter has already pledged content related to self-harm will no longer be reported as abusive in an effort to reduce the stigma around suicide.About 8 million people a year kill themselves, according to the World Health Organization.Facebook has a team of moderators who watch for content such as live broadcasting of violent acts as well as suicides.

A variety of new colours will also be available, with a new matt finish on the back of the iPhone 11 Pro.The iPhone Pro will be available in two sizes, with either a 5.8-inch (147mm) or 6.5-inch (165mm) screen. The improved Super Retina XDR OLED displays have a higher resolution, are brighter and have better colour, but are more efficient on battery.The big new addition for this year’s iPhone is a square lump on the back, which contains a triple camera system for the iPhone 11 Pro. The three 12-megapixel cameras work together in a similar way to the dual-camera system of the previous iPhones, combining an ultra-wide angle, a main and a telephoto camera for zooming from 0.5x to 2x, similar to rivals’ products.Apple said it paired all three cameras for colour and exposure in the factory, pushing the iPhone as a film-making system for both shooting and editing video.The new cameras also offer better low-light performance with a new night mode – a current pain point for consumers – as seen in rival phones. Apple says the phones also produce better all-round, more detailed images using advanced computational photography, and that its new HDR system allows superior lighting.Apple also upgraded the TrueDepth selfie camera to 12 megapixels, enabling wider photos and shooting up to 4K at 60 frames per second. The selfie camera can also now shoot slow-motion video.Tim Cook, Apple’s chief executive, said: “For those that want something that truly pushes the limits, this is the iPhone 11 Pro. The most powerful and advanced iPhones we’ve ever produced in a stunning new design.”The 6.1-inch iPhone 11 – the direct replacement for the iPhone XR – gains a dual-camera version of Apple’s new system, supplanting the single camera from last year and adding a 12-megapixel ultra wide-angle camera to the traditional 12-megapixel camera. The new cheaper iPhone can also capture video from both cameras at up to 4K at 60 frames per second. Apple claimed it shoots the highest quality video in a smartphone, apart from the iPhone 11 Pro.The iPhone 11 has the same 6.1-inch LCD as the iPhone XR, and the same aluminium and glass build, but now with tougher glass.All the new iPhones also have the new, faster A13 Bionic chip, which Apple says is both the fastest CPU and GPU in a smartphone ever.Apple said the battery on the iPhone 11 was capable of lasting one hour longer than the iPhone XR, which was already the longest-lasting iPhone in the firm’s history. It said the iPhone 11 Pro would last four hours longer than the iPhone XS, and the iPhone 11 Pro Max five hours longer than the iPhone XS Max.Both iPhone 11 Pros also ship with a faster 18W charger in the box, something others have been doing for years.Apple has also improved its Face ID facial recognition system, implemented the new wifi 6 standard and faster wireless charging.One big missing feature for the iPhone is support for the latest 5G networks, which recently launched in the UK, US and elsewhere. While the availability of the new significantly faster mobile networks is limited at the moment, the rollout is expected to reach many major towns and cities by the end of 2019.Samsung, OnePlus and other predominantly Chinese smartphone manufacturers all have at least one 5G model on sale, giving them a significant advantage in the new era of mobile connectivity.With a trade war between the US and China likely to affect Apple’s growth in the Chinese market, and potentially increasing the cost of the iPhone elsewhere thanks to tariffs, the next few years may prove difficult. Apple will be banking on the top-end appeal of its most expensive iPhone 11 Pro to continue where the iPhone XS Max left off, while the cheaper iPhone 11 appeals to a wider market by competing more directly on price with the likes of Samsung.The iPhone 11 will cost $699 in the US (£729 in the UK), $50 less than the iPhone XR from last year. The iPhone 11 Pro and 11 Pro Max will cost from $999 (£1,049 in the UK) and $1,099 (£1,149 in the UK), and will ship on 20 September."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/560dcdbd3b1c49a8901b079b5228d5cef7bfa133/0_219_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7c47f4bfda87d340e2122b5261a6c6de","title":"iphone launch live new phones watches and laptops expected","story":"Apple’s autumn press event brings at least three iPhones, two watches and an arcade – follow along live to see if there are any surprises in storeAnd with that, we’re done.

That could help the company gain a foothold in this market, but equally will raise some awkward questions in this new age of technology anti-trust enforcement.Also there is a new (refurbished) Apple Store on Fifth Avenue in New York.This has been your update on the Apple Retail Experience.Now we get the boring stuff: Deirdre O’Brien, who took over from Angela Arendts, is on stage to talk about the Apple Retail Experience.You can now choose your watch strap when you buy an Apple Watch.And you can use your current iPhone as credit towards your new iPhone, she says.The iPhone 11 Pro will start at $999 and $1099 for the Max.Pre-order starts on Friday at 5am Pacific Time, and they’ll be on shelves from September 20th.Also, the old iPhone 8 gets a price cut to $449.Filmmakers can shoot from two lenses at once (with pro camera apps like Filmic, that is), which, some filmmakers assure me, is actually pretty cool.There’s a new font in the camera app!New buzzword alert! The iPhone 11 Pro has “Deep Fusion technology”, which lies behind the Night Mode, “pixel by pixel optimising for detail and low-noise”.Schiller calls it “computational photography mad science”, Google will call it “what we did last year”.Schiller walks through a few sample shots. Most interesting is the speed of the lenses – smartphones have got good at zooming over the years, but not at high-speed photography. That looks like it’ll change.The camera(s)! Three lenses: 12MP wide, 12mp telephoto, and 12mp ultra-wide. So you’ll be able to go from 0.5x zoom to 2x zoom, and get all the same night shift stuff that you also get on the iPhone 11.Apple is branding the iPhone 11 as “2x optical zoom out”, which is cheeky I can’t imagine they’ll have the gall to call this a “4x zoom”, though.The battery! It “lasts 4 hours more than iPhone XS” and, on the big one, “5 hours more” than the old big one. (Wow, that’s actually a huge increase.)Someone is talking about the A13 bionic chip. It has 8.5 billion transistors. If you need the loo, now’s the time.Phil Schiller comes up to talk about the phone. “The first phone we’ve called Pro”, he points out.It comes in “midnight green”, “space grey” “silver” and “gold”, comes in two sizes, 5.8” and 6.5”, and has an “incredible new display” that is brighter and more colourful than ever before. So it’s been rebranded, from Super Retina to Super Retina XDR.“But what if I want to spend more than a thousand pounds on my phone?” Good news! Apple is here for you: Tim Cook introduces the iPhone 11 Pro.Price! The iPhone 11 starts at $699.

Owner Remigio Sognatesori doesn’t bat an eyelid, because bringing your own food is a time-honoured custom in the fraschette (maker-run wine bars) of the Castelli Romani, 17 small towns on volcanic hills south-east of Rome, of which Frascati is the liveliest.Remigio tells us that from at least medieval times winemakers would hang out a laurel branch (frasca) when their new wine was ready. Locals and passing farmers would flock to these cellars to carouse and quaff, taking their own snacks and nibbles to soak up the wine. And if those nibbles were salty and spicy – olives, salami and coppiette, the jerky-like strips of cured shin meat with lots of chilli that we’ve brought – well, that just led to more jugs of wine, merry drinkers and happy owners.“It was genius,” adds Remigio. “People loved them, and they gave makers a local market for their wine.”By the 1800s, he says, there were more than 1,000 fraschette in Frascati alone, and their fame had spread to the big city. Particularly after the railway from Rome opened in 1856, escaping hot, crowded streets for an evening in a rural winery became a cool option for city-dwellers, as it still is. Today, most fraschette also do food, but they’re still all about local wine and specialities.The Castelli Romani towns sit atop hills at least 320 metres high, with splendid panoramas as far as the dome of St Peter’s. After our aperitivo, we stroll round the corner to Cantina Simonetti on sloping Piazza San Rocco. I gaze at the view, and at the sun setting over the cobbled square with its paper-covered tables filled with happy customers – and admire yet again the Italian knack for la dolce vita.I love the way the ancient cellar door at Simonetti is bowed at the sides, to allow huge barrels in and out. Frascati wines have long had a bulk-and-boring image but recent efforts to improve quality have paid off. A carafe of appley-almondy white is a perfect foil for classic amatriciana pasta and a tasty if rather out-there main of coratella (lamb entrails). Offal is as cherished here as in Rome, but I still wimp out of ordering trippe.For a side trip from Rome, the Castelli Romani, half an hour away by rail, are hard to beat. As well as Frascati, trains also run to Albano and Lanuvio. And while it would be tempting to spend all day eating and drinking, the area’s volcanic topography and turbulent history mean there’s plenty to see and do between meals.History can mostly be enjoyed by strolling streets rather than doing museums. Albano, on the Appian Way, has a second-century military gateway, huge Roman water cisterns and a well-preserved amphitheatre whose acoustics we test out with claps and yells. In smaller Lanuvio, a seventh-century BC temple to Juno shares a green hill with a dog park and children’s playground, and the water fountain in its town square, between butcher and chemist, is a richly carved second-century Roman sarcophagus, repurposed by villagers generations ago.Before weary city workers started coming here to drink, these airy hills were a bolthole for Roman nobles including Cicero. In the Renaissance, wealthy families spent fortunes upgrading their summer villas, and several of these are now open to the public, offering an eyeful of 16th-century conspicuous consumption. Rooms in the Chigi Palace, for example, have “wallpaper” of richly decorated leather – which can be seen in banquet scenes from Visconti’s the Leopard, filmed here.I doubt whether that was much consolation in the 17th century for the 10 daughters of Agostino Chigi, banker and finance minister to the pope, who were all made to become nuns. Their portraits, veiled and wimpled, line one room. Only one looks content with her lot.I imagine the poor loves got to enjoy the toothsome speciality for which the town outside their palace walls has been famed since Roman times – porchetta. Most Italian markets have a van selling this boneless stuffed roast pig, but Ariccia (walkable from Albano station) is porchetta central. Fraschette on Via Borgo San Rocco all have fragrant home-cooked porkers outside. At Sora Ines (no 19) a €14 antipasto includes mounds of porchetta with shiny brown crackling, prosciutto, mozzarella, melon, mushrooms, roasted aubergines and more.We do our best with that, then drag our bellies up the hill to an extension of Ariccia’s fraschetta quarter, in rows of former wine cellars flanking the palace. One, Osteria di Corte, has a special claim to fame: young chef Marco Liberti’s cacio e pepe pasta came top this year in TV food show 4 Ristoranti. This is a bit like winning MasterChef, and the dish doesn’t disappoint: creamy sheep’s cheese coating fat spaghetti, with a hit of black pepper.We also check out a fraschetta called Hosteria la Fraschetta in papal retreat Castel Gandolfo, then head for Marino village – whose fountain runs with wine at festival time. Here we taste Marco Fabi’s delicious straw-coloured whites in a wine museum he has set up in a disused cellar. And of course he, too, has a fraschetta: Fòr de Porta in the village centre has all the favourites, plus a tasty vegan selection: truffles, bean purees, fennel, wild and cave-grown mushrooms and more.These wooded hills hide two deep greeny-blue lakes and lots of scenic trails. The larger lake, Albano, has beaches on one side, with kayaks and paddleboards, but I long to try the cyclingwalking paths on its wilder east, or hike to Monte Cavo at almost 1,000 metres.Because it’s hard to make the most of these Roman hills unless you’ve worked up a very large appetite.• Accommodation was provided by Hotel Colonna in central Frascati, which has doubles from €75 B\u0026ampB. Train travel to Frascati was provided by Trenitalia.

The  recently described him as “a sometimes abrasive political figure at home” but “also a deft political strategist” who had recently come under attack from farmers in Ireland over a proposed beef deal with countries in the South American Mercosur bloc.He has been highly critical of the British approach to Brexit and recently he launched a scathing attack on Johnson, describing him as an unelected prime minister who was “gambling” with Ireland’s peace process.He also warned that a hard Brexit would create a “foul atmosphere” with the EU and would have “serious consequences” for the UK’s chances of a favourable trade deal with the bloc.However, others in Ireland see his appointment to the trade portfolio as a positive step for Johnson because the taoiseach and his deputy have repeatedly promised over the past three years that they would be the UK’s strongest ally in trade talks, because no country wants a better outcome than its westerly neighbour.On Monday, Varadkar warned Johnson that trade talks with the EU would be a “herculean” challenge but said Ireland would act as his friend in Brussels. “We want to be your friend and ally, your Athena,” he said in reference to the Greek goddess who prevented Hercules from murdering his foster parent.Von der Leyen’s commission will be the first not to include a British member since 1973. The remaining 27 EU member states have nominated a politician to send to Brussels. Only the UK did not propose a candidate, in line with Johnson’s determination to leave on 31 October “do or die”.But Von der Leyen said the UK would have to appoint a commissioner if it was still in the EU after 1 November.European commissioners swear an oath not to take instructions from any government and act in the general interest of the bloc.

And I am so ashamed and sorry for the impact of this crime committed here.”Hindus, Christians, Muslims and Sikhs were killed in April 1919 when they gathered in Amritsar, in Punjab, then part of British India. They were protesting peacefully after earlier riots over the arrest of pro-independence leaders.Under the orders of Brig Gen Reginald Dyer, an Anglican, British troops opened fire. According to official figures, 379 people were killed and about 1,200 wounded, though other estimates suggested much higher casualties.Winston Churchill condemned the massacre in the House of Commons, saying it was “an extraordinary event, a monstrous event, an event which stands in singular and sinister isolation”.In 2013, David Cameron became the first serving prime minister to visit the site of the killings, bowing his head in honour of the victims. The episode was “deeply shameful” and should never be forgotten, he said, but he stopped short of apologising.This year Theresa May called the killings a “shameful scar” in British-Indian history but also stopped short of formally apologising.Writing on Facebook during a trip to Sri Lanka and India, Welby said visiting the memorial had aroused “a sense of profound shame at what happened in this place. It is one of a number of deep stains on British history.”He added: “Learning of what happened, I recognise the sins of my British colonial history, the ideology that too often subjugated and dehumanised other races and cultures … We have a great responsibility to not just lament this horrific massacre but most importantly to learn from it in a way that changes our actions.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eed5a3479b4e695163a6df408716521197bd53fb/8_57_3864_2318/master/3864.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=487b3d3b518114a52aecdd2f680b2af8","title":"no 10 request user data government website sparks alarm","story":"Privacy campaigners question urgency of move and motives of PM and Dominic CummingsData privacy campaign groups and Labour have expressed alarm after it emerged Downing Street has ordered departments to centralise the collection and analysis of user information from the government’s main public information website ahead of Brexit.While officials insist the move to share user data from the Gov.uk website is simply intended to improve the service and that no personal details are collected, campaigners raised concern about the urgency of the task, and the personal involvement of Boris Johnson and his chief adviser, Dominic Cummings.A leaked memo last month from Johnson to ministers on the cabinet committee tasked with no-deal preparations, known as exit operations, or XO, specifically linked the gathering of the user data to government decision-making over Brexit.The memo, seen by BuzzFeed, said the XO committee had been tasked with making sure Gov.uk “is serving as a platform to allow targeted and personalised information to be gathered, analysed and fed back actively to support key decision-making – in effect, focused on generating the highest-quality analytics and performance data to support exit preparations”.Johnson ended the memo, sent on 19 August, by writing: “I expect everyone to act immediately to execute the above actions.”Nine days later Cummings, who has been the focus of concerns about the use of voter data by the official Vote Leave campaign in the 2016 Brexit referendum, emailed officials to stress this was a “top priority”, BuzzFeed said.Dominic Cummings, the son of an oil rig project manager and a special needs teacher, was born in Durham in 1971. He attended a state primary school followed by the fee-paying Durham school and, in 1994, Oxford University, where he studied ancient and modern history.\u0026nbspAfter three years living in Russia, where he attempted to set up an airline connecting Samara in the south with Vienna, the then 28-year-old became campaign director of Business for Sterling, which worked to prevent Britain from joining the euro.Although he has never, as far as anyone knows, been a member of a political party, Cummings was headhunted to be director of strategy for the then Conservative leader, Iain Duncan Smith, in 2002.While he was seen as a “young, thrusting moderniser”, Cummings quickly\u0026nbspoffended party traditionalists. He quit the job after only eight months, describing Duncan Smith as incompetent.Following the 2010 general election, the then education secretary, Michael Gove, appointed Cummings as his chief of staff. Many in Whitehall found Cummings as difficult as he found them. In 2013, civil servants in the Department for Education\u0026nbspcomplained to the Independent\u0026nbspof an “us-and-them, aggressive, intimidating culture” created by Cummings and Gove.He never hid his disdain for the workings of Whitehall and has derided Westminster figures in eye-catching\u0026nbspmedia interviews\u0026nbspand published\u0026nbsprambling blogposts\u0026nbspthat are obsessed over by Westminster insiders. He described prime minister David Cameron as “a sphinx without a riddle”, and former Brexit minister David Davis as “thick as mince, lazy as a toad, and vain as Narcissus”.In 2015, Cummings and the political strategist Matthew Elliott founded Vote Leave, which was designated by the Electoral Commission as the official EU referendum\u0026nbspleave campaign\u0026nbspin April of the following year.In July 2018, the Electoral Commission announced Vote Leave had been found guilty of breaking electoral law by overspending, following testimony from whistleblowers. The group was\u0026nbspfined £61,000\u0026nbspand referred to the police. Cummings has used his blog to furiously defend himself and the Vote Leave campaign. In March 2019, he was found in contempt of parliament for refusing to appear at a committee of MPs investigating fake news.Tom Watson, Labour’s deputy leader, said: “This centralised harvesting of citizen’s data is very suspicious. Why would Dominic Cummings say this was a top priority for the government, given the national crisis we are in? We need immediate assurances about what this data is going to be used for.”Silkie Carlo, the director of privacy campaign group Big Brother Watch, said: “This data grab raises important questions as to the legitimacy, urgency and purpose of such personal information collection. The government must answer these questions urgently.”The claim that no personal data would be collected “is at odds with its instruction that government websites should urgently gather ‘targeted and personalised information’,” Carlo said.“This secret instruction and contradictory public statement is cause for concern and undermines public trust at an important time. People need to be able to access government information without worrying about how their data might be tracked, recorded and used.”Pascal Crowe from Open Rights Group, which campaigns on digital privacy and freedoms, said: “This decision completely disregards the data rights of ordinary citizens. There is no suggestion of public consultation, seeking consent or promoting safeguards.“The public conversation around the use of data has shifted since the Cambridge Analytica scandal. Where is the public’s consent for this? Dominic Cummings may claim to be a pioneering advocate of data science, but when it comes to its ethical use, he is woefully behind.”Officials have said the only difference will be that anonymised user data currently collected by inidual departments will now be collated across the Gov.uk website, allowing better information on how the site is used as a whole.A government spokesman said: “Across the industry, it is normal for organisations to look at how their websites are used to make sure they provide the best possible service.“Inidual government departments currently collect anonymised user data when people use Gov.uk. The government digital service is working on a project to bring this anonymous data together to make sure people can access all the services they need as easily as possible.“No personal data is collected at any point during the process, and all activity is fully compliant with our legal and ethical obligations.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c72a8245859578beedb6563517f454463b13c0b4/0_89_720_432/master/720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d2b7719594704a533f533110366e8dab","title":"northern ireland citizens must register to identify as irish tribunal told","story":"Case raises questions over enforceability of 1998 Good Friday agreementThe right of Northern Irish people to identify as British, Irish or both does not automatically change their citizenship unless they formally register any change, an immigration tribunal has been told.Fundamental questions over the enforceability of the 1998 Good Friday agreement have been raised in a test case over the residency rights of an American who is married to a Derry woman.Emma DeSouza found herself at the centre of a legal battle after her application in 2015 for a residence card for her US-born husband, Jake DeSouza, was rejected.Any EU citizen living in the UK in accordance with EU regulations can bring their family with them. But the Home Office initially turned down the application on the grounds that Emma DeSouza was British, even though she had never carried a British passport.It said that as she was born in Northern Ireland, under the British Nationality Act 1981 she was automatically deemed British and would have to apply through the normal routes for third-country citizens. She could not therefore exercise separate EEA treaty rights.The Home Office told Mr DeSouza the only way it could deal with his case was for his wife to “renounce her status as a British citizen”.DeSouza challenged that decision on the grounds that his wife had the right to be treated as an Irish citizen under the Good Friday agreement and was therefore an EU citizen exercising her freedom of movement rights.The first-tier immigration and asylum tribunal ruled in his favour, saying that under the terms of the Good Friday agreement people of Northern Ireland were in a unique position within the United Kingdom and could identify themselves as Irish or British, or both.Appealing against that decision, however, Tom McGleenan QC for the Home Office argued that not all the contents of the agreement had been incorporated into UK law and it did not supersede the 1981 British Nationality Act.The initial tribunal had made a “fundamental and egregious error”, McGleenan said. Mrs DeSouza had held British citizenship since birth “so she is not exercising treaty rights” and therefore did not fit into the category of being an EEA national.“The mere act of identification does not change citizenship acquired at birth,” said McGleenan. “There’s no administrative formalities for the recording of that change.But Ronan Lavery QC, for DeSouza, said the Good Friday agreement did not compel people to reject their citizenship. “In a country without a written constitution, the Good Friday agreement sets out provisions for people in Northern Ireland.”Renouncing British citizenship costs £200 and would require Mrs DeSouza to tick a box accepting that she was British in the first place, Lavery said – which she does not accept.Imagine, he suggested, that the Germans had won the second world war and imposed German citizenship on all British people. He asked: “Wouldn’t Britons find it offensive to have to go through a process of renouncing German citizenship?”Both McGleenan and Lavery appeared via remote video-link from Belfast. The judges hearing the case, Mr Justice Lane and Jeremy Rintoul, were in a London courtroom."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cb8c1f248321a721276a7f8d5d3878758b6ddf66/0_169_5064_3038/master/5064.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=338b0f8a6b49dc29a9c9dbfc294dbb96","title":"uk accuses iran of selling oil from seized tanker to syria","story":"Foreign Office says Tehran breaching assurances with sale to ‘Assad’s murderous regime’Britain has accused Iran of breaching assurances that it would not sell oil to Syria from an Iranian tanker released by authorities in Gibraltar on the condition that the 2.1m barrels it was carrying would not be sold to the “murderous regime” of Bashar al-Assad.Tehran acknowledged at the weekend that the oil had been sold and the reflagged tanker Adrian Darya 1, previously known as Grace 1, had reached its final destination, after the ship was photographed off the coast of Syria.Iran, desperate for revenue from oil exports, did not formally confirm the customer was Syria.The UK foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, summoned Hamid Baeidinejad, the Iranian ambassador to the UK, to a meeting on Wednesday to ask why the assurances given to the Gibraltarian authorities had not been honoured.In July 2015, Iran and a six-nation negotiating group reached a landmark agreement known as the\u0026nbspJoint Comprehensive Plan of Action\u0026nbspthat\u0026nbspended a 12-year deadlock\u0026nbspover Tehran’s nuclear programme. The deal, struck in Vienna after nearly two years of intensive talks, limited the Iranian programme, to reassure the rest of the world that it cannot develop nuclear weapons, in return for sanctions relief.The six major powers involved in the nuclear talks with\u0026nbspIran\u0026nbspwere in a group known as the P5+1: the UN security council’s five permanent members – China, France, Russia, the UK and the US – and Germany. The nuclear deal is also enshrined in a UN security council resolution that incorporated it into international law. The 15 members of the council at the time unanimously endorsed the agreement.On 8 May 2018, US president Donald Trump pulled his country out of the deal. Iran announced its partial withdrawal from the nuclear deal a year later.British officials are relatively certain from intelligence assessments that the oil was offloaded on to smaller boats.British marines seized Grace 1 in July after it entered Gibraltarian waters, claiming the oil was destined for Assad and Syria in breach of EU economic sanctions.The Foreign Office says Iranian officials gave as many as five different assurances to British officials – including one in writing to Gibraltar’s government – that the ship’s cargo would not go to Syria.“Iran repeatedly gave assurances to the government of Gibraltar that the Grace 1Adrian Darya 1 would not deliver oil to any EU-sanctioned entity in Syria or elsewhere. It is now clear that Iran has breached these assurances and that the oil has been transferred to Syria and Assad’s murderous regime,” the Foreign Office said in a statement.“Iran’s actions represent an unacceptable violation of international norms and the UK will raise the issue at the United Nations later this month.”Raab said: “Iran has shown complete disregard for its own assurances over Adrian Darya 1. This sale of oil to Assad’s brutal regime is part of a pattern of behaviour by the government of Iran designed to disrupt regional security.“This includes illegally supplying weapons to Houthi insurgents in Yemen, support for Hezbollah terrorists and most recently its attempts to hijack commercial ships passing through the Gulf.“We want Iran to come in from the cold, but the only way to do that is to keep its word and comply with the rules-based international system.”The UK insisted the tanker was seized only in pursuit of EU sanctions policy, and not in support of the US effort to cut off Iranian oil exports, a strategy with which the UK does not agree.Britain is pursuing a policy of maximum economic pressure on Iran in an attempt to force Tehran to renegotiate the joint comprehensive plan of action, a deal on Iran’s nuclear programme signed in 2015.Iran has argued it was not a party to the EU sanctions against Damascus, but also said the oil was not destined for Syria. Subsequently, following negotiations both in the Foreign Office in London and in Gibraltar, the British claimed assurances had been given that the oil would not be sold to Syria.The US attempted to block the departure of the ship from Gibraltar, and US officials then tried to contact the captain of the ship to offer him a substantial sum in return for not selling the oil to Syria but instead taking the ship to a port at which the US could seize the cargo.The Gibraltar first minister, Fabian Picardo, said in a statement: “It will be a massive volte face for Iran to have failed to live up to its written undertaking in the full glare of international public opinion.“They will really make themselves look shifty and unreliable if they have acted contrary to their repeated assertions and undertakings.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6dfae2e35157d61246911d4f840a12db7532686d/1_23_899_539/master/899.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2dd6b1499bd7a46a0e88c91df7bf9db2","title":"why do dubai princesses keep trying run away podcast","story":"Ola Salem discusses the orce case of Princess Haya, who fled to London.

Photograph: Nick BradshawBanks should take account of the high levels of rent paid by people who are also saving for a house deposit when granting mortgage approval, according to Fianna Fáil.Darragh O’Brien, the party’s housing spokesman, gave a presentation to TDs and Senators on the second day of the Fianna Fáil parliamentary party think-in in Gorey, Co Wexford.He listed a number of proposals under the headings of increasing the affordability of homes, boosting housing supply generally and supporting home ownership.The proposals include an “affordable rent scheme on State land” as well as “recognising rent payments in mortgage approvals”.It is understood that the party has written to the Central Bank requesting that it take a firmer line in instructing lenders to take account of monthly rental payments when deciding to grant mortgage approval.Earlier this year Taoiseach Leo Varadkar raised the prospect of the Central Bank changing its rules on mortgage lending to cover people paying high rents while also saving for a mortgage deposit.The rules curtail mortgages to 3½ times a buyer’s salary and to a minimum deposit of 10 per cent from first-time purchasers and 20 per cent from other buyers.Banks are allowed discretion on a certain volume of lending, allowing borrowers higher loan-to-income and loan-to-value figures, but these loans are quickly snapped up.“I do think one aspect of the mortgage rules that is very tough is the fact that you are expected to show that you are saving at the same time that you are renting,” the Taoiseach said last July.Mr O’Brien’s presentation to his colleagues means the two largest parties in the Dáil are now pressurising the Central Bank to take some sort of action for those who are saving while renting.Martin boastSeparately, Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin has claimed his past achievements as minister for health are far more significant than anything Simon Harris or Mr Varadkar achieved in the Department of Health.He made the claim in response to Mr Harris’s criticism of Mr Martin’s record in a number of government departments. In governments led by Bertie Ahern and Brian Cowen, Mr Martin served as senior minister in the departments of education, health, enterprise and foreign affairs.Speaking at a public health event in Dublin on Tuesday, Mr Harris had accused Mr Martin of failing to stop “illegal charges in nursing homes” during his tenure in the Department of Health.“He brought in cruel cuts. He invented and created the bureaucratic organisation that is the HSE,” Mr Harris said.“I’m now having to dismantle the failed structures he created. I’m not conned and the Irish people are not conned.Government recordMr Martin and Fianna Fáil have criticised the Government’s record on spending in health, and have said they will seek transparency in this year’s budget negotiations.Under the confidence-and-supply agreement, Fianna Fáil support is needed to pass the budget, which takes place on October 8th this year.“I think he has been a very poor Minister on a number of fronts,” Mr Martin said of Mr Harris, adding that Fianna Fáil governments had made improvements in cancer and cardiovascular care and other areas.“And then in public health measures like the smoking ban and so on. Those were effective interventions in health and I can’t point to similar interventions from Simon Harris or indeed from Leo Varadkar when he was minister for health.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4012855.1568047643!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"the ira was formed in my grandad s sitting room","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe house formerly owned by Victor Fagg in Athlone where the Provisional IRA was founded December 23rd 1969, according the BBC documentary Spotlight On The Troubles. Photograph: BBC NIStep inside my parent’s home on the outskirts of Athlone, Co Westmeath and you’ll probably be presented with a cup of tea and some kitchen-baked scones but this former guesthouse offers up more than just bed-and-breakfast.Built as a farmhouse by my grandfather Victor Fagg in 1949, it plays centre stage in an historical event that has been hidden from my family for nearly 50 years.The first episode of a new BBC TV series on the Troubles, to be broadcast on Tuesday, reveals that the Provisional IRA was formed on December 23rd 1969 in the same sitting room where I grew up watching TV. To say it was news to us is an understatement.Des Long, a senior figure in Republican Sinn Féin, told the programme he attended the meeting a few days before Christmas 1969 at my grandfather’s home where a “Provisional army council” of the IRA was formed. It was claimed about two dozen republicans gathered for the meeting, checking in at 8pm and checking out at 8am, as though they were a group of holiday-makers on a seasonal getaway to the midlands.Long described Victor Fagg as “a Protestant IRA man” but the truth was a bit more complicated. Born in July 1906 at Blacksod Bay Coast Guard Station, near Belmullet, Co Mayo, his republican interest dates back to an event in 1921 when - during the War of Independence - Major-General Thomas Stanton Lambert was assassinated by IRA members in Athlone.Victor saw the staff car speeding off with the general’s body after the ambush but refused to answer questions when British troops threatened to shoot and kill him about what he had seen.My grandfather was the son of a sailor who served on board ships like the HMS Gannet and, as such, he would have been no stranger to the British military but I imagine the soldiers serving in Ireland in 1921 were not the most disciplined bunch.The British forces retaliated to the ambush by burning down a number of farmhouses. The Black and Tans were known for their cruelty, and the incident made a lasting impression on the 14-year-old Victor but it would not be the last violent act he would see.According to the Republican newspaper Saoirse, Victor Fagg joined the Irish Republican Army a few years later and “was as a member of the Guard of Honour when the bodies of 20 republican soldiers executed by the Free State Army throughout its western command were handed over to relatives and comrades at the main gate of Athlone Barracks in October 1924”.In 1938, he was one of 12 men nominated for the IRA executive council at its general convention, two of whom Seán McNeela and Tony D’Arcy died on hunger strike in 1940. All 12 men would later be interned in the Curragh during the Emergency where I understand Victor witnessed the killing of another friend, Barney Casey, who was shot by Free State guards.My grandfather was one of very few Protestants interned in the Curragh in 1940 and in 1943 he converted to Catholicism when he married Una Daly who was herself a captain in Cumann na mBan.Victor Fagg was well respected in the midlands where he operated the agricultural store and was secretary of the co-operative committee. My grandparents loved horses and were involved with the Glasson Farmers Hunt and Victor was part of the Athlone Show committee for many years.A local historian’s notes on the setting up of the creamery in 1961 highlight its importance to the Athlone farming community and Victor was apparently gifted in bringing different people together and organised the forming of the creamery committee of which he became secretary. It was the same networking skills that perhaps made him a natural host for the secretive meeting in December 1969.Victor Fagg died in on March 6th 1988, aged 81. He received a republican funeral, with a tricolour draped across his coffin in the Catholic side of Cornamagh Cemetery. Ruairi Ó Brádaigh, president of Republican Sinn Féin, which was formed in 1986 following a split in Provisional Sinn Féin, gave an impassioned eulogy describing him as a quiet and unassuming Irishman whose “family background was one of service in the British forces but he was brought face to face with the realities of British rule in Ireland at the early age of 14 years”.Not far from his grave, in the Protestant side of the cemetery, his parents and my great grandparents are buried. Two years later, my grandmother died and was buried by his side and my parents inherited their farmhouse which they later transformed into a guesthouse.Northern Ireland’s religious war has always confused me. I knew my grandfather was originally from a Protestant household and his conversion to republicanism was never fully explained. He died without writing memoirs and when my mother asked why, he told her that “there was wrong on both sides”.The first episode of Spotlight On The Troubles: A Secret History will broadcast on Tuesday, September 10th, at 8.30pm on BBC1 Northern Ireland and BBC4 Morgan Fagg is an English teacher and writer, based in Madrid, Spain"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4013847.1568126898!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"in his own words phil hogan on brexit and the three stooges","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t‘Don’t listen to the Three Stooges’ on the Irish Border, said Phil Hogan in reference to  Boris Johnson, Nigel Farage, and Jaccob Rees-Mogg.

Because you never know with Boris, do you?It’s why Leo Varadkar needed to be clear and unambiguous when laying out Ireland’s stance on the Border backstop (among other issues) when he had a captive audience in the new UK PM on the steps of Government Buildings.“What we cannot do and will not do - and I know you understand this - is the replacement of a legal guarantee with a promise” he told his British counterpart, no offence and all that.But while Johnson was physically present at the adjoining microphone, it’s debatable whether the Taoiseach had his unided attention. Throughout Varadkar’s polite but pointedly realistic assessment of the Brexit state of play, his guest fidgeted and grimaced and smirked, eyes scanning the rows of journalists as if trying to find a friendly face in the crowd. In contrast, the Taoiseach turned his face towards his fellow leader and listened intently while he spoke.In tone, style and look, the two men couldn’t have been more different. That shouldn’t really matter - Bertie Ahern was celebrated for his beloved anorak and stage-Dubliner approach but he won three general elections on the trot and won respect on the international stage. Before he became Taoiseach and acquired an assistant to smarten him up, it wasn’t unusual to see Bertie’s shirt hanging out. He didn’t have to work at it.Leo is a different kettle of Canali. He looked very smart in his close cut suit as he prepared to greet his honoured guest. When Boris got out of the car and bounded up the steps, baggy of trouser and untethered of shirt, a male voice arose from the ranks of the Irish media.“Jaaaysus, would ya look at the state of him.”That was rather unfair. It takes effort to maintain such a low standard.Well behavedIt was very cordial between the two as they warmly shook hands and faced the cameras. Boris, a la Trump, remarked to Leo that the journalists were very well behaved.On to the statements, Crumplestiltskin mussing up his hair and swinging his arms and making faces while the Taoiseach administered a dose of reality from outside the Westminster bubble.This meeting was a long time coming. Johnson became prime minister back in July but somehow he never managed to visit his nearest neighbour at a very difficult time in their shared history.But never mind. He was here now and scattering optimism and enthusiasm about like fairy dust.Brexit will work out well for all concerned. Boris will overcome the backstop and will lead the UK out of Europe on October 31st despite what the law might say. “I’m absolutely undaunted by whatever takes place in parliament” he declared.Sure what means parliament to a man who left Dublin to return to Westminster so he could suspend crucial proceedings for a month - to BoRogue the institution, as the technical term goes.“We gotta get on and do this….and that is what will get done” said Boris, blathering on while saying nothing about what his government intends to do to solve the backstop conundrum blighting Blighty’s Brexit. “I genuinely think it can be done. I think there is a way forward and I’m delighted it’s been approached in a positive way by governments around the EU, but particularly, obviously, here in Dublin.”Less of the “can do” rhetoric and more candour was what the aforementioned Ireland and the EU wanted. It wasn’t forthcoming.Varadkar said patiently he is ready to hear “constructive ways to achieve our agreed goals and resolve the current impasse.”“Abundant proposals” parped the prime minister.Rolled his eyesBoris said he couldn’t reveal them as he can’t give the game away because, er, he doesn’t have a single viable proposal. At least not one that isn’t bound up in the political future of Johnson and the posterity planning of his handler, Dominic Cummings.He wasn’t best pleased with the impertinence of journalist Kevin Doyle who questioned the bona fides of his concern for the Irish Border, wondering when was the last time he visited the area. Does he still think traversing it is “like crossing from Camden to Islington?”.This, after the Indo man opened with a haymaker. “Prime minister, when you talk about people being found ‘dead in ditches’, there’s a sense in this country that you really don’t understand what’s at stake here.”Johnson petulantly rolled his eyes like a schoolboy getting an ear-bashing from the headmaster.We half expected him to say he had been misheard and what he actually said was “I’d rather dine in Shoreditch than ask the EU for a Brexit extension”. But his heart didn’t seem to be in it.Earlier though, when enthusiastically empathising with Border residents, he drew on personal experience “as someone who went to the Border several times before the Belfast Agreement and shuddered to see watchtowers on UK soil.” That was over 20 years ago.Last year, he said managing that fragile frontier would be no more difficult than administering the congestion charge between London boroughs. He wasn’t shuddering then.On Monday, Johnson answered nothing and had nothing new to say.But he really wants to get on with it.“Our governments have spent three years masticating this problem. I think it is time to honour the achievements of our predecessors who tackled far worse problems by cracking this one ourselves.”After masticating for three whole years, it’s a wonder Boris Johnson could see his breakfast, let alone chew it.Carry On RegardlessPerhaps mastication was on his mind because Leo Varadkar mentioned his hero, Winston Churchill. The Taoiseach also mentioned that he is also an admirer of the “great” man. (You can’t say he wasn’t trying to charm his guest.) Churchhill famously talked of jaw jaw and not war war. That must have brought mastication to mind.After the brief Q and A session, the two leaders repaired upstairs for breakfast. But first there was a photocall when Johnson signed the guest book. He looked at the previous pages. “Michel Barnier” he noted. “A-ha!” he cried triumphantly, as if rumbling some dastardly plot.And he did. Leo has been collaborating with the EU.The visit was done and dusted within a couple of hours. The Magic Roundabout spun again and Boris Johnson returned to London to resume his lead role in Carry On Regardless.He must have been relieved to move on. When he stepped off the roundabout in Dublin he looked dizzy, like a dishevelled Dougal, aimlessly waffling around in circles without the calming magic of Cummings, his Zebedee.The prime minister didn’t look or sound good alongside the measured Varadkar, who answered questions clearly and didn’t rely on waffle. The Taoiseach even treated him to a touch of the Classics, putting him on notice that negotiation post-Brexit is “going to be a herculean task for you” adding “We want to be your friend and ally - your Athena - in doing so”.It didn’t take long for the Google scholars to find out that Athena intervened after Hercules went mad and killed his wife and children, saving him from committing further atrocities in his madness.Leo’s speech writer lectures in history in Trinity College. Irish and American history. The Taoiseach added the reference to Greek mythology in the final draft. Purely “to be constructive” stressed a colleague.Our eyes have seen the glory of the Cummings’ stooge abroad.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Photograph: Kenzo tribouillard  AFPGetty Images\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t                                                            Phil Hogan has been nominated as the European Union’s new chief trade negotiator. File photograph: Ray RyanThe nomination of Ireland’s agriculture commissioner Phil Hogan to the trade portfolio, the commission’s president-elect said, would lay the basis for talks on a strong long-term relationship with the UK.Mr Hogan had handled agriculture “brilliantly” Ursula von der Leyen told journalists in Brussels as she announced the responsibilities of her new team.He would be tough and “very fair” in the important task of crafting a very good free trade agreement with the UK. “If a hard Brexit should happen it is not the end, but the beginning of a future relationship,” she said.Mr Hogan said he was pleased to have been nominated to one of the most important economic portfolios. “International trade is the lifeline of the EU economy and its economic importance is illustrated by the fact that one in every seven jobs in the EU is supported by the export of goods and services.”Mr Hogan said as a result of the European Commission’s trade agenda, the EU had become the “largest exporter of agri-food products in the world, with exports of €138 billion last year, supporting millions of jobs, many of them in Ireland.”Mr Hogan said there was enormous untapped potential for job creation from the implementation of trade agreements.“Ireland is a small, open, export-orientated economy, which has been a very significant beneficiary of EU trade policy and the growth of exports over many years.“It is estimated that that exports to countries outside the EU support around 650,000 jobs in Ireland, particularly in such sectors as agri-food, pharma, medical devices, med-tech and financial services,” he said.Taoiseach Leo Varadkar congratulated Mr Hogan, describing his nomination as a “very positive development” for Ireland. The Taoiseach said: “Ireland sought a major economic brief in the new European Commission, and I am very satisfied that we have secured it.“Commissioner Hogan will of course work for Europe as a whole, but it is a definite advantage to have an Irish person in charge of this crucial brief over the next five years.“He will take the lead on the EU’s post-Brexit trade deal with the UK, as well as Mercosur and the EU’s trading relations with India, the US and China.“He has proven to be vociferous on Brexit, and I am sure that this will continue in his new role,” he said.Ms von der Leyen announced a repartition of portfolios that reflected a remarkable balancing of gender - 13 female and 14 male - by geography, east west and north south. It was also ided between mainstream political parties with two for socialists, three for the centre right and three for the centre. There was a clear prioritisation of policy issues, notably confronting climate change and the digital future . The commission from 1985 to 1988 had no women at all.Ms von der Leyen has named eight co-ordinating vice-presidents. Three of them will have executive powers and are all outgoing commissioners, to be responsible for work across several directorates: Dutch VP Frans Timmermans, the socialist rival for the presidency, will take charge of the “European Green Deal”, while Denmark’s Margrethe Vestager, the Renew Europe candidate, will help make Europe “fit for the digital age”.Ms Vestager, whose robust policing of competition policy had earned her much respect, also keeps the high profile competition portfolio. This comes just a week before the Court of Justice of the European Union, hears the appeal against the commission €13 billion Apple state aids ruling against Ireland.Outgoing Latvian VP Valdis Dombrovskis keeps his job of co-ordinating economic, monetary policies and financial services. He will work with Paolo Gentiloni, the former Italian PM who has specific responsibility for the economy and whose appointment at a time when Italy is at loggerheads with the commission over its deficit management raised eyebrows.Ms von der Leyen insists, however that there is no conflict of interest . “You are Europeans first,” she says she told each of her nominees, “no longer representatives or messengers from your countries…. Decisions will be arrived at in the college.”Indeed she has not shied away from giving portfolios to nominees from member states who have strong direct interests in the posts they will get. The outgoing Czech Vera Jourova is being given a VP brief to uphold “values and transparency” , which is code for putting manners on the wayward other Visegrad states.A representative of the latter, Hungarian former justice minister, László Trócsányi, is being asked to deal with enlargement, notably the expansion of the Union into the Balkans where, like Hungary, the rule of law is a particular concern. He is likely to face a severe grilling by MEPs.Greece’s nominee, Margaritis Schinas will have VP responsibility for migration, while Poland’s Janusz Wojciechowski is to get Hogan’s old brief to administer farm spending - Poland is the largest CAP recipient.Among the prominent women are also Sylvie Goulard a former French defence minister, as commissioner for the internal market and also overseeing a new directorate-general for defence industry and space Dubravaka Šuica, a former mayor of Dobrovnik in Croatia, as vice president for democracy and demography and Kadri Simson, of Estonia, as energy commissioner.Outgoing Bulgarian Mariya Gabriel will take charge of innovation and youth, a large brief that includes the huge research budget and the popular Erasmus student programme.With one commissioner per member state - at Ireland’s insistence a few years ago - the 28-strong commission is somewhat unwieldy with critics suggesting that some jobs may be less substantive than their names suggest. But Ms von der Leyen defended the repartition of roles, insisting there was a job for everyone.“We have a structure that focuses on tasks, not hierarchies,” von der Leyen said at a news conference at the Commission headquarters. “We need to be able to deliver on the issues that matter the most, rapidly and with determination.”The president-elect also promised that the commission will conduct its business in a paperless way and will delete one regulation for every new one it initiates.In the next few weeks all the nominees will face hearings in the European Parliament which has the right to reject the whole team. The new commission takes office on November 1st."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4013644.1568110814!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"penny finally dropping for uk on brexit says phil hogan","story":"“The penny is finally dropping” with the UK on Brexit, Phil Hogan predicts with new confidence. The probability of a deal is rising, he insists.The Irish Agriculture Commissioner, who has today been nominated to take over the EU trade portfolio in which he will play a key role in the next phase of talks, points optimistically to the revival of the idea of an all-Ireland backstop. The idea was dropped from the original Withdrawal Agreement by then British prime minister Theresa May under pressure from unionists, but her successor Boris Johnson appears to be re-examining all-Ireland based solutions.“Mr Johnson has made a proposal in the last few days talking about an all-Ireland food zone,”\u0026nbspHogan told The  in an interview after his nomination. “That is certainly a clear indication of ergence between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, the EU and the rest of the UK. This is the first time that this has been spoken about by a British prime minister where they are prepared to accept some level of ergence between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.“If we can build on that we certainly might get closer to one another in terms of a possible outcome,” he says.There is some way to go, he admits, insisting that the EU would not accept a partial backstop. “It would have to include all goods . . . in terms of any agreement,” he says.“I remain hopeful that the penny is finally dropping with the UK that there are pragmatic and practical solutions can actually be introduced into the debate at this stage – albeit at the eleventh hour – that may find some common ground between the EU and the UK.”Are we heading in the direction of the first version of the backstop? “Yes. The Taoiseach has indicated in the last 24 hours that the Northern Ireland-only backstop is quite an interesting idea to revisit.”Hogan was this morning nominated to take over the important trade portfolio by Commission president-elect Ursula von der Leyen, in what is being seen as both a tribute to his widely regarded work and an expression of solidarity with Ireland over Brexit.Agriculture roleIn the agriculture portfolio, Hogan presided over significant reform of the common agricultural policy (Cap), three emergency aid packages for the sector, the creation of a special Africa taskforce, and contributed to trade talks with Japan, Mexico, Canada and Mercosur.He says he is “very honoured and pleased to get such a substantial economic portfolio”.In a crucial economic role – the Commission negotiates on behalf of all the member states on international trade – Hogan will also take charge of the negotiations with the UK on Brexit and its future relationship with the EU. The EU’s Article 50 Task Force under Michel Barnier, responsible for negotiating the exit deal, will be replaced by a Hogan-led team to craft a long-term trade agreement with the UK.He predicts the establishment of the new group “will take probably six to eight months once we know what the outcome of the present negotiations are. Then I expect it will take a number of years before we conclude the negotiations.”He reiterates the EU insistence that nothing can happen, deal or no deal, before the UK accepts the obligations in the Withdrawal Agreement on citizens’ rights, the Brexit bill, and the backstop. “The orce proceedings have to be completed first before the future relationship which would include a free-trade agreement.“But we will not be starting from scratch in the case of the UK because they have been part of the EU for the last 45 years. I expect that we will be able to move more quickly than we would in any other trade negotiation.”ScrutinyHogan will face close questioning by MEPs in hearings over the next few weeks which are likely to focus on the Mercosur trade agreement with five south American countries. Many MEPs are deeply critical of the deal because they say it fails to tackle sustainability issues like deforestation.Hogan, who played an important part in the final stages of talks, is adamant the opposite is true. “We have used market access for the first time to yield substantial progress in relation to sustainability,” he insists, “to deal with issues that are very difficult and appalling like the deforestation of the Amazon.”In the absence of the agreement, he argues, the EU simply does not have any leverage. “There’s a separate chapter on sustainability. There’s a dispute resolution mechanism if there is not full compliance with the Paris climate agreement. And ultimately a decision can be made by any member state, and by the European Parliament, that we will abandon this particular deal with the Mercosur countries if not all aspects are going to be complied with.”He sees the key new challenges as the UK talks, “to try and eliminate the escalation of a trade war between the US and the EU”, discussions with Australia and New Zealand, and the reform of the World Trade Organisation.He also makes a case for what he says is the enhanced enforcement and implementation of recently signed trade deals. “We’re not getting, in my view, the value of the deals we have completed with the rest of the world at this stage. And we need to put some structures in place in order to get better opportunities for our businesses, farmers and for our services.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Photograph: Ray Ryan.Phil Hogan’s nomination as the next EU trade commissioner by incoming commission president Ursula von der Leyen marks the culmination of remarkable career for the Fine Gael stalwart.Known primarily to the Irish electorate as “Big Phil”, the political bruiser who saw off a heave against Enda Kenny when Fine Gael was in opposition in 2010, the Kilkenny man’s career in Brussels is a testament to his more refined political skills.Since his appointment as Agriculture Commissioner in 2014 – after a spell in government as minister for the environment which, because of the introduction of water charges and property tax, saw him become unpopular in Ireland – Hogan successfully managed his brief while also becoming a significant player in the EU.He developed a strong relationship with Jean Claude Juncker, the outgoing president of the European Commission, and both are likely to have recognised seasoned political operators in each other.‘Farmer Phil’Hogan was known to tell people that Juncker jokingly referred to him at times as “Farmer Phil” and he clearly enjoyed chaperoning Juncker around Leinster House and Dublin during a visit in June 2018.Hogan skilfully navigated the Brussels scene in a more sophisticated manner than the bruiser caricature would lead people to believe, say Government figures.“You have to remember that the Commission is full of technocrats, academics,” said one person who has observed Hogan at work in Brussels. “He is a politician’s politician.”As such, he was seen as an ally of the European Council and kept in touch and in favour with MEPs. He also knew how to cut deals and sell good news: political skills that do not come easy to many EU commissioners.Hogan has been an outspoken critic of Brexiteers, repeatedly warning about the consequences of the UK’s withdrawal from the EU. As recently as last month, he said a no-deal Brexit would create a “foul atmosphere” between the EU and the UK and would have “serious consequences” for negotiating any future trade agreement – negotiations he will now oversee.Sources in Dublin say they had long expected Hogan to be given the trade portfolio, a move seen as a pointed signal to London from the European Commission.Irish lobbyingHogan is understood to have initially found von der Leyen harder to read than her predecessor, Juncker, and has publicly credited the allocation of the trade portfolio to lobbying by Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and the Government.Hogan quietly assisted Varadkar in his efforts to become Fine Gael leader and Taoiseach in 2017 and previously had an uneasy relationship with Tánaiste Simon Coveney, who lost the contest to succeed Kenny to Varadkar.The ill-feeling between Hogan and Coveney dated back to the Fine Gael heave of 2010 but sources said they were regularly seen together in Brussels since Coveney was appointed Minister for Foreign Affairs by Varadkar in 2017.Private praise for Coveney’s Brexit efforts comes easier to Hogan now than it may have a few years ago.Despite leaving Leinster House five years ago, the political animal who was a key player in Fine Gael’s election successes under Kenny’s leadership lives on. Hogan keeps a close eye on domestic politics and is in regular contact with old colleagues in the Oireachtas to discuss the Irish political scene.He is likely to continue to do so, even after his promotion to one of the most senior positions in the EU."},{"url":null,"title":"middle","story":"Israeli prime minister denies using intelligence about Iran to boost election campaignPart of walkway collapses after thousands travel to Karbala for Ashura celebrationsCall for reform after \u0026lsquoblue girl\u0026rsquo facing jail sentence for trying to enter ground set herself on fire\u0026lsquoThe possessor of real nukes cries wolf\u0026rsquo, says Iranian foreign ministerClaim Arabs involved in election fraud come from PM \u0026lsquosuspected of fraud and bribery\u0026rsquoIran injecting uraniam gas into advanced centrifuges \u0026ndash spokesmanAt least 500 killed, 400,000 displaced so far in northwest Syria campaign against jihadisRouhani warning comes as France steps up diplomatic efforts to resolve crisisLebanon PM seeks intervention from US and France \u0026lsquoin face of developments\u0026rsquo in southTrump tweets photo of site, raising questions over disclosing surveillance secretsIran and Hizbullah joint endeavour subject of classified intelligence made publicAttack in city of Aden is a part of surge of violence complicating UN peace effortsUS must lift all sanctions before talks, says Rouhani, after G7 summit suggested progressWave of Israeli attacks prompts threats of retaliatory strikes from Teheran and HizbullahIsraeli says it struck Iranian forces that had been planning to launch \u0026lsquokiller drones\u0026rsquo at its targetsRina Shnerb killed and family members injured near natural spring in West BankMartin Griffiths claims chaos in region could enable re-emergence of extremist groupsUN says hundreds killed since offensive by Russian-backed Syrian forces began in AprilInstead of flying Palestinians abroad, Israel must \u0026lsquostop punishing\u0026rsquo two million peopleCapture of strategic town of of Khan Sheikhoun would be a key gain for Assad forces"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4014099.1568140201!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"netanyahu vows to annex large parts of occupied west bank","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tIsraeli prime minister Binyamin Netanyahu reaffirmed a pledge to annex all Jewish settlements throughout the West Bank. Photograph: Menahem KahanaAFPGetty ImagesIsraeli prime minister Binyamin Netanyahu announced his intention on Tuesday to annex the Jordan Valley in the occupied West Bank if he wins next week’s general election. “Today, I announce my intention, after the establishment of a new government, to apply Israeli sovereignty to the Jordan Valley and the northern Dead Sea,” Mr Netanyahu said in a speech broadcast live on Israeli television channels. Mr Netanyahu reaffirmed a pledge to annex all Jewish settlements throughout the West Bank, but said such a move would not be made before publication of a long-awaited US peace plan and consultations with President Donald Trump. There was no immediate comment from Washington. Palestinian prime minister Mohammad Shtayyeh, in a statement issued shortly before Mr Netanyahu spoke, amid reports of a possible annexation announcement, said the Israeli leader is “a prime destroyer of the peace process”.Earlier Mr Netanyahu denied claims that he had used sensitive intelligence about Iran’s nuclear programme to boost his election campaign.In a Monday night press conference, broadcast live on Israeli television channels, Mr Netanyahu disclosed new information about what he described as “additional secret sites in Iran’s nuclear programme”, citing a specific location in Abadeh as “a site for developing nuclear weapons”.Benny Gantz, the head of the centrist Blue and White party, which is running neck and neck with Netanyahu’s Likud ahead of next Tuesday’s poll, accused him of misusing top -secret information for political gain.“Netanyahu’s use of sensitive security information for the purposes of his campaign attests to bad judgment. Even in his last days as prime minister, Netanyahu is only looking out for Netanyahu.” But officials in the prime minister’s office said that national security professionals had urged Mr Netanyahu to reveal the information on Monday evening, immediately after a press conference in Vienna by International Atomic Energy Agency acting chief Cornel Feruta, following his meetings with Iranian officials in Tehran. The nuclear watchdog revealed this week it had found traces of uranium at a separate facility that Mr Netanyahu revealed in another announcement a year ago, calling it a “secret atomic warehouse”. It also confirmed that Tehran was installing hundreds of advanced centrifuges for enriching uranium.Satellite imagesMr Netanyahu’s press conference was complemented by satellite images of the Abadeh site, which allegedly was razed by the Iranians after they knew it had been discovered by Israel. Mr Netanyahu urged “pressure, pressure and more pressure against the tyrants in Iran”. “Israel knows what you are doing, Israel knows when you are doing it, and Israel knows where you are doing it,” he said. “We will continue to expose your lies, we will continue to do everything to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons and we will continue to act against Iranian aggression everywhere, at all times.” Iran’s foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, responded to Mr Netanyahu on Twitter, referring to him as “the possessor of real nukes” who “cries wolf – on an alleged ‘demolished’ site in Iran”.He accused Mr Netanyahu of wanting another war. Israeli commentators noted that Mr Netanyahu’s comments were broadcast live on Likud party social media accounts, with the party’s logo and icons of its ballot slip superimposed on the presentation. Mr Netanyahu’s press conference came against growing Israeli concern over efforts by French president Emmanuel Macron to extricate Iran from sanctions and to revive the nuclear agreement and the possibility that US president Donald Trump will hold talks with his Iranian counterpart Hassan Rouhani.According to the Ma’ariv newspaper, the army and Mossad officials also criticised Mr Netanyahu for his press conference and recent revelations about Israeli strikes at Iranian and pro-Iranian militia targets at various locations across the Middle East. Israel’s departure from its traditional policy of ambiguity has created an uncomfortable atmosphere and was getting the army and Mossad involved in Mr Netanyahu’s election campaign, the report said. – Additional reporting: Reuters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4014129.1568143319!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"tactical votes key to unseating brexiteers in remain strongholds","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t Irish actor Owen McDonnell in St Alban’s: “Voting for the Liberal Democrats is not a protest vote it is a vote that can make a meaningful difference to the way the country is going.” Photograph: Simon CarswellIrish actor Owen McDonnell could not sleep one night last month. He was due to start shooting on a new film the next day and made the mistake of reading comments by a Brexiteer in a news report. His anger stirred him into action.“In the middle of the night I decided to join the Liberal Democrats because I was sick of not doing anything and because this is a potential seat to win. I said: ‘Screw this – I have got to join up and make a difference,’” he said.Describing himself as a “natural Labour voter”, McDonnell, who has been living in the UK since the mid-1990s, voted for Diane Abbott when he lived in London until he moved here last year. Unlike her safe-as-houses Labour seat, St Alban’s is considered up for grabs in Brexit-contaminated British politics when voters are expected to head to the polls in the coming weeks or months.Daisy Cooper, the Lib Dem candidate in the constituency, increased her party’s vote by 14 per cent in the 2017 election and reduced the Tory majority by half. She is eyeing the seat held since 2005 by pro-Brexit Conservative MP Anne Main in a constituency that voted 63 per cent Remain in the 2016 Brexit referendum.The Lib Dems, who under leader Jo Swinson are pushing for a second referendum or “People’s Vote” with the option to remain in the EU, are poised to campaign in the next election to revoke the article 50 exit process.McDonnell, like his preferred candidate in St Alban’s, spies an opportunity. He believes the party offers a “sensible approach” to Brexit that recognises that “half the country didn’t want it to happen”.‘Balance of power’“The Liberal Democrats are in a position where they can actually say, ‘look, we could hold the balance of power and if we do, we are in a position to temper either the Conservatives who have become increasingly right-wing under Boris Johnson or Labour who become increasingly left-wing under Jeremy Corbyn, ” said McDonnell, sipping a coffee near his home.“So I think voting for the Liberal Democrats is not a protest vote it is a vote that can actually make a meaningful difference to the way the country is going.”The actor is not alone.In St Alban’s Baked Nation coffee shop, Cooper told The  that the desire to unseat a pro-Brexit in a Remain constituency is drawing new supporters who have not traditionally voted for her party.“We are attracting a lot of soft Labour voters who would tactically vote for us and that has been the strategy for us for a while, but what’s quite surprising now is that we are winning a lot of soft Conservatives as well,” said Cooper, who describes herself as “a committed Remainer” and campaigner for a second Brexit vote for three years.Of almost 1,000 new members to have joined the party this year, she says they are evenly split among former Conservative voters, former Labour voters and “lifelong liberal voters who haven’t felt mobilised before”.Party allegiancesLess than half of the Labour candidate’s votes in 2017 would have been enough for Cooper to take the Tory seat.St Alban’s is one of dozens of constituencies across the UK targeted by the People’s Vote campaign for tactical voting where the Remainers are being urged to set aside party allegiances in favour of pro-Remain candidates with the best chance of winning to shore up enough support at Westminster to block Brexit.Cooper says Boris Johnson’s decision to prorogue parliament on Monday for five weeks is helping these efforts.“Prorogation has created a real visceral anger on the doorsteps,” she said.As University of Hertfordshire students milled about this medieval abbey town in gowns and mortarboards awaiting graduation ceremonies, members of the public walking by the old clock tower expressed concern at Johnson’s Brexit strategy and what it was doing to the Conservative party.Ruth Peniket, a long-time Tory supporter and Remain voter from a neighbouring constituency, says the shift from a “moderate Conservative party to an extreme one” would encourage her to come here and campaign for the Lib Dems.“What has happened in this last week has been horrendous – the expulsion of Conservative MPs, the push for no-deal. It swings me even further behind the Liberal Democrats,” she said."},{"url":null,"title":"telegraph audio briefings sign new whatsapp group","story":"Want audio briefings direct to your WhatsApp?

The Treasury estimates that a bottle of wine bought in Heathrow duty-free could, as a result, be up to £2.23 cheaper.Holidaymakers will now also be able to bring in limited amounts of alcohol and cigarettes bought at duty-free shops in the EU, saving over £12 on two crates of beer, for example.Chancellor of the exchequer Sajid Javid said: “As we prepare to leave the EU, I’m pleased to be able to back British travellers.“We want people to enjoy their hard-earned holidays and this decision will help holidaymakers’ cash go that little bit further.”Created with Sketch.Protesters take to streets after Boris Johnson suspends parliament  Show all 11Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Anti Brexit protesters march on WhitehallMany of the protesters carried placardsThe protesters also marched to Trafalgar Square, where they blocked trafficJohn McDonnell addressed crowds in Whitehall.A small group of Brexit supporters attempted to stage a counter protest in central London.Three people were arrested in London, including a woman who sat on the road near Trafalgar Square.In Oxford, locals and students gathered outside Balliol College, Boris Johnson\u0027s alma mater, to protest.Thousands of people gather in central Glasgow to protest against the prime minister.Jeremy Corbyn spoke to protesters in central Glasgow.Anti Brexit protesters march on WhitehallMany of the protesters carried placardsThe protesters also marched to Trafalgar Square, where they blocked trafficJohn McDonnell addressed crowds in Whitehall.A small group of Brexit supporters attempted to stage a counter protest in central London.Three people were arrested in London, including a woman who sat on the road near Trafalgar Square.In Oxford, locals and students gathered outside Balliol College, Boris Johnson\u0027s alma mater, to protest.Thousands of people gather in central Glasgow to protest against the prime minister.Jeremy Corbyn spoke to protesters in central Glasgow.Currently, travellers will be able to shop duty-free when going to non-EU countries.\u0026nbspTravellers within the EU were able to shop without paying certain local taxes and duties, or customs charges, until the 1990s, on the condition that they took the goods out of the country. Duty-free sales were then abolished when the single market was introduced, effectively erasing national borders.\u0026nbspIn a 1997 statement defending the decision, the European Commission wrote: “People enjoy being able to literally fill up their car or baggage with goods bought in other EU countries that are cheaper or not available in their country of residence.\u0026nbsp“Being able to buy a single 1l bottle of spirits and a single box of 200 cigarettes in a duty-free shop if you happen to travel by air, sea or the Channel Tunnel shuttle pales in comparison with the new opportunities to shop in other EU countries.”These opportunities include the freedom to bring in unlimited amounts of goods bought anywhere in the EU without systematic border checks, making shopping in another EU country as easy as purchasing in a local shop, the commission noted.This freedom will be kept in part after a no-deal Brexit, according to the Treasury statement. People travelling back from the EU will still be able to bring back unlimited amounts specifically of alcohol and cigarettes, provided they did not buy them in a duty-free shop.The Treasury’s decision on duty-free shopping will not apply to movements of goods from Northern Ireland to EU member state Ireland, as EU law does not allow the Irish government to operate duty-free at the land border.A no-deal Brexit, which until last week looked increasingly likely, faces a fresh hurdle after parliament passed a law to stop such an outcome.

Brexit is not a big deal for Primark, it is more of an event for other people.”ABF also said it has “completed all practical preparations” for Brexit and has contingency plans in place for potential disruption.ABF expects full-year sales at Primark to be 4 per cent up on last year, but much of the growth is due to additional stores being opened.Primark is still the face of fast fashion as growth continuesLike-for-like sales, which strip out that effect, are set to fall 2 per cent globally and 1 per cent in the UK, the company said. ABF’s shares fell 1.8 per cent on Monday after the trading update.

Just as with the cheaper model, the company focused primarily on the camera in its announcement.The company said that its improved screen as well as new colours justify the pro moniker, which has only ever been used on bigger devices.This is the first phone that we\u0027ve called pro, said Apple\u0027s Phil Schiller, as he unveiled the phone.For us that means it\u0027s the first device that pros can count on to get work done. But it\u0027s also a device for all of us who want the best product made, even if we\u0027re not a pro.The iPhone 11 Pro costs $999 or $1,099 for the bigger Max version, the same price as the XS and XS Max they replace. Pre-orders will begin on Friday – at the slightly later hour of 5am pacific daylight time – and will all start shipping on 20 September.The new phone comes in a number of colours, including a brand new green. And those finish are also matte, rather than the shiny gloss in previous versions.It also includes three different lenses in the camera. As well as the normal one, and the zoom that arrived in recent iPhones, it also has an ultra-wide camera that can allow for images that take in twice as much as the previous phone.New Apple Watch finally brings screen that will never turn offThe iPhone can take photos with all of those different cameras at once, Apple said, letting people choose either to zoom in or to use the new wider lens to take in the full detail. The three cameras are able to talk to each other, so that they are aligned ready for switching between the different lenses.It also includes a feature called Deep Fusion which can use machine learning to take a variety of different photos at once and combine them into the best version of any photo. It is computational photography mad science, said Mr Schiller, it is way cool.It also includes new video recording features, as well as updated editing tools to allow them to be adjusted after the fact. The phone has the ability to record through two of the cameras at once, and switch between the two even as video is being recorded.Inside the phone is Apple\u0027s brand new A13 Bionic chip. The company said that will be vastly quicker than all of the chips it has made before, but that it can also work less hard to preserve battery life.The iPhone 11 Pro can last four hours longer than the iPhone XS that it replaces the bigger Max version can last five hours longer than the XS Max, Apple said. It will also come with a new more powerful charger to allow it power up more quickly.Apple said there was also a variety of new features it did not have time to discuss, including upgraded material\u0026nbspthat gives it the strongest glass in a smartphone.Follow the latest from the iPhone event below:We\u0027ve got more details coming about iOS 13.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspIt was barely mentioned during the keynote but we\u0027ve got a press release in our inbox.

The Treasury estimates that a bottle of wine bought in Heathrow duty-free could, as a result, be up to £2.23 cheaper.Holidaymakers will now also be able to bring in limited amounts of alcohol and cigarettes bought at duty-free shops in the EU, saving over £12 on two crates of beer, for example.Chancellor of the exchequer Sajid Javid said: “As we prepare to leave the EU, I’m pleased to be able to back British travellers.“We want people to enjoy their hard-earned holidays and this decision will help holidaymakers’ cash go that little bit further.”Created with Sketch.Protesters take to streets after Boris Johnson suspends parliament  Show all 11Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Anti Brexit protesters march on WhitehallMany of the protesters carried placardsThe protesters also marched to Trafalgar Square, where they blocked trafficJohn McDonnell addressed crowds in Whitehall.A small group of Brexit supporters attempted to stage a counter protest in central London.Three people were arrested in London, including a woman who sat on the road near Trafalgar Square.In Oxford, locals and students gathered outside Balliol College, Boris Johnson\u0027s alma mater, to protest.Thousands of people gather in central Glasgow to protest against the prime minister.Jeremy Corbyn spoke to protesters in central Glasgow.Anti Brexit protesters march on WhitehallMany of the protesters carried placardsThe protesters also marched to Trafalgar Square, where they blocked trafficJohn McDonnell addressed crowds in Whitehall.A small group of Brexit supporters attempted to stage a counter protest in central London.Three people were arrested in London, including a woman who sat on the road near Trafalgar Square.In Oxford, locals and students gathered outside Balliol College, Boris Johnson\u0027s alma mater, to protest.Thousands of people gather in central Glasgow to protest against the prime minister.Jeremy Corbyn spoke to protesters in central Glasgow.Currently, travellers will be able to shop duty-free when going to non-EU countries.\u0026nbspTravellers within the EU were able to shop without paying certain local taxes and duties, or customs charges, until the 1990s, on the condition that they took the goods out of the country. Duty-free sales were then abolished when the single market was introduced, effectively erasing national borders.\u0026nbspIn a 1997 statement defending the decision, the European Commission wrote: “People enjoy being able to literally fill up their car or baggage with goods bought in other EU countries that are cheaper or not available in their country of residence.\u0026nbsp“Being able to buy a single 1l bottle of spirits and a single box of 200 cigarettes in a duty-free shop if you happen to travel by air, sea or the Channel Tunnel shuttle pales in comparison with the new opportunities to shop in other EU countries.”These opportunities include the freedom to bring in unlimited amounts of goods bought anywhere in the EU without systematic border checks, making shopping in another EU country as easy as purchasing in a local shop, the commission noted.This freedom will be kept in part after a no-deal Brexit, according to the Treasury statement. People travelling back from the EU will still be able to bring back unlimited amounts specifically of alcohol and cigarettes, provided they did not buy them in a duty-free shop.The Treasury’s decision on duty-free shopping will not apply to movements of goods from Northern Ireland to EU member state Ireland, as EU law does not allow the Irish government to operate duty-free at the land border.A no-deal Brexit, which until last week looked increasingly likely, faces a fresh hurdle after parliament passed a law to stop such an outcome. The bill requires Boris Johnson to request an extension to Brexit negotiations until the end of January unless he can secure a deal or parliamentary approval for no deal by 19 October.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Brexit is not a big deal for Primark, it is more of an event for other people.”ABF also said it has “completed all practical preparations” for Brexit and has contingency plans in place for potential disruption.ABF expects full-year sales at Primark to be 4 per cent up on last year, but much of the growth is due to additional stores being opened.Primark is still the face of fast fashion as growth continuesLike-for-like sales, which strip out that effect, are set to fall 2 per cent globally and 1 per cent in the UK, the company said. ABF’s shares fell 1.8 per cent on Monday after the trading update. Final results will be reported on 5 November.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

However, the thing to remember is it can’t follow this method forever.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Minds Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Minds.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Shock resignations and drastic ministerial announcements in parliament are dominating the news agenda, making it difficult to shift attention to anything else.One group that does seem to be doing well at shouting about their Brexit concerns is\u0026nbspEU nationals. Criticism of the EU settlement scheme has\u0026nbspbeen hitting the headlines\u0026nbspin recent weeks, with a stream of newspaper articles highlighting cases where often highly educated and successful UK residents have been wrongly denied settled status, prompting outrage.Rightly so. It can be easily argued that it isn’t fair for someone who has been legally resident in Britain for many years to have to apply to obtain immigration status at all – let alone be wrongly denied it.But it is important to note that it is only a certain cohort of EU nationals who are getting their voices heard in the media even if the concerns are definitely worth hearing. Celebrity chefs, headteachers and local councillors – they are people who have the confidence and the means to speak up.And most of these people were\u0026nbspgranted full settled status after submitting further evidence to the\u0026nbspHome Office\u0026nbspof their residence in the UK. So while the experience is stressful and anxiety-inducing, and that cannot be underestimated, they are at no risk of being left undocumented\u0026nbspafter Brexit.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Australia celebrate the wicket of England\u0027s Craig Overton, which meant they won the fourth test and retained the Ashes.Manchester City celebrate after Caroline Weir scored during their Women\u0027s Super League match against Manchester United at Etihad Stadium.

But did his plan work  Heres what we know.Boris Johnson certainly wanted one after  rebel Tory MPs joined with the opposition in backing a law that would block a No Deal Brexit.The PM said he believed he needs a fresh mandate from voters to prise a new deal from EU leaders.In the wake of MPs passing the delaying bill in the Commons, the Prime Minister called for Britain to go to the polls on October .The move, however, failed to win the two thirds of MPs necessary under the Fixed Term Parliaments Act.The vote was lost after Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn ordered his MPs to abstain in the knowledge this would prevent Boris getting the two thirds majority he needed.That prompted a furious Mr Johnson to brand Corbyn chicken saying he was “the first leader of the opposition in the democratic history of our country to refuse the invitation of an election”.Labour’s mass abstention on September  came despite Mr Corbyn and other senior figures in his party having called for a General Election as soon as possible more than  times so far — in this year alone.Johnson was again defeated by the House of Commons on September , after only winning  votes -  MPs short of the  he needed to call an election.He has now lost six out of six votes, an all-time record for a Prime Minister.With parliament prorogued until October , it means there now cannot be an election until November - after the PMs do or die Brexit date of October .If it passes, the election would not be before November as the Commons will be prorogued until October .A General Election gives UK citizens a chance to select an MP to represent their local area in the House of Commons.Normally there will be several candidates, each from a dferent political party, standing to be the Member of Parliament in each constituency.The vote will also determine who will be elected as the UK Prime Minister.The last General Election was held on June , .Previously elections could be called simply by the Prime Minister going to the Queen at any point within five years of the last one.But after the Fixed Term Parliament Act was passed in  the five-year gap was enshrined in law.Under the act every PM now needs two thirds of all MPs -  - to agree to go to the country before any election can be held.I said I wanted to make your streets safer - and that is why we are recruiting another , police officers.I said I wanted to improve your hospital and reduce the waiting times at your GP. And so we are doing  new hospital upgrades in addition to the £billion more going into the NHS. And I said I wanted every child in this country to have a superb education and that’s why I announced last week that we are levelling up funding across the country and spending much more next year in both primary and secondary schools.And its to push forward this agenda on these and many other fronts that we need a Queen’s Speech in October, while leaving due time to debate Brexit and other matters.And as we come to that Brexit deadline I am encouraged by the progress we are making. In the last few weeks the chances of a deal have been rising, I believe, for three reasons.They can see that we want a deal.They can see that we have a clear vision for our future relationship with the EU - something that has not always perhaps been the case.And they can see that we are utterly determined to strengthen our position by getting ready to come out regardless, come what may.Butthere is one thing that can hold us back in these talks, it is the sense in Brussels that MPs may find some way to cancel the referendum, or that tomorrow MPs will vote - with Jeremy Corbyn - for yet another pointless delay I don’t think they will. I hope that they won’tButthey do they will plainly chop the legs out from under the UK position and make any further negotiation absolutely impossible.And so I say, to show our friends in Brussels that we are united in our purpose, MPs should vote with the Government against Corbyn’s pointless delay.I want everybody to know, there are no circumstances in which I will ask Brussels to delay. We are leaving on the st of October, no s or buts.We will not accept any attempt to go back on our promises or scrub that referendum.Armed and fortied with that conviction I believe we will get a deal at that crucial summit in October.A deal that Parliament will certainly be able to scrutinise.And in the meantime lets let our negotiators get on with their work, without that sword of Damocles over their necks and without an election.Without an election - I don’t want an election, you don’t want an election.Let us get on with the people’s agenda - fighting crime, improving the NHS, boosting schools, cutting the cost of living, unlocking talent and opportunity across the entire United Kingdom, with infrastructure, education and technology It is a massive agenda. Let’s come together and get it done - and let’s get Brexit done by October .The date of the last General Election was June , , which saw the Conservatives lose their majority but remain in Government after they struck a deal with the DUP.Theresa May called a shock snap election in  to try and strengthen the Conservatives hold on Parliament, but it backfired when her majority was slashed by  seats.The Tories wafer-thin working Commons majority was slashed to zero as Tory rebel Phillip Lee defected to the Lib Dems.The next General Election is scheduled to be held on May ,   Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But in the past few years his image has become somewhat tarnished.He’s no longer the boy wonder who can do no wrong and this week Brad revealed how he spent  months going to Alcoholics Anonymous meetings after his marriage to Angelina Jolie broke down.He was with an all-male AA group and described it as “removing his drinking privileges” — but said it was a “freeing” experience. I suspect he is the kind of straight man who prefers the company of other fellas.He seems far happier just watching baseball on TV with some of his mates than dressed up in a tuxedo at a red-carpet event with a glamorous woman on his arm.There were rumours that his drinking was a factor in wrecking his relationship with Angelina — with accusations of him having a booze-fuelled rant at one of the older kids — and even close pals agreed that he needed help getting back on track.While he has been trying to get his act together — and all credit to him for seeking help —  months down the line Brad is still trying to officially “consciously uncouple” from Angelina.The y orce proceedings and bitter child-custody battle have at times been highly toxic but now we are told it is all being settled behind closed doors. This means that the lawyers will be having a field day and it will be costing an absolute fortune.The whole split will have been incredibly stressful so it’s maybe no wonder Brad sought solace by hitting the bottle. But let’s just take a look at Jenner.It’s hard to believe she was once an object of pity after Brad fell head over heels for Angelina when she was his movie co-star in Mr  Mrs Smith back in .Jenner is now light years from the supposed “woman scorned” who everyone felt desperately sorry for — she is currently right at the very top of her game.Jenner has turned  and appears on the current cover of Instyle magazine, glowing with health and happiness and looking at least two decades younger.As well as the famous split with Brad, she didn’t have the easiest time finding her feet in Hollywood. After Friends came to an end, her film career failed to take off and then stalled with a series of pretty dire rom-coms.To her credit, Jenner bounced back spectacularly with a string of hits and critically acclaimed roles — in movies such as Cake, Mother’s Day, Dumplin’ and, most recently, Murder Mystery.Although none of her post-Brad relationships lasted the distance and her marriage to Justin Theroux ended in orce, Jenner now seems very comfortable in her own skin.She has said before that she doesn’t want people to feel she needs their sympathy and that she is extremely happy with her le. She is clearly frustrated at being labelled the “deserted we” and has long since made her peace with Brad.So much so that he was a guest at her th birthday party and they are friends — with real affection for one another. Brad and Angelina have always insisted they got together after his marriage to Jenner was in trouble, but all couples go through bad patches and you do have to wonder just what would have happenedMr  Mrs Smith had never been made.Perhaps Brad and Jen would have been able to talk through any tensions and misunderstandings and save their relationship. A lot of people would like to see these two back together again, but I reckon Brad is now carrying too much baggage for a woman such as Jenner.Who would have thought she would end up being the stronger of the two  They do say the best revenge is living a good le — and Jenner is the proof of that.SHE looked frail and unsteady at times walking up Downing Street to No  but Barbara Windsor’s glorious smile never faded. The -year-old was on a mission as she delivered a letter to Boris Johnson calling on him to improve dementia care.It was typical Barbara, drawing on every ounce of her strength and resilience to make sure the needs of dementia sufferers are heard. Leaning on the arm of devoted husband Scott, above, who has been her rock since her Alzheimer’s diagnosis, it was heartening to see glimpses of the Barbara we all love.She was immaculately made up and her trademark blonde beehive was teased higher than ever. She smiled, waved and joked with everyone, but you could seeshe was exhausted as well as exhilarated. Seeing Barbara and Scott together – and the tender way he takes care of her – is so moving.This vile disease might be cruelly robbing him of the woman he loves, but the two of them endeavour to make the most of every day and they are doing a vital job in raising money and awareness so one day we might even conquer dementia.What a tribute that would be to one of the most delightful women I’ve ever been lucky enough to come across.MY thoughts are with Alexandra Burke and her footballer partner Angus MacDonald, who has been diagnosed with bowel cancer at the heartbreakingly young age of .The Hull City defender is a fit sportsman and the news proves this hellish disease can strike down anyone. I hope the cancer has been caught early and he will go on to make a full recovery with singer Alexandra by his side.It’s going to be a very tough time for them both – but I hope all the support and good wishes being sent their way will be of some help and comfort.I’M a bit bemused that Harry and Meghan have apparently declined an invitation to his granny’s Highland home, saying baby Archie is too young.Their four-month-old has already flown to Ibiza for a week on a private jet and is about to go on a long trip to South Africa. By all accounts, there is also an upcoming trip to Calornia so Mum and Dad can go househunting.So to say he’s too small to pop up the road to Scotland seems somewhat disingenuous. The Queen always invites her family to Balmoral to spend part of the summer with her. Princess Anne, Prince Edward and Sophie and princesses Eugenie and Beatrice spent time there last month.The Queen also showed her unquestioning support to Prince Andrew, who is embroiled in the scandal surrounding the late convicted pervert Jeffrey Epstein.William and Kate flew up with their three kids for a family break – somewhat pointedly on a Flybe plane – the day after the Sussexes went on that Ibiza trip in a private jet financed by Uncle Elton.Maybe Meghan simply doesn’t fancy the chilly BBQs and outdoorsy le at Balmoral. Harry’s mum Diana was never a big fan and I wouldn’t blame Meghan for not wanting to be part of the hunting, shooting and fishing brigade. But it’s the excuse of Archie being too young that doesn’t ring true.It was the same with Harry’s response to their flights on private jets when preaching to us all about reducing our carbon footprints. He claimed it was to protect his family but big bro William will one day be king and he took Kate and their three children on a commercial airline to Scotland.As I’ve said before, Harry and Meghan have good intentions and a lot to offer. They could do so much good but they seem to have lost their way and there is a growing disconnect between them and us that is really sad.WHAT the feck have we all done in a previous le to deserve the complete and utter balls-up currently being played out in our parliament  It makes the deranged and sweary TV comedy The Thick Of It look like a sensible political documentary.We have become a country full of people who are either permanently angry or completely and utterly fed up to the back teeth of the whole Brexit debacle. Or both.Family members have fallen out with one another after heated arguments over leaving the EU, including the PM’s nearest and dearest. This week Boris Johnson’s own brother Jo turned against him and resigned from Parliament as a minister and MP.Boris says he’d rather be dead in a ditch than ask for a Brexit extension but it’s increasingly likely he will be boxed into a corner and have no choice. So what then  Does he resign and run away again leaving some other poor sod to clear up the mess It looks suspiciously as though there’s no real plan and the whole motley crew are just lurching from crisis to crisis.  We deserve better.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And that reveals two things about Corbyn’s mob:First, they HAVE finally decided to abandon all their Leave voters. Second, they intend to insult their intelligence too, by assuming them too dim to see through such a transparent con-trick.Labour should simply state: “In power, we would scrap Brexit.” Yes, it would be shameful and, in a country where trust in politicians is already nearly the ­lowest in Europe, insanely dangerous.But at least Corbyn would for once be telling the truth.CAN the world’s worst loser Gina Miller really not hear her own revolting hypocrisy “I will not give up the fight for democracy,” she bleats as her legal bid to stop the PM suspending Parliament is chucked out.This is a rich woman using her millions to meddle in politics while refusing to stand for election. A woman bent on overturning the biggest mandate in our history because she doesn’t like it.A woman whose Remainer pals are running scared of an election Boris Johnson might win.The only vote they want is a second referendum biased for Remain. Butthey can get away with simply cancelling Brexit, all the better.Here’s the only democracy Miller likes:One where she and her powerful, know-all London friends get their way — and the ignorant little people can go to hell.“ANY EU citizens in Britain legally must be told unequivocally they can stay.”So said The Sun just after the  referendum. It was Vote Leave’s stance too.It is still Boris Johnson’s position now.“Under this Government,” he says, “they will have the absolute certainty for the right to live and remain.”Applying to stay is pretty straight- forward. Many have done so. But the number falling prey to Home Office carelessness or negligence is appalling.No one who has lived and worked here legally for years should be suddenly sent letters wrongly declaring them ineligible.

He was charming, witty and fun to debate with.I think some women around the union or Oxford University Conservative Association were head over heels for him.Even today his is thought of as rather dishy in Tory circles with Made in Cha star turned Politico, Georgia Toffolo, describing him as a sex god.An unsurprisingly precocious child, JRM was interviewed on the today programme about finance when he was just -years-old.The keen capitalist, who already read the Financial Times daily and attended company shareholder meetings, was happy to appear on the programme for a fee in .Young Jacob asked the beeb to fork out £ for the interview and when they failed to cough up sent a letter threatening legal action.He wrote: “Dear Today programme, you are in a debt of £ which was payable as from   .“I have no idea what your excuse is but I will not accept it. If it is not received by    which is nearly two months, I shall increase it to £.“If it is not received within  days I shall take legal advice. I hope it does not come to that for I have no desire to prosecute the BBC.”When asked about the incident by The Sun last year, Jacob, now , described it as an error of his misspent youth.A friend who knows both Jacob and Louise claims that the chick lit author turned politico told them that Rees-Mogg had proposed to her but she said no.The pair were very close friends at Oxford and allegedly Louise seriously considered the proposal before turning them down.She would eventually go on to marry Anthony  LoCicero in  but orce him nine years later before hooking up with her current hubby, US businessman Peter Mensch.Jacob and Louise remain close to this day and are Godparents to one anothers children.A fan of the finer things in le, when Jacob was packed of to Eton as a -year-old he discovered he was unhappy with the bedding provided by the prestigious school.As a result, the future MPs now famous nanny, made frequent visits to the Berkshire public school to make his bed.Young Jacob preferred his own linen to the standard issue sheets doled out at the £,-per-year school.During his Far Eastern adventure in the world of Hong Kong finance, Moggy apparently got cosy with a young lady named Maria Butler.The pair apparently dined out together a few times and it seemed like one of the more serious relationships Jacob had had with a woman.But apparently the budding would be romance, which never became physical, was cut short after devoutly Catholic Jacob discovered Maria had been orced following a brief, ill-fated marriage in her early s. History buff Jacob once changed the last four digits of his phone number to , the year of Charles Is execution, to make it easier to remember.He revealed during an interview at the London Palladium with the Spectator that he opted for the number after moving into a new home.Jacob, who read history at Oxford, said: It’s important to have telephone numbers that people can remember.Soyou say to people ‘-the death of Charles I’ they know exactly what to call.As a great British politician, Mr Rees-Mogg obviously opted for a great British Motor.Jacobs dad, Times editor William Rees-Mogg spied a rather nice  T-Series Bentley first owned by former England cricket captain Gubby Allen.Following his death in , Gubby’s papers went on sale at an auction attended by Jacob’s father, a former Editor of The Times and a collector of rare books.It was there that he saw Gubby’s old car for sale and contacted the -year-old Jacob about a potential purchase.Jacob said: “Neither my father nor I knew anything about cars, but we dutully looked under the bonnet and there was an engine there but beyond that, our technical skills were not very great.I bid for it and got it and then realised that enjoying the car was probably going to cost almost as much as buying it”"},{"url":null,"title":"priti patel vindaloo visas britain curry houses","story":"Priti Patel is unveiling plans to lt immigration restrictions on skilled chefs.It comes amid fears Britain’s favourite takeaway is at risk of extinction as specialist cooks cannot get the clearance to move to the country.Ms Patel last night said: “Before we introduce the new points-based immigration system post-Brexit, we are changing the rules to make it easier for restaurants to get the highly skilled chefs they need.“The UK has one of the best food scenes in the world and these changes will make it even better.”Curry houses are closing at a rate of two a week, research shows.The industry has begged ministers for more help for years, warning a shortage of chefs will see more close their doors.Previously, takeaway restaurants could not recruit specialist chefs from abroad.PM Boris Johnson has promised Brexit Britain would open its doors to the “best and brightest” talent.The Home Secretary will lt restrictions so they can look to India and other countries.The Home Office said the move will be a huge boost to all takeaway eateries, not just curry houses.She has also ruled that any new recruits moving to Britain do not have to meet the £, earning threshold that other workers do.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Nothing happened and yet everything happened.An occasion that actually asks quite a lot of the contestants, who have to feign wild enthusiasm for the announcement of their partner, no matter who they get.Levels of sincerity ied on Saturday.Dear old Anton Du Beke looked genuinely delighted to be paired with the dance-trained Emma “Honey” Barton off EastEnders and avoid the Anneka Rice bullet.While BBC pundit Alex Scott resorted to the pat footballer’s response: “I’m over the moon,” to avoid saying anything too specic about how she really felt about Neil Jones, and Giovanni Pernice wasn’t fooling anyone with his fist pumps for landing Michelle Visage .Before we even got to that stage, though, viewers had the almost as tricky task of identying this year’s celebrities, who came with some pretty desperate pleadings.“You may know me from being a CBBC presenter.” No.“You may have seen me on BBC’s Animal Park.” No.“People may have seen me cooking on Saturday morning TV.” Yeah, and they may have seen aliens doing a conga down Falkirk High Street at closing time, Viscountess Emma Weymouth, but I haven’t and I’m supposed to be doing this stuff professionally.It’s the height of arrogance, of course, for the BBC to serve up such an anonymous line-up on its biggest show and, one day, it will bite them on the backside.At the moment, though, a certain level of complacency is probably justied, because I’m pretty sure I said the same thing about Seann Walsh last year, and he turned out to be one of the most talked-about bookings in Strictly history.As unimaginative as these new bookings are, there’s also the tantalising prospect of some serious dancing stfs among that line-up, particularly from the blokes.My expectations are especially high low for Mike Bushell, Chris Ramsey, the ping-pong bloke and rower James Cracknell, who’s “got Luba” , but is already being talked about by the presenters in terms that wouldn’t have flattered Professor Stephen Hawking.“He’s used to sitting down.”All of which, you may have noticed, ignores the real elephant in the room at Saturday’s pairing ceremony, who was teed up perfectly when Mike Bushell laid out his dance credentials.“I like jumping up and down to Faithless.”Well, today’s you’re lucky day, Michael. You’re going to be jumping up and down WITH Faithless.“It’s Katya!”And may that be a lesson you’ll never forget, young lady.Celebs On The Farm, Caprice: “We need to encourage Arg.”Good Morning Britain, Piers Morgan: “Mickey , it’s great to see you in such great shape.”And please send flowers and tributesPiers ever thinks Mickey looks “a bit off colour”.HAVING almost run out of people to offend, patronise and revolt in Los Angeles, it was time for Gemma Collins to choose a fragrance for her new brand of perfume on last week’s final episode of ITVBe’s Diva Forever.Something to reflect her “personality” was the instruction.But with Novichok now on the proscribed list, it looked like being a long old haul as she road- tested a few of the alternatives supplied by her visibly horried US agent.“Nah, car air ­freshener,” said Gemma, pulling a face at the first one.“And this one’s got something that makes me feel sick.”“They don’t know who I am,” she bellowed. “You have to explain who I am. The GC.”Ladies and gentlemen of the US press, meet Godzilla’s Cousin.Fair.THOSE eye-watering meatballs Neil “Razor” Ruddock served up for London Zoo staff last week have already passed into Celebrity MasterChef legend, but probably not out of the systems of anyone who ate them.The size and consistency of hand grenades, they were. And one of the keepers should probably have checked the elephant house, just to seethe bulls were missing anything.They were definitely the culinary highlight of the week though, on a show that always stands or falls on the quality of the bookings.Last week it stood thanks to Razor, Joey Essex and dear old Zandra Rhodes, , who now occupies the same DNA space as a Barry Humphries impression of Su Pollard.A lot of the camera’s attention, of course, was focused on Joey, who was funny here in a way he’s really not on a lot of other shows, probably because so much of his food was “dense”, “thick” and “simple”.The real danger to le and limb, however, was Zandra, who’s deaf as an egg whisk and absolutely lethal with a ft-long kebab skewer in her hands, which may or may not have explained a slight edge to the commentary.“On the red team, Zandra and Oti are preparing the trout for the smoker.”A bit harsh. Plenty of le left in the old girl.Keisha: “John Major.”Ben Shephard: “What relation to you is the daughter of your aunt ”Martin: “Sister.”Lucky Stars, Ben Shephard: “Which cereal grain is the main ingredient in sushi ”Kimberly Wyatt: “Seaweed.”And The Chase, Bradley Walsh: “In AD a man is said to have been attacked by what Scottish monster ”Rosie: “Giants.”No. Kenny Burns.DEAR old Auntie actually sounding proud of the fact, “Gemma Collins is now at the BBC”.Anyone who thinks  years of politicians shouting “let me just finish” on Question Time is a cause for celebration.Good Morning Britain’s human anaconda, Piers Morgan, almost dislocating his jaw at the thought of swallowing British Airways’ eight-course tasting menu.Britain’s Got Talent’s Wembley Arena audience voting for the best sob storyinstead of the best act .And Brazilian kne thrower Alfredo Silva announcing he’d split from we Anna, then ruining everything by revealing he’d dropped her from the act as well. Just as things might have got interesting. TREASURE Island’s cash-snaffling bounder Lord I Mountbatten already looking like the most inspired reality show booking of the year.Russell Crowe’s stunning transformation on Sky Atlantic’s brilliant The Loudest Voice. Lost Voice Guy’s drooling emoji getting a genuine belly laugh, rather than the sympathetic iety that normally greets Britain’s Got Talent comedians.And the final episode of Mortimer  Whitehouse: Gone Fishing, where the overwhelming sense of peace, calm and friendship is only enhanced by the knowledge the BBC’s best show ticks none of its precious and idiotic boxes.SHANE Warne: “As a commentator I was told two things. One, don’t tell me what I can see. And three, take me out to the middle.”Matt Murray: “It looked a really bad injury when Bloomfield was stretchered on.”Lewis Hamilton: “At Mercedes you’re in the family for le.

It also recognises people from all four nations of the United Kingdom.”Brexiteers last night said the knighthood for Olly Robbins defied belief – and was another sign of the ‘Remain’ bias of Mrs May’s administration.Mr Robbins was accused throughout Brexit negotiations under the former PM of masterminding a soft Brexit tying Britain to the EU.Last night one senior Brexiteer said Sir Oliver should instead have been given the French government’s highest honour.“I would have thought a Legion d’honneur would have been more appropriate for his services to the European Union,” the Tory MP said.But Mrs May was DEFENDED last night by Lord Speaker, Lord Fowler, who insisted Mrs May had shown “restraint”.He said Theresa May’s resignation honours list was “substantially smaller than similar political resignation lists drawn up by previous Prime Ministers”.In other ‘gongs’, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn gave peerages to Christine Blower, the ex-general secretary of the National Union of Teachers.Boycott was allegedly previously denied a gong due to an assault conviction in the s.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

because he actually gave birth to the bundle of joy in his arms himself.Freddy, who is transgender and was born female, fell pregnant with his first child using a sperm donor in  despite having already transitioned into a man.Because he had decided to keep his womb in case he wanted kids, he was able to carry the little boy for nine months himself before eventually giving birth last year.Now, Freddy has shared his full, remarkable journey to fatherhood for the first time in a new BBC documentary, Seahorse: The Dad Who Gave Birth, which airs tonight.The film documents his bid to become a parent - from his disbelief at his positive pregnancy test and his first pregnancy scan to his agonised groans during labour.It also records the psychological struggles he faced - such as a loss of identity as he developed a baby bump like millions of pregnant women and his trousers became too tight.What I feel like Im going through isnt me having a baby, or pregnancy, its like a much more fundamental, total loss of myself, he explains in the documentary.For Freddy, becoming a parent was a dream come true.Born a little girl, old family videos show him playing on a swing in a patterned dress with a bob haircut, and being told good girl as he totters across the grass as a toddler.Freddy, who lives in England, had always wanted to have children one day, but grew up feeling that he was a boy - something he eventually revealed to his mum, Esme Chilton.He was up at university at Edinburgh and hed been feeling quite unhappy, Esme recalls in Seahorse, directed by Game of Thrones filmmaker Jeanie Finlay.He just said, Im a boy and I want to be a boy... this is how Ive been feeling all my le.She adds: I did think, oh my God, that means I wont have grandchildren from Freddy.Freddy - who studied Arabic and once nearly joined the prestigious Sandhurst military academy - began taking testosterone injections aged  as he transitioned from female to male.These hormone injections are used to make transgender men more masculine, causing them to develop more body hair, facial hair, muscle and a deeper voice, and stopping their periods.Freddy also underwent top surgery to remove his breast tissue and reshape his chest - yet he chose not to have a hysterectomy because he hadnt ruled out having a child himself.Although Freddy had been warned testosterone would make him infertile, he still hoped he could carry his own baby. And aged , he stopped taking the hormone in a bid to conceive.Im now one month and three weeks off testosterone, he says in the documentary.And now I feel a little bit soft and almost like Im shrinking from inside.Freddys body effectively went into reverse after he halted his injections, meaning he had periods again, his facial hair got wispier and his hips broadened, thereports.I dont like it. Every time I think about it, its like what the f*** am I doing  he says in the film, before sobbing into the camera and admitting that he feels like a f***ing alien.I dont like the idea that Ive got f***ing tampons in my bag, he adds.Freddy felt that having his own child via articial insemination, using a sperm donor, was the simplest option for him as a both gay and transgender man.Not only women feel broody, explains the multimedia journalist, referring to his decision as the pragmatic thing to do. This is a physical process and I will be the dad.Mother Esme adds: I loved being pregnant.Everyone should experience it, shouldnt they  I think... especially men.Freddy, who started the process of trying to conceive in  and visited a fertility clinic, conceived his son on just his second round of insemination after his first attempt failed.He paid £ for the sperm, which he selected from a range of donors. In the film, he reacts with disbelief as he peers down at the positive Clearblue pregnancy test.What  Am I imagining that  he says, turning to his mum beside him.That looks like a positive result to me, darling, Esme replies.Freddy, who describes his heart as f***ing racing, is later filmed attending a pregnancy scan with his mother, where the pair listen to his childs heartbeat inside his womb.But while Freddys bump grew over following months, he was never recognised as a pregnant transgender man, with strangers assuming he simply had a beer belly.Yet after his pregnancy made the headlines, he was targeted by cruel trolls and even received death threats, with some claiming theres no such thing as a pregnant man.As a trans man to carry your own child is a scary, daunting prospect, Esme weeps in the film, wiping her eyes. You just worry for your child that you want them to be happy.By the time Freddy went into labour last year, he was ready to be on the other side of pregnancy.Filmmakers followed him to hospital, where he battled through contractions, clambered into a birthing pool, groaned loudly in pain and finally delivered his gorgeous boy.If men had to go through this all the time, youd just never hear the end of it, Freddy says.Yet despite being legally recognised as a man at the time of his sons birth, Freddy was not allowed to be listed as the father or parent on his birth certicate, only as the mother.He took the decision to Londons High Court earlier this year - where in July judge Sir Andrew McFarlane lted a previous reporting restriction banning his identication.If Freddy wins the case, his boy would be the first child in Britain to legally not have a mum.Today, Freddys fight to be formally registered as his childs dad continues - amid an increasing hostility towards transgender people in Britain and where.UK Government figures show that anti-trans hate crimes soared by nearly a third in just a year - from , in  to , in .Yet Freddy finds comfort in the beautul little boy whom he carried and delivered himself.I obviously feel a very strong bond with him, he says, cradling his tiny son. I just know that I want to be near him all the time. And I miss him... even when hes in bed at night.He adds: I think anyone has the potential to feel that way.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He annoyed people because he was clever, pompous and headstrong.”That description could be given today by many MPs, who have tired of Bercow’s constant attention-seeking and his delight in the sound of his own hammy voice.Just as aggravating has been his bias towards the anti-Conservative opposition. That was reflected yesterday in the Commons at news of his imminent resignation.In a nauseating display, Labour MPs who queued up to heap praise on him before they gave him a standing ovation.The Speaker should be a neutral referee who allows the game to flow freely and fairly.But, throughout his  years in charge of the chamber, Bercow was a whistle-happy, partisan official who acted as an additional player for his favoured side and continually put himself at the centre of the action.To understand Bercow, one incident is particularly illuminating. An early turning point in Bercow’s young le came when the head of his primary school refused to put him forward to grammar school, despite Bercow being so precocious he already read The Times .Instead he had to go to the local comprehensive, where he was bullied.On one occasion he was thrown in a pond as his chief tormentor said triumphantly, “Bercow is in there with the other amphibians.”But the experience fed Bercow’s determination to achieve, which he channelled into politics.To his army of left-wing supporters, he was a great reformer who modernised the practices of the Commons, expanded the role of backbenchers and held the Government rigorously to account.But to his enemies, he was squawking egomaniac who demeaned his office with his behaviour. His explicit cheerleading for left-wing causes and Remain was bad enough.This is a figure who subverted the rules of Parliament to wreck Brexit and undermine the Tory Government through endless procedural manoeuvres, as he has shown again this month.The notorious “B******s to Brexit” sticker on his family car, parked at Parliament, has reflected his attitude.His enthusiasm for the fashionable cause of ersity was highlighted in March  when, at a Westminster ceremony, he bizarrely described Elizabeth II as “a kaleidoscope Queen in a kaleidoscope country in a kaleidoscope Commonwealth.”In another typical move, he barred President Trump from addressing Parliament during his recent state visit, justying his stance on the grounds of Britain’s “opposition to racism and sexism.”Nor has he been helped by his eccentric conduct of his we Sally, who is almost as big an attention-seeker as he is.She worked in public relations and was a Labour campaigner when they married in , but it was his elevation to the Speaker’s chair in  that really gave her the opportunity to bask in the limelight.Having appeared on Celebrity Big Brother – and been the first contestant in her series to be evicted – she went on to take part in an reality show with Paddy Doherty, the CBB winner, bare-knuckle fighter and My Big Fat Gypsy Wedding star, with the pair taking it in turns to experience the other’s lestyle.She caused more embarrassment with other incidents, like the infamous stunt in  when she was photographed in the shadow of Big Ben wearing just a strategically placed sheet.After that, Bercow reportedly “read her the riot act.”Yet she caused him further humiliation when it was revealed in March  that she had indulged in a long, passionate affair with the Speaker’s cousin, Alan Bercow.Though she rebuilt her marriage, she admitted that she was “a terrible we and always had been.”Perhaps the darkest episode of all was when used social media to hint that the former Tory Treasurer Lord McAlpine was a paedophile, a baseless smear for which she ended up in court in , was convicted of libel and ordered to pay undisclosed damages. Despite his legal victory, Lord McAlpine died soon afterwards.Before his marriage to Sally, Bercow had few serious relationships.Conceited and awkward with women, he was described in his youth by one female contemporary as a “loudmouthed” and “not attractive young man.”A female journalist who went on a few dates with him recalled that he “was a very odd little man and socially quite gauche. He was restless and found it hard to relax.”His insecurities were fed by his stature and also his unusual background, which gave him the sense of being an outsider.Further friction is generated by Bercow’s manner, which combines self-importance with linguistic showing-off and flashes of rudeness.Part of this stems from small man syndrome.Standing just  feet six inches tall, Bercow tries to make up for his lack of stature by parading his authority.The former Tory Minister Sir Simon Burns memorably described Bercow as “a sanctimonious dwarf.”Several Tories were so exasperated with him that in  that they tried to throw him out of his job.The MP James Durridge, who organised this unsuccessful bid, said that Labour find Bercow “convenient because he is a more effective opposition than their own leader.”But since then Bercow’s pro-Remain antics have stretched Conservative tolerance beyond breaking point.That’s why the party decided to take the unprecedented step of standing a candidate against Bercow in his Buckingham constituency at the next election in defiance of the long-standing tradition that the Speaker is never opposed by any of the main parties.There have been repeated accusations that Bercow has bullied his staff, allegations he denies, just as he disputes the claim that he called Andrea Leadsom “a stupid woman.”Whatever the truth, he has not established a harmonious atmosphere at Westminster or enhanced his reputation.Unlike some of his predecessors like Bernard Weatherill and Betty Boothroyd, he leaves office under a cloud.Bercow was brilliant at tennis, even becoming a junior British champion. As a young player, he was described by a professional as “unbelievably talented and invincible.”To this day Bercow retains his deep enthusiasm for the sport and is a big fan of Roger Federer - particularlyhe can watch him for free.An investigation last year found he had received more than £, in freebies since he became speaker - most of which were tickets to tennis and football matches.Indeed, he was spotted at Wimbledon this year wearing a t-shirt with the Federer logo on it, while he was also caught by a BBC camera saying, “We all love you, Roger, all of us.”Im not sure the same can be said of Bercow.After a decade in the role of Speaker, he leaves behind a tainted legacy.He sees himself as a champion of Parliamentary democracy.

I regret it deeply.But ex-Tory leadership contender Rory Stewart, speaking at today’s launch, warned that a No Deal Brexit would ide the country just like Margaret Thatcher did.Meanwhile Tory MP Jeremy Lefroy revealed that Boris Johnson had himself said No Deal would be damaging.According to Mr Lefroy the PM told him and other Tory Remainers in a meeting in No last week: “I think a No Deal would be bad.”The ‘MPs for a Deal’ group said they were lobbying Mrs May to join their campaign and are confident she will join soon.The former PM agreed to vote for their amendment to last week’s Benn Bill last week, which called for her deal to be put to the Commons one final time."},{"url":null,"title":"john bercow parliament prorogation labour mps scuffle","story":"Chaos broke out in the Commons as doorkeepers were forced to stop back-bencher Lloyd Russell-Moyle from holding down John Bercow when he tried to leave the chamber.As the Brighton Kemptown MP was dragged away by Commons staff he tumbled into fellow protesting MPs with others scattering during the havoc.Labour MPs also screamed “shame on you” at the Tories and held homemade placards with “silenced” on them.One of the silenced signs was left in Mr Bercows chair after he had departed.Brits on social media were stunned by the chaos in the chamber and slammed Labour for kicking off the ugly protests.One Leave voter fumed: The whole lot of self serving, patronising morons need sacking.

He will stick around till October  for one reason: To help hammer the final nails in the coffin of Brexit and our democracy.Boris’s Government must stop him — as well as denying him the customary peerage he’ll assume is his.But Bercow caused uproar with Conservative Brexiteers after he tore up the Commons rulebook last week to allow fellow Europhiles to seize control of the agenda and pass a law to delay Brexit.In , he said he would only serve nine years as Speaker but has recently refused to step down.Jeremy Corbyn led the tributes as Labour MPs treated the Speaker to a standing ovation at the start of a long love-in.The Islington North MP described Bercow as superb and said democracy is stronger for your being the Speaker.But Tories were less generous and many of the partys front-bench remained seated during the applause.Michael Gove was one of the senior Tories to commend the Speaker – in the absence of Boris Johnson - aiming a dig at him for dragging his children into a Commons row last week.However, he added: Your love of democracy is transparent in everything you say and do.It also appears that Bercow has admirers in Brussels with EU chief Guy Verhofstadt even telling him to become an MEP.Verhofstadt, the European Parliaments chief Brexit co-ordinator, tweeted: “John #Bercow is a driven speaker and gted orator but above all the keeper of the great British parliamentary tradition.“I would lovewe could welcome him in the European Commission or European Parliament.”While Bercow was celebrated in the Commons today - he could face a future probe into serious bullying allegations made against him by former staff.The House of Commons backed a change of rules to allow historical claims of bullying and sexual harassment to be investigated.Former Commons Leader Andrea Leadsom said the move was vital to holding alleged bullies like Mr Bercow to account because current rules would allow the Speaker to get a plum seat in the House of Lords and “get away with it”.Currently only allegations that took place since the  General Election can be probed.Until now Mr Bercow has avoided a probe over claims he physically intimidated two of his former staff members.Mr Bercow denies claims he bullied staff."},{"url":null,"title":"did john bercow sprinkle drops of water in his eyes","story":"The Remainer Speaker choked up during his resignation speech in the Commons – but eagle-eyed reporters said not all his tears came from within.In footage captured in the chamber, Bercow appeared to dip his fingers in a glass of water before wiping his face.Writing in todays Times, Sun columnist Quentin Letts said: Not all the moisture came from within.At .pm, a few seconds before he made his personal statement to the House, he took his drinking glass, dipped two fingers in it and sprinkled water on his eyes.The crafty little coyote.The ’s Owen Bennett who spotted the bizarre scenes, also tweeted: “John Bercow just rubbed water on to his eyes…”The Speakers Office did not wish to give a comment when approached by Sun Online.Remainer Bercow – known for his eccentric outbursts in the Commons – also told the chamber he will resign as a Tory MPBoris Johnson gets a national poll.But while the Speaker was treated to a long drawn out goodbye  -  with MPs falling over themselves to pay tribute for more than an hour -

High streets are struggling, pubs and post offices are closing and jobs are going. Our proud towns were once the engine of British industry, but for decades they have been shamefully neglected as investment has gone into nearby cities. Decades ago young people flocked to towns to find work in mines, mills and factories, but as they shut the Thatcher Government did nothing to replace them and towns have fallen behind. The young have left their home towns in growing numbers, taking with them the cash that fuels high streets, pubs, clubs and cinemas. Families now live hundreds of miles from each other and loneliness is re.  Town football and rugby clubs are debt-ridden and in crisis, while historic buildings are boarded-up and falling apart. Austerity has turbo-charged the decline with record numbers of libraries and Sure Start centres closing as councils struggle with huge cuts. Our towns deserve better. That’s why I back the Mirror’s campaign to give them the power, money and attention they deserve. It should shock us that the Arts Council spends £ in Islington for every £ they spend in all the former coalfield communities in Britain. The Government has admitted more must be spent on transport, but while cities will benefit, people in towns will be left stranded.  From some parts of Wigan, it takes nearly as long to travel  miles to work in Birkenhead as it does to go  miles to London. We need fair funding for buses and trains, better broadband and wi-fi and investment in our young people, so businesses invest in towns again. Most of all we need power to decide how money is spent.

Current deputy Sir Lindsay Hoyle is the favourite while Labour grandee Harriet Harman is bidding to become only the second woman to hold the post. It comes after Mr Bercow - regularly accused of anti-Brexit bias but hailed as a hero of Parliament by his fans - finally announced he will bow out after  years. The Speaker wept as he announced he would quit on October  in a declaration watched by his we Sally. The timing of his resignation is no coincidence. It means the election to replace him is likely to come before a general election, allowing the current Parliament - not a new one - to choose his replacement.    That is important because it means a group of MPs who are against a hard, no-deal Brexit will be choosing the next person to oversee the legislature. So how will the election work and who is running  Heres everything you need to know. How does the election work   MPs would normally be expected to vote for a new Speaker on Monday  November - the first sitting day after John Bercow quits. Candidates must submit their nomination papers, signed by at least  MPs from at three parties, to Commons authorities between .am and .am on the day of the election. Names of all the approved candidates are then published at am before a snap hustings in the Commons chamber at .pm - consisting of a speech from each hopeful. MPs will then be given half an hour to vote for their favourite candidate on a ballot paper. If no single candidate wins more than % of the vote, the lowest-ranked candidateis eliminated and there is another round of voting. This continues until one candidate has won more than % of the total votes from MPs. A motion is then put to the Commons proposing the winner as Speaker. It can go to a vote again but by this point, they are likely to win. Traditionally the Speaker is dragged to the grand seat, supposedly against their will. Confirmed candidates Lindsay Hoyle Labour, Chorley, age . Odds:    The Lancashire-born businessman went to private Lordaposs College in Bolton and ran his own screen-printing firm before becoming an MP in . He has been a Deputy Speaker for nine years where his no-nonsense manner led to clashes with MPs - including telling off the SNP for singing EU anthem Ode to Joy in . In the same week he had a fierce clash with ex-SNP leader Alex Salmond, with the pair shouting at each other across the chamber over time slots given to Brexit scrutiny. Despite this Mr Hoyle is generally regarded as a popular figure who hasnapost made enemies in the same way as Bercow.There was an outpouring of tributes in  when his -year-old daughter Natalie was found dead. An inquest recorded an open verdict. Mr Hoyle was one of just three Labour MPs who did not declare their voting intention in the  EU referendum. His Lancashire district backed Brexit by % to %. Harriet Harman Labour, Camberwell  Peckham, age . Odds:     As Westminsteraposs longest-serving female MP, the QC is known as the Mother of the House with  yearsapos unbroken service. She spent more than two decades on the Labour front bench including as Deputy Labour Leader, Tony Blairaposs first Minister for Women and Leader of the House of Commons.  Born in London and educated at private St Paulaposs Girlsapos School, Ms Harman worked for the National Council for Civil Libertiesbefore becoming an MP in . Following a torrent of stories in the Daily Mail, she later said she regretted the NCCLaposs decision to grant affiliate status to a pro-paedophile group before she joined the staff. When she was elected barely  women had served in the Commons in its history. Her decades of activism for womenaposs rights led to mockery from right-wing pundits, including when she toured a pink bus round the country in . Her four-month stint as acting Labour leader, before Jeremy Corbyn took power, was marked by her decision not to oppose cruel Tory tax credit cuts that were later scrapped. Other controversies included being banned from driving in  after she was caught speeding at mph on the M. While in government she also tried to block the release of detailed Parliamentary expenses data. Due to her long experience and cross-party reputation, her name has been put forward as a possible caretaker Prime Ministerthe government loses a no confidence vote. Ms Harman was a prominent Remain-backer in  and though she has promised to be scrupulously neutral on Brexit, she has also warned she will be a champion for Parliamentelected. Her warning that she will take a robust stance could spark fears she will be a continuity John Bercow. Dame Eleanor Laing Conservative, Epping Forest, age . Odds:     The privately-educated solicitor from Paisley has spent six of her  years in Parliament as a Deputy Speaker, meaning she did not declare how she voted in the  EU referendum. She was a Special Advisor during the Thatcher and Major governments, and after her  election was an early Tory backer of equalising the age of consent at  for gay men. But she attracted controversy in  when she allegedly criticised a pregnant MP for leaving a debate to eat. She also voluntarily repaid £, during the  MPsapos expenses scandal over claims relating to a second home. Announcing her candidacy, she said the next Speaker should definitely be a woman as people need a breath of fresh air in Parliament. Meg Hillier Labour, Hackney South  Shoreditch, age . Odds:     The privately-schooled former journalist and councillor served on the London Assembly before her election in . As Gordon Brownaposs Identity Minister she was tasked with promoting the failed ID card scheme - but was left red-faced in  when forgetting her own ID card at a photoshoot. She later served as Shadow Energy Secretary under Ed Miliband before rising to prominence as the hard-bitten chair of the powerful Public Accounts Committee. Pro-EU Ms Hillier voted Remain in the  referendum, voted against triggering Article  in , and earlier this year said Parliament should seriously consider delaying or revoking Article  to cancel Brexit. Chris Bryant Labour, Rhondda, age . Odds:     The privately-schooled former Church of England vicar dabbled with Conservatism as a student, before leaving the priesthood in  when he realised other members of the church believed the Bible doesnapost really like gays. He moved to London and rose through the ranks of the capitalaposs Labour groups through the s before his election to Parliament in . He shot to prominence soon afterwards for his role exposing wrongdoing in the press, including extracting a confession by then-Sun editor Rebekah Wade in  that the paper had paid the police for information in the past. He has become an outspoken voice on skin cancer after discovering he had melanoma on a trip to the barber. The MP voted Remain in the  referendum and said the whole country should have a chance to hold a second referendum on Brexit. His opening offer to MPs marked him out from John Bercow, emphasising that he would stick to rules and fairness. Sir Edward Leigh Conservative, Gainsborough, age . Odds:  Not available  The privately-educated veteran MP since  has only an outside chance due to his tub-thumping backing for Brexit. He has highly conservative views on social issues including backing the anti-gay Section  and voting against civil partnerships. Briefly a junior minister under John Major, the MP has spent all but three of his  years in Parliament as a backbencher including on the trade, procedure and parliamentary restoration committees. Sir Henry Bellingham Conservative, North West Norfolk, age . Odds:  Not available  The Old Etonian Leave-backer was elected as an MP in  after a career as a barrister. He spent a decade on the Tory front bench but never rose to the rank of Cabinet or shadow cabinet. Announcing his bid, he said the Speaker must show respect to all MPs, admitting people might accuse me of being an establishment figure but adding: Iaposm not one of the inner core in the Speakeraposs office. Shailesh Vara Conservative, North West Cambridgeshire, age . Odds: Not available    The MP since  was born in Uganda and moved to Britain aged four, where he studied at a grammar school in Buckinghamshire. He worked as a solicitor in the City of London in Hong Kong before joining Parliament. He has been a minister for the thorny areas of legal aid and work and pensions - both slashed by the Tories - and later Northern Ireland.  Considering running Dame Rosie Winterton Labour, Doncaster Central, age . Odds:     The privately-educated MP began her career as John Prescottaposs assistant in the s before her election to Parliament in . She spent almost a decade on Labouraposs front bench under Tony Blair and Gordon Brown before becoming the partyaposs Chief Whip in . Her six years in the top job presided over a tumultuous time in the party when more than  Labour MPs voted no confidence in Jeremy Corbyn but he refused to quit. Before becoming a deputy speaker in , which bound her to rules of impartiality, Dame Rosie voted Remain in the EU referendum but said it was important to respect the nationaposs vote to leave - including in her Doncaster seat. As of September  it is understood she is still considering whether to run. Pete Wishart SNP, Perth  North Perthshire, age .

Iaposve had quite a few questions of this. Did I ever catch anyone in the mile high club  No, I didnapost. Honestly never, Lucy said. I mean there were a few occasions where two people come out of the toilet together, like it was a husband and we. There were a few of those but I donapost know what theyaposre doing in there, who knows right   They could have just been going to the toilet together but I never actually thought to myself theyaposre up to x, y and z in the toilet.  I never actually heard of any anyone catching anyone either so maybe it is a little bit of like a scandalised myth. Iaposm sure someone at some point has caught someone doing it on the plane but in my personal experience, no. Lucy was askedshe and her co-workers suffered from jet lag as a result of flying to far-flung destinations. Yes absolutely, all the time. I think any long-haul cabin crew member will experience jet lag - itaposs kind of unavoidable really,apos she said.  Lucy said the only bad experience she had with a customer was when they ran out of a particular snack on board. A lady got really funny with me once because I ran out of Pringles for her kids. I mean, I do not stock up the airplane so I have nothing to do with the fact that weaposre out of Pringles, nothing I can do, itaposs just the way it is,apos she said.

There are beds on the planes... Thereaposs a crew rest room where cabin crew go to sleep, they usually either upstairs or downstairs on the plane, she continued. As a cabin crew member, Lucy said they were required to look immaculate on board at all times and adhere to a strict dress code. Yes they do take that kind of thing very seriously,apos she said. Youaposre actually marked on each flight on your personal grooming soyou are meeting the grooming standards like is your lipstick red, your hair correct, are you wearing the unorm correctly     In regards to hair, Iaposd try to wear it like as a cabin crew does - so up in a bun and smart appearance. Lucy said she was given up to seven free flights a year as a perk of the job - but was still required to pay tax on them. They were only standby flights - meaning they werenapost definitely booked sothe flight was oversold or full, you wouldnapost get on,apos she said. aposSo they werenapost definite tickets which was kind of annoying because I like to plan everything. I donapost really like to be waiting around. I also didnapost get the chance to use any of it because I was so busy all the time. You donapost get to choose specic dates or anything like that, you kind of get what youaposre given when you first join so I didnapost even get a chance to use any of my free flights.

Today a jury heard four socially isolated girls in the Huddersfield area were treated as sexual commodities against their wishes by older men. Prosecutor Richard Wright QC told Leeds Crown Court there was a sense that those in authority did not do enough to engage with these girls and find out what was happening to them. The alleged abuse happened in West Yorkshire between  and . Mr Wright said: The girls targeted by those men were children and the men knew that and they did not care about it for a moment.  These men cared only for themselves and viewed these girls as objects to be used and abused at will. You will readily understand that these vulnerable youngsters, who were also socially isolated, very rapidly found themselves drawn into a world in which they had little or no control of their lives and were unable to make truly free or informed choices about anything they did with these men. Discussing the complainantsapos backgrounds, the prosecutor told jurors: What they plainly had in common was their young age, their social isolation, and the fact that each of them was in their own way extremely vulnerable so that they were easy targets for abuse. He added that the defendants, all from Huddersfield, had deliberately targeted the vulnerable children, bent them to their will, abused them and passed them around other men for sexual purposes, using threats and violence when necessary.  The prosecutor told jurors that, after being offered friendship, cigarettes, alcohol and drugs, some of the girls, who were aged between  and  at the time, were taken to parties and used as a commodity. The court heard how, prior to and during the alleged offences, the complainants had been deliberately avoiding home and people in positions of authority. Mr Wright said: There is here regrettably a sense that those in authority who handled the concerns of parents and friends expressed at the time of these offences did not do enough to engage with these girls and find out what was happening to them. The prosecutor said that one of these children had been intelligent and close to her mother prior to the abuse, but became immersed in a very dangerous lestyle when she moved schools and befriended a group of children who regularly truanted and associated with older Asian men.    Jurors were told that another of the four complainants had similarly been bright, but went off the rails. Mr Wright said that the girlaposs mother had desperately tried to stop her daughter from going out and had contacted police and social services, but was failed by their inaction. A -year-old man, who cannot be named for legal reasons, denies one count of rape and two of trafficking for sexual exploitation, while Iftikar Ali, , of Holly Road, Thornton Lodge, is charged with three counts of rape and one of attempted rape. Basharat Hussain, , of William Street, Crosland Moor, faces two rape charges, while Manzoor Akhtar, , of Blackmoorfoot Road, faces three counts of the same offence and one of trafficking for sexual exploitation.

I agree with school unorm, but I think they are just picking for pickingaposs sake to lord power over the kids, Theresa, from Shipdham, said.If they are going to be so picky maybe the school should start providing it because children are being punished for the way that their parents have interpreted the unorm policy - they have not gone out and bought it themselves.

Why chastise them for something so minimal and meaningless  I had a problem with her school skirt last year, because like many girls she is slim with long legs.

They had three further meetings at which point the victim told the defendant she was not interested. He told her he needed some time to accept her decision and that he needed to see her one last time. She agreed to this and they met on May . “On that occasion she again told him that she was not interested.

When Epstein pleaded guilty in  to soliciting a -year-old and procuring a minor for prostitution, was sentenced to  months, was said in court to have “deviant behaviour patterns” and banned from going near schools or playgrounds, Andrew remained his friend. When the pervert was freed in  and threw a get-out-of-jail party at his New York mansion, the Duke of York was happy to attend.    In  Andrew spent four days at Epstein’s New York mansion, where his judgment did not question the constant stream of young women who came and went. When his ex-we was in debt, he reportedly brokered a deal for Epstein – at that point a registered sex offender serving a further year of house arrest – to pay it off. After it was discovered by newspapers, Sarah Ferguson issued a public apology for her “gigantic error of judgment”. When pictures of Andrew with the convicted paedophile were published in early  and his position as a trade envoy became an international embarrassment, the prince snootily declared he had “evolved” beyond the job anyway. He said: “I have decided that the label I gave myself when I began this role... has served its purpose.”    And that was it. Until flight logs were published showing Virginia Roberts – the teen he emphatically denies sleeping with – had been trafficked by Epstein to London, the Bahamas and New York at times that Andrew was in the area. Until video emerged of him waving off a female visitor to Epstein’s townhouse. And then, he’s appalled only at the “recent” reports and “alleged” crimes.   A Palace spokesman added: “HRH deplores the exploitation of any human being.”He didn’t deplore Epstein’s confession of exploiting children.He wasn’t appalled enough to cut all ties with a man who had abused girls younger than the duke’s own daughters.  Beatrice and Eugenie are probably appalled to find that, in , they stayed at an Epstein property now known as ‘Paedophile Island’. The Queen is presumably appalled that a serial child abuser stayed at Balmoral, and Sandringham, and attended family birthday parties.    Andrew may be appalled that HE was exploited.And he might deplore the fact his august royal personage is being linked to a pervy ex-maths teacher who made a fortune and used it to destroy children’s lives. But the evidence points to him not being particularly appalled at Epstein’s crimes  at the time. As Mrs Merton might  ask, what stopped you  being appalled about the billionaire paedophile a bit sooner  "},{"url":null,"title":"struggling family take out loan","story":"NewsStruggling family take out loan so boy can have first ever birthday party aged EXCLUSIVE: Jayden Jeal had his first ever birthday party aged  - his parents are left with just £ a month after paying rent and billsShareCommentsByTalia Shadwell:,  SEP Updated:,  SEP Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news uk-news video struggling-parents-take-out-loan-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,hidePreviewImage:,info:,article:,info:,],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,hidePreviewImage:\"\"Get the biggest politics stories by emailSubscribe We will use your email address only for the purpose of sending you newsletters.

But they did all they could to throw Jayden his birthday party. “His friends get presents, decorations, balloons- my son’s never had them, said Mrs Jeal. He’s five - I didn’t have the heart to say you can’t have a party like your friends. “It’s worth it just to see his face, but we’re having to take a loan to do it.” Mrs Jeal is thrty and proudly mentions how she managed to make up kids’ party bags from the local discount store at a cost of around £. per child.  If that figure sounds oddly specic - it’s because the Jeals’ budget scrutinises every last penny. Mrs Jeal says her family has been penalised because her husband earns just £ over the minimum wage an hour in a job he’s worked at for six years as a medical supplies warehouse operator.  She says the family has lost access to benefits they desperately need because he brings home £ extra a week in his paypacket. Sheaposs now calling on the Government to end the cruel benefit caps freeze. She says: “It makes me really, really mad because we’re doing the best we can for our family.” The familyaposs financial situation even affects the food they eat.  When the family eats chicken as a treat, Mrs Jeal goes without so her husband and children have enough to eat.“I’m not a big meat eater or anything soI get something like a chicken I give it to my husband and my kids and I just make do with potatoes and gravy.” The mum says she is in poor health because of these sacrices - she struggles to lose weight - finding that healthy food like fruit and vegetables are the most expensive. Mrs Jeal says that Jayden had the benefit of a free nursery early childhood education when he turned two.However, his little sister Skye won’t qualy for the free  hours a week that could have enabled her to go back to work. Because her annual wage has risen by £ over two years in line with the recent national minimum wage rises, the family no longer qualy for the nursery place - they earn £ annually over the threshold. Mrs Jeal is desperate for her “bright, intelligent” toddler to get the same early education as her son- also pointing out it’s meant to help parents back to work.

End Child Poverty recently revealed that half of all children in Blackburn live in poverty. Exclusive data obtained by the Mirror for its Town  series also shows that it’s the fourth most deprived town in England. As well as having one of the worst child poverty rates in the country, Blackburn also has one of the lowest le-expectancy rates. The local council has seen its spending power decline by nearly a third since , losing out on tens of millions of pounds. And it appears to be the the Lancashire townaposs youngest residents whoaposve been hit hardest. We want to hear stories from your town. What do you think about it  Are you facing any issues  Email webnews@mirror or call   . ’s Talia Shadwell visited the town to see what effects this was having on the community. aposWeaposve gone backwardsapos  People living in Blackburn and the surrounding area are among the lowest paid in the country. They earn an average of £ per week - even before tax and living costs. Veteran councillor Maureen Bateson believes local families struggle so much because it is expensive to be poor.  She says an industry has sprung up around towns like Blackburn - from the credit shops, to private foster care agencies filling the gaps the austerity-hit council’s budget can’t cover - for three times the fees. The councillor says she meets a lot of families who appear to be stuck in a debt cycle - often on Universal Credit , and paying the hated Bedroom Tax. See how your area ranks for deprivation with the Mirroraposs exclusive interactive map    “It’s the gas, the electric, and everything  - because a lot of these families will be on prepaid meters so they’re on fuel cards. “Someone once defined poverty to me as the lack of choice in le. And I would say that certainly in my time as a councillor I think we’ve now begun to go backwards.” \u2028‘Some people havenapost eaten for three daysapos Neil Mistry and Debbie Miller run a soup kitchen whose volunteers feed up to  people a week. In winter, their volunteer vans drive around Blackburn every night, offering hot food and a brew. The pair say \u2028there has been a notable increase in the number of working families and women arriving at Community Spirit in desperate need of a bite to eat.  “Everybody knows that the cost of living is increasing - even working families are going to foodbanks and soup kitchens,” says Mistry.\u2028\u2028 On the evening the Mirror visits, people queue for nearly an hour before the doors open to tables stocked with food and drinks donated by the local community and businesses. “Some who come here haven’t eaten for two or three days and they demolish whatever we give them because they’re really, really hungry,” says Miller.  “Sometimes some of these people don’t hear their names from one week to the next and the first thing a lot of them will tell you is their name - because it doesn’t get used. They don’t hear their name because it’s a very lonely existence. “So the first thing some of them will say is ‘I’m Jim,’ and then the week after that you’ve got to remember ‘that’s Jim’ because you’ll be the first person from the week before that’s used their name.”  \u2028aposSome of our pupils donapost want to go home for their summer holidaysapos Blackburn Central High School is a picture of ersity with pupils speaking more than  languages between them - five times as many students who speak English as a second language than the national average. But nearly half the school’s pupils come from a disadvantaged background. It is one of many schools around Britain now forced to offer summer hunger programmes for kids who go home to bare cupboards. The school tries to help its most disadvantaged children with healthy food and education to prevent learning loss over the summer.  During the school terms, the most disadvantaged pupils use the same swipe card as teachers and their friends who are not on free school meals - so that no one can tell who is using the allowance. The school offers a free daily breakfast - but instead of inviting only their lower income pupils - which make up the majority of the school - they invite everyone including the teachers. Acting headteacher Shanaz Hussain says cash fundraised by the school community pays to feed around  people breakfast each day.\u2028\u2028  When students come into school and they haven’t had their breakfast they are going to find it dficult to concentrate and they aren’t going to be hydrated, they will lose focus in lessons. “Coming into school and having breakfast sets a really, really firm foundation to have a break from any stress they might have had - to be with their friends, to be with their peers, to be with their teachers and really have a break from whatever it is they are leaving at home.” \u2028Hussain admits it can be tough for teachers to say farewell to pupils at the end of term. For many young pupils school is a world away from their struggles at home.\u2028\u2028  “Even during the summer holidays I know I will find the very last day very dficult because I know a lot of our young people will go home very, very excited to spend time with their families. “We also have those young people who sadly will be very, very reluctant to leave the safe haven that they have in school.” aposNurses come to our foodbanks - what does that say about our society apos Gillian Beeley has been finding donations, food and clothing for Blackburn’s foodbanks and volunteer kitchens since the global financial crisis. \u2028She’s noticed the demand pick up again in recent years and is left seething with anger. “We’ve heard stories of nurses coming to the foodbank. What does that say about our society   \u2028“Across Lancashire, there are people coming into foodbanks that you wouldn’t necessarily expect to be seeing.

For the past two weeks the tropical cyclone has been wreaking destruction in the north western Bahamas, causing fatalities, untold damage and making , people homeless. Until today, the tail end of Dorian has brought strong winds and rain to the north, with the remnants of Tropical Storm Gabrielle delivering buffeting conditions from further up the US.The two weather system will now combine forces to suck hot air north. The Met Office predicts the twin tempests will bring tropical air towards the UK, allowing temperatures to rise from highs of C recorded earlier in the week to C tomorrow.   By Sunday the mercury will hit C, with the Weather Outlook predicting things will reach a positively balmy C. Met Office forecaster Marco Petagna said: “It turns warmer and humid as the remnants of Dorian and Gabrielle feed tropical air to the UK. “It turns warmer still at the weekend and early next week with high pressure, with C possible in the South.”    The warm weather will last until at least the middle of next week. The Weather Outlook forecaster Brian Gaze said: “Sunny weather is forecast to see highs up to C. “High pressure is expected to bring a southerly feed. Most places across the country are due dry skies and long spells of sunshine from Friday. Temperatures are expected to peak on Sunday and Monday. The good weather is not likely to blow over too soon.

He’s worked really hard and he’s a very good young goalkeeper.“Hopefully, he learns from that. I saw the tackle back and I don’t know, it was a hard one to call.“The referees deal with their side of things but I look after our side of things as a manager and I’m not making any excuses. I need to look at what our team did wrong and, as a group, sit down and dig deep.“I thought we had done it last week but we’ll have to dig a lot deeper now to find out what’s going on. That was really, really poor in the second half.“It doesn’t matter who you play against, that second half was nowhere near acceptable for a club this size.”McPake named an experienced starting XI with Paul McGowan and Josh Meekings ing to the side along with Ferrie and Sean Mackie.The manager said: “It was a very strong team and one that,they were right and did things properly, they should have won the game of football.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/08/5d654f01808b53.92042964.jpg ","title":"dundee united expected to make changes to starting line up against arbroath","story":"Dundee United will make changes from their triumphant derby line-up for tomorrow’s Tunnock’s Caramel Wafer Challenge Cup clash with Arbroath at Tannadice.However, there will still be plenty experience in the Tangerines’ line-up and the mission will be the unchanged from recent league outings – to come away with a victory.In the past couple of seasons United have used this competition to give many of their youth squad experience of top-team action.While, however, several of their usual league starters will be given a day off tomorrow, the selection for this third-round tie will come from the first-team squad.That means the likes of back-up goalie Deniz Mehmet and attacker Cammy Smith, who’ve spent most of their time on the bench during the first month-and-a-half of the season, are expecting to be handed starting places.“There are a few bumps and bruises from last Friday night so we will be cautious on that,” said assistant boss Gordon Forrest.“As it gets later in the week, we’re getting a clearer picture over possible changes but we will go into the game focused.”The management team are also well aware this is a chance to keep fringe players match fit and reward some of them who’ve been working hard in training despite being out of the team right now.“We have a large squad that we want to try to look at. We want to keep pushing people forward to provide competition,” added Forrest.“Guys who haven’t been playing have been fantastic when they come off the bench.“Nicky Clark has been starting but came off the bench last week and was excellent while Cammy Smith came on, scored and had another chance. Ian Harkes also came on and performed, so it is great.“They have to keep that hunger and desire, those levels up. They have been working really hard and deserve to play but it has been dficult because the other lads have been performing to a high level.“We need players pushing each other and we need the competition for places.

That’s disappointing.“We have been working on them as a team but in both the first phase and second phase of set-plays we got it wrong and we couldn’t deal with it.“Against Inverness earlier in the season we did really well against a really high number of set-plays over the two games against them.“So I didn’t see it coming but it’s happened and we will be better at it.“We work on that every week, it’s built into our training.

We do at the moment have a dentist and fully qualied staff and are happy with their work.Rumour has it that the aforementioned dentist and staff will be taking on patients from Mid Argyll Hospital, which I presume they tend to already.But the practice is to lose its local NHS patients, so they will deal solely with patients who require dental treatment from the hospital. I think this situation leaves the NHS patients in limbo.I am sure we would rather that the current dentist and all of her staff be given a chance to voice their opinions on this matter as much and as well as the local populace.Yes, it will be brilliant to have both dentists in the town. There is the possibility that those on the local list who are currently treated well by the dental department at the hospital maybe still seen by the dentist and her staff, but I would like this to be confirmed by the local NHS trust.Brian MacDonald, CrinanSir,Hundreds of people across Scotland have been helped through their exam results by a local group of Skills Development Scotlandcareers advisers.Based across the north of Scotland, the advisers were part of a team taking calls at the SDS Exam Results Helpline from am on results day.The helpline is a vital service, supporting young people and their families at what can be one of the most stressful times of their lives.Expert advice and guidance is available all year round, not just on results day.Our professionally qualied careers advisers are working in every state secondary school in Scotland and from our network of high street centres across the country.In schools, careers services are delivered one-to-one, in classrooms and at school events across all year groups, supporting young people to develop the skills to make informed career decisions throughout their lives.

It was fantastic to speak to so many of my constituents.It was also wonderful to see many local business stalls promoting Islay#s dynamic and booming economy.The show was well attended with lots of families, both local and visitors, having a fun day out and luckily the sun was shining most of the day.A huge thanks to all the organisers and everyone  who contributed to the event.Councillor Alastair RedmanSir,I have real concerns about the deteriorating condition of some Argyll cemeteries.Constituents from Islay recently joined Councillor Alastair Redman in highlighting the poor upkeep of cemeteries in the area he represents.Councillor Redman reported that there were also problems at other cemeteries in his ward, including the cemetery at Carradale in East Kintyre.I understand that Argyll and Bute Council confirmed that they now, at last, have plans in place to address the problems at Kilnaughton.It remains disappointing, however, that things are allowed to deteriorate to the extent that the maintenance of cemeteries has become a matter of public concern.Frankly, it is very surprising that a cemetery where interments are actually still taking place has been undermined in this way and there must surely be an obligation to ensure this doesn’t happen.My experience is that communities in the Highlands and Islands pay special regard to the final resting places of fellow members of their communities and will be perplexed to discover that they appear to be uncared-for.Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands MSP"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures august 16 2019","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowTayvallich reader Colin MacInnes captured this photo of these two fluffy cygnets at the Corran Burn in Lochgilphead back in July.A couple of adult swans were spotted floating nearby at the time on Loch Fyne and Loch Gilp around Ardrishaig."},{"url":null,"title":"red star take derby spoils","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsRed Star welcomed local rivals Tarbert to the joint campus, and it was the Lochgilphead side who maintained their place at the top of the group thanks to a Stuart MacLean goal early in the second half.The first half of the game on Saturday August  began at a typically fast pace as you might expect from a derby clash-  but both sides were limited to efforts from long range which goalkeepers John Martin and Ally Lewis dealt with relative ease.The home side started to enjoy more possession as the first half progressed but were finding the well-organised Tarbert defence dficult to breach and were limited to efforts from distance which failed to trouble Martin in the Dookers goal.Star came out quicker at the start of the second half and looked to play at a much higher tempo. The deadline was broken on  minutes when Lee MacLean broke from midfield and managed to beat the offside trap, his cross from the left channel was met by the in-form Stuart MacLean whose shot beat Martin to give Star the lead.Tarbert looked to commit bodies forward in a bid to get back into the game which made for a more open contest, however the Star defence of Coll McCallum, Ricky Reid and Kyle Selfridge coped well throughout.Red Star should have made the closing stages a lot more comfortable for themselves with Gregor Peacock going close with a couple of opportunities and Aaron Moore having a shot well blocked but in the end Stuart MacLean’s goal was enough for a hard-fought but deserved win.On Saturday August  Star welcome Dunoon to the joint campus for their final game of the group stage, where a victory for the Lochgilphead side will see them progress to the quarter-finals.The kick-off time will be announced on the club’s social media pages during the week."},{"url":null,"title":"get dancing get fit and have fun","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowBack in April, the Mid Argyll branch of the Royal Scottish Country Dance Society held a ‘Bring a Friend’ evening.The result was a super evening of dancing and laughter, not to mention some delicious home baking at half time, and the branch was delighted at the number of people who came along.Now the dancing season is starting again after the summer break and the members are hoping to welcome those friends – and others – to their regular Monday evening classes.Scottish Country Dancing is a really great way to stay physically and mentally fit while having a lot of fun and listening to some lovely music at the same time.

These songs were associated with the Tlell River on Hai Gwaii in Canada. These tracks, with a selection of later collaborations, make up River to Sea from Tlell to Tiree. The title documents Sheila#s journey from the coast of Canada to Tiree, where the track All You Really Need is the Sea was written.This artist is probably best described as a folk blues singer. She has the sharply observing, descriptive eye of the classic singer songwriter troubadour and while her voice is given gravitas and character by time, she swings and has the timing of the blues singer.Wild Biscuit#s musical accompaniment gives Sheila#s characterful voice depth and presence. The menacing guitar on I#ve Waited a Long Time and the atmospheric double bass and keyboards on Where the Pebbles Grind and Scrape complement Cameron#s lyrics and singing.Remembering Mr Toast is an atmospheric and evocative, less bombastic or overblown Scottish Jim Morrison, finding real beauty in a melancholic memory. The delicate hesitant guitar and reflective lyrics continue on Don#t Sigh and Go on Then, beautul, bitter sweet country love songs. All You Really Need is the Sea and Deep and Real are spiritual songs, again moving between an intimate relationship to consider the huge landscape and the restorative natural world.Is it blues, country, easy listening, folk or poetry set to delicate sympathetic music  It doesn#t matter. Close your eyes, listen to Sheila#s rich voice, with its cadence and rhythm. Enjoy the flow of words and the pictures they conjure on this warm and captivating set of recordings."},{"url":null,"title":"macalister wins tarbert golf championship","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe delayed fourth and final round of the Tarbert Golf Club championship took place at Glenralloch on Saturday August  in glorious conditions.The greens were freshly cut with captain Smyth choosing some interesting pin positions to test the players# skills.Iain Macalister held a one shot lead over Bruce MacNab and a five shot lead over John MacNab heading into the final round.If there were any nerves at the start of play this was not evident as Iain started with four fours then followed that with an excellent -foot birdie putt at the fth and a chip-in birdie at the sixth.

Now I am not saying this is the simplest or even healthiest of activities. All this crouching, hand staining, pricked fingers and even eye strain.Often when you reach for a large black juicy berry it seems to disappear. It’s like the behaviour of politicians. They offer so much but when you reach for it # it disappears. Do you remember the Scottish government passed a law guaranteeing one would be seen by an appropriate health specialist within a stated limited time  The SNP government daily breaks this law – be it on cancer, accident and emergencies, or mental health.Or what about the promises made to the people of Arran and the Outer Hebrides on improved ferry services. The Scottish government is responsible for Caledonian Maritime Assets, CMal, which own and manage ferries. MV Glen Sannox was intended to commence service to Arran in  but lies incomplete for all to see in the Ferguson Marine yard in Port Glasgow. Part of the delay is because of disagreement over the fixed-price design and build contract for the two vessels.The SNP seems obsessed with this type of contract which has adversely affected schools, colleges and community centres. Worse still, while the SNP ridiculed previous government public private partnerships they have introduced a system clearly no better. What about the £. million each month we the taxpayers have to pay for the unopened Edinburgh sick children’s hospital  Jeanne Freeman, the SNP Cabinet Secretary for Health and Social Care, stepped in so late that she does not know whether this much-needed hospital will ever open.The second part of the bramble experience is the delicious mouthwatering bramble crumble.

That is roughly the equivalent of only being able to have a small cup of tea and one can of soft drink per day. In addition, they may have to limit the potassium and phosphate in their diet which means missing out on enjoying foods like chocolate, bananas and tomatoes.We want to make the kidney diet about all the things patients can eat and bring enjoyment back into food # which is why we have launched the Kidney Kitchen.We hope that the Kidney Kitchen will mean everyone living with kidney disease in Scotland can enjoy healthy and delicious food with their family and friends.If you are, oryou know a kidney patient, check out www.kidneykitchen.orgEwen Maclean, advocacy officer Scotland, Kidney Care UKSir,The death of a pet cat can come as a shock, and many owners can find it dficult to come to terms with their loss.The death of a pet is not always seen as a signicant loss, leading some people to hide their feelings which can cause them to feel very alone.On Grief Awareness Day, August , Cats Protection is highlighting its free and confidential Paws to Listen support service, so people facing the loss of a cat do not have to feel alone.The service is available on   .

She would think nothing of taking home patientsrsquo pot plants to look afterthey were going on holiday, and once arrived back at Lindean with a pair of dachshunds for the same reason.Born in Troon, Ayrshire, on November , , Helen was the daughter of John and Helen Baxter. At that time her father was employed as an English teacher at Marr College, later transferring to the village school of Scotlandwell in Perth  Kinross.The family moved to the Borders when Mr Baxter took up the post of schoolmaster at Bowden School, eventually rising to become Director of Education for Roxburghshire County Council.The family set up home at Lindean, with Helenrsquos brother Sandy later taking over the running of Lindean Farm. Both siblings attended Lindean School, before moving to Selkirk High School.Helen undertook her basic nursing training at Edinburghrsquos Dean College, then studied for her midwery qualication at Bellshill Maternity Hospital, Glasgow. From there she headed to Jersey to serve as a midwe on the island, before ing to the Borders in the early s.In November, , she married Harry Russell, who earlier that year had been appointed Selkirkrsquos Royal Burgh Standard Bearer. The couple made their home in Lindean, with daughters Judith and Claire arriving in  and .Helen continued her nursing career at Galashiels Cottage Hospital and Peel Hospital, before taking on the joint role of district nurse  midwe for Selkirk and the Valleys, firstly based in the Nursersquos Cottage at Ettrickbridge, and then at Selkirk Health Centre.On call night and day, Helen Russellrsquos passion for the job - and her patients - knew no bounds.

She also enjoyed sewing, knitting, embroidery and crocheting, last year completing a dozen poppies for the lsquoSelkirk Remembersrsquo armistice cascade at Selkirk Parish Church.Dr John Wilson, who worked as a GP at Selkirk Health Centre, remembers Helen Russell with particular affection. ldquoThe whole team at Selkirk were absolutely fantastic, he said, ldquoand the support and help Helen gave me in my early days in the town was wonderful.ldquoShe and her fellow district nurses had a lot of responsibility, and it was a great eye-opener for me to see just how professionally and selflessly they carried out all their ied duties.

Not only are volunteers providing fresh food for locals, they are also regenerating unused spaces, transforming them into lush green patches for all to feast upon. When filming wrapped, reporter Hilary Scott caught up with community gardeners Adam Skelton and Shirley Spence, to ask them how their gardens grow.THE High Street is the heart of the bustling town of Peebles.A derelict bit of land behind the former court building has been transformed into a tranquil greenspace and is now the Courthouse Community Garden.Adam Skelton told the Peeblesshire News: ldquoDuring the filming we discussed Borders Food Community Facebook Group which is a popular place for people to share food, plants, seeds, tools, and materials, as well as advice and information related to food growing, preparing, cooking and storing.ldquoAnyone can join the group free and there you can connect with lots of knowledgeable and very helpful grower, composters, cooks, preservers, picklers. The list goes on.ldquoWe also discussed land sharing. Various group members have allowed us to share their land and create group food gardens.And the Courthouse Community Garden is one of those havens.ldquoIt was an unused overgrown patch of land and we have converted it into a very productive little garden, explained Adam.ldquoThere is no contract or rent and we have not received any funding.The creation of this garden is down to the hard work of green-fingered volunteers and waste products, which Adam says is a ldquowin-win for all involved.He added: ldquoThe land owners get their land tended and access to free fresh food on their doorstep and we get to grow as we wish in this lovely space.Despite the success of Borders Food Community, Adam says he finds it odd that the vast majority of people are not eating truly local food when there are so many benefits.ldquoFor example therersquos the environment. There is no packaging or food miles, itrsquos so much tastier when fresh and all the nutrients intact and its better for local economy.Adam is very passionate about the work of community gardens and is encouraging locals to join Borders Food Community Facebook Group where they can discover their nearest community garden and get involved.The ITV crew headed to Innerleithen in the afternoon to discover a garden maintained by little and large green-fingers.Volunteers from community gardens across the Borders gathered at the Edible Garden along with St Ronanrsquos Primary School pupils.ldquoEveryone who wanted to got the chance to say a few words. It was great to have people from all the community gardens together in one place discussing more ways to collaborate together to further promote local food growing across the Borders, said Adam.The Edible Garden team were delighted to host the ITV Border Le crew.Shirley Spence said: ldquoWe enjoyed meeting the dferent groups of community growers and making new contacts. We were pleased with the comments and feedback about our garden and learning about other community gardens and their work in the Borders.And the children from St Ronanrsquos Primary School also enjoyed their moment in front of the cameras. ldquoThey were talking about what they liked to plant and grow and how gardening has encouraged them to try and eat dferent vegetables and fruits, explained Shirley.ldquoWe hope there will be many more initiatives for community growing starting up in other Border towns and villages.It might be a wrap for the film crew, but these community horticulturists continue to work hard growing fresh fruit and vegetables in their tasty gardens throughout the year.ITV will be airing the show later this month, and being involved in the creation of a community garden which is fresh, free and enhances the environment is a worthy  minutes claim to fame."},{"url":null,"title":"andy-set-toast-peebles-highland-games","story":"FORMER athletics coach

the proposed changes to the th century building has triggered the move at Holyrood.Over the coming months a reporter, who has yet to be appointed, will collate evidence and carry out a site visit.The -bedroom hotel closed in  after owners Roy and Lorna Curry had failed to make the business profitable.Plans were submitted by Rikeja Ltd with the local authority the following year for an extension to be added and  apartments to be created.A spokesman said: \"The proposal to alter, extend and convert the hotel to form  apartments represents an appropriate use for the building restoring it to its

manner which not only preserves but also enhances the character and appearance of the building as one of special architectural character and appearance.\"The impacts associated with the proposed use of the property for residential purposes will also be signicantly less that those associated with its established use.\"Venlaw Castle was built on the site of Smithfield Castle in  by the Sherf Deputy

additional floor and also a baronial wing to the property.The castle was used as a Red Cross Hospital during World War I.And eventually, just after the Second World War, it was converted into an upmarket hotel.But a downturn in trade and several takeovers later the doors closed in December, .The plans for apartments, which were submitted the following year, won support from Scottish Borders Council at their planning meeting in March.Planning officer Ranald Dods said: \"The proposal as submitted is, on balance, not considered to be sufficiently detrimental to the character of the listed building to warrant a recommendation of refusal.\"The proposals contained in the planning application are considered acceptable.\"But continued concerns from Historic Environmental Scotland over the proposed changes to the listed building has led to the governments Planning and Environmental Appeals Division calling the application in.A decision is likely to be made during the

Street, Selkirk which is open until Friday, September th.\"It brings a smile to everyones face,\" says Stormers committee member Daphne.Organiser Kay Ross said the idea for the very first Selkirk

And luckily enough for any visitors, this isnt the only event in Selkirk this week. The Walking Festival is back in Selkirk again and the two events have come together to make a great community experience.Sue Briggs from the Walking Festival says both benefit from each other: \"Having the two adds a new dimension to the events. Walkers arrive and see theres more on in town than they expected. Same way weve had people come from the Stormers askingwe have any free spaces on walks. Were glad that the two events can help support the town and local businesses.\"The festival will cast off with a Mad Hatters Tea Party and auction on Saturday, September th. The auction will be run by none other than BBC Bargain Hunts Anita Manning, who is sure to get the bids rolling in.Leading up to the event, organisers held their own competition to decide  lucky hats out of  to be showcased at the auction. Some entries even arrived from as far away as Canada, America and the Isle of Wight. But those who didnt make the top  havent been left out. You can buy any number of crocheted and knitted items from the Border Bunnets pop-up shop at  Tower Street, Selkirk .And, all of this is for a good cause as proceeds from the festival will go to Alzheimer Scotland. Kay explained: \"Its an illness, and its become something a tremendous number of people deal with. Our thinking was, hats go on your head. Your memory is in your head. Simple as that.\"And with a chuckle, Daphne added: \"Also, were a lot older!\"We do have older members too and a few ladies living with Alzheimers.\"Over  tickets have been sold for Saturdays tea party, theres even a growing waiting list for extra spaces.But you dont have to be at the auction to be a winner. If you stop by the Tower Street shop you can make a silent bid on any of the  hats you want and you might just be the lucky one to take home a truly unique piece.,params: .pushKay told us:\"Being realistic, hats adults wear now are traditional, plain beanies. I think hats could be a more fashionable statement to other people.\"The Hatfest has opened up many channels of collaboration within the community. Students at Selkirk High School designed and created some of the trophies for the top  and overall winning hats, members of the Community Shed provided wooden supports for the decorated traffic cones around the town. And sweetest of all, pupils from local schools have designed mini cones with small hats which will later be donated to Innocent Smoothies Age UK fundraiser.Your last chance to make a bid on a hat is

Ryan McConnachie opted to go straight down the middle and evaded the e of the Dunoon keeper.There was a moment of worry at the other end, though, when goalscorer Souden also committed a handball in the Pupils’ box, and referee Peter Laing pointed to the spot. Dunoon halved the Pupils’ advantage, making it -.Then, just  seconds later, the Pupils restored their two-goal lead through Donald McCallum, who met left-sided substitute Kenny Kerr’s low cross to squeeze a shot between the Dunoon defenders and the frame of the goal.Soon after, the Pupils made it -, when Kerr guided another delightful cross onto the head of John McCallum, who guided an effort past the keeper from six yards, but it was the goal creator Kerr who was rightly mobbed by his team-mates.Not content with four, the Feathers-sponsored Pupils scored again, with # stand by # Kerr making it three assists in one match.Played in by McConnachie after some strong play in midfield by fellow substitute Michael McKinlay, Kerr set up young winger Ross Brown, who gladly tucked home goal number five with a close-range finish.With the match drawing to a close, McConnachie sealed his brace # and the Pupils’ sixth goal # with an excellent inidual effort, surging past a defender before rounding the hosts’ keeper and slotting the ball low into an unguarded net, adding gloss to an already emphatic cup win.After a great team performance, the Pupils will be hoping for more of the same tomorrowwhen they welcome a Tarbert side # who last week also defeated Dunoon # in a Kintyre derby.The match is scheduled for a pm kick off at Kintyre Park."},{"url":null,"title":"third round of tarberts golf championship","story":"Former champion Bruce MacNab held a four-shot lead going into the third round but a horror start saw the lead wiped out at the very first hole when Iain Macalister birdied and Bruce had a seven.Iain went on to birdie the second hole as well and despite the windy conditions was very much in control of his game over the first nine holes to be out in .John MacNab was also playing his normal steady game also ing , enjoying birdies at the st and th holes.After nine holes Iain had turned a four-shot deficit into a four-shot lead over Bruce and six ahead of John.Over the next four holes both Iain and John dropped four shots allowing Bruce some breathing space to claw back some of the deficit.When play was complete and all scores checked the totals after round three were as follows: Iain Macalister , Bruce MacNab , John MacNab .In the John Reid Quaich the silverware again headed south to Largieside with Duncan Johnstone retaining the trophy, shooting  nett over the two rounds.

Work is expected to start at the end of the month and should be completed by the send of September.Councillor Frank T. Spears stated that the work would not involve any long-term closure of the main roadway.The #dry bridge#, owned by Lord Margadale, has been the subject of much discussion and minor rows for the past several months. Since Western Ferries Ltd. began their sea service, heavy articulated lorries carrying malt and grain to the island#s distilleries have been unable to go under the bridge. Matters came to a head three months ago when Argyll County Council re-imposed a weight limit on the Glen road # the ersion used by the transporters to avoid the bridge.The bridge owners came quickly to the rescue and allowed the heavy traffic to use their private road at Bridgend for a three-week period, but following local protests and legal consultations the transporters were again allowed to use the Glen road.Leboat saves three on rocksThe crew of a lobster fishing boat were marooned on a partially-submerged rock for more than two hours when their vessel foundered off the north-east coast of Islay on Thursday morning.The ft #May#, owned and skippered by -year-old Mr Lachlan Clark of Port Charlotte # the veteran of several sea-dramas # struck the rocks while they were lting lobster creels.The Islay leboat was called out to rescue the skipper and his crew # Alastair MacDonald, a -year-old fisherman, and Norman Gardiner, a -year-old Colonsay doctor#s son who was making his first trip and deputising for a sick crew member.Following the rescue, the crew # who were unhurt # were landed at Port Askaig.ONE-HUNDRED YEARS AGONational Health Insurance ActA number of contraventions of the National Health Insurance Act were the subject of prosecutions in Campbeltown Sherf Court on Thursday # Sherf MacMaster Campbell on the bench.The first case was that of a Clachan merchant who was charged with neglecting to stamp the card of a female servant.Mr M. Dick, solicitor, who appeared for accused, tendered a plea of guilty, and said the observations he was about to make would apply equally to all the cases subsequently to be heard. These were the first prosecutions of the kind in this court. The Act, as his Lordship knew, was a most voluminous and complicated measure.The sherf observed that some excellent and very lucid summaries had been circulated.Mr Dick, proceeding, asked his Lordship to examine the contribution card. He would find that the part which was the very kernel of the offence was embodied in the middle of Art.  in very inconspicuous type. The employer was there required to stamp the card #not later than the time at which wages are paid# but to read that one required to hold the card at about  degrees.The sherf askedhe was to understand that this was the first occasion on which a domestic servant had been employed by accused  If not, he must have been trained in the use of this wonderful document years ago.Mr Dick said his Lordship must consider this, that in cases of this kind there were two standards of clearness. What was clear to the judicial mind might be very far from clear to the lay mind.It was a matter of common knowledge that there was a very general belief in this part of the country thatinsurance cards were stamped at the time they were run out the Act would be complied with.The card, of course, bore that the stamps must be affixed #not later than the time wages are paid#. He asked his Lordship to consider the phraseology. These cards came into the hands of many rustic employers of labour. Why should it not be stated in bold characters on the card that the stamps must be affixed at the time wages are paid In the country wages were paid sometimes by the half-year, sometimes by the month, and sometimes at irregular periods suitable to the circumstances of the worker.The cards represented not the half-year of the feeing terms, but the calendar half-year. All these circumstances contributed to the confusion of the lay mind, and encouraged the widespread impression thatthe cards were stamped at the end of the period the duty of a citizen was thereby fulfilled."},{"url":null,"title":"leader august 23 2019","story":"The Courier is honoured to deliver news to the community # during the good times and the bad.This week we were delighted to share the news that Campbeltown now boasts the #whisky bar of the year#, according to judges at the Scottish Bar and Pub Awards , who bestowed the title to the Ardshiel Hotel.Since buying the hotel more than a decade ago, Flora Grant and Marion MacKinnon have more than tripled the number of whiskies on offer, turning the hotel into something of a tourist attraction in itself.However, we also revealed that nine jobs have been lost at Campbeltown Creamery.While it is still hoped that a take-over by local farmers is the future for the site, it is terrible for the iniduals who have lost their jobs, some after many, many years.We know there is a market for Campbeltown cheese, and while the number of farms supplying the creamery has fallen over the years, there are still almost .Here#s hoping the future is bright for both Campbeltown#s whiskies and cheeses."},{"url":null,"title":"fun in the sun at first mokfest","story":"India enjoyed herself at this year#s Up The Close event, which included children#s entertainer Funky Chicken and ious fair attractions, and was made all the better by the glorious sunshine.India was joined by her mum Lynsey Mcshannon, who was able to get into the spirit of things this year having been heavily pregnant last year, and her dad Gary Anderson.This year#s Up The Close was a particular hit, with the welcome , after nearly a decade, of indie rockers a new hope "},{"url":null,"title":"more music in store for the wee toon","story":"On Wednesday, September  at .pm, well-known folksinger, entertainer and broadcaster Alastair McDonald will be in concert in Campbeltown Free Church.This will not be Alastair’s first visit to the Wee Toon.

Last weekend, we were fortunate to be invited to an orchard in East Lothian to pick some apples.As we entered Lewis stopped for a moment and said ldquoWow.He has seen apples growing on trees before, but I think it was the sight of so many apple trees together all in fruit. It was a visual feast, even for me.And so we picked some apples, in the company of a friend who uses local fruits to make juices. Lewis just couldnrsquot decide which apple tree to pick from first. He wandered about in awe, eyeing the apples.There were many ieties in the orchard, but I sadly canrsquot remember all their names.ldquoI think Lewis is in paradise, I remarked as I watched him.ldquoWhatrsquos paradise  asked my nearly six-year-old inquisitive daughter Skye. I had to think about my answer.ldquoSome people say itrsquos a perfect place, but other people say itrsquos a perfect feeling.ldquoCan be both then, maybe at the same time Skye replied.I smiled and agreed. We both watched Lewis, as he wondered under the small trees, dancing with delight at the sight of so many delicious looking ripe apples.ldquoYea said Skye, ldquoLewis is definitely having paradykes.ldquoWe say in paradise I said, in a bit of a teachery tone.ldquoBut you can have it too insisted Skye ldquobecause itrsquos a happy feeling.How could I disagree  ldquoYoursquore right I smiled.ldquoThis one Lewis called out. The apple was just out of reach and so his sister ran up and carefully picked it for him, in the way she had been shown. Lewis studied the apple before eating, savouring the moment.He was indeed both in, and having, paradise.We collected a small basket full of apples of dferent ieties, and after giving our thanks we started our walk back to the car. As we meandered along the path Skye asked for a story about an apple.So I told the story of Johnny Appleseed. Then a riddle ldquoA wee roond hoose, sometimes red, sometimes green, the maist bent lum ye hae ersquoer seen. Nae windaes or doors tae open or slide, it has a secret, therersquos a star inside.The answer of course is an apple. The bent lumbeing the stalk, and the star being the seed core when the apple is cut horizontally through the middle.As we walked, I reflected on the symbolism of the apple, and how it has been used in folklore and legend. And of course there is the famous apple which fell on Newtonrsquos head.Well it probably didnrsquot really fall on his head, as that seems a later embellishment, but for sure Newton himself often told the tale of the falling apple and the inspiration it gave him. He lived well into old age, and I think he understood the power of a story to convey the meaning of an event or idea.We approached our car and I took my sonrsquos hand to keep him safe as we crossed the road.ldquoDad he said looking up at me, ldquoyou are my walking apple.I laughed at the image and wondered what he meant. Was he referring to my rotund body shape perhaps ldquoWhy am I your walking apple  I asked him.ldquoCause I love apples and you are walking with me he said, with a sense of poetic meaning only a young child can convey.I was momentarily overwhelmed by this simple but moving comment. Lewis, aged only four, conveyed a powerful symbolism for apples that morning.The apple falling from the tree in front of Isaac Newton was a symbol of scientic discovery. For my son, an apple is a symbol of love. And my son loves the apples he eats, and the ones which walk with him.

In part, this could be because her fiction is risky, challenging, sometimes riotously funny, but as often sizzling with rage. Her titles include Man or Mango , Dot in the Universe, and Mimi, savage satires on gender politics which are nevertheless also filled with tenderness and optimism. Her fondness for emphasising words in capital letters or italics has irked some critics, who prefer the page to look ordered and calm. But since when was fiction a form of beta blocker  With Ellmann, you feel yoursquove had an injection of adrenaline, quickening your heartbeat and bringing the world alive.Compared with her other novels, Ducks, Newburyport takes something of a new turn. As always, a woman is at its heart, but in this instance, instead of a slim work, it is big: just shy of , pages. Told by an Ohio housewe, who bakes her way through the tale, it is a stream-of-consciousness portrait of modern-day America, in all its confusion, consumerism, and cupidity. A y glossary of abbreviations is appended, ranging from Ato ZPGby way of IHPand WMD . You get the picture.Theof the story is ambitious enough, but asshe needed something more to spur her on, Ellmann has written the entire book ndash barring the opening passage ndash in a single sentence. Does this sound intimidating  Probably. Or make the book hard to read  Not at all. It is like stumbling on an oasis in a desert, a refreshing, invigorating, restorative immersion in a piece of remarkable, thoughtful and truly innovative fiction. Too many headline-grabbing novels are dull and predictable, enervating rather than enjoyable, derivative when they should be daring. Such tedious stuff makes you forget that the original meaning of the word novel was something dferent, unique, and new.Thankfully the Booker  has recognised a work of exceptional talent. Its presence on the shortlist adds lustre to a prize that has been dogged over the years by accusations of mediocrity and popularism, charges that last yearrsquos winner, Milkman by Anna Burns, helped to refute. Ellmannrsquos fellow shortlistees are prestigious, including Margaret Atwood and Salman Rushdie, both of whom have won before, along with El Shafak, second only to Orhan Pamuk in Turkey for international acclaim, British writer Bernadine Eisto, and the Nigerian Chigozie Obioma, shortlisted for his second novel, as he was with his first.The competition is stf, but already statistics are being trotted out: were it to win, Ducks, Newburyport would be the longest to prevail in the historyrsquos prize, beating even Eleanor Cattonrsquos doorstopper, The Luminaries, by more than  pages. Apart from their size, however, these two novels are poles apart. There is nothing conventional about Ducks, Newburyport. Indeed, Ellmannrsquos literary credentials can be traced back to James Joyce, the exemplar of stream of consciousness, where the reader has to surrender themselves to the flow, trusting the author to keep their head above water until they reach their destination. In the fluidity of Ellmannrsquos prose therersquos an echo of Henry James, with his sharp and self-conscious interrogation of America. Therersquos a nod to Virginia Woolf too, but Ellmannrsquos wit and acerbity, her scorching political lens, are all her own.The direction her style has taken is perhaps no surprise. Ellmannrsquos late father Richard was a world-renowned expert on Oscar Wilde and Yeats, but above all on James Joyce. His biography of the myopic Dublin genius has never been surpassed, remaining one of the most acclaimed literary biographies of the last century. The linguistic poetry and emotional range of Joyce, who must have been an invisible but constant presence in the Ellmann household, seems to have got under his daughterrsquos skin at a formative age.The announcement of the Booker Prize next month, on October , will mark  years to the day since its only Scottish winner, James Kelman, took the prize in  with How Late It Was, How Late. This was a highly contentious choice, not just because of its interior monologue narration, but also its liberal use of the F-word, which horried one uptight judge. The controversy it sparked has never been forgotten. These days, though, you canrsquot help thinking the title sounds like a lament for the lapse of time between Kelmanrsquos success and that of anyone  living north of the Border.There is no doubting Kelmanrsquos status as one of our finest novelists. Along with Alasdair Gray, he is an obvious contender for a Nobel Prize, though the chances of that idiosyncratic telescopersquos lens turning in this direction seem slim. Unlike many others, winning the Booker did not make Kelman rich or famous. It did, however, raise his profile internationally, and set a benchmark for those keen to add something memorable to the literary cairn.Ducks, Newburyport certainly does that. Other than in their tireless search for a mesmerising and distinctive way of expressing themselves, at first glance there is little obvious common ground between this pair. It is only when you read their books and recognise their seemingly effortless brilliance that you realise how similar, and rare, they are.In the acknowledgements at the end of Ducks, Newburyport, Ellmann thanks ldquoEdinburgh City Council for my Saltire card, a dandy aid to the impecunious. Itrsquos a cheerful reminder that unless yoursquore a bestseller, the literary le is not deluxe. Yet listening to the naturalness of her narratorrsquos voice, and the stories she tells, makes you grateful that the writerrsquos feet are firmly on the ground, be it a New Town pavement, No.  bus, or mid-west America, where the future is unfolding fast."},{"url":null,"title":"Marianne Taylor  Bargain bin awaits for David Cameron s  candid  memoir","story":"In my readingIve ascertained that there are three essential elements to a good memoir. Firstly, the reader must be able to walk in the subjectrsquos shoes and inhabit their world. It must also have a fair scattering of interesting ndash the more gasp-inducing the better ndash personal anecdotes and revelations. And finally, perhaps most crucially, it should reveal something universal about le itself. Good memoirs have one or two of these attributes great memoirs possess them all.How many ndashany ndash will David Cameronrsquos hotly-anticipated book contain, I wonder  The former prime ministerrsquos memoir, For The Record, is due out in  daysrsquo time, which means by rights I should already be able to answer that question. It is normal protocol for editors and reviewers to be sent copies weeks, sometimes months, in advance, but this book is apparently so hot it will stay under lock and key until the release date of September .Does this mean Mr Cameron is about to spill the beans on Boris Johnson  Does he have something up his sleeve that could bring down his old Eton, Oxford and Bullingdon Club chum  Are we to take it the revelations contained in this book are so explosive they will cause another major tremor in what has been a summer of political earthquakes : Johnson called Cameron a girly swotI fear those of hoping for such an outcome will be let down. After all, with Mr Cameron reportedly paid pound, in advance for the book ndash therersquos also a TV series in the offing ndash itrsquos more likely his publishers are simply ensuring they get plenty of bang for their buck. Indeed,there was anyone left who believed Mr Cameron had been laying low over the last three years because he feels ashamed about the misery and chaos he has inflicted upon the rest of us by holding the EU referendum, the penny must surely have dropped that he is under contract to keep schtum.By rights, of course, this is a man who should, evenonly in print, fall on his knees and beg forgiveness from us all. So arrogant and wrong-headed was his decision-making that we now sit on the precipice of a no-deal Brexit that has the potential to cause economic, political and social misery. Not that wealthy, privileged, cosseted Mr Cameron and his family will suffer its effects, of course, just as he clearly didnrsquot feel any sympathy or responsibility towards the families and communities he and his government plunged into austerity from  onwards.Evenno-deal can be avoided, the damaging isions Mr Camerons referendum created and fed upon will last for generations. To say he changed his country for the worse is an understatement. As for the apology he owes the people of Libya, thatrsquos another can of worms.Andthe memoirs of his predecessors are anything to go by, rather than apology and candour, Mr Cameronrsquos tome will be filled with dull procedure, maddening attempts to deflect blame and crass legacy-making.As for the standard of writing, it will be interesting to seehe has more talent than some of the previous inhabitants of Number . Even that great verbal communicator Tony Blair revealed himself to be a terrible writer his  book overflowed with clicheacute and wince-inducing pop psychology. Werenrsquot there also some really bad sex scenes  Crucially, he refused to confront Iraq.:David Cameron toto political limelight next month to publicise his autobiography For The RecordGordon Brownrsquos memoir ndash with its ghastly title My Le, Our Times ndash was criminally dull, as was John Majorrsquos, which I remember reading on my sickbed in the early Noughties after picking it up in an actual bargain bin for p. I only read two volumes of Mrs Thatcherrsquos autobiography and can attest that despite the grand delusion, at least they werenrsquot boring.For a truly skilled and revelatory take on the political world, we must turn to those who surround the powerful. All three volumes of Alastair Campbellrsquos diaries make for scintillating reading, as do those of the late Tory MP Alan Clark. Neither Campbell nor Clark emerge as likeable people, yet both are talented writers who exude wit, humour and honesty in spades. Their books embed readers in their heads, shock us, and in dferent ways, tell us about the nature of power.Mr Cameronrsquos publishers claim he will ldquotalk candidly, though itrsquos hard to imagine this former PR man, who, in common with his pal Mr Johnson has never seemed burdened by self-doubt, will feel the need or inclination to explain himself to the likes of us.

The city has announced that its entire fleet of  vehicles will be carbon free by the end of .So it will be buying electric cars and, more controversially, hydrogen-powered heavy vehicles for its heavy fleet.Its ambition is part of a wider bid to become Britainrsquos first zero net carbon city.As a start Glasgow has secured pound, from government quango Transport Scotland to convert  winter gritters to dual fuel hydrogen.Glasgow hopes that it can create a market for hydrogen fuel that will help other local authorities and commercial firms switch. And it recognise it will not make progressit cannot find a solution for heavy transport.Anna Richardson, the councillor who leads on the climate emergency, said: ldquoTo tackle carbon reduction in Glasgow effectively, it is essential the council gets its own house in order.ldquoBoth transport providers and environmental campaigners are looking to the council to take a lead toward carbon neutrality for our fleet.ldquoElectric vehicle technology is evolving rapidly and will be able to support a wide range of tasks undertaken by our vehicles.ldquoBut the green technology for heavier vehicles is still emerging and so we have the opportunity to influence the market for ourselves and other major transport providers.ldquoThe funding award from Transport Scotland will help to ensure larger dual fuel hydrogen gritters are up and running in the early part of next year.ldquoThese dual fuel vehicles should act as a signicant stepping stone towards emissions-free gritters and refuse trucks as part of our wider strategy for a zero emissions fleet.ldquoA wide range of discussions is currently underway on we best secure green hydrogen for our vehicles and move away from traditional sources of energy.ldquoWe are absolutely focused on ensuring renewable energy drives our fleet in future.Anna RichardsonHydrogen remains controversial among environmentalists, some of whom see it as a ldquogateway drug fuel for big hydrocarbon firms.Richard Dixon, of Friends of the Earth, said: ldquoHydrogen is a dead end for transport fuels which is being heavily promoted by the fossil fuel industry.ldquoIf Glasgow invests in hydrogen vehicles they will find them to be very expensive white elephants in the future.ldquoThere are already electric single and double decker buses in London, electric buses in four Scottish cities, electric bin lorries on trial in Sheffield and plans to build electric waste trucks in the UK.ldquoElectric vehicles, even large ones, are the future, so there is no need to go to the expense or take the risk of using hydrogen to run vehicles. ldquoThe plan admits that hydrogen trucks are extremely expensive. ldquoElectricity is clearly winning the big vehicle war over hydrogen. If you are going to spend lots of money replacing a fleet, spend it on electric vehicles because they are the only sensible option.GrittersThe dispute centres on whether hydrogen, current described as ldquogrey because it is made with either natural gas or coal, can be ldquogreen in the future.Supporters of hydrogen technology stress that it will massively reduce emissions compared with the current solution for powering big trucks: diesel. Even dual-fuel vehicles are understood to offer a % cut.The Scottish Government is also eager to pursue hydrogen for heavy vehicles and ferries.Transport Secretary Michael Matheson, praised the councilrsquos efforts to move towards a zero emissions fleet.Mr Matheson said the city was ldquoyet again leading from the front in taking steps to improve air quality and through their new plan to decarbonise their existing fleet of vehicles by .He added: ldquoThe   Programme for Government outlined our commitment to phase out the need for new petrol or diesel cars in the public sector fleet by  and for all other vehicles by .ldquoGlasgowrsquos new fleet strategy directly responds to this ambition and supports our Climate Change Plan alongside our ambition for Scotlandrsquos air quality to be the best in Europe.ldquoTransport Scotland officials have been working closely with Glasgow City Council to support this strategy and Irsquom delighted we are providing pound, from our Switched on Fleets Fund to convert over  gritters to dual-fuel hydrogen.ldquoWe will continue to work in partnership to ensure that we can collectively maximise the economic opportunities for all of Scotland through this crucial transition to low carbon transportation.The overhaul and upgrade of the councilrsquos fleet is due to begin with new electric cars being introduced in early months of next year along with the tower vans used to repair the cityrsquos lighting columns.New electric road and precinct sweepers will be deployed next year also. Aberdeen has already put Scotlandrsquos first hydrogen dual-fuel street sweeper in to operation.A Glasgow council spokesman added: ldquoThe fleet strategy also provides the opportunity for new technology to be installed within vehicles that will to boost the operation performance of vehicles, sharpen the scheduling for collection routes and ultimately improve recycling rates.ldquoThe safe operation of the councilrsquos vehicles for employees, contractors, other road users and the general public is the key principle that underpins the strategy.Glasgow council is mulling a whole series of policy proposals from a working group to reach zero net carbon by , including reforms to its own estate.The fleet strategy was approved last month so is one of the first initiatives to get official blessing from the local authorityrsquos ruling SNP administration."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/10392067.jpg?type=article-full","title":"theresa-may-accused-39-worst-kind-cronyism-39-honours-showered-former-no-10-staff","story":"David Lidington, who served as her de facto deputy, and Olly Robins, her chief Brexit negotiator, receive knighthoods while Gavin Barwell, her Chief of Staff, is elevated to the Lords.Also among the honours recipients for their ldquopolitical and public service, is Sir Kim Darroch, the ex-UK ambassador to Washington, who fell foul of Donald Trumprsquos ire over his leaked opinions of the US administration.

Any surplus generated will be reinvested firstly in the parking service, followed by other transport related projects.The new structure will be reviewed by Aberdeenshire Council’s Infrastructure Services Committee after a year of operation to see what effect it has had.Infrastructure Services Committee chair Cllr Peter Argyle said: “With more and more of us using digital means to pay for everyday transactions, we hope the contactless paymentoptions at our Pay and Display car parks will be a welcome convenience for many.data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.ellontimes webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"The Money Talk Team has helped save families thousands of pounds.\"  Money Talk Team helps thousands of low-income families viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"ELLO | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"ELLO | Article Teaser\"“It is part of the investment we have promised to make in our car parks as the new fees structure takes effect, ensuring we are providing a modern and convenient service whilemanaging the cost of providing it.”Committee vice-chair Cllr John Cox said: “The new approach allows us to keep Pay and Display car parks convenient parking in our town centres recognising more cashless servicesare standard.”"},{"url":null,"title":"inverurie s mike wins new mini","story":"INVERURIE resident and dedicated charity suppoter Mike Barron received an unexpected Christmas gt when he scooped a brand new car in a fundraiser in aid of a good cause close to his heart.Mike is the lucky winner of the Mini which was the star prize in a raffle which boosted CLAN Cancer Support coffers by thousands to end  on a high. The annual event is organised by a group of  North-east Rotary clubs and for the past five years it has played a part in CLAN’s fundraising effort. The star prize was sponsored by energy company TAQA Bratani to ensure every penny raised through selling tickets went to charity.When the draw was made on Christmas eve, Mike was on the other side of the world in New Zealand - unaware of his good fortune.Mike who is a member of Inverurie Rotary Club, has been a keen supporter of CLAN over the years and has taken part in ious events to generating funds for the charity - personally raising £, three years ago during the appeal to meet the costs of the new CLAN House. He said: “Our family has had connections with cancer charities both in Scotland and in New Zealand. Our reason for being at Tauranga in New Zealand over the festive period was to be company for our daughter, who lost her husband in January  after four years of deteriorating ill health through cancer. “Our-son-law’s New Zealand outreach care, from a similar charity to CLAN, was of the highest order prior to and immediately after his early death at  years of age. The support was tremendous. “My we too had breast cancer some  years ago and is meantime free of any problems.As a family we are indebted to organisations involved with cancer.” The handover of the prize was delayed until Mike landed back in Scotland from New Zealand.data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Boris Johnson beginning his visit to Aberdeenshire.

The society now also delivers animal welfare educational programmes, reaching more than , children in .So it’s fair to say that it has come a long way in the last  years.But for all the successes, there are also new issues it has to face – not least thanks to the advent of the internet.Mike explained: “For years, we have looked after all of Scotland’s animals – wild, farm and domestic.“Farming has come on leaps and bounds in the last few decades and we now have very few problems in the industry.“When I was a kid growing up, you used to have pet shops selling cats, dogs, budgies and the like.“Now, thanks to the internet, people have far more exotic animals in their care which all of our inspectors need to know how to care for and handle – from bearded dragons to massive boa constrictors!“We also have to contend with puppy farmers plying their trade online and selling puppies from car boots.“Some of the puppies die within a few days of people buying them, having paid a lot of money for the animal and thousands on vet fees.“Sadly, we also still see things that I saw  years ago such as Dobermans with every rib on their body sticking out.“However, thanks to our education programme, we are reaching the children of today who will be the animal lovers of the future.“And the majority of people our inspectors visit are not harming animals for fun – it’s a case of ignorance and neglect. In those cases, we’re not just helping the animals, but humans too.“Only five to ten per cent of cases every year are intentional cruelty. So Scotland is still a nation which, in the main, loves and cares for its animals.”That care and concern shines through as the public helps fund the SSPCA’s £ million budget annually.That covers the cost of  employees, including  inspectors,  ambulance drivers and the -strong team based at its nine centres across Scotland and its widle sanctuary.The society receives no government funding and relies solely on the public to fund its work.Mike added: “We are really lucky that, from a population of five and a half million, only  people were prosecuted last year for animal cruelty.“We will never be out of a job but the vast majority of people in Scotland are law abiding and animal loving.“And we couldn’t do what we do without their support.”In December, the Society plans to launch celebrations to commemorate the th anniversary that will run throughout .Anyone with interesting anecdotes or memorabilia they’d like to share should get in touch via its website or by emailing .years@scottishspca.org.The SSPCA is the only animal charity in the UK able to report animal cruelty cases to the Crown, with reports sent to the Procurator Fiscal Service. The charity receives no government funding and relies on donations and grants to continue its work, which costs £ million each year.In , it found homes for  rescued animals, helped more than  wildle casualties and spoke to more than , children.For every pound it receives, p is spent on animal welfare, p on fundraising and promotion and p on administration.So you can rest assured that the bulk of any donation you make will make a huge dference to the animals in the SSPCA’s care.Last year, its animal helpline received almost a quarter of a million calls, the inspectorate attended more than , incidents and more than , animals were cared for across its nine rescue and rehoming centres and at the national wildle rescue centre.

He accepts, reluctantly, the only way to resolve Brexit is to give the British people the general election that Labour, the SNP and the Liberal Democrats have been demanding – but the opposition parties vote against it, arguing that the timing does not suit them.They want a general election, but only once a further extension of EU membership – costing £ billion a month for a minimum of three months – has been agreed with the EU. They accuse Johnson of procuring a coup –yet it is his opponents who have been conspiring and collaborating with the very foreign power he is seeking to disentangle from – taking its legal advice and arranging an extension behind the nation’s back.: Sajid Javid refuses to rule out Brexit Party pactImagine past British politicians collaborating with IRA leaders while there was terrorism on our streets, or having private talks to support Khrushchev during the Cuban missile crisis, or Halax cooking up a deal with Ribbentrop after Poland had been invaded and our troops driven out of France  Yet that is indeed what MPs disrespecting the referendum result have effectively done. Surely these people must face the judgment of the British people through an early general election  Meanwhile Labour leaflets printed and posted before the week’s developments popped through voters’ letterboxes at the weekend demanding a general election “now” – exposing their two-faced opportunism. Labour and opposition parties fear an immediate general election because polling shows strong support for Conservatives before Halloween falls signicantlyit comes afterwards. Further, another poll has shown there is more support for – or put another way, less fear of – leaving the EU “without a deal” than for Corbyn becoming prime minister.After months,not years, of cataclysmic fearmongering of biblical proportions, the British public think Corbyn running the country is far worse than becoming a normal free-trading nation without any special deal between the EU and UK.And yet there is a possibility that Corbyn as prime minister is what we shall get – but without that general election. Not only do Johnson’s opponents want to overturn the referendum result, they wish to overturn the Government without any of us ordinary mortals having a say in the matter – prolonging the longest parliamentary session in  years. This begs the question: why might Corbyn be judged worse If we are to believe the opponents of “no-deal” then overnight we shall be enduring food shortages in shops, run out of fresh sandwiches, endure chaos at ports, be forced to ration medicines, lose valuable export markets and suffer an economic recession. Other, almost-daily scares add to these woes, causing a mood of uncertainty and apprehension yet Britain’s collective upper lip is stfening.We have been here before. We were toldwe voted to leave there would be an immediate recession, some , people would lose their jobs, property prices would collapse and interest rates would have to go up to control rampant inflation. Three years later and none of the “immediate” outcomes has materialised – in fact employment has grown by ,jobs, earnings are outstripping living costs, average property values continue to rise, tax receipts are growing so the deficit is reducing and public finances improving – and while an overdue recession is possible it will be global factors that precipitate it.Whether or not people just don’t believe the scares any more, think any short-term upheaval will be worth our country taking back control or huge compensating economic opportunities are not being reported, it is impossible to say. It might be a combination of all these.It might also be people think Corbyn is simply not fit to be in office. After all, there are many in the Labour Party– or who voted Remain – who think Corbyn would be a disaster. It is not inconceivable a large share of these people consider a five-year Corbyn premiership worse than a no-deal Brexit where any dficulties should prove short-term. Economic forecasts by the independent National Institute of Economic and Social Research and others suggest UK GDP will continue to rise after Brexit but might be - per cent smaller by  thanwe remain in the EU. That’s only . per cent smaller a year – less than GDP averaging  per cent growth over the last  years. All of this has to compare with the possible rule of a prime minister who has sided with practically every enemy of the country, calling many of them his “friends”. A leader whose relationship with anti-semitism in his party has caused many of his MPs and members to leave. A leader advocating economic policies that would cause capital flight and a collapse in investment.Voters know there has never been a Labour government that ended with lower unemployment than it inherited – and at a time of low employment this must mean people will start to lose their jobs. Sure, they probably welcome Labour spending to “end austerity” – but the Conservatives have already started that without Labour’s additional tax rises which the Financial Times estimates at £bn.They can also smell the rancid stench coming from a backroom deal being cooked up with Nicola Sturgeon to provide a second independence referendum infor ensuring there is no early election – and, when later there is, Labour gains power through a confidence-and-supply arrangement. Corbyn would then cling on like a limpet, lasting far longer than any no-deal upheaval.Internationally he could then demonise the only liberal state in the Middle East while siding with misogynist, homophobic Iran and championing the cause of anti-semitic Marxists delivering death and torture in South America, such as Venezuela’s President Nicolas Maduro.The public are not stupid – the real threat to our way of le, our economy and our liberties comes from Corbyn – and there’s no disguising it. Brexit must be delivered and Corbyn stopped. With the help of Brexit Party support reaching out to Labour Leave voters or those who never voted before, Johnson can defeat Corbyn and turn no-deal threats into opportunities.I have some useful numbers when he decides to make the call.Brian Monteith MEP is chief whip of the Brexit Party in the European Parliament©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"is brexit an english nationalist project dr rakib ehsan","story":"With a no-deal Brexit looming on the horizon, there is no surprise that the Scottish independence movement has regained serious momentum.A recent poll has shown that more Scottish people would prefer independence to remaining in the Union, with another survey showing that  per cent of Scots believe support for Scottish independence would increasethe UK was to leave the EU on a no-deal basis.What has been alarming is the absence of a positive, inclusive “post-Brexit” vision which can appeal to Remain-voting Scotland.English Eurosceptic politicians, some who are so pro-Leave to the extent that they are gunning for a no-deal Brexit, appear relaxed over the heightened risk of Scottish separation and the subsequent break-up of the UK. Pro-Remain, anti-separationist Scots – including those who identy with the Conservative Party – are being particularly let down by pro-Brexit English politicians who advertise themselves as supposedly passionate unionists. Perhaps a profound sense of personal disappointment over the Brexit approach adopted by the Tory leadership at Westminster was the driving force behind Ruth Davidson’s resignation – with the Scottish Conservatives now deprived of her uplting and charismatic leadership: Tories set to lose all Scottish seats to SNP in general election, poll suggestsFor unlimited access to Scotland’s best news, sport and expert analysis, SUBSCRIBE to The Scotsman website here The unfortunate reality is that Brexit has only served to intensy existing English-Scottish tensions.The  UK referendum on EU membership was itself a product of Conservative Party internal management, with then PM David Cameron producing a pledge to hold it to help stem the loss of support to the UK Independence Party in the affluent Tory-voting shires in order to appease hard Eurosceptics on his own benches. Every single Scottish local authority –  in total – voted to remain in the EU. Out of the top  Remain votes across the UK’s local authorities four were Scottish: EdinburghEast RenfrewshireEast Dunbartonshireand Stirling . Scotland overall delivered a Remain vote of  per cent.Yes, the referendum was a UK-wide democratic exercise. But the prospect of Remain-voting Scotland being dragged into a no-deal Brexit spearheaded by PM Boris Johnson, who himself seems increasingly focused on wooing Labour Leavers in the provincial Midlands and Northern England, has inevitably provided the SNP and the broader Scottish independence movement with a major boost.Indeed, a recent poll by YouGov suggests that all  Conservative-held seats in Scotland are at risk of falling to the SNP –with the real takeaway figure being that across the  constituencies polled,  per cent would vote for the UK to remain in the event of a second vote on EU membership .And much of this is because Brexit is increasingly coming across as an inward-looking English enterprise – one which seems very much at ease with the heightened possibility of Scottish independence. Another poll conducted by YouGov of Conservative Party members demonstrated this very point – with  per cent of respondents claiming that Scotland breaking away from the UK was a price worth payingit was a consequence of Brexit being delivered . The concern for genuine unionists is that deeper expressions of “Englishness” and “Scottishness” are very much at odds when it comes to the UK’s broader relationship with the EU. While prevailing expressions of English political identity are intertwined with Eurosceptic sentiment, Scottish political identity is associated with a far more positive view of the UK’s membership of the EU. With this also being the case among young people, there is no doubt that a disruptive no-deal exit from the EU – one led by a Conservative Prime Minister who clearly has little time for the SNP’s -strong Westminster contingent, and has so far adopted a belligerent approach to delivering Brexit – could inject considerable youthful energy into the push for a second referendum on Scottish independence. Considering the political circumstances, genuine pro-Leave unionists – on both sides of the border – have their work cut outthey intend to secure the UK’s withdrawal from the EU as well as neutralising the very real prospect of post-Brexit Scottish independence. As it stands, Brexit could be the straw that breaks the camel’s back – breaking apart our family of nations.

Fteen thousand independence supporters marched through Perth on Saturday, led by the deputy First Minister John Swinney, and local SNP MP Pete Wishart. I’ve lived near Perth for  years, and can’t remember a bigger gathering on the streets of the slightly douce Fair City. But the chances are that none bar the marchers and those affected by road closures will have any idea a march took place. Ditto the other All Under One Bannermarches held this summer in Oban, Ayr, Aberdeen, Dunfermline and Glasgow - or the Outer Hebrides for Independence march held in Stornoway.Despite the near certainty that more than  thousand folk will turn out for the final scheduled march in Edinburgh next month, and even though it’s a perfectly-timed gt for news producers seeking visual ways to represent the Brexit-induced sht in Scottish public opinion - the same news blackout will probably occur. Yet a small Glasgow march did get front page treatment this weekend - likewise a smaller Brexit demonstration in London. Mind you, they both had something the AUOB march did not - violence, confrontation and arrests. Let’s not be naive. Punch-ups and sectarianism on the streets of Glasgow certainly sells papers. But what does that tell peaceful independence marchers - exercise your democratic rights peacefully and you’ll be completely ignored : SNP electoral gains would lend ‘weight’ for indyref demandsIt’s a moral dilemma that may not unduly bother editors and owners since newspapers are expected to be partisan. But BBC Scotland is a public broadcaster, fundedby licence fee payers, so there’s particular annoyance amongst marchers over its profoundly deaf ear. What’s the problem - wrong democratic leaves on the line One frustrated Yesser observed on twitter “It’s almost like a point of principle for [BBC Scotland] now. If the whole population of Scotland marched at the same time on the same day in every town  city in the country, they would still not report it.Another observed: “No violence, no thuggery, no mess, just happy, hopeful people looking to the future. [We] need to stop expecting the BBC to care.”Aunty is stoking the alienation of independence-supporters from public service broadcasting and has only itself to blamethey switch off, or switch over - and recent statistics suggest thousands of viewers have been doing both. But denying air-time to the peaceful Yes movement could have more serious consequences. People who aren’t heard, tend to shout louder. People who are effectively punished for following rules, often feel tempted to break them. The fact AUOB marches remain ignored, yet completely peaceful, is testimony to excellent stewarding and an in-built Jimmy-Reid-like understanding about the need for discipline. Over time though, faith in democracy, and civic institutions is bound to be erodedthe peaceful exercise of democratic rights is consistently regarded as too boring or small beer to warrant attention. To be crystal clear, I’m not suggesting there’s the slightest chance the precious combination of restraint, fun and respectful behaviour developed on these marches will ever be jettisoned. But activists representing the will of half the voting population cannot go on being ignored by the great and good, without denting Scotland’s conceit of itself as a properly responsive democracy. So, what’s un-newsworthy about the AUOB marches  Is that old problem of balance partly to blame  Has Aunty decided it can’t cover Yes demonstrations, till tens of thousands of “No Thanks” campaigners hire buses to cross Scotland on their only real day offto demonstrate their enduring belief in the strength of the Union  Cos, that will probably never happen.Defensive nationalism - of the kind typied by Better Together - doesn’t rely on street action for impact. Its strength comes from control of the establishment, the great and good, institutions like banks, newspapers and governments, and therefore pensions and public spending. Aspiring nationalism - of the kind typied by the Yes movement - has little institutional underpinningand relies on song, slogan, culture, social media and street protest to express itself. The Yes and No campaigns are very dferent beasts and there will never be “balance” in their activities.So, what must change for marches to get news coverage  Nicola Sturgeon at the helm, perhaps  If so, what does that say about the status of the self-organising Yes movement - does it really need party-political endorsement to make “real” news  Do fteen or even one hundred thousand people on the streets without a First Minister, really constitute no more than a pointless gathering or a rabble in the mind of news producers  If so, that’s shameful.Demonstrations are the preserve of those without institutional clout and so the streets are essentially a working-class domain. Middle class society usually has other, more discreet ways to influence events - networks, contacts, societies, powerful neighbours and golfing companions. So, it’s not surprising the middle-class professionals who run Scotland find the resort to public demonstrations a bit - vulgar, desperate and last season. And a bit hard to pigeon-hole.Law-abiding, peaceful, working-class marchers don’t fit a pre-prepared stereotype. Violent, angry Old Firm supporters do. Road blocks produced by a couple of hundred Extinction Rebellion protesters also look sufficiently confrontational to be newsworthy. But tens of thousands of folk marching peacefully about independence in towns and cities without any experience of large demonstrations for a century  What is that really  It’s not new, it’s not surprising anymore, it doesn’t pose an immediate threat to the status quo or change anything overnight. And that’s what news has become.Coupled with the pervasive belief that “proper” democracy happens only in buildings like parliaments, and it’s not surprising broadcasters feel uncomfortable about street protest. Fling in the banal dficulty that staffing is low at weekends, TV news bulletins are shorter than usual, and Perth is not Glasgow and you have a neat stack of excuses for not sending a camera along. But what do we get instead  Bulletins littered with the antics, outrages, disruptions, preoccupations and entitled social behaviour of the English upper-class. Home-grown demonstrations may be hard to slot in, but their persistent absence from news bulletins just exacerbates feelings of bias and distances BBC Scotland further from half its viewing public.Fortunately, in October, there’s one final chance to get it right.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"looking back when a young jacob rees mogg campaigned in scotland with his nanny","story":"The Scotsman recalls his first foray into Scottish politics.Brexit campaigner Jacob Rees-Mogg started his political career back in Rees-Mogg was just  when he was selected by the Conservatives to contest Central Fe ndash a traditional Labour seat ndash at the  general election.The Etonian travelled to Scotland with a mind to hitting the campaign trail, but his upper-class background soon put him at odds with a largely working-class electorate.The son of late Times editor William, Rees-Mogg made the inauspicious decision to knock on doors in the former mining town of Leven on the Fe coast.But reports quickly emerged of the English candidate taking the familyrsquos nanny, Veronica Crook, in tow during canvassing while driving around the back streets of Fe in a Bentley.Rees-Mogg turned into cannon fodder, particularly for the tabloid newspapers.He was photographed in a pin-stripe suit visiting the doors of constituents in the Broom estate in Leven.Declarations by Rees-Mogg that people on benefits were the ldquoscourge of the earth didnrsquot help his position.Adding to his back story were reports of Rees-Mogg having to be saved by his Labour opponent Henry McLeish from being beaten up.McLeish told the Daily Record earlier this year: ldquoAt one point, somebody threatened to come onto the  and beat him up.ldquoA touching part to that was that after saving him from a potential duffing up, his father, the very distinguished editor of the Times, William Rees-Mogg, sent me a letter thanking me for how Irsquod managed to protect him, for which he was very grateful.Why your new suitable cabin baggage might actually fall foul of Ryanair rulesldquoIt was a delightful letter, basically saying lsquoI donrsquot often write to Labour MPs, but I would like to thank you very, very sincerely for the way you looked after my sonrsquo.ldquoJacob was like a fish out of water and clearly bewildered by places like Methil and Kennoway.ldquoI did not get the feeling he was the dangerous ideologue extremist we know him as today.ldquoHe was reasonably well behaved in my company because I think he was in fear of his le.ldquoThe fact he is looked upon by some as a future Prime Minister seems well beyond the realms of comprehension.

But this week the #Peatbogs# will be back on home turf to showcase their energetic brand of traditional-inspired electronica as part of this year#s Skye Live Festival.The rare Skye gig will mark the start of another autumn tour for the six-piece group, for whom constant re-invention has proved key to longevity spanning almost three decades.The sound that#ll boom out in the tent high above Portree Harbour this Saturday will be far removed from the group#s roots as a folk band playing in local pubs. But the Peatbogs, like more recent successors such as Niteworks, are a reminder that a grounding in traditional music is no barrier to a letime of instrumental experimentation.Le for the Peatbog Faeries began with a gig in Edinbane Lodge in the spring of . Peter Morrison and bass player Innes Hutton from Braes # the two constants in the line-up # were joined by Davie Tait, Ali Pentland and Alan Edmunds.Pubs and village hall dances became their early staple, but gradually more adventurous elements crept into their set and the audiences lapped it up.Morrison recalled: #We#d bring in a blues or a reggae sound, and we found it was these things that started to go down best with audiences.#We moved to more of a world music sound around about , but we never expected much to come of it. We were just out to play at pubs and parties and have a bit of fun#.Their first tape # the #Great Ceilidh Swindle# # sold well locally and paid for a demo in Edinburgh, which in turn caught the ear of Greentrax Records, the specialist label in Scottish traditional music.With bands like Shooglenty and Martyn Bennett also arriving on the scene it proved a perfect time to be breaking new ground and the Peatbog Faeries# debut album #Mellowsity# would stay in Greentrax#s top ten for the next decade-and-a-half.Morrison remembers: #Because of our size and sound, bands like us and Shooglenty cost a lot more to record than other folk bands at the time. So there was a worry at the start.#But as soon as we signed to Greentrax, we quite quickly got an agent and we got sought-after slots at Glastonbury, Nomad and Celtic Connections.#We didn#t really notice what was happening, in a way # it felt like one day we were playing in the pub, the next day playing in front of thousands.#There weren#t that many precedents for bands like ours. Most folk bands just played in pubs. There were some accordion bands that were full-time or groups like #Silly Wizard#, but for us coming out of Skye we never thought it would turn into a full-time occupation.#We just went with the flow and luckily for us it proved a lot more popular than we thought it would be.#The band#s line-up has changed several times, and in turn, each addition helped explore new sounds # the most dramatic sht coming when Rick Taylor and Nigel Hitchcock arrived on Skye in the s to add a three-piece brass section.Taylor # who passed away earlier this year # was a revered musician who had toured with Elton John, while in recent years the Peatbog#s fiddler Peter Tickell left the group to take to the road with Sting.The current scaled-back line-up has seen Morrison and Hutton joined by Edinburgh-based Tom Salter on guitar keyboard player Graeme Stafford from Ardnamurchan drummer Stu Haikney and Shetlander Ross Couper on fiddle.For Peter Morrison, the global tours, the record deals and the Glastonbury stage all owe their origins to the chance he got to learn the chanter in the long-since closed Vatten Bridge primary school.He explains: #Every year Norman MacLeod # the teacher#s husband # and John Laing used to pipe us all in to the Christmas Party, so that was where I first heard the pipes.#Every pupil got the chance of learning the chanter at school, and I think nine of us started playing. It was either that or an hour of maths.#I think I was the only one who carried on into secondary school, but I got the bug. I didn#t like the competing part, but I enjoyed listening to the pipes and learning to play them.#My pal Donnie MacAskill from Roag also played the accordion, so I learned to play drums along with him and from about the age of  I was always in bands.#Morrison#s early piping tutor was Cameron MacFadyen, and he received additional help from Nicol Campbell # another well-known local piper and character from Dunvegan, whose memory has been honoured across the globe.Morrison added: #When he passed away Nicol left me his kilt, which has since been worn on stages in Japan, Africa and America.#A joiner to trade, who also worked for aperiod as a hotelier in Dunvegan, Peter Morrison has seen attitudes to traditional music change over the years, and with it opportunities flourish.He still lives in Roag with we Johan and grown-up kids Jenny and Calum, and it#s no surprise to hear him promote the virtues of free access to music tuition in local schools.He continues to be #amazed# at some of the local talent learning traditional instruments, some of whom he can be heard playing alongside at regular music sessions laid on in the Edinbane Inn and the Old Inn in Carbost.#It#s changed a lot since when I was a youngster whenyou wanted to learn music the only real opportunity was the pipes,# he recalled.#Things like the fis movement have been really helpful in creating opportunities. There now seems to be a constant stream of really good young musicians coming out of Skye.#When I started you would never have thought of making a career out of it, but now with some of these youngsters, it seems to be the only thing they think about. #A lot of these kids are now at a standard that in previous years only a handful of people in Scotland were achieving.#In Skye you have the likes of Daimh, Niteworks, Bridghe Campbell # the list goes on and on. #At these regular sessions there are some great young local players going along like Anna Scott, Dugald McKiggan, Archie and Isobel Maclean and Malin Lewis.#Morrison continued: #Recently over in LorientI saw a great act. It was a Sikh beatboxer, accompanied by step-dancer Sophie Stevenson along with Catherine Tinney from Portree singing puirt-a-beul.#This was another Skye person on the international stage, singing to an incredible standard, but she was someone I#d never heard sing before. #In the past, going somewhere like Lorient,there was a person from Skye on stage you would know exactly who it was # they would be an established name. Now you can go somewhere like that and get a surprise.#It shows the strength in depth there is now.#Some of that west-coast musical talent will be showcased at Skye Live this weekend among a ied line-up that will also include some of the country#s top nightclub DJs.Morrison urged the local community to rally behind the festival weekend, which this year starts with a Thursday-night concert to the Waterboys.He added: #We played at the very first Skye Live five years ago and are looking forward to getting on stage at the Lump in Portree again.#It#s an iconic setting, but organisers have kept the festival to a level that is comfortable for the place.#A capacity of , people is about a fth of the population of Skye and is manageable. When you start to go into the tens of thousands it brings pressures, and it#s a risk to go too big without the infrastructure to support it.#Whenever anyone organises a festival there will always be people who might want to pick holes in it or knock it in some way.#But people need to remember that these guys are putting on a  for so many types of music.#It#s something people of all ages can go to and hear some of the best music in Scotland in Portree. I would hope local people can support it in any way they can.#The Skye Live festival runs from Thursday th until Saturday th September.

Twenty years after the peace process, scores of so-called ‘peace walls’ continue to separate Catholic and Protestant neighbourhoods.We are introduced to the character of Jean Beattie whose grief turns to anger when police refuse to open the peace gate at the end of her street to allow her best friend’s funeral procession through to her church on the other side of the peace wall. Comforted by friends Roberta, Bridget and Patricia from the cross-community pensioners’ club, Jean vows that the gate will be opened.Tony spoke of how he was inspired to put pen to paper following his work with a cross-community women’s group at Forthspring Intercommunity Group, situated on Springfield Road’s peace line, across the road where Tony’s father grew up.Tony will launch Belfast Gate on Monday evening at Fountain Street’s Waterstones store. Speaking ahead of the launch he described his novel as“totally dferent from anything I have written and published before”.“It’s my first book set in the present day and it’s written in the present tense. It’s the voice of a narrator, a fictional story rather than a personal memoir. However, the tone, humour and underlying themes are similar to my previous books.”He continued: “After more than  years of peace, the peace walls continue to ide the good people of Belfast, as they have done for  years. I want people to consider the possibility of a future without walls and, importantly, to laugh them down.”Belfast Gate will be available to purchase from Monday September  priced at £ and is available from all good bookstores and online including Amazon Kindle and audiobook.

The UK doesn’t have a written constitution… and commentators have reflected over this in the last weeks as the Brexit crisis has loomed, in fact that’s the beauty of the UK constitution – its flexibility – that when we are looking at the UK constitution, it draws upon not just one document… we are entitled to look at historical events, how we reached a certain point and what the interests of public policy are in a flexible and fluid environment.“And in the context of Northern Ireland, when one is interpreting any piece of legislation one must look at the Belfast Agreement and the provisions of it, and interpret the legislation in a way which is consistent with it.“What is it about UK policy that would require a government to foist citizenship upon people who do not want it… who find it offensive to have that citizenship foisted upon them  What part of government policy is that  It’s not part of any government policy.”The judges retired to consider the arguments and a ruling will follow.Sinn Fein MEP Martina Anderson, Sinn Fein MP for Fermanagh Michelle Gildernew and SDLP MLA Dolores Kelly were among Ms DeSouza’s supporters at the Royal Courts of Justice in Belfast on Tuesday.Speaking outside court, Ms DeSouza said after hearing the arguments put forward by the Home Office, she is concerned at the implications after Brexit.“There are huge concerns over how we are going to access our EU rights and entitlements post-Brexit because we are not going to be considered EU citizens, my concern is they are going to treat everyone in Northern Ireland as British and use it as a way to restrict EU rights and entitlements,” she said."},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article38486534.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/car_in_mud.jpg","title":"pictured car stuck in mud at northern ireland beach","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Their address is listed as  Parnell Square, which is the partys headquarters in Dublin.It was outlined in Mr Hamptons will that the money was to be used to cover election expenses, to fund Sinn Fein offices and advice centres, and to aid republican prisoners and their families in both Ireland and Britain.Mr Hamptons will stated: \"In the event that the organisation which is now known as Sinn Fein should cease to be in existence or should have split or taken a dferent name at the date of death then I direct that my executors and trustees are to apply my monies to the political party to which Mr Gerry Adams MP then belongs.\"\"Should Mr Adams pre-decease me or not be a member of any political party at the date of my death then I direct that my executors and trustees shall apply my monies to the republican or nationalist political party in the six counties, other than the SDLP, which has the largest number of elected councillors.\"Mr Hamptons donation was made public on Thursday by the Electoral Commission.A Probate Registry of Wales document confirms that when he died on January , , at a nursing home in Pembrokeshire, Mr Hampton left an estate in the UK worth £,,.However, at the time of writing his will in , he was living in a mobile home in Ireland.

The donation to Sinn Fein was paid to the party in instalments of £m and £, in April and May this year.The size of the UK estate and the mention of other global assets means that Sinn Fein may yet be in line for further donations from Mr Hampton.Under HM Revenue  Customs rules, Sinn Fein will not have to pay any inheritance tax on the £.m gt as any political party that has at least two MPs in the House of Commons is not liable to do so.Sinn Fein has seven MPs but because of a Westminster abstentionist policy they do not take their seats in the house.A political party also qualies for exemptionit has one MP and received no less than , votes at the last general election.

responsible for nominating the  host, and the nomination is set to be formally accepted at December’s Cop summit in Chile, the Government said.Next year’s talks mark the full adoption of the Paris Agreement and the date by which countries are expected to come forward with stronger emissions cuts to meet the goals of the deal.Plans submitted so far by countries are putting the world on a pathway towards more than C of warming, though the Paris Agreement commits them to curb temperatures to .C or C above pre-industrial levels in order to avoid the worst impacts of climate change.Foreign

Italy.“Over , delegates from around the world will come together to commit to ambitious action to tackle climate change.“We’re ready to bring the world together to make sure we leave our precious

said: “It is right that this conference should come to Scotland given our leadership in climate action.“Scotland was one of the first countries in the world to acknowledge the global climate emergency

its legal goals to cut greenhouse gas emissions by , with a new target to reach “net zero” emissions by mid-century becoming law in the summer.But concerns have been raised, including by the Government’s own advisory Climate Change Committee, that the UK is off track to meet its targets and signicantly more action is needed to cut emissions from homes, power generation, transport and agriculture.Dr Kat Kramer, Christian Aid’s global climate lead, backed the news that the “historic” meeting was taking place in the UK.She said: “For it to be a success, the UK needs to walk the talk and increase its own near-term targets reducing its emissions rapidly and radically.“The UK further needs to develop a holistic plan to achieve its own legally-binding goal of achieving net zero emissions by .”And she said: “Internationally, the UK needs to make sure that it is doing its fair share to support developing countries through finance and providing them with sustainable technologies like wind and solar.”Clara Goldsmith, director of The Climate Coalition, which consists of groups ranging from the National Trust to WWF and Islamic Relief, said: “Over the next  months, the world’s eyes will be on us just as widespread public pressure to act on climate change grows – this is the perfect opportunity for the UK Government to put its money where its mouth is.”The

temperatures.Global climate “strikes” will be held on Friday September , ahead of the summit, with workers and protesters supporting young people walking out of lessons and lectures to call for urgent

The delivery of a Personalised Medicine Centre of Excellenceat Ulster University and Altnagelvin is also a priority for this fund as is the provision of an integrated, Council-wide, multi-skills employment pathways intervention support programme.The report advised that work on these innovation projects as well as the proposed SMART and digital city projects were advancing in close collaboration with local industry and partners and relevant government departments, while the strategic outline cases for major regeneration projects for Derry City and Strabane Town Centre are at an advanced stage of progress.The Personalised Medicine Centre of Excellence intends on harnessing the power of Genomics to predict and diagnose inherited and acquired disease, and to personalise treatments and interventions.The Ulster University representatives said it will expand its partnership with Genomics Ireland and other commercial enterprises to sequence the genomes of % of NI’s population contributing to a research database that can be interrogated to develop personalised medicine solutions with worldwide application and valuable I.P. and how it will also contribute to health improvement locally through a unique ‘community buy-in’ approach.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh"},{"url":"https://img.resized.co/derrynow/eyJkYXRhIjoie1widXJsXCI6XCJodHRwczpcXFwvXFxcL3MzLWV1LXdlc3QtMS5hbWF6b25hd3MuY29tXFxcL3N0b3JhZ2UucHVibGlzaGVycGx1cy5pZVxcXC9tZWRpYS5yaXZlcm1lZGlhLmllXFxcL3VwbG9hZHNcXFwvMjAxOVxcXC8wOVxcXC8wOTEyMTkwNlxcXC9TVFJBQkFORS1ERVZJQ0UtLnBuZ1wiLFwid2lkdGhcIjo2NDcsXCJoZWlnaHRcIjozNDAsXCJkZWZhdWx0XCI6XCJodHRwczpcXFwvXFxcL2NhY2hlLnJlc2l6ZWQuY29cXFwvbm8taW1hZ2UucG5nXCIsXCJvcHRpb25zXCI6W119IiwiaGFzaCI6IjhlOTFmNGZjY2ExNDE2YjZiOGFkN2MwMzExOGY0ZWQ0NThmOWJlMmIifQ==/strabane-device.png","title":"security operation creggan area derry following discovery mortar device strabane","story":"District Commander Superintendent Gordon McCalmont said: \"It is our assessment that the New IRA is responsible for the mortar device that was discovered outside homes in Church View Close in Strabane on Saturday morning th September. The people who left this device had every intention of killing my colleagues serving the Strabane community. They showed no regard for the families, elderly and vulnerable people who were forced to leave their homes and whose lives were put at risk.   As a parent myself it was terrying to hear local mother Aileen Mullan recount how close her children were to this deadly device.\"The New IRA members behind this attack are living in the community. They are building bombs and storing weapons and placing the community at risk. To further highlight the recklessness and total disregard shown by the New IRA,  a public safety operation is taking place in Creggan this morning th September involving approximately  officers and explosive detection dogs. Our assessment is that this group is concealing bomb making materials. We have a number of areas of focus but there is nothing definitive and no guarantees.

The only dissenting voice came from the DUPrsquos Harry Harvey, who voted against.The DUP councillor took an alternative view on the perceived harmful effect that circus le has on animals.Cllr Harvey said: ldquoI wonrsquot be supporting this motion as circus animals are very well trained and well trained animals are generally happy and well looked after.Cllr Brown told the meeting that many animals travelling with circuses were ldquosubjected to constantly being moved around cramped temporary housing, forced training and performance, loud noises and intimidating crowds of people.He continued: ldquoTravelling circus le is likely to have a harmful effect on animal welfare as captive animals are unable to socialise, get enough exercise or exhibit natural behaviours. Many animals develop behavioural and or health problems as a direct result of the captive le that they are forced to lead.He said that a recent report commissioned by the Welsh Government concluded that: ldquoLe for wild animals in travelling circuses... does not appear to constitute either a lsquogood lersquo or a lsquole worth livingrsquo.ldquoThe Irish government recently saw footage from the Animal Defenders International group which showed elephants and camels being repeatedly punched and hit with sticks to perform, said Cllr Brown.He added: ldquoIn May, the UK Government announced it would be banning wild animals in circuses from early . The Irish Government banned wild animals in January .ldquoAs usual, this being a devolved issue, Northern Ireland is behind the times yet again.

I hope that it will be delivered as soon as possible, given the huge volume of traffic which passes through the centre of the town each day.Cllr Walker said a number of traffic surveys have been carried out over the years to determine the need for an upgraded crossing and is pleased that one is finally going to be delivered and will be paid for by the Department for Infrastructure.ldquoThe importance of this puffin crossing cannot be highlighted enough, he continued. ldquoThe new crossing will see the provision of Killyleaghrsquos first set of traffic lights which in itself is signicant.

But he conceded that theof -hour AE services may be dficult.Mr McGoran was invited to address the Down Community Health Committee and said it was important that the South Eastern Trust was having a conversation with campaigners who are keen to continue discussions with officials to ensure the retention of existing services and the delivery of enhanced provision moving forward.Over previous years, relations between both organisations was particularly fraught at times and while they did not always see eye to eye, Mr McGoran hopes they can now move forward together.He said he had ldquonothing but respect for the Down community because local people cared about their health and social care services, committing time and energy to make sure the area gets the best provision it can.ldquoThis is not always obvious everywhere in Northern Ireland, Mr McGoran continued. ldquoYou have been at this for a long time and I have no doubt that without your campaigning work we would not have some of the things we have in this organisation today. I am also not sure that we would have the Downe Hospital.ldquoYour contribution and those who went before you has been fundamental in keeping this area in the spotlight, fighting ultimately for your services. I take my hat off to you. The Downe is here to stay and we have a fantastic facility and there are no staff better. In fact, we have incredible staff who work right across the organisation.Mr McGoran said that while administrators and campaigners may not have always agreed in the past about how the health trust did things, he suggested they all had the same aim mdashwanting the best health and social care that could be delivered, sometimes within challenging resources.Looking to the future, the health chief referred to an ongoing review of emergency care which has resulted in the group overseeing the exercise visiting the Downe and meeting with senior health officials.ldquoI do envisage that there is going to be further change for emergency medicine but when I was asked the question what did I think about the future of the service at the Downe, Ulster and Lagan Valley hospitals in  yearsrsquo time, I could not really answer that, explained Mr McGoran.ldquoI was prepared to say what it would be like in five yearsrsquo time, but could not look beyond that. A five year vision is really something that you can get a hold of and we made it clear to those in charge of the review that the emergency care model we have in place at the Downe will be here in five yearsrsquo time.Mr McGoran said the health trust was on record with the Department of Health during the early stages of the current engagement that it still sees the current model at the Downe comprising the emergency department, out of hours GP service and weekend nurse-led minor injuries unit remaining in place.ldquoWe will still have acute beds in the Downe and it will deal with medically unwell patients. All of the current infrastructure we have will remain in place and our vision is to expect these to remain in place for the next five years, he confirmed.Mr McGoran said the one caveat was that it remained to be seen what the Department of Health will do with the information it has been provided with in relation to the future of emergency care, suggesting serious conversations about the way forward have only just begun.He added: ldquoThere is work ongoing and at some point there may be a consultation exercise. I do not know where all this is going to go and it is a bit early to speculate.Community Health Committee chairman Eamonn McGrady welcomed the health officialrsquos ldquoconstructive and honest engagement with campaigners.He said: ldquoWe need to go forward in a partnership, but that does not mean that we will always agree. Our community supports the Downe Hospital and also the centres of excellence in the bigger hospitals that our delivering our health needs.ldquoBut we need as much care as possible provided as locally as possible, safely and well adequately resourced in a brilliant building.Mr McGrady added: ldquoI hope that in five yearsrsquo time we will be looking at a very major extension at the Downe and a major increase in capacity.

Only a handful of the  boats finished the course, which started in Bangor via Strangford to Portpatrick.PORTAVOGIE mdash Portavogie fishermen wishing to haul out their boats look like having an easier time in front of them this winter because the NI Fisheries Harbour Authority have ordered a special winch which they hope to have in operation soon.The winch has been ordered from Butters Cranes, Glasgow, and will be able to handle up to  tonnes..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/4th September 2019 Lighthouse.jpg","title":"Lighthouse beam must be preserved  ","story":"THE campaign group lobbying for the retention of the iconic sweeping beam at St Johnrsquos Point Lighthouse near Killough has again insisted that it must be preserved, with the building developed to provide a leading tourist attraction.The Lecale Lightkeepers have written to the Commissioners of Irish Lightsmdash which wants to remove the beam powered by a six ton Fresnel lamp and replace it with an LED light mdash highlighting the importance of retaining the beam in its current form for future generations.Campaigners say that the century-old beam must not be confined to the pages of history, warning CIL thatit persists with its controversial plan, it will miss a ldquotremendous opportunity to preserve both the iconic lighthouse and its beam.The Lecale Lightkeepers say the beam, which is an integral part of the lighthousersquos heritage and a stunning feature of the Lecale landscape, must be retained for people to enjoy.CIL has argued that because the current lamp rotates in a bath of mercury and poses a health and safety risk, it is looking at designing a new mechanism which would allow the mercury to be removed.However, campaigners do not agree, claiming that such an option would be expensive to operate and, most signicantly, alter the character of the light.They have also branded claims that the mercury bath poses a health and safety risk as a ldquored herring and fear that replacing the existing mechanism could potentially damage the lens.In a letter to the Dublin-based CIL, campaigners say they remain as ldquocommitted as ever to preserving the sweeping beam which is important to the local community.In July, CIL confirmed that trials of an alternate bearing system were ongoing but it was unable to make a final determination as to the suitability of such a system.Seeking an update on the trials, campaigners say they have held since the outset that a solid metal-on-solid metal bearing ldquodefies common sense as a practical approach since the energy necessary to overcome the friction forces therein would be costly and the apparatus itself require lubrication and continuous maintenance.ldquoSuch problems were addressed successfully by Messrs Bourdelles  Fresnel, the distinguished French lighthouse engineers in the th century and their designs, including the almost frictionless mercury bearing, were employed in lighthouse construction world-wide, including Ireland and at St Johnrsquos Point in , the letter continues.ldquoWe believe it is an established fact that any potential hazard to health by mercury vapour can be managed by adequate ventilation. This was foreseen in the design of St Johnrsquos Point lighthouse where there is excellent lantern sidewall and cowling ventilation in a tower  feet above the ground in this remote location. There is little hazard from the liquid mercury since it is not readily absorbed dermally.Campaigners have suggested that it would be interesting to see CILrsquos lighthouse keeper health monitoring records for mercury covering the past  years and more when the lighthouse was manned and used the present system. They also said it would be interestingto see the training records for keepers in safe mercury handling during all these years. ldquoPresumably, these would have been managed by independent bodies of experts since the Commissioners probably didnrsquot previously have and donrsquot today have any toxicological experts on your permanent payroll, says the campaigners letter.Another area of concern highlighted is the poor state of the lighthouse, including adjoining housing which a delegation from the Commissionerrsquos office recently visited.Campaigners point to the ldquolamentable state of the walls of the lighthouse station and the grounds, suggesting that they present a picture of ldquowoeful neglect and asking how CIL can expect the public to be impressed with a lack of basic asset maintenance.The letter highlights that the current Fresnel lens system turns  hours a day and is clearly visible from the road outside the lighthouse station.Campaigners say this in itself is a visual attraction during daylight hours ldquosince the magnicent large lens system is big enough to be seen turning on itrsquos mercury bearing and is even more magnicent at night.The letter continues: ldquoWe believe that CIL will miss a tremendous opportunity to preserve this lighthouse and its sweeping beamyou persist with your alternative bearing plans. The whole lighthouse station could become part of a wider tourist attraction in the area. Future generations will thank you for retaining the current historic beam system, still going smoothly after  years and showing no signs of obsolescence. You have not made an economic case for change of lens system at St Johnrsquos Point as far as we know and it is dficult to see how you can.ldquoWhat happens at the lighthouse remains the focus of keen and widespread local and political interest in this area and we will ensure this continues to be a high-profile local issue.The letter adds: ldquoLecale Lightkeepers are willing to fully support CIL and others in any preservation programme that involves retaining the sweeping beam. However, we reject the idea that the use of mercury in this lens bearing application represents a health hazard that cannot be managed by a sensible, low-cost maintenance programme involving chiefly adequate ventilation. This has always have been the case anyway..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/4th September 2019 new.jpg","title":"New sponsorship page for Newcastle League cups  ","story":"THE Newcastle League has released details of a lucrative sponsorship deal with NFU Mutual.The home, business and motor insurance company, who have local offices in Downpatrick, Ballynahinch and Saintfield, have agreed to sponsor both the Bobby Dalzell Cup and Harry Clarke Cup.Details of the sponsorship were announced at the draw for the first round of the Bobby Dalzell Cup in Downpatrick last Thursday night.A delighted Newcastle League secretary said: We are thrilled that the NFU have agreed to sponsor our two main cup competitions for this season as well as taking up the option on any further sponsorship, he enthused.Downpatrick NFU branch manager Johnny McGreevy said the company was delighted to be able to support local sport.ldquoThe league has been a vital part of the local community for over  years and are known for their integrity and fairness, he said.ldquoAs a long-standing local business these are qualities we appreciate and reflect in our own activities.The draw for the first round of the Bobby Dalzell Cup, to be played on Saturday, September , is as follows:Kilmore Rec II v Castlewellan Forest, Saintfield United III v Valley Rangers Colts, Drumaness Mills Reserves v Ballynahinch United Swts, Ballyvea II v Ballyhalbert United, Tollymore Forest v Ballynahinch Young Men, Strangford v Dromara Village II.The draw for the second round was also made last week and is:Ardglass v Drumaness Mills Reserves or Ballynahinch United Swts, Rossglass County v Kilmore Rec II or Castlewellan Forest, Dundrum United v Ballynagross, Ballynahinch Olympic Town v Strangford or Dromara Village III, Carryduff Athletic v Saintfield United III or Valley Rangers Colts, Newcastle Swts v Mourne Rovers, Ballyvea II or Ballyhalbert United v Tollymore Forest or Ballynahinch Young Men, Celtic Bhoys v Killough..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/4th September 2019 Schoolboy.jpg","title":"Schoolboy motors his way into national driving competition final  ","story":"NEWCASTLE youth Evan Biggerstaff has made his way into the final of a national driving competition mdash despite being four years away from allowed to drive legally.The  year-old, who attends Shimna Integrated College, will be one of  finalists in his age category at the Young Driver Challenge .He is the first ever competitor from Northern Ireland to make the final which will be at the National Exhibition Centre in Birmingham where they will be crowned Britainrsquos best young driver by TV presenters and motoring experts Quentin Willson and Vicki Butler Henderson.All the competitors are under the legal driving age but the aim of the event is reinforce safe driving in prospective drivers at a young age.Pupils drive dual controlled Vauxhall Corsas on private land with a fully qualied instructor and learn the skills needed to be a safe and responsible driver.Despite ranging in age from just  to , all of the drivers have shown exceptional skill.The challenge is run by Young Driver, the UKrsquos largest provider of pre- driving lessons.Evan has had lessons at the Young Driverrsquos Belfast venue mdash one of more than  across the UK.He said: ldquoDriving is a skill that is, for most people, completely necessary in le but most people learn how to do it at  or older, so to have it nearly mastered by , I think will come in really useful later in my le.ldquoIrsquove always loved driving and didnrsquot think I was too bad at it for my age but I never suspected I would be ranked in the top  in the entire UK for my age group.

Image: BBC SpotlightAlthough it has long been known that Mr McGuinness was an IRA commander, he refused to discuss his actions in the organisation and insisted that he had never killed anyone.The images will be broadcast next Tuesday in the first part of one of BBC Northern Ireland’s most ambitious projects, a two-year re-examination of the Troubles which will run over seven programmes. .ev-modals .modal.in .modal-dialog .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget .photo-article-notier-default .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p @media.photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p #jp .main-content .ev-widget#sticky-footer .sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner p @media@media#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_text,#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_button #sticky-footer .fluid-container #sticky-footer .mobile-sticky-footer_button The first programme in the series also includes a former colonel saying that he was shown evidence by the RUC that Ian Paisley, the future First Minister, had supplied the money for explosives which caused one of the first explosions of the Troubles.The rare footage of an IRA car bomb being assembled was filmed in Londonderry in the early years of the Troubles.During the programme, former IRA bomber Shane Paul O’Doherty commentated on the pictures, saying: “There’s a huge charge there. A very dangerous alarm clock timer that could blow them all to hell.”When asked who he recognised, he said: “Well, there’s Martin....Martin McGuinness.” Mr O’Doherty said he was certain that it was the future deputy First Minister, saying “nobody walks like him, with a stoop in his back”.The car containing the bomb could be identied by its number plate. The BBC programme includes footage of the bomb exploding  minutes later in the centre of Mr McGuinness’s home city, Londonderry.The day after the bombing, Northern Ireland Prime Minister Brian Faulkner was brought to London to be told that security powers would be removed from Stormont and taken on by Westminster, leading to the collapse of Stormont.The Spotlight programme also includes footage of Mr McGuinness showing guns to young children and handing them bullets while seated in a car.Commentating on the film pictures, Mr O’Doherty said: “It’s Martin McGuinness. Very young, tall, handling weapons – a rle and a revolver – rolling up to a load of kids who are staring in the windows, craning in the windows and showing them bullets.“It’s horric, really, because here was McGuinness showing eight, nine and -year-olds guns and bullets that were exciting. People had a feeling that you were on television, you know, you were superstars.”Police had evidence Ian Paisley paid for Troubles bombing, says ex-colonel Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"The programme does not explain the background to the footage. However, Spotlight reporter Darragh MacIntyre said that it would be made clear in a future film in the series.He said that it had been shot by an American documentary maker and was never broadcast.Mr McIntyre, the reporter who in  exposed the then DUP MP Iris Robinson’s affair and financial dealings with property developers, said that the  footage “speaks to a time when within Free Derry and where in the north there was a sense that the IRA had it won, that they were the original guerrilla fighters and within a matter of months would see their way to a new united Ireland...so they were quite free - not just Martin McGuinness - when they were filming with this documentary team”.In , Mr McGuinness told the journalist Eamonn Mallie that he was “very proud that I was a part of the IRA in Derry” but declined to say whether he had ever killed anyone.Last month, former IRA member Kieran Conway said that as the IRA’s chief of staff at the time of the attack which killed Lord Mountbatten and others, including two children, Mr McGuinness had to “take responsibility” for what had happened that day.Another former IRA man, Anthony McIntyre, said of that attack: “If they knew about the children, and were quite prepared to go ahead and to sacrice their lives in order to get Mountbatten, then it’s a war crime”.However, Sinn Féin MLA and former IRA man Raymond McCartney denounced such criticism of Mr McGuinness, saying that he was “held in the highest of esteem across Ireland and internationally”.The Foyle MLA said: “It is reprehensible that anyone would make unfounded allegations against a man who is no longer here to defend himself.”Spotlight on The Troubles – a Secret History involve two -minute programmes and five hour-long episodes. The series has been overseen by editor Jeremy Adams, deputy editor Gwyneth Jones and producer Chris Thornton. It involves three senior Spotlight reporters – Darragh MacIntyre, Jenner O’Leary and Mandy McAuley.The first programme will be broadcast on BBC One NI on Tuesday at .pm and will also be shown on BBC

Of those,  have been empty for more than two years.Landlords will be given incentives to bring long term empty properties into use as the council says they attract crime and anti-social behaviour, drive down values and become ldquodetrimental to the lives of residents.Measures are set out in a draft strategy which the councilrsquos cabinet, on July , agreed to publish for public consultation.While the council wants landlords to accept help to get homes in use, the strategy says theauthority will take actionnecessary.Vale council deputy leader Cllr Lis Burnett told the meeting she was ldquostunned more than  homes in the Vale have been empty for more than two years.ldquoItrsquos absolutely staggering, she said. ldquoA strategy on a way we can tackle it is very welcome. Empty properties are detrimental to the lives of local residents.ldquoThey are often a magnet for crime and continue to blight neighbourhoods. They can also be a risk to emergency services.Some  Vale properties have been empty for more than  years, but most long-term empty properties are vacant for six months to two years. In April , the St Augustinersquos ward in Penarth had the most long-term empty homes, with  empty for more than six months and  for more than two years.Penarthrsquos Plymouth ward had more than  empty for more than six months, and more than  empty for more than two years.The proposed strategy calls on the council to maintain and improve its empty homes data, provide financial incentives to landlords, prioritise empty homes for enforcement action such as enforced sales and compulsory purchase orders, and to raise awareness of the issue of empty homes.The strategy says: ldquoA voluntary way forward to renovation and re-occupation is always the preferred option, and officers make all available endeavours to encourage and persuade such progress.ldquoHowever, in instances where owners cannot be traced or where exhaustive attempts to encourage and promote progress from known owners prove unproductive, orthere is an imminent risk to health and safety, there is little option but to proceed with a statutory solution,The draft empty homes strategy will be put to public consultation after the councilrsquos August recess. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Ms Parker and Mr Glover met several years ago when he trained her at their local gym. They then ended up unexpectedly working together later in le when Mr Glover changed jobs.Mr Glover said: ldquoIt was very tough for Julie before the transplant as she suffered with a genetic lung disease and her lungs slowly stopped working over a few years.\"It got to the point where she required an oxygen tank to be strapped to her back so that she could breathe. She never gave up and still worked and tried to do as much as she could and always kept a smile on her face.Ms Parker has a rare condition called Alpha--antitrypsin deficiency which means she lacks a protective enzyme inhibitor which makes her more vulnerable to smoke, dust and other toxic materials and increases the risk of lung disease. Because of the deficiency, Ms Parker was required to have a double lung transplant. Shortly after the transplant Ms Parker went to lunch with Mr Glover and he was amazed at how well she looked.He said: ldquoBecause I was seeing her every day, I knew her health was declining as a result of the lung disease. But I donrsquot think I was so aware of the extent until I saw her after the operation, and how healthy she looked.This isnrsquot the first challenge Mr Glover has taken on.In the past he has carried lbs up and down the highest mountain in Southern Britain, completed car dead lts and successfully performed  pull ups.The pair now plan to walk Pen-Y-Fan, the highest mountain in South Wales, together to raise money in the future once Ms Parker is well enough.Mr Glover set out to raise pound, and has now raised pound.Officially, Mr Glover had only  days to train for this challenge, enlisting friends to help him by sitting in the car and steering as he tows.ldquoI was getting up at :am to run around car parks towing the car with a harness before work,\" he said. \"I love setting myself challenges but donrsquot tend to do what everyone  does. So I will look for something a bit far out or invent my own and usually try and document them on video.All the proceeds from the day will go towards the charityrsquos Harefield Transplant Appeal, to raise funds for organ care systems to allow more patients to receive le-saving transplants.If yoursquod like to support Mr Glover in his marathon challenge his Justgiving page is: https:www.justgiving fundraising muscleworld article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Two-year-old Matilda Philpott who has Stickler Syndrome was joined by her two brothers, Oliva and Alfie, four-year-old Alice Haswell who has Goldenhar Syndrome camped out with her sister Scarlet, and -year-old Daisy Stacey who has Vacterl Association attended with her sister Molly.The weekend saw the families take part in a range of activities from archery, crafts and pop rockets to laser shooting, fire lighting, bush craft and raft making.The camp was the first time the referred children have been on a Scout Camp, something leaders have been hoping to achieve since the start of the group.Ruth Weltch, Group Scout Leader said: ldquoThe opportunity to regularly set up camp in the great outdoors is one of the main reasons young people enjoy Scouting so much and we wanted to give our children, who would not normally have the opportunity, the chance to take part in a weekend of outdoor activities and to sleep under canvas with their families.ldquoWe have been overwhelmed and humbled by the amount of help offered by leaders, not just from Cardf and Vale Scouts but from other scouting areas in Wales.This reflects the scope of the hospice itself which is open to all children with le limiting illnesses throughout Wales.ldquoWe have been able to give these children the opportunity to take part in activities not usually accessible to them and that we take for granted.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We speak to founder Daniel Crawford and his team about the journey so far A spark in the mind of Daniel Crawford as he studied for his masters degree in Glasgow just a few years ago has grown into a business at the sharp end of technology. axialD is tasked with turning the complicated and laborious process of converting D medical scans into D models – and producing them for use by surgeons and medical professionals. It’s an ever-growing business, spun out of Ulster University, which is expanding its reach across the UK, Ireland and now into the US where it’s targeting a burgeoning fresh marketplace. The company has been involved with Catalyst since , been directly involved with a host of its programmes, and is participating in the EU INTERREG funded North West Centre for Advanced Manufacturing , managed by the Special European Union Programmes Body . Catalyst is Northern Ireland’s leading technology hub, home to  companies and around , staff. Daniel has a strong team around him – growing to  staff based in Belfast city centre, including Niall Haslam, chief technology officer, Katie McKinley, head of new business and strategic partnerships and Cathy Coomber as operations manager. While studying medical visualisation and human anatomy in Glasgow, Daniel was exposed to the raft of imaging available – including CT, MRI and ultrasound, and began examining how the crucial data could be better used. The biomedical physics undergraduate grew the idea into his thesis – looking at converting D data sets and converting them into fully D printable files. “That allows us to turn images into D models to allow surgeons or registrars, to understand digital pathologies, before going in to theatre,” he said. “But we discovered it wasn’t just good for that and surgeons also wanted to get their hands on the D models.” That gave Daniel greater scope for developing the concept. In one early case, a surgeon was able to use one of the D prints to identy small fractures in a patient who had suffered a motorcycle crash, that weren’t initially apparent using more traditional methods. The company was thrust into Catalyst’s Springboard programme in  – a  week scheme which allowed a would-be entrepreneur, fresh out of university, access to business training and development, which included working with PathXL’s Stuart Harvey. From there, it was into the Halo programme – bringing axialD together with angel investors in order to get the start-up off the ground. It landed £, through Techstart and private investors, which allowed the company to get the ball rolling. Through Catalyst, Daniel also got the opportunity to visit MIT and the entrepreneurial development programme, Way to Scale, bringing axialD to Massachusetts and the Boston area – the global heart of the health technology sector. Niall Haslam is axialD’s chief technical officer. He said a Belfast and Boston partnership has helped strengthen the links between the cities, bringing firms from Northern Ireland to the US for both networking and scoping out the potential for setting up shop across the Atlantic. “The Way to Scale program brings entrepreneurs together. It’s a great networking opportunity,” Niall says. axialD is now a partner in the EU INTERREG-funded NW CAM, which brings together a network of research institutes, universities and enterprises to carry out research in advanced manufacturing. It is working with Ulster University on a number of projects, including looking at developing custom designed jigs for hospitals to produce D models. Cathy Coomber has been with axialD for three years. “What we have done in that time is looking at standardising the processes,” she says. “Biomedical engineers from Ulster University and those across the UK are producing data, manually segmenting thousands of medical images in order to help them develop an algorithm. “That allows us to massively improve our standardised process and reduce the time involved in producing those files.” That could mean reducing the time down from up to five hours, to as little as an hour. “When the company started, Daniel was able to get those early users excited in Glasgow, and then setting up in Belfast there were key surgeons which helped set the pace,” Katie McKinley, head of new business and strategic partnerships said. The company has since been involved with NHS frameworks as a means to help remove as many bottlenecks as possible. This involves developing and marketing the products to the NHS and HSC in the Republic – helping them to learn about the product, the process and what area of specialism it can be used in. “In the last  months with the development of the algorithms, we are moving in to the US,” Katie said. “We’re seeing a lot of growth in the US.” And the axialD team is also growing fast. “We have  staff at the moment but are looking to expand in  months,” Daniel said. “That includes new staff in the US to help grow and manage that market as we further expand our software team back home.” The success of axialD mirrors the overall success of Catalyst, since its inception  years ago. It’s an independent not-for-profit organisation across its four sites – including its largest base at the Titanic Quarter in Belfast, alongside its Londonderry hub, Ballymena, along with the Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub at Danske Bank in Belfast city centre.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/jm_1.jpg","title":"how do you retain staff and keep them enjoying their job","story":"Posted on Wednesday September  by Ulster Business With such intense competition for talent, the challenge for employers isn’t just finding prospective candidates, it’s also keeping them, writes John Moore, managing director of Hays NI Astonishingly, almost half of professionals surveyed in the Hays What Workers Want Report said that they left at least one new job within the first  months because it didn’t match expectations formed during the application process. A signicant number of our employees at Hays have been with us for , ,  and even  years, and we pride ourselves on growing our own talent and promoting from within. Although there are times when employees leave due to circumstances employers can’t control, organisations can create the right conditions to retain their staff for as long as possible. We believe there are three key areas. A sense of purpose Across ages, cultures and sectors, professionals need to get up in the morning knowing that they can make a dference. No matter how big or small, recognising a clear and meaningful purpose in your role is a huge driver for staff. Communication is key for employers. By prioritising employee progression, offering regular feedback and communicating the wider objectives of the business, employers can ensure their staff come to work each day with a strong purpose. Variety each day While not every task can be exciting, and some parts of a job will inevitably be more stimulating than others,the mundane becomes the usual, employees will think about moving on. Injecting iety into each week and staying interested at work partly falls on employees themselves, who can proactively seize opportunities. But a good employer should also push their staff and encourage them to work outside of their comfort zones. This ensures professionals can keep growing and developing within an organisation rather than move where. A strong network The people we work with have a huge bearing on our happiness levels at work. You simply can’t stay in a role long-termyou don’t enjoy working with those around you, so the importance and impact of these relationships are not to be underrated. Employers can help their staff develop a network of inspiring and admirable colleagues from their first day by making sure they receive proper introductions and support contacts. Workers who have these strong bonds feel a greater sense of belonging which keeps them wanting to work in their organisation. With these three points in mind, it’s important to consider how someone’s organisation and role makes them feel, rather than just how impactful their salary or bonus might be. After all, this is what can’t easily be replicated across organisations and can keep an employee with an organisation throughout their career.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"new  bedroom boutique hotel planned for belfast","story":"Posted on Wednesday September  by John Mulgrew A listed Belfast building could become a new hotel and restaurant as part of wider plans for a £m revamp of the city centre. Tribeca Belfast, formerly Royal Exchange, will see UK developer Castlebrooke redevelop much of the north side of the city centre. It’s made a number of amendments and changes to the development, most notably revising back from a formerly retail-led scheme to one with fewer shops. As part of the revised plans it wants to turn the listed former Assembly Rooms building at the corner of North Street and Waring Street into a new -bedroom hotel, with a restaurant and bars. That would involve knocking down part of the newer extension to the building, including the rear part of the former Northern Bank and the adjacent - North Street to “accommodate the new extension to form the proposed boutique hotel”. “The proposals for the existing building are similar in scope to that which was included as part of the extant approval. It is proposed to conservatively repair the existing historic fabric of the former Northern Bank,” a design statement says. “A key feature of the proposed extension is that the interface with the rearelevation of the existing listed bank building will be improved by setting back the footprint of the proposed extension so that the north west corner of the original building is readable.” The scheme includes the re-use and adaptation of the existing building as well as an extension on the footprint of the existing s extension on North Street. The extension will be set over five floors, with a rooftop bar, while upper floors are set back with metal cladding to the facades to “reduce the overall massing of the building and reflect the roofing materials or upper story treatment of surrounding buildings”. Tribeca Belfast includes development around Royal Avenue, Donegall Street, North Street, Garfield Street and High Street. Castlebrooke Investments says it is now committed to bringing North Street Arcade back into use in a new format, with space designed for independent retailers. This summer the developer ran a fresh public consultation amid revised plans for the scheme, which included signicantly reducing a huge -storey building to around , retaining additional facades and dropping plans for an underground car park.

Before starting as a trainee solicitor in a City of London firm, I initially worked as a paralegal for three months in a law firm in Perth, enjoying the lestyle and dferent culture of le in Australia, and then spent a further three months travelling in Australia, New Zealand and Asia. After ing to London, I qualied as a solicitor and then spent eight years working in the real estate department of a London law firm. With two young children, we decided to move back to Northern Ireland in  when I joined Cleaver Fulton Rankin as an assistant solicitor. I have been here ever since and was made a director in . What have you found the most challenging during your years of business, so far  As we will all be aware, the real estate market can be a bit of a rollercoaster. Having been involved in some fantastic deals here in Northern Ireland, largely courtesy of the peace idend, this all came crashing to a halt in . For real estate lawyers in particular, this presented a fresh challenge in terms of expanding client base and ensuring that our teams were kept busy. For a number of years I spent more time advising clients on restructuring, acting for administrators or receivers in selling off assets and working on refinancing transactions. This proved to be a huge contrast to the positive and very visible growth in the economy seen in the previous years. Thankfully, the real estate sector again currently seems to be enjoying good growth with high rates offor investors. However, it has to be said that the lack of political leadership here does still give cause for concern. How would you describe your management style  The most important resource that we have is our young people, so I hopefully lead by example and seek to encourage them. In my view the carrot is always better than the stick. What would you changeyou could go back and do it all again  I have spent over  years now practising law, butI could go back to university again, rather than doing a law degree, I would have studied history. It would have meant an extra year spent in training, but I think it may have kept my interest slightly more than lectures on tort and equity. Have you done it all on your own  No, absolutely not. One of the main reasons for coming back to Northern Ireland was, with a young family, we had the benefit here of family support. My parents in particular, played a key role in helping with child care at a time when I was trying to establish my career. I never underestimate the dficulties facing working parents with young children who deserve all the credit and support that they can get. A strong support network is also very important in the office and I am lucky to have the benefit of some great lawyers around me to whom I can turn to for help when needed. How would you like your business to be remembered  As a leading commercial law firm in Northern Ireland that is independent and innovative provides high quality legal advice to its clients conducts business in a socially responsible and ethical matter has a strong commercial awareness and specialist legal professionals. What piece of advice would you give to a -year-old you  Believe in yourself, be flexible and above all when opportunities present themselves to you, grab them.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/da1.jpg","title":"clarity telecom building telecoms from the ground up","story":"Posted on Monday September  by Ulster Business Clarity Telecom helps businesses of all shapes and sizes develop their communications needs from the ground up, and is now rolling out its fast-growing cloud software across the UK and Ireland. Founder and managing director David Whelan speaks to Ulster Business about a business which boasts the right tools for the job David Whelan’s vision and mantra for what is now one of the leading telecoms businesses is clear – telecommunications services are only as good as the foundations on which they are built, with engineering front and centre. He’s the entrepreneur behind Clarity Telecom – a successful Belfast-based full-service telecommunications solutions company with almost  years under its belt, helping develop top-end connectivity – including lines, calls, mobile, broadband and cloud software – for businesses across Ireland and the UK. And for David, telecoms is all about engineering at the core of finding the best comprehensive solution to its customers, having the right tools for the job, and having world class people. For Clarity Telecom, it’s about developing a bespoke system for companies, focusing on engineering from day one. Since its inception in , Clarity Telecom has grown to have a greater engineering capability than any other independent telecommunications company in Northern Ireland, and is now rolling out its leading byphone VoIPsystem throughout the UK and Ireland. David also says through Clarity Telecom and its burgeoning byphone technology, the company could double revenues in the next three years as well as growing its workforce. “The phone network stops at a plug in the wall and from that point on, you have to provide the infrastructure and management,” David says. “What we do is focus on the engineering. It’s all about how well it works and adapts to your business. “By focusing on that we are looking at the way things are being built, and we can then get insights on how we can change and improve things.” Led by engineering, the Clarity team is driving change within the telecoms industry ensuring client infrastructure is fit for purpose and for the future. That starts with assessing a business’s needs, making sure the network is suitable, reviewing the workforce needs and bandwidth requirements. From there, Clarity Telecom can develop a bespoke solution – from cabling, to switching, cloud services, routing and phone systems. Clarity Telecom now has a team of  staff – a third of whom work directly within the engineering side of the business. But that number could grow further still, as the company expands its business across Northern Ireland, and develops its byphone technology. The company developed its subsidiary, Voxbit, in  – specically to design engineering solutions. And through that has come one of its most successful products, byphone. A simple to use VoIP , byphone is a drag and drop system that allows users to configure their own phone set up suited to the exact needs of the organisation and enables a range of analysis tools that can help business owners drive up efficiencies. “In  as VoIP started coming along, I realised that was a signicant opportunity,” David says. “Where the communications industry is going is into the cloud. It’s going from traditional storage within buildings, into something in the cloud. The traditional telephone systems are evolving. “We started making a series of innovations surrounding cloud technology. We realised you can make it simpler – we were asking ourselves, can you make it work without a manual, for example. “If you can, in the same way as Apple’s iPhone made things easier for users, people will start using the services. It’s about making everyone’s le easier. “The end user wants to be able to use the system easily, from managing their telephone number, to having access to voicemail. It’s about the ‘power of simple’. “We now have around  resellers for the byphone system in the UK, and we are looking at trebling or quadrupling those sales,” he said. One of Clarity Telecom’s customers is Mid  East Antrim Borough Council. The firm was tasked with bringing together the complex communication needs of the new ‘super council’ following the amalgamation in . “With bringing three councils together, one of the main problems was having a single phone number that people could call. If you have numerous sites, spread across three council areas, that would involve a lot of rip and replace,” David says. “But we gave them one telephone number and then managed the routing to all those bits of equipment across the council areas.” Hotel giant Andras House – which operates seven hotels and , rooms in Belfast including the Crowne Plaza at Shaw’s Bridge and the new Hampton Hilton – is also another major customer. “Businesses trust us to be able to provide the engineering solutions in order for them to run their companies,” David says. So, why should a business consider Clarity Telecom for its crucial and comprehensive connectivity needs  David says Clarity is all about improving how companies interact with their customers – making it easier, and thus, improving revenue and sales. “As you manage your telephone connections you become better at dealing with your customers – you become more efficient at dealing with them, and they will have a better experience. It’s about improving customer contact. “As a business you are able to do a lot more, such as listening to call recordings, access to statistics and using data which will help manage that contact, as well as saving on costs and making your business more efficient. “What solution depends on your business. That is where we come along. We never put a system in without doing a full engineering visit.” Some of the connectivity includes the ability to connect landline with mobile phones, call forwarding and being able to access voicemails as digital recordings, by phone or computer. “When companies deal with us, they can come along and say ‘this is what we are trying to do’, and we are able to work the engineering and infrastructure, before then providing the services,” David says. “It’s also about fighting against the view that it’s all about price. Yes, you have to be competitive, but you need the right infrastructure. For example,a shop loses connectivity for two days, then they lose two days of sales, simply because they don’t have the back-up for the credit card payment system. “It’s about getting businesses to think about the infrastructure and all of the issues. It’s not just about how cheap you can make a call. It’s about how customers can engage with your business – and we are at the heart of making that happen.” For further information, contact Clarity Telecom on    or visit www.clarityteleView all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/greggssss.jpg","title":"greggs to open new belfast city centre store","story":"Posted on Tuesday  September  by John Mulgrew Greggs looks set to open a new store in the heart of Belfast city centre, it can be revealed.
