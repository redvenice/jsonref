Also in the picture are the Queen and Sarah Ferguson\u0027s older sister Jane. A friend of the Duchess said today that she believed the picture was taken  at the exclusive Guards Polo Club at Windsor. Her late father, Ronald Ferguson, had helped to start the club together with Prince Philip. It wasn’t the first time the pair had met as Sarah had moved in royal circles since she was baby. But the friend added: ‘Even at the age of ten Andrew and Sarah knew that they would marry!’          Scott was  extremely charming, spoke 10 languages and his diplomatic experience meant he was suave and comfortable around royalty                                                    He arrived in London via Paris on a train reserved for German generals, smuggling important intelligence reports in 1941 and became the private secretary of King Peter of Yugoslavia, who was also living in exile in a suite at Claridge\u0027s.He spent several years working for King Peter before setting himself up as a photographer. Voynovich took his small Leica camera everywhere and often his hosts at weekend country house parties would invite him to take pictures.He was a friend of Sir \u0027Jock\u0027 Colville, Princess Elizabeth\u0027s private secretary, so it was not long before she saw some of these pictures. Through Colville, Elizabeth requested Voynovich photograph her in uniform during one of her first Trooping the Colour ceremonies.   This launched his photographic career and he changed his name to John Scott to help him get work.The auction takes place on June 14. Moment masked thug tries to break into car using huge macheteDisgusting moment patient has hundreds of blackheads removedCCTV footage of ISIS member Safaa Boular near the MI6 buildingShocking moment jilted boyfriend shoots his former girlfriend deadRobbers flee on moped after robbery at Regent St jewellery shopDisgusting moment rats crawl over burger buns at Burger KingShocking footage of mass brawl between twelve peopleShocking moment TV reporter robbed at gunpoint while filmingHammer wielding gangs clash outside of a primary schoolFootage just moments before thieves steal a £15,000 cameraSeveral countries in talks to create migrant camp outside the EUAmong the collection are dozens of snaps of a young Princess Anne, often with her horses. She was crowned the \u0027busiest Royal\u0027 for the second time after clocking up 455 official engagements in 2017. Anne put her younger family members to shame with a dizzying roster of UK gala dinners, receptions and charity events - as well as a further 85 engagements overseas          Prince Charles, in muddy polo gear, speaks to one of his dogs at Smiths Lawn Polo Ground Windsor in the 1970s. In 2005, and after 40 years and quite a few fractures, the Prince of Wales announced his retirement from polo - the sport he once described as \u0027my one great extravagance\u0027. He played in matches from the age of 15 and as a child watched his father play          This unusually candid snap of the Queen kneeling on the grass with a reclining Lord Mountbatten (left) at a horse show reveals how remarkably unruffled she could be. Surrounded by her friends and family, she calmly watched the event - despite the crowd gathered behind herThe picture that made him: A young Princess Elizabeth saw some of Colonel Vassa Voynovich\u0027s pictures of her friends as he was a friend of Sir \u0027Jock\u0027 Colville, her private secretary. Through Colville, Elizabeth requested he photograph her in uniform during one of her first Trooping the Colour ceremonies in 1951. The success of this image launched his photographic career and he changed his name to John Scott to help him get work          Another photo shows a bearded Prince Charles, aged in his 20s, on horseback looking strikingly similar to his son Prince Harry. Wearing a flat cap and a tweed jacket, the keen horseman has often taken part in races and polo matches. Last year he opened up about the emotional moment he cradled his  racehorse Allibar when it collapsed and died during training in 1981          Prince Philip cooling off after a polo match. Scott, an ex-cavalry officer with equestrian expertise, was at home capturing Ascot, Badminton and the Windsor Horse Show, and shared the Royals\u0027 passion for horses. He was also extremely charming, spoke 10 languages and his diplomatic experience meant he was suave and comfortable around royalty          Queen Elizabeth, right, is pictured enjoying a conversation with her mother while out with her camera. The pair shared a close relationship, particularly after the death of King George VI, but aside from a love of horses did not share many common interests.

He attended a lunch held at the 20th Century Fox studio in Hollywood, California, where he met film royalty such as Cary Grant, Charlton Heston and Lauren Bacall, along with the M*A*S*H stars - most of whom were still in costume. According to a fansite, he watched an episode of the series being filmed along with an episode of Charlie\u0027s Angels          The Prince of Wales is also pictured in the archive meeting other actresses and actors in Hollywood in 1977 - three years before he first started courting Diana. His visit made headlines across the country and saw hundreds of fans turn out to catch a glimpse of the Royal on US soil          Prince Charles (centre with his back turned) meeting Bionic Man actor Lee Majors with his then-wife, Charlie\u0027s Angels actress Farrah Fawcett-Majors, and movie royalty Sophia Loren  and Cary Grant at a star-studded Hollywood party in 1977          One of the photos shows the Queen during a royal visit to then-Communist Yugoslavia in 1972. It was the monarch\u0027s first visit to an eastern bloc country and she was greeted by President Josip Tito in full military uniform. She went on the state visit with husband Prince Philip and daughter Princess Anne and returned the favour when she invited Tito to Buckingham Palace in 1978          President Tito, pictured during The Queen\u0027s state visit to Yugoslavia in 1972, pulled out all the stops to make the trip a memorable one including raising the Union Jack flag. A former communist revolutionary, Tito led a successful resistance group against the Nazis during World War Two and became prime minister of his country in 1944, before becoming its first president in 1953. It is said on his return visit to London he impressed the royals by playing Chopin on the piano          A candid snap of Andrew and Edward from the 1970\u0027s. Auctioneer David Lay, who is selling the archive, said: \u0027During my many years as an auctioneer we have handled quite a few photographic collections but this is undoubtedly one of the most remarkable archives I have ever seen. In the UK and indeed many other parts of the world, the fascination with the British Royals is unwavering and here we have an archive that documents four decades of their lives\u0027          A smiling Queen at Balmoral in the early 1950\u0027s. Auctioneer Mr Lay added: \u0027The breadth and quality of the images is superb so really it is unparalleled in my experience. Looking through all the images in this archive, covering almost 40 years, it is possible to see the Royal family grow up before ones eyes. Everything is here, from childhood to maturity, diplomatic Royal engagements with all their pomp and ceremony to unguarded family moments between the Queen and her children. It is an astonishing collection of images\u0027          Princess Margaret with Lord Snowdon and Prince Andrew.A remarkable archive of over 4,000 photos of the Royals taken over four decades by a trusted photographer has emerged for sale for £10,000.The photos include iconic snaps of Prince Charles and Princess Diana on honeymoon as well as intimate shots of the Queen and other prominent Royals relaxing  A very young Katharine Worsely, the Duchess of Kent. The Duchess, now 85, met Prince Edward, Duke of Kent, the eldest son of Prince George, Duke of Kent, and Princess Marina of Greece and Denmark, while he was based at Catterick Camp.  On June 8 1961, the couple married at York Minster and Princess Anne was one of the bridesmaids. Guests included actors Noël Coward and Douglas Fairbanks Jr. as well as members of the British, Greek, Danish, Norwegian, Yugoslavian, Romanian and Spanish royal families. The Duchess later gained attention for her conversion to Catholicism in 1994, the first member of the Royal Family to convert publicly since the passing of the Act of Settlement 1701          Role reversal: The Queen is pictured snapping away on her camera while in the countryside with her family. She often used a German designed Leica to take her snaps and was regularly photographed taking pictures of horse events          A young Prince Charles on the Royal yacht Bloodhound in Scotland. The classic 1930s yacht, which was owned by Her Majesty and Prince Philip from 1962 to 1969, was where Charles and his sister Anne learned how to sail. Prince Philip had much success competing with her at the famous Cowes Week Regatta around the Isle of Wight, and she was also used to take the entire family, along with the Britannia, to Scotland\u0027s Western Isles for their annual holiday          The Royals have many interests and this photo of Prince Charles and sister Princess Anne from the early 1960s shows they grew up with a keen interest in boats. The pair are pictured on a rubber speedboat, with Charles appearing to be tinkering with the engine while Anne retrieves an oar to manually move the vessel          Princess Margaret\u0027s relationship with her husband eventually became strained and they are pictured here deep in conversation, with both looking concerned. The marriage broke down in 1976 after Margaret was pictured on the front page of a national newspaper with younger lover Sir Roddy Llewellyn, 17 years her junior, and they were orced two years later          A young Princess Anne is pictured in a casual moment chatting to a member of the public while dressed in what appears to be a 1970s style, wearing a cravat and jeans. The photo was taken around the time of a kidnapping attempt on the Princess in which Ian Ball stopped her limousine and shot her protection officer in a failed £2million ransom plot          Just like recent events with the birth of Prince Louis, a new royal baby was a major event for the media. Here Princess Margaret, right, and her husband Lord Snowden, left, are pictured taking their newborn son David home after his birth in November 1961. The Princess had two children with her husband, a photographer previously known as Antony Armstrong-Jones before he was given a title          A young Prince Edward and his cousin Sarah Armstrong Jones, daughter of Princess Margaret, are pictured here playing together at a horse show in the late 1960s. The candid series of photographs show the Royal Family at some of their most relaxed moments and reveals how their children were just like any other, particularly in this image where the prince appears to be trying to protect his hair from his cousin          This series of snaps taken of Princess Diana were commissioned for a set of stamps issued on her 21st birthday, a year after she married Prince Charles. Her expression looks somewhat uncomfortable and possibly reflects her feelings within the Royal Family, with problems quickly surfacing in her marriage to Charles, which would end in orce after 15 years          The Queen, right, and her sister Princess Margaret, left, pictured together in the 1970s. Reflecting how they have often been portrayed in the media, the monarch looks stern and serious while Margaret has a more relaxed expression. The pair are believed to be pictured at a horse show, which they grew up attending together          The Queen is pictured by Mr Scott here at one of her favourite events, the Badminton Horse Trials, in 1952. She even moved the trials to Windsor for one year in 1955 so they could also stage the second European Championships. The car parks, tradestands, arena and cross country courses fit into an area of approximately 500 acres of Badminton Park          Scott (pictured) lived an extraordinary life himself as he was a Yugoslavian aristocrat who fled his native Serbia during the Second World War after it was occupied by the Nazis. His actual name was Colonel Vassa Voynovich and he commanded a platoon on the Russian front aged just 17 during the First World War. An ex-cavalry officer with equestrian expertise, he was at home capturing Ascot, Badminton and the Windsor Horse Show, and shared the Royals\u0027 passion for horses. He was also extremely charming, spoke 10 languages and his diplomatic experience meant he was suave and comfortable around royalty          Prince Charles and Princess Diana do not look much like a happy couple here pictured on a trip to Wales in the early 1980s. Although the couple\u0027s marriage initially seemed strong, problems began to develop after five years and both had affairs, with Charles seeing his now wife Camilla, leading to Diana saying there were \u0027three people in the marriage\u0027 a decade later  Princess Diana looks a lot happier in these photos, including an iconic shot with Charles  as they walked around Balmoral on their honeymoon in 1981, left, when she was just 20 years old, and alongside the Duchess of York, who also endured her own difficulties with the Royals, at the Guard\u0027s Polo Club, Egham in 1982           Charles is pictured dancing with scantily clad women at a carnival in Brazil surrounded by a mass of press, more dancers in elaborate gold coloured clothing and a huddle of happy revellers. Draped in a smart double breasted tuxedo with large bow-tie, Charles cut a dashing figure with his hair swept over in a side parting style, which has, ironically, become fashionable again and was worn similarly by many male attendees at his son Prince Harry\u0027s recent wedding to Meghan Markle          Saintly smile: Sharing a laugh with Mother Theresa in Calcutta in 1978, Charles donned a red rose in his lapel and a smart grey day suit with matching neck tie. Years later Princess Diana would have a spiritual awakening at the hands of Mother Theresa and write, in a letter to her confidant Paul Burrell: \u0027Today, something very profound touched my life.

who qualified in Chennai, India - denied wrongdoing. Today the service said there was no impairment of Dr Laxman\u0027s fitness to practise and cleared her to return to work at another hospital.The tribunal cleared Dr Laxman of misconduct and said her fitness to practise was not impaired.It ruled the decision to proceed with a natural birth was \u0027negligent and fell below the standards ordinarily to be expected\u0027 but did not amount to serious misconduct.The panel\u0027s written decision said: \u0027The failing which the tribunal has found proved was not sustained, persistent or repeated, but rather a single error of judgement made in very difficult circumstances.\u0027The tribunal was satisfied that throughout the attempted delivery of baby B, Dr Vilvanathan Laxman believed that she was acting in both patient A\u0027s and baby B\u0027s best interests, and that she genuinely believed that proceeding with a vaginal delivery was the optimum course to take in the circumstances which existed at the time.\u0027 EU will \u0027dig its own grave\u0027 if it tries to punish Italy over...PM vows target for getting net immigration below 100,000 a...Share this articleDr Laxman said she believed the baby would have died had a Caesarean section been carried out.But at a finding of facts hearing, panel chairman Tim Bradbury said: \u0027It was Dr Laxman\u0027s decision in this regard that was to dictate her subsequent actions and the course of events which ultimately led to Baby B being decapitated.\u0027The Tribunal was in no doubt that throughout her involvement in the attempted delivery of Baby B, she was endeavouring to achieve the best outcome for Patient A and Baby B.\u0027However the central issue in this case is whether Dr Laxman\u0027s decision to attempt a vaginal delivery of Baby B rather than an immediate caesarean section under general anaesthetic was clinically indicated or whether the only proper course in the circumstances would have been to proceed to an immediate Caesarean section.\u0027Dr Laxman had not sufficiently addressed in her mind the risk to Baby B by proceeding with a vaginal delivery - namely the risk of head entrapment and the delay this complication would inevitably cause.          Ninewells Hospital in Dundee where the woman, 30, went to have her baby delivered when she went into premature labour\u0027Further, the Tribunal found that she embarked upon a vaginal delivery without a proper basis for concluding that a delivery was imminent or that there were any characteristics present that might be regarded as favourable to a vaginal delivery.\u0027The Tribunal did not accept that in these circumstances a caesarean section was the appropriate mode of delivery for foetal wellbeing. The Tribunal did not accept that the circumstances were such that Dr Laxman should have assumed that a caesarean section would have no prospect of success.\u0027The Tribunal determined that at this time Dr Laxman\u0027s priority was a live delivery and there was also a reasonable prospect that Baby B could have survived following an immediate caesarean section under general anaesthetic.\u0027The decision to proceed with vaginal delivery represented a failure in her clinical decision-making on the evidence available to her at the time.\u0027In today\u0027s tribunal decision, the panel added: \u0027The tribunal is satisfied that Dr Vilvanathan Laxman has expressed genuine and appropriate remorse for what happened, and she candidly accepted responsibility as the consultant in charge in theatre that day. \u0027The events in question are likely to have had a profound impact on Dr Laxman, as they surely will have for all others who were present in theatre that day. She has learnt from this unfortunate episode and that the likelihood of it being repeated is extremely remote. \u0027Further, at no point has Dr Vilvanathan Laxman sought to blame others for what happened or to minimise her actions.\u0027It was ruled that Dr Laxman should not receive a formal warning over the case and an interim order on her medical registration has now been revoked.The report said: \u0027In all the circumstances, the tribunal has concluded that Dr Vilvanathan Laxman\u0027s conduct did not fall so far short of the standards of conduct reasonably to be expected of a doctor as to amount to serious misconduct.\u0027In respect of patient safety, the tribunal was satisfied that Dr Vilvanathan Laxman does not currently present a risk to patients.\u0027Dr Vilvanathan Laxman\u0027s wrong decision related to an isolated, single incident in an otherwise unblemished career.\u0027The panel concluded: \u0027Nothing in this determination should detract from the fact that on March 16 2014 Dr Vilvanathan Laxman made a significant error of judgement which had serious consequences and a profound impact upon patient A and for which Dr Vilvanathan Laxman bears a heavy responsibility.\u0027 The tragedy occurred on March 16 2014 whilst Laxman was working at Ninewells Hospital in Dundee with a team of other doctors.The woman\u0027s waters had broken early at 25 weeks and upon examination her unborn baby was found to have a prolapsed cord, was in a breech position whilst the mother\u0027s cervix was between 2-4cm dilated. It can be 10cm fully dilated and the patient was told by doctors she might have to undergo a C-section.Laxman had started work at 8.30am the previous day and went home at 6pm for five hours before returning to the hospital at 11pm. She was told about the patient at 2am and was subsequently paged at 8.30am to take a look at her when her condition became more critical.Later, whilst discussing the method of delivery, Laxman told a colleague: \u0027We are not doing a C-section - you would never do a C-section of a 25-weeker.\u0027 She then carried out a vaginal examination of the woman and told her \u0027to push.\u0027Mr Bradbury added: \u0027Initially the body of Baby B descended without difficulty however, the arms were raised and the hands were behind the head which required manipulation by Dr Laxman for their delivery.\u0027Thereafter, Baby B\u0027s head became trapped in the uterus with his neck within Patient A\u0027s cervix.\u0027There then followed what was to become, in the Tribunal\u0027s view, an increasingly desperate attempt to deliver Baby B\u0027s head. \u0027Because of the pain and distress that Patient A was by this time experiencing the decision was made to administer a general anaesthetic following which further attempts were made to incise Patient A\u0027s cervix and extract Baby B by means of traction.\u0027While Patient A was under general anaesthetic, Dr Laxman continued to make attempts to deliver Baby B by traction and ultimately Baby B\u0027s head became detached from his body. \u0027The evidence suggests, and the Tribunal accepts, that by the time that Baby B\u0027s head became detached from his body he had already died.\u0027Even on her own initial assessment that Patient A\u0027s cervix was 4cm dilated this should have indicated to Dr Laxman that this was insufficient to deliver Baby B\u0027s head.\u0027She should have appreciated that there would be a real and significant risk of complications arising during delivery, namely head entrapment, having had regard to the likely diameter of the baby\u0027s head at this gestation.\u0027Dr Laxman made a decision which was not clinically indicated, in that she failed to perform an immediate delivery by caesarean section under general anaesthetic and instead proceeded with a vaginal delivery.\u0027Her conduct set in train a course of events which ultimately resulted in the decapitation of Baby B and to this extent contributed to that decapitation. \u0027But for Dr Laxman\u0027s error of judgement in this regard, the decapitation would not have occurred.\u0027Laxman will now face further disciplinary hearings which will decide whether she could be struck off.She told the hearing: \u0027I was trying to deliver a live baby, I was trying really hard, possibly too hard. \u0027I did not intend to harm mum or the baby. I am distraught at the outcome and I am very sorry it did not come out the way I meant it.\u0027"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/05/19/4CF1F7BD00000578-5809377-image-m-4_1528223340106.jpg","title":"Kenneth Cole deletes tone deaf tweet calling Kate Spade inspiring accessory","story":"    Kenneth Cole wrote then deleted this tweet on Tuesday morning after news of Kate Spade\u0027s death emerged           Spade and Cole are pictured in 2002 at an event in New York City.

It is unclear whether Argentina will play another warm-up, or if it will arrive in Moscow ahead of scheduleThe grassroots movement advocates boycotts, estment and sanctions against Israel in what supporters say is a way to promote Palestinian rights through nonviolent means. Israel says the campaign goes beyond Israeli occupation of lands claimed by the Palestinians and masks a deeper aim of delegitimising or even destroying the country. It has formed a government ministry whose primary mission is to combat the boycott movement.The Argentinean move, which featured on the front pages of all the major Israeli dailies, raised fears that it could serve as a template for future boycotts of Jerusalem, most notably next year\u0027s scheduled hosting of the popular Eurovision song contest.Argentina opens its Group D campaign in Russia against Iceland on June 16.

They pulled up to his car as it was stopped by the side of the road near to some traff­ic lights, which were green.\u0027They smashed the window which clearly startled Michael as it would anyone — then he jumped out the passenger’s side and they followed him round.The witness added: \u0027People who saw it were shocked too. No one went to help when it was happening, but it happened so fast, they were gone in seconds. They had hammers and I’m sure I saw one of them with a big knife.\u0027  In a chilling illustration of the moped gang crisis, a young woman was fighting for her life last night after her mobile was snatched by moped-riding thieves. And a motorcycle gang targeted yet another luxury store in London yesterday with pedestrians forced to try to tackle them, wrestling one suspect to the ground.Campaigners and politicians warned the attacks were matched by disturbing rises in stabbings, drug crime and gang violence.London now has a higher murder rate than New York, with more than 70 killings so far this year. Knife crime has also led to the deaths of a 17-year-old boy in Ipswich and of 15-year-olds in Sheffield and Wolverhampton.After an extraordinary day of violence, including the attack on Michael McIntyre, it emerged: Scotland Yard has logged 22,025 motorcycle muggings in 12 months – a rise of 50 per centOfficers revealed that city gangs had set up 650 ‘county line’ networks to sell drugs in towns and villages Police were hunting moped robbers who targeted comedian Michael McIntyre A rank-and-file police leader said officers were wary of chasing them for fear of possible disciplinary action A think-tank said shop theft cost £6.3billion last year – or £270 for every household.David Green, of the Civitas think-tank, said: ‘A fall in police numbers combined with increasingly violent drug gangs has meant some parts of our cities resemble TV’s The Wire. Violent crime is rising and knife crime is rising as gangs fight over drug territories.’Experts believe a booming illicit drugs market – notably in crack cocaine – is fuelling much of the violence. They have also highlighted the middle-class appetite for regular cocaine.The Metropolitan Police figures showed that crimes committed using mopeds, scooters and motorcycles soared by 50 per cent in the year to May, to 22,025.               As the thugs fled, the 42-year-old rushed round to the passenger side of the vehicle to comfort his son (pictured), who is understood to have been in the car at the time of the attackMr McIntyre, 42, who is worth £38million, was waiting outside a school in northLondon, when he was robbed at around 2pm on Monday.Police are investigating whether the moped gang followed him from his £5.7million Hampstead mansion with the aim of grabbing his Rolex or if he was the victim of a random attack because he was driving a luxury car in a wealthy London suburb. The father-of-two was picking up Oscar, 10, who with his brother Lucas, 13, are the source of a lot of his material in his much-loved stand-up routines. Speaking after the incident, Mr McIntyre said: \u0027I can\u0027t really say what\u0027s happening, we\u0027re in the process of sorting this out. There\u0027s been an incident and we\u0027re dealing with it.\u0027I need to find out the best thing to do here, I can\u0027t say anything. This is not a wind up, it\u0027s ongoing and I can\u0027t share the details.\u0027 Journalist Jane Moore, who is married to the comic\u0027s agent Gary Farrow, believes Michael may have been targeted as soon as his son was in the car knowing the star would not risk them harming him.She told ITV\u0027s Loose Women: \u0027How terrifying - his 10-year-old son is in the front seat of the car, and this guy pulls up alongside and he\u0027s got a hammer. To smash a window like that it takes about 10 or 15 goes. Can you imagine how terrified?\u0027They probably targeted him because he had a child in his car, because as a parent you\u0027re not going to take anybody on, you\u0027re going to say, \u0027have whatever you want, don\u0027t hurt me or my child\u0027\u0027,She added: \u0027Somebody please do something about these gangs\u0027 while fellow panelist Anna Richardson said father and son should seek counsellling and revealed she had needed help after she was robbed in a hotel room in 2016. Mr McIntyre was in the Range Rover with his ten-year-old son  in the front passenger seat, one witness told the Mail. They originally claimed the star fell out of the driver\u0027s side and appeared to try to fight off the robbers during the 30-second attack.He then rushed round to the passenger side of the vehicle to comfort his shaken up son and give him a hug.A friend said today Michael, who is currently on the UK leg of his Big World Tour, is \u0027very shaken by the whole experience\u0027 but was uninjured. The moped gang dressed head-to-toe in black pulled up next to him and smashed their way into his car and demanded his Rolex before they sped away.Mr McIntyre\u0027s wife Kitty was reportedly seen close to the damaged car in \u0027floods of tears\u0027 as police spoke to her husband. Today she left the £5.7million family home  and told reporters her husband was \u0027fine\u0027.  Parents on the school run rushed to comfort the shocked star  and he looked shell-shocked and was heard saying: \u0027I need to find out the best thing to do here\u0027.It\u0027s not known if the comedian was targeted or his £120,000 Range Rover was simply in the wrong place at the wrong time.             The robbers used hammers to destroy the driver\u0027s window and demanded his silver watch, worth around £15,000            A serious looking Kitty McIntyre, wife of Michael McIntyre, was photographed leaving the family home in North  London yesterday and said her husband is \u0027fine\u0027      Former Crystal Palace owner Simon Jordan, left, had a £100,000 watch stolen after an armed moped rider stopped his Maserati in Croydon earlier this year. Ex Made in Chelsea star Ashley James, pictured right, was targeted by moped thieves for her phone in MarchMoped riders also stole a £100,000 Franck Muller watch from former Crystal Palace owner Simon Jordan when he stopped in his Maserati in Croydon.The rider appeared to produce a gun and threatened the businessman through the window.Mr Jordan said his 80-year-old father was also in the car and was \u0027trying to have a pop at the gunman\u0027.A 32-year-old man was arrested and charged over the offence last month. Ex Made in Chelsea star Ashley James was also targetted in March after two moped riders stole her phone near Kilburn station.The 30-year-old model former Celebrity Big Brother star revealed she chased down the thieves and got the phone back after tackling them.She added it was the second time such an incident had happened to her after having her handbag stolen in Barcelona.And Harry Potter star Daniel Radcliffe rushed to the aid of a tourist slashed in the face by a moped rider last July.The victim was targeted for a Louis Vuitton bag and Radcliffe, 27, rushed over to tend to him after the offenders sped away.  Raiders tried to steal Evening Standard editor George Osborne\u0027s phone as he left the BBC\u0027s Broadcasting House in May last year. Harry Potter star Daniel Radcliffe rushed to the aid of a tourist slashed in the face by a moped rider last July                        Kitty McIntyre left their £5.7million north London mansion at 8.20am on Tuesday morning and drove their eldest son Lucas, 13, to school. Oscar, ten, who is believed to have witnessed the attack was not with her.She returned to their six bedroom home and parked their silver-grey Range Rover sport courtesy car in the driveway.When asked if they were worried for their family\u0027s safety, the aromatherapist said: \u0027No, no. He\u0027s fine.\u0027The three-storey mansion, with a green door, had every blind and curtain drawn.It is not known if Michael, who is one of the most successful comedians of all time, is at home.His Range Rover, with the shattered window, was not outside his home. Moped crime has been described as being \u0027out of control\u0027 in London with 23,000 offences last year - up from 827 reported incidents in 2012. Gangs all over the capital have been trying to rip valuables such as phones and jewellery from drivers and pedestrians including millionaire Simon Jordan, whose £127,000 watch was taken at gunpoint as he sat in his Masarati in March.George Osborne almost had his phone ripped from his hand outside the BBC in May last year and Harry Potter star Daniel Radcliffe ran to the aid of a tourist who was attacked in Fulham. Michael McIntyre had been sitting outside the  school when two masked riders brandishing hammers pulled up next to him.They then smashed through his driver\u0027s window and stole his watch. It is not known if they took other items like his wallet and phone. One witness said: \u0027The guy at the front of the moped started to hit the driver\u0027s window about ten to 15 times and it eventually just cracked. He opens the door and gets Michael McIntyre out of the car. Michael fell but he was still trying to put up a fight.\u0027I just remember one of the bikers trying to get something. I don\u0027t know what the guy was trying to get – a watch, a wallet, maybe?\u0027And then within seconds they were gone down the hill. It was all so quick – the whole thing must have taken 30 seconds\u0027.He added he thought that Michael\u0027s son was in the car with him and was hugged by his dad and school friends afterwards.             Mr Mcintyre was photographed looking shell-shocked by his £120,000 Range Rover after yesterday afternoon\u0027s attack            The millionaire comedian was sitting in his Range Rover at around 2pm yesterday when the thugs started trying to smash his window with a hammerAnother witness said: \u0027I was driving along the road when I saw two men dressed head to toe in black. One man was on the bike and the other was either attacking or fighting Michael McIntyre. There was shouting too.\u0027The driver\u0027s window of his Range Rover was completely smashed. The second guy jumped on the back of the motorbike and they got away\u0027.       1.

It took too much effort,\u0027 said a woman who gave only her surname Wang.The former resident, now in her 40s, only returns these days to earn extra money as a safety officer, keeping an eye on the tourists.           The island looks like a scene from a movie set and almost every metre of the stone buildings have been overtaken by vines          Vines climbing up buildings, along the paths and through the windows of former homes are so beautiful they look deliberate          What was once home to fishermen and their families in a once thriving village is now overgrown, eerie and abandoned\u0027It was a lot of fun when we were young, going down to the beach to collect seafood,\u0027 she said.But by the mid-1990s the village, which once had as many as 3,000 residents, was largely abandoned in favour of a neighbouring town on the island.\u0027Once people had more money, they all moved out one after another up into the town. That how it was,\u0027 Wang said.In recent years, selfie-snapping day-trippers could roam freely through Houtouwan.However, since last year, local authorities have charged 50 yuan (£5.83) for entry, while confining tourists to a single circular walking loop through a village frozen in time.  The site 140 kilometres (87 miles) from Shanghai captivates tourists with its fairy-tale setting and East China Sea vistas  The big seas that lash the coast made it too dangerous to land small craft, meaning the only connection to other communities on Shengshan was a strenuous trek up a steep, winding path  The seaside village now lies empty because it was more economical for the fishermen to move and work on the mainland Many of China\u0027s villages have disappeared due to economic development, inaccessibility, poverty and social changes, among other factors.Nearly 900,000 villages across China were abandoned or destroyed in the first decade of this century, historian Feng Jicai previously told Jinan Daily News. In 2014, a study on the nation\u0027s rapid urbanisation in rural areas was conducted by Chinese researchers, who  visited 91 remote villages  in a seven-month expedition.  They discovered that some villages with development value have been commercialised with shops and tourism, while some were abandoned as many young villagers have moved away to find work in the city, according to Guangzhou Daily.The famous Chinese mathematician Chen Jingrun\u0027s hometown - Chaolei Village in Fuzhou City - was completely demolished because of the construction of Fuzhou Railway Station.Another remote village, Maijieping, located 800 metres above sea level in Yanshi city of Henan province, is home to only four remaining elderly residents after younger families have moved to neighbouring cities.However, Houtouwan is perhaps the most renowned \u0027ghost village\u0027 due to its fairy tale-like reclamation."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/06/12/4CF8AF6400000578-5811943-image-a-41_1528283467655.jpg","title":"Mans portable charger suddenly EXPLODES ball flames bus","story":"    The man is seen taking a bus in Guangdong last Wednesday when his bag suddenly burst into a ball of flames right in front of him.

It took too much effort,\u0027 said a woman who gave only her surname Wang.The former resident, now in her 40s, only returns these days to earn extra money as a safety officer, keeping an eye on the tourists.           The island looks like a scene from a movie set and almost every metre of the stone buildings have been overtaken by vines          Vines climbing up buildings, along the paths and through the windows of former homes are so beautiful they look deliberate          What was once home to fishermen and their families in a once thriving village is now overgrown, eerie and abandoned\u0027It was a lot of fun when we were young, going down to the beach to collect seafood,\u0027 she said.But by the mid-1990s the village, which once had as many as 3,000 residents, was largely abandoned in favour of a neighbouring town on the island.\u0027Once people had more money, they all moved out one after another up into the town. That how it was,\u0027 Wang said.In recent years, selfie-snapping day-trippers could roam freely through Houtouwan.However, since last year, local authorities have charged 50 yuan (£5.83) for entry, while confining tourists to a single circular walking loop through a village frozen in time.

Share them with our picture editor carly.earl@theIn 1972, Alan Adler owned a grocery shop that wasn’t doing very well. An advertisement in the Age promised him $80 a week if, instead, he ran a photobooth – a contraption that he did not understand. He bought two.“It was a disaster from day one,” he said. “One of the thermostats malfunctioned in the booth which caused the photo to come out white. I had no idea what a photobooth was about, and hadn’t seen one before I bought one.”Since those first two, the 86-year-old now owns “too many” black and white photobooths throughout Melbourne to remember – though many are now in his garage, victims of the digital photo revolution. His most famous booth, at Melbourne’s Flinders Street station, has just been given a reprieve from a planned removal. It will remain at the station, though in a different spot.“We didn’t really make any real money out of the photobooth until the $1 coin came in,” he says. “Before that you had to use four 20c coins and we would charge you 80c. Not many people carried four 20c cents with them so I wasn’t really very popular. Then the $2 coin come out and we were really making money!”Adler’s booths use the old school method, with silver-halide film, thick paper and a cocktail of six or seven different chemicals.“You can’t have a better photograph than a proper photographic process with the chemicals,” he says. “With a very expensive digital camera you can get close, but it doesn’t have the warmth or the character. Our photos are really long lasting. I’ve photos I took 46 years ago, good as the day they were taken.”Fans and customers send him nice messages from time to time, which he especially enjoys.“I got some very lovely letters” he says. One was from a group who met up on the last day that one of his booths was in operation. “We want to thank you for so many years of happiness,” they wrote.Now, the business has changed, and Alder says it’s no longer viable. It costs $2,000 for him to buy just one chemical used in the processing. “We really never charged enough,” he says. “Then digital photobooths came on to the market and we lost our locations.“It’s been my whole life. We’ve met fellow photobooth operators all around the world. We’ve been to America a few times to get spare parts for machines. We met a guy in Switzerland. It’s been our life for 50 years.” Do you have your own pictures from the Flinders Street photobooth?

In 1970, the first annual Pride month followed, along with the Christopher Street Liberation Day and the first gay pride march in American history, where hundreds marched to Central Park.Years later, Pride month continues to be a time for the LGBT community to celebrate and commemorate. This year, a series of LGBT art exhibitions are popping up, from billboards in Los Angeles to photographs of drag queens.Opening at SOMArts in San Francisco, this group exhibition curated by Rudy Lemcke features politically charged artworks by 15 artists. With the modern LGBT movement emerging out of resistance against violence, oppression and censorship, this exhibition features works “that speak to homophobic, transphobic and gendered violence”, said Lemcke. “It’s about the deep wounds that have shaped our identity as a community.” Among the artists, Jamil Hellu is showing artwork inspired by Russia’s anti-LGBT propaganda law. “I am committed to speaking out against human rights abuses and bringing attention to the sociological ramifications of violence against gay people,” said Hellu. “It’s so important to keep the awareness alive that in many other parts of the world people are still being oppressed and persecuted to death because of homophobia.”The New York artist takes his work outdoors in Los Angeles, showing on a pair of digital billboards on Sunset Boulevard. As part of the Rich Picture, a video art billboard series curated by Jessica Rich, Newsome is showing Knot Variations, which taps into the ballroom culture and vogue dance movement that surfaced in Harlem in the 1980s. “How do marginalized people find some upward mobility by using the culture they create when it’s not being celebrated by the masses until it’s adjacent to whiteness or being recreated by white America?” he asked. “Voguing got going around the same time as the Aids crisis began, and as more people swooped in, the conversation was soon driven by people who weren’t part of the community. It’s not that people can’t participate in the culture, but those who create the culture need to have agency over it. This is work that is with, for and about the community.” The Los Angeles Art Association has partnered up with the city of West Hollywood to present a group exhibition celebrating LGBT life during West Hollywood’s Pride Month festivities. Opening on 8 June, the exhibition is held at Gallery 825, featuring artists including Dwora Fried, who creates mixed media assemblages based on identity, portrait photographer Jim Zver and Xunzhi Sun, who is showing works from his BirthMark series. Peter Mays, executive director of the LAAA, says this exhibition “offers expression, agency and celebration of artists addressing their own, inidual pride experience”. What does a queer portrait look like? Curated by artist Liz Collins, this group show of 95 artworks opening 14 June at the Bureau of General Services – Queer Division offers a look into queer portraiture of today, including former Sex and the City actor, activist and New York gubernatorial candidate Cynthia Nixon. On a colorful wallpaper, portraits are hung salon-style by artists like India Salvor Menuez, the famed model who founded the Luck You artist collective, singer-songwriter Justin Vivian Bond and JD Samson from the band Le Tigre. “It’s a celebratory, vibrant and sensual experience that lays bare a rich and multifaceted community of creative people at an important cultural site in New York City,” said Collins. “Through the layers of images and varied representations of self and others coming from the queer art world, this exhibition aims to engulf visitors in a world of beings as a celebration of life.” Opening on 9 June at the Leslie-Lohman Museum in New York, this group exhibition features 12 New York artists who work in photography, including portraits of gay couples by Andrew Jarman and snapshots of drag queens by Alexis Ruiseco-Lombera. The goal of the exhibition is meant to examine gender, sexuality, race and ethnicity. “For the artists, photography, the medium of choice, is the weapon and the target,” said the museum’s director, Gonzalo Casals. “It allows them to communicate the complexities of a queer world always about to exist, while transgressing – or ‘queering’, as put by the curators – the traditional forms of portraiture and landscape to give us a glimpse of a queer future.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4432ae43122fbe247c5a1beb9574c79b5512b3ca/0_121_6000_3601/master/6000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1e348510c07f6c670ed6ad62b6f53a0d","title":"sanne de wilde best photograph island of the colourblind pingelap micronesia","story":"‘It’s the most colour-blind place on Earth. I had to take four flights to get there. I wanted to celebrate their unique way of seeing the world’I shot this image of Deke, one of the smaller islands of the Pingelap atoll, in the Federated States of Micronesia, in 2015. I had travelled to the atoll to research achromatopsia, a rare genetic condition that causes complete colour blindness and hypersensitivity to light. In severe cases, all you can see is shades of grey. Worldwide, only one in every 30,000 people have achromatopsia. But on Pingelap, one in 10 do. It’s the most colour-blind place on Earth.The prevalence of achromatopsia on the island can be traced back to the 18th century when it was engulfed by a typhoon, leaving around 20 survivors. The ruler carried the recessive gene that causes the condition. After a few generations, more or less everyone on the island was related to him.Getting to the islands was arduous, involving three flights to get from Amsterdam, to Pohnpei, then another on a four-seater plane over to Pingelap. As soon as I arrived I was welcomed. A member of the family I was to stay with met me at the landing strip with a marmar, a floral wreath to wear in my hair. On one of my final nights on the island, one of my host family’s relatives came over from Pohnpei. They prepared a ceremony for me and killed a pig – something usually reserved for weddings and funerals – and announced that I was “one of the family, once and for all.”.Trying to understand the place of achromatopsia in Pingelapese culture wasn’t easy. When you can’t see colour, the concept doesn’t really mean anything. In a bid to understand what the world looked like for the islanders, I prepared workshops where they would draw and paint over my images. Most people discover they are colour blind when they come to paint or draw. It can be a moment of shame, or loss. Instead, I wanted to celebrate their unique way of seeing the world.I took this photo after the first workshop, as the boat was returning to the mainland. It was a special day, and I wanted to mark the occasion. I shot it with a Nikon fitted with an infrared lens and a colour filter. I had no idea the shot would look like this until I got home, and I didn’t retouch the colour balance at all – this is how it came out. It was the perfect way of capturing a project that was all about seeing the world differently.Looking at it now, I can’t help but compare the scene to images of refugee boats that have filled television screens over the last few years. That might be reality for the Pingelapese in a few decades’ time. The Marshall Islands and Micronesia are likely to be some of the first places to disappear if sea levels continue to rise. They live in tiny, harmless economies, but it’s they who will pay the price for the way the west lives.Studied: Painting at Sint Lucas in Antwerp and photography at the Royal Academy of Fine Art in Ghent.Influences: “My dad, who was a photographer, and Michael Jackson.”High point: “I just gave a talk about the Island of the Colourblind in Norway, and a guy came up to me at the end and told me how much he loved my work.

The novel follows three orphaned siblings, elder sister Isma and twins Aneeka and Parvaiz, the latter of whom has left London to work for the media arm of Isis. When Eamonn, son of the British Muslim home secretary, enters their lives, Aneeka hopes to use him to save her missing brother.Announcing Home Fire as winner of the £30,000 award, chair of judges Sarah Sands said the panel “chose the book which we felt spoke for our times … Home Fire is about identity, conflicting loyalties, love and politics. And it sustains mastery of its themes and its form. It is a remarkable book which we passionately recommend.”Shamsie, who grew up in Karachi and now lives in London, beat a shortlist that included US author Jesmyn Ward’s novel Sing, Unburied, Sing, for which she won the National Book Award, and Imogen Hermes Gowar’s debut, The Mermaid and Mrs Hancock.With Shamsie’s novel anticipating a British Muslim home secretary – since the novel was released, Sajid Javid was appointed to the role – Sands praised the novel’s “astonishing prescience” and “the breadth of its ambition”.“Shamsie is funny and exact about the Muslim experience, what it means to be challenged on your identity, what it means choosing between public and private … Her nuance, her sympathies, really make you challenge your own lazy thinking on all this,” she said. “The different characters were all so well-realised that you have sympathy for all of them – even the brother, that was the extraordinary thing. There’s no question what he did was wrong, but you feel sympathy, that it was a terrible misjudgment, that there’s no going back.“To humanise a political story in that way really does show what literature can do, that it can tackle a hard subject that otherwise would never have that sense of layered sympathy and understanding. It really advanced our understanding of the whole issue of identity.”Home Fire, which was longlisted for the 2017 Man Booker prize and shortlisted for the Costa novel award, should also be considered “a really good page-turner”, said Sands.“It is very readable, it’s extremely well written, it’s well plotted, it’s something that could easily be a brilliant television series or film. It’s not that you’re thinking, ‘This is a novel about politics, I need to plough through’,” she said. “It doesn’t feel as if she is straining to recreate Antigone – you could read it without thinking about Sophocles at all. In a way, that just gives it a resonance.”In a week when author Marian Keyes accused the Wodehouse prize for comic fiction of sexism, saying that “male voices are automatically given extra weight” when it comes to prize shortlists, Sands said that she felt the Women’s prize was still needed.“I have absolutely loved immersing myself in women’s fiction for a year, it’s been an absolute privilege,” said Sands, who was joined on the judging panel – which considered almost 200 books – by the journalist Anita Anand, the comedian Katy Brand, the co-founder of the Women’s Equality party Catherine Mayer and the actor Imogen Stubbs.The annual award, which has been won by authors including Lionel Shriver, Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie and Naomi Alderman in the last two decades, was previously known as the Orange prize and the Baileys prize."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e1e0d6d04a1423dbbe54692129a1247b48147ffb/20_0_3210_1926/master/3210.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fbed2f2caec81f44984c6c02652fec24","title":"poundland faces administration as it struggles to find buyer","story":"More than 5,000 jobs at risk as private equity owner said to be declining to further fund chainPoundworld is facing the threat of administration as the group’s private equity owner struggles to secure a rescue buyer before the company’s next rent payment.

No serious buyers had come forward by the deadline of Monday this week, giving the company few options but to call in the administrators.The company’s founder, Chris Edwards, is thought to be trying to find backers for a rescue bid, but is running out of time ahead of the next rent payment date, which is 24 June.TPG, a US private equity firm, is the same firm that owns the Prezzo chain, which is also closing about 100 restaurants through a company voluntary arrangement (CVA).Poundworld had also considered a plan to launch a CVA, an insolvency procedure that would enable it to reduce rents and close about 100 stores to cut costs. But the cut-price chain has almost no time left as it must give creditors 14 days notice ahead of a vote, which it would need to secure before its next rental payment.The company’s difficulties come as a string of retailers and restaurants seek to exit high-street outlets in the face of rising costs and a squeeze on consumer spending.House of Fraser is expected to announce details of a CVA, under which it is likely to close at least 20 of its 60 stores, within days.

On Wednesday the bank’s website admitted that some were “having difficulties and seeing an error message” when making payments, and it stated that some business account holders were “still having issues”.Pester’s appearance before the committee came shortly after the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) launched a stinging attack on the bank’s bosses over their failure to be open and transparent with customers.The bank revealed it had racked up a year-to-date bill of about £70m to cover various costs relating to the problems, which included £11.2m in compensation to customers who had suffered fraud – a figure likely to reach closer to £20m once amounts not yet paid were included.During the hearing the FCA’s chief executive, Andrew Bailey, said there had been about 10,600 fraud “incidents” relating to the IT meltdown. However, Pester said that the number who had lost money from their accounts to fraudsters was 1,300. These people had now been refunded, he added.The chief executive said he was shocked to read reports of customers who had waited on the phone for up to nine hours to disclose incidents of fraud. In some cases their life savings had been taken from them.However, Pester said 70 times the normal level of fraud attacks were seen last month, and he described this as “an unprecedented attack across UK banking from organised crime”, adding that TSB was working with a range of agencies in an attempt to track down the perpetrators.Morgan gave details of a self-employed businessman, Paul Catherall, who had £24,550 stolen from his account last month. The bank later made a payment into his account of the same sum, but had offered only £192 compensation, of which £42 was for the cost of phone calls made by Catherall. Morgan said: “I don’t think £192 is nearly sufficient.” She added that some people’s major life experiences such as weddings and house purchases had been ruined by what had happened.The bank also disclosed that it had cancelled overdraft fees and charges totalling £29m in the wake of the problems.The committee also heard that 370 former customers had been affected by a blunder which meant people switching away from TSB to another bank found that regular payments had been cancelled because companies were told that they had died. Pester said a software error was behind the problem, and people were being contacted and offered compensation.One MP, Labour’s John Mann, asked: “How many heads are going to roll?” Meddings said the board had hired City law firm Slaughter \u0026amp May to lead an independent review into the meltdown, which was going to be thorough. He added: “If I’m found to be culpable, then the actions will attach to me.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ed9da651f5139ef91ed8ddab2ef753c40be8cf02/0_0_5150_3090/master/5150.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d9e72721a528ebdf58de4f34287abc27","title":"appetite is mysterious lets learn from pregnant women rather than calling them greedy","story":"New research has hinted at the psychology behind weight gains during pregnancy. Yet public health messages can’t seem to get beyondbeing patronising or punitiveOne third of pregnant women “lose control” of their eating, according to a researcher at University College London, and gain an additional 3.7kg, a figure that made me laugh out loud, because if you can count them in single digits and they’re not stones, such weight gains don’t know the meaning of “losing control”. The researcher, Nadia Micali, said something more interesting about her findings than you’ll usually find in the overeating business: “We often imagine that just telling women: ‘Don’t eat for two, don’t eat for two,’ is going to be enough. But loss of control needs to be treated slightly differently in a more psychologically acute way.”When the question is, “Why are people eating too much?”, the first answer is usually public education: tell them to eat less. Then tell them to eat differently. Then tell them in a patronising way, maybe with colourful cartoons. It doesn’t work, because there is no information deficit: everyone knows that celery is healthy and doughnuts are not. Frustrated by the inefficacy of telling people things they already know, public health turns wrathful: tell those lard buckets they will get cancer. Tell them they already have diabetes, and it’s their own fault. Tax them! The thrill of the punitive language gets in the way of any impartial analysis of whether it’s working or something must, because it isn’t, and still they stick with it.Appetite is mysterious, deeper than reason, unresponsive to threat. The “loss of control” in pregnancy is raw and intense. Smart public health would study these women intently – their hormonal swerves, their blood, their neurology, their pupils when they see a Tottenham cake – for they may hold the key that unlocks a puzzle fit for Indiana Jones. But it won’t, because they’re fat, right? So, they must be greedy, and what can you learn from a person without control?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9c82f35cb7d5573c504d2f8127679e87fdffc6c1/0_108_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9dd6a9081f9ab62091a44669941b600d","title":"fix eu single currency does not work","story":"Even when it was clearly in decline, the Soviet Union commanded loyal devotion. Its admirers could never quite grasp that the nation instrumental in winning the second world war had a broken economy.The same cognitive dissonance applies to the European Union today. There is the EU as it exists in the minds of its most avid supporters: fast-growing, a defender of progressive values, fighting the good fight against Thatcherism, and marching steadfastly towards greater integration.Then there is the EU as it really is: struggling economically wedded to an aggressive form of neoliberal economics insistent that there is no alternative to a top-down, ever-closer union and spawning anti-elite parties across the continent.Like the USSR under Gorbachev, Europe needs radical reform before it is too late because, as George Soros noted last week, everything that could go wrong has gone wrong. The EU is saddled with a single currency that doesn’t work but unable to admit it. It has forced its weaker members to suffer the consequences of the euro’s design weaknesses with austerity policies it has told those who complain about low growth and high unemployment to sort out their own problems through structural reforms (wage cuts and privatisation) and it has failed to comprehend the anger felt at mass immigration, which has increased the pool of readily available cheap labour.A\u0026nbspparticularly serious\u0026nbspform of this cognitive dissonance seems to afflict\u0026nbspsome left-leaning remainers in the UK. They appear to have forced Jeremy Corbyn and John McDonnell into softening (or fudging) Labour’s stance on\u0026nbspthe single market, even though they were two of the very few Labour MPs who rightly predicted where Europe would end up if it insisted on following rightwing economic policies.And their insistence that the best way to help those who voted for Brexit is a reformed UK in a reformed EU glides over the fact that they rarely come up with any ideas for what these reforms might look like or how they might come about. That, of course, is because they have no plan other than to return Britain to its blissful prelapsarian state before the referendum. Gordon Brown’s plan to tackle the causes of Brexit – low wages, the sense of being cast adrift, the pressures from migration, the loss of sovereignty and concerns about the NHS – is a welcome and timely exception to this rule. But Brown’s warning that serious change is needed to prevent Britain being permanently paralysed applies equally to the rest of Europe, ided between social liberals and conservatives, between a rich north and a poorer south, and between those for whom globalisation works and those for whom it doesn’t.Those who think that Euroscepticism is just a British phenomenon need to take a long, hard look at the populism on the march across Europe and ask themselves why it is happening. Then they need to work out what they are going to do about it.One option, proposed by Emmanuel Macron, is to make Europe more like the US. Macron’s argument, which makes a lot of sense, is that the single currency is an unfinished and hence inherently unstable construct, which needs a much bigger budget, run by a single finance minister, to even out variations in economic performance. But there is little appetite in the rest of the EU for Macron’s plan, particularly where it really counts: in Germany.Another option would be for Italy to precipitate change by leaving the euro. This is even less likely than adoption of Macron’s plans, because as soon as the financial markets got whiff of the idea it would result in sky-high Italian interest rates and the collapse of an already shaky banking system. Italians with savings would see their value decimated by a return to the lira. The only way Italy will leave the euro is by mistake, and then it would be catastrophic.A third option would be for the conduct of European economic policy to become less fixated on austerity. There could be less emphasis on hitting arbitrary budget deficit targets, a move away from the neoliberal structural adjustment policies imposed on those countries seeking support, an acceptance that those countries trying to cope with migration flows across the Mediterranean need much more financial help than they are currently getting, and a Marshall plan for Africa of the sort floated by Soros. All would be welcome: all would meet with strong opposition from Angela Merkel.By far the best option would be for Germany to take the initiative and announce that it was leaving the single currency, taking a small group of northern European countries with it. This would have a number of clear advantages. First, it would remove the stigma of leaving the euro because the decision would be taken from a position of strength not weakness. Second, the new mark would be a lot stronger than the euro and that would help iron out some of the imbalances in Europe’s economy by making German exports dearer and German imports cheaper. Third, the new hard eurozone would be more like Germany’s original vision of what it imagined monetary union would look like.Fourth, it would breathe new life into plans for\u0026nbspEuropean integration because it could start small and get bigger over time. Countries such as the Netherlands and Austria would be obvious choices as\u0026nbspfounder members of a smaller club bound by common fiscal rules.Finally, it would make a reality of a multispeed Europe in which some countries would be members of the hard eurozone, some would be actively planning to join it once their economies were ready, and some would decide they never wanted to join.As things stand, this is just as big a fantasy as Macron’s integrationist blueprint. Germany is the one country that has really benefited from the single currency and is not going to propose a hard-mark zone that might exclude France. Macron would throw a wobbly if it did.But if European leaders had the opportunity to turn the clock back to before the euro was introduced, this is the sort of plan they would probably come up with. And if this sort of EU had seemed feasible in June 2016, the UK would never have voted for Brexit."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/135378d984791416b4904ac41aa6841d1903c3b8/0_174_5548_3329/master/5548.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6a567aa375f8d1fcd262a2eadf377407","title":"struggling to concentrate on labour and brexit i have an unusual solution","story":"Think of the single market as being like Alton Towers. Should we stay there or build a new theme park? I don’t know whether I have mentioned this, but I think that leaving the EU is a stupid idea. All the time I don’t spend working (staring out of a window), I spend campaigning against this stupid idea. And even I cannot get to the end of a paragraph that has the phrase “single market” in it, while the word “amendment” acts like an allergen. Just to overcome this, I henceforth will say “Alton Towers” in place of single market, “wheeze” instead of amendment, and only use first names: if you need to know which Keir and Chuka I mean, I can only assume you’ve found your happy place and you should stay there.Keir’s wheeze is that we retain access to Alton Towers. We get to go on all the rides, eat from its many snack bars, benefit from its safety protocols, which are not perfect but are better than no safety, and obey its rules. There will be those who grumble that they don’t want to stay in Alton Towers, they want to build a new theme park, and those people are crazy. One week they will tell you the world is lousy with fairground rides at low, low prices two years later, all they’ve found is some secondhand giant teacups from Cuba. Then there will be people who say: if we’re going to stay in Alton Towers, why can’t we retain our place on the management and create a theme park built for the future, where everything is solar-powered and the snack bars serve vegan fried “chicken”. It would be one where children in low-income families – which, at the rate we’re going, will soon be most children – can get in free. But it is the will of the people that we leave the management committee for, you know, reasons. So OK, Keir’s wheeze is not a bad wheeze.Chuka disagrees with Keir’s wheeze, because the lords have a different one, in which we also remain at Alton Towers, but in an area devised years ago for people who have mixed feelings about theme parks but don’t want to be left out. The Norway family have an Ambivalence Day Pass, and Chuka wants one of those. He reckons Tory rebels will buy the lords’ wheeze, because it’s cross-party, but won’t buy Keir’s, because it comes from Labour’s front bench. This makes no sense, unless we assume that Tory rebels don’t know how parliament works. Whoever they line up behind, the result of their rebellion would be the same: defeat for a fragile government and whatever consequences that brings. It’s not as though the lords represent an alternative opposition, or that MPs must choose between disagreeing with Theresa May and hating Jeremy Corbyn more.Ah, but does Chuka have a sub-wheeze (using the word for its true meaning on this occasion)? Is he trying to scoop up Tory rebels, filch half the Labour party and emerge, phoenix-like, when the flames of this unending tedium are done, as the leader of a new centrist party? Dastardly, but along with Tony Blair, David Miliband and Peter Mandelson, Chuka is reaching the point where even his most self-evident statements (“Alton Towers is more fun and professionally run than Lapland New Forest”), ring with self-serving expedience. We’re going to end up leaving Alton Towers for a wreck of a place with crappy elves and no Santa for a reason history will be too depressed to relate – just to disagree with Chuka."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5e6c02716ef9641c45292d4b71a7d59eb705bc17/60_0_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=63826651261d4ac95051331910f43051","title":"love at first swipe would you shop the love island look live","story":"The reality TV show and fast fashion brand Missguided have coupled up to offer instant ways to shop the clothes worn by the contestants. Could this be the future of shopping?Love Island has it all – sun, sex, suspiciously orange men, and now, shopping. Last week, the reality TV show announced that this year it will partner with the high-street fashion brand Missguided, not only to style the contestants, but also to direct viewers to shop the looks they see on telly through the Love Island app. In a move to capitalise on its captive audience, the institution that is Love Island continues to capture the hearts – and now wallets – of fans everywhere.“It’s about having a direct hotline straight to their target demographic,” says Leanne Elliott-Young, fashion partnerships expert and founder of fashion futures studio CommuneEAST. She thinks that the collaboration, which allows viewers to either shop items in the “Love Island style” or, sometimes, the exact garments worn by the contestants, is a clever tactic to bypass the structures of influencer marketing, which, she says, we are beginning to trust less.It might not seem like an obvious parallel, but a line can be drawn between what Love Island is doing for high-street shopping now and what Burberry once did for the luxury market – the brand’s See Now Buy Now format, which has since been limited to capsule collections, was a radical approach to seasonal catwalk shopping when it first launched in 2016. By reducing the time that people had to wait to get an item of clothing from a whole season to offering instant gratification, the brand gave the world of high fashion something a little like farm-to-table, except, well, catwalk to home delivery. Although it was difficult to do (and played a big part in disrupting the fashion calendar), it allowed people to tap into the excitement of the catwalk show and, much like Love Island is doing, turned shopping into part of the entertainment itself.Love Island is tapping into the tastes of its “fandom” and allowing Missguided to speak directly to that base at a time when brands such as Marks \u0026amp Spencer are falling short, because they are basing their offering on the high-street myth of the everywoman. “I think it’s about brands capitalising on the look and feel of this particular TV programme,” says Laura Saunter, retail editor at fashion forecasting agency WGSN.In 2014, Fashion app TAGit tried to do this by letting users shop items from TV shows such as Keeping Up with the Kardashians and Scandal. But with visual search tools now embedded into many shopping sites such as Asos, which allow shoppers to upload or take an image and then search Asos’s products for clothing that is similar to what’s pictured, “you no longer need apps like TAGit to help you hunt down something you see on TV,” says Saunter. In an era where we are shopping in store less and online more this is, she thinks, a further development to making it easier to find exactly what you want. Elliott-Young thinks that it’s also about the way that many people are watching Love Island while simultaneously tweeting and texting on their phones, making it a slippery slope to online shopping sites and apps. And seeing the clothes in action on the show helps them make quicker decisions, because it makes the online shopping experience a little more real.Fashion websites are trying to incorporate this idea, too: “If you look at the majority of them now they have a video element of a model, so you can see what the item of clothing looks like when you walk in it,” she says. But Love Island goes one better. “People want to know what it looks like when they sit in it, or what happens with their swimsuit when they get in a jacuzzi. Love Island and Missguided are essentially putting the clothes in context.”Whether this entertainment-fuelled, impulse-driven type of shopping, in a country where £3.1bn a month is spent on impulse buys alone, will only work with the low price points that fast fashion brands provide remains to be seen. And only time will tell whether watching Love Islanders in swimsuits will actually compel us to buy one. Let’s just hope our summer purchase decisions won’t be as misguided as some of our romantic ones."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/118ccf5575dd779ae8a96025b683c4578f375897/0_149_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e98f66713170fb5983a23b1a9e7531f3","title":"england nikita parris shouting referees world cup russia","story":"For Nikita Parris the past two years have been all about gaining control. Quite apart from learning when to slow down and when to speed up, she has become much more adept at judging the right moments to act on immediate instinct and recognising the situations where it is better to pause and think things through.“I think I’ve matured,” says the England and Manchester City forward. “On an odd occasion you’ll still find me shouting at referees when I’ve become increasingly frustrated but I’ve tried to control my temper.”As she sits and chats at St George’s Park before flying to Moscow with Phil Neville’s squad for Friday’s World Cup qualifier against Russia, Parris explains that her new measured approach is not merely confined to moderating a reputation for screaming at match officials.“I’ve grown not just as a player but as a person,” says the 24-year‑old Toxteth-born half-sister of the boxer Natasha Jonas. “But my passion will always remain. It’s there because I love football and I love fighting for my club and my country. Every time I step on the pitch I think about winning and putting on a performance that ensures my team comes out on top.”Eight goals in 22 internationals during the 24 months since her England debut against Serbia suggest Parris’s capacity to learn quickly is as sharp as her warm Merseyside wit. “International football’s a much quicker environment,” she says. “You have to move the ball quicker and make decisions quicker. I’ve stretched myself and I make decisions very quickly now. You can’t overthink when chances come, you’ve got to take them.“But I’ve also got more maturity, more composure in the final third. I’m calmer in front of goal. When I was younger, I was so fixed on scoring I’d snatch at chances. I’d forgotten about the process you need to go through before you shoot. Now I know that if you get that process right, scoring’s the easy part.”It helps that Neville speaks her language. “Phil’s brought a winning mentality with him,” says a player with a personality to match her dynamic change of pace. “His background’s all about winning, look at the trophies he’s collected. That’s what we want to do, too. At the end of your career you want to be able to look into your cupboard and see all the medals you’ve amassed.”When England beat Russia 6-0 at Tranmere last September Neville’s soon-to-be-sacked predecessor, Mark Sampson, was feeling the strain of Eni Aluko’s well‑documented racism allegations. After Parris scored the opening goal she immediately led her team-mates in a race to the technical area where England’s outgoing manager was hugged in a pointed display of squad unity. Parris makes it plain that she relished being part of the environment created by Sampson – whose unfair dismissal case against the FA should be resolved soon – and is proud of a culture that helped England to reach the Euro 2017 semi‑finals in the Netherlands.Asked to identify how Neville has changed the collective mentality, her instructive reply brims with subtext. “To be honest with you, we’ve remained the same. Our values, our beliefs and our integrity – which we’ve always had – have been retained. Our culture of togetherness – which we’ve always had – has remained the same.More immediately, England’s men have a World Cup of their own to challenge for and, before departing for her own mission in Moscow, Parris enjoyed sharing St George’s Park with Gareth Southgate’s players. “We were in the gym with them this morning and we’ve had a few conversations,” she says. “It’s been nice to see the men here we’ve wished them well for Russia.”With her quick, clever feet, penchant for dribbling at opponents, ability to operate either on the wing or more centrally and, of course, those goals, Parris is hoping for a starting role in Neville’s front three in France next summer. She revels in feeling the heat of competition in an attacking department suddenly feeling slightly overcrowded, as Jodie Taylor, Ellen White, Fran Kirby, Toni Duggan and Parris herself face competition from Beth Mead and Georgia Stanway.“We’ve got good young strikers knocking at the door now but having competition is essential,” Parris says. “We want to become the best team in the world and then be the best for a long time so we need to be challenged. If you don’t have competition in a squad, you can have complacency – and, if you have complacency, you won’t win.”Meanwhile, the former England forward Eni Aluko has joined Juventus Women after helping Chelsea to their recent league and cup double. Aluko wrote on Twitter: “Delighted \u0026amp honoured to join JuventusFCWomen - Italian champions, a club with an overwhelming history, ambition and success.

Shaqiri, a £12m arrival from Internazionale in 2015, has made clear he has no interest in playing in the Championship but would “love to stay in England”.Shaqiri’s availability and affordability has alerted a host of clubs in Europe and the Premier League, with Tottenham Hotspur and Southampton – the latter managed by Mark Hughes, who signed the winger for Stoke – among those linked with the 26-year-old. Liverpool also have an interest in the former Bayern Munich player, with Jürgen Klopp looking to strengthen in key areas, although that has not advanced to activating Shaqiri’s release clause.Liverpool were close to signing Shaqiri from Bayern in the summer of 2014 and were the player’s preferred option at the time. The winger, however, later claimed Bayern blocked his transfer to Anfield and, with his playing time at the Allianz Arena limited under Pep Guardiola, he joined Internazionale six months later.Klopp has added the Monaco midfielder Fabinho to his squad this summer for £43.7m and wants the highly rated Lyon captain, Nabil Fekir, ideally before the World Cup."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d5af842270e99b72a4f72899bf2f1c3434ef9eab/0_167_3529_2118/master/3529.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f576e6f1ec9a12049ae79100454f17ba","title":"oscar duarte costa rica nicaragua espanyol world cup","story":"Residents of the Nicaraguan town where the defender was born put history and conflict aside to support Costa RicaThis article is part of the ’s 2018 World Cup Experts’ Network, a cooperation between some of the best media organisations from the 32 countries who have qualified for Russia. the is running previews from two countries each day in the run-up to the tournament kicking off on 14 June.Óscar Duarte was born in Catarina, just south of the Nicaraguan capital Managua, but moved to Costa Rica with his mother at a young age. As he developed as a footballer he developed a rare sense of being both a Costa Rican and a Nicaraguan.Relations between the countries have not been good for some time and most of the animosity centres on a border conflict at the east end of the two nations and the interpretation of navigation rights on the San Juan river. In 1998 Nicaragua banned the transit of Costa Rican policemen on the river and this, among other matters such as fishing rights, rumbled on until an International Court of Justice ruling 2009, mainly in Costa Rica’s favour. A year later, however, there was another coming together as Nicaragua dredged 33 kilometres of the river. Costa Rica claimed it was a violation of its sovereignty and had caused environmental damage to the wetlands at Isla Calero. After five years of diplomatic conflict, the International Court of Justice ruled in 2015 that Nicaragua should pay Costa Rica for the damage. It appeared to be a hollow victory though. Costa Rica had demanded US$6.7m but got US$378,890. Only last month the ongoing protests in Nicaragua caused renewed diplomatic tension. Officials in San José called on Managua to respect human rights and reconsider the closure of media organisations reporting on the protests. Managua told its neighbour to mind its own business. All this makes Duarte’s story even more remarkable because the Eyol defender is one of the few people apparently capable of bringing the two nations together. Ever since his Costa Rica debut in 2010, and particularly after the 2014 World Cup, he has become a symbol of how the two countries can get on. “It’s nice for me to see how the people come together,” Duarte has said, “because you know all the problems that have happened in the past and all the differences between the two countries, but it’s always nice to show that through football you can make people come together.”And so it is that on game days the town of Catarina has become an extension of Costa Rican territory, with the residents wearing Los Ticos shirts and celebrating goals as if they were their own. People meet to watch the games together. “We are proud to have a one of our people, such as Óscar Duarte, playing for Costa Rica,” Fermín Guerrero, who lives in Catarina, said. “We feel very happy for him and he also puts the name of Nicaragua on the map.”Duarte did not have the easiest upbringing but he was determined to become a footballer. It drove him on in the face of adversity. For a long time he flew under the radar. He made his way through the academy at Saprissa, Costa Rica’s most successful club, but did not find it easy to get into the first team and gained experience on loan at Puntarenas.After that, he returned to Saprissa and enjoyed more playing time before being sold to Club Brugge in Belgium in 2013. He moved to Eyol three years later and has done well there.It is, though, as the person who has united two countries in dispute that he stands out. He often goes back to Nicaragua on holiday and was invited to watch the national team play Bolivia around his 28th birthday celebrations. He met the Nicaragua captain, Juan Barrera, beforehand and is friends with another member of the team, Luis Fernando Copete.Duarte regards himself as representing both countries. “It is not just a feeling,” he told La Prensa last year. “It is the fact that I was born in Nicaragua and no matter what anyone says that is not going to change. I would say that I am representing two countries.”Asked whether he would be the same person if he had stayed in Nicaragua, he said: “I don’t think so because no one can be the same person if they live somewhere different. If I had stayed in Nicaragua maybe I wouldn’t have had the possibility to move abroad. I was playing for Costa Rica when Club Brugge spotted me, for example.“I am not surprised that people in Nicaragua cheer me on. I was born in Catarina and I represent both Nicaragua and Costa Rica I think it’s normal. I do not see why they should miss out on cheering someone in the World Cup just because I have moved to a different country. When you see that these people are happy and grateful that is really nice.”In Russia Duarte will hope to help Costa Rica reach the quarter-finals again, as they did in Brazil four years ago, but without being sent off, as he was in the last-16 game against Greece. Whatever happens, he has done what few people have done before him: bring Costa Rica and Nicaragua closer together.

Lord Rothermere, the chairman of the Daily Mail’s parent company DMGT, said Dacre was “the greatest Fleet Street editor of his generation” whose “many campaigns, investigations and crusades that have held power to account, given a voice to the voiceless and often set the political agenda through six prime ministerships”.Dacre will remain with the company as chairman and editor-in-chief of Associated Newspapers, in addition to advising Rothermere on the changing media landscape.In a statement Dacre thanked Rothermere for giving him the freedom to edit without interference and the backing to assemble “Fleet Street’s greatest team of journalists”, something which was worth “more than all the riches of Araby”.He went on to highlight the topics the newspaper has campaigned on during his tenure, saying: “Whether it has been justice for Stephen Lawrence and the Omagh bomb victims, plastic in supermarkets and in the seas, dignity for the elderly, thwarting Labour’s plans for supercasinos, or putting sepsis and prostate cancer on the map, we have shown that newspapers make a difference.”“Without the Mail, Gary McKinnon, Shaker Aamer and Marine A would probably be in jail and Afghan British army translators, whose lives are now at risk, would not have the chance to live here.”He also praised the campaign against state regulation of the press and pledged to “continue playing as great a part in it as ever”.Dacre’s departure after 26 years in the job will start a fierce competition to succeed him at the newspaper, which sells 1.3m copies a day and continues to have enormous influence over the political agenda. The Mail on Sunday editor, Geordie Greig, who has regularly clashed with Dacre and supported remain in the EU referendum, is a leading candidate, as is current Daily Mail deputy editor, Gerard Greaves.

In her accompanying notes on Genius, the returning French pop star explains how this song sees her take on a macho persona as a way of sparring with male sexual energy – even if there are those who will reject her for it. Also done in French as sister recording Damn, Dis-Moi, Girlfriend is set to HD 80s boogie production – redolent of the guest star Dam-Funk, who delivers some deep, sexy vocal interjections.In a very strong month for rap albums, what with A$AP Rocky’s impressionistically blunted Testing and Pusha T’s Kanye-produced side of beef Daytona both proving excellent, Playboi Carti’s newest full-length, Die Lit, still stood out. His hopscotching flow broke through on Magnolia last year, and that track’s producer, Pi’erre Bourne, is the key to the album’s hazy appeal. For Fell In Luv, he cuts up a sample of a sample – Purity Ring’s lift of Young Magic – to end up with something Holly Herndon might make if she segued into mumble-rap production.Recent months have seen the 1975’s frontman Matty Healy credited with inspiring a spuriously named genre called Healywave (though he prefers Mattycore). To be fair, he has worked with most of the acts connected with it – his Dirty Hit labelmates Pale Waves and No Rome – and to be even fairer, it should probably be called Hutchencewave for its clear debt to INXS. Still, technicalities: no sooner had the term started catching on (sort of) than the 1975 return with a completely new sound. The first track from their third album hooks around a single, strangulated riff that sounds a bit like Room on Fire-era Strokes rendered as a polyphonic ringtone. It’s miles better than that suggests, and completely unlike anything else on the radio. Like always, Healy’s lyrics veer between ludicrous and devoutly sincere, touching on STDs, finding grey hairs in your “zoot” (zoot!) and an impressively self-lacerating description of himself as “a millennial that baby boomers like”. As neurotic as the song is, Healy suggests being kinder to yourself as you grow up the strangely affecting Give Yourself a Try is a sign of the 1975 letting themselves grow in weird and wonderful ways.Speaking of Healywave, there’s definitely a touch of the 1975 in the muted guitar that chimes through the second chorus of Troye Sivan’s excellent single Bloom. But most of this glorious ode to bottoming shimmers by on synths that channel the sense of anticipation and nervousness that Sivan conveys as he plays the part of a receptive partner losing his virginity. It’s stylishly done stuff: his voice on the tantalising first verse is coated in whispery reverb, an invitation to come closer, while the choruses are peppered with subtle gasps that imbue the elegant Bloom with an indecently good sense of lust.It seems far too long since Tirzah’s brief run of brilliance in the mid-2010s – not least the brilliantly scruffy I’m Not Dancing. Similarly earwormy is Gladly, the first single from her long-awaited debut album Devotion (out this August on Domino). Produced by Mica Levi, the track lopes sleepily around a single loop, a heavy, warped piano refrain that seems to pace around in circles and mirrors Tirzah’s state of mind. “All I want is you,” she repeats, drowsy with longing and obsession: “I love you.” Proof that the simplest songs are sometimes the most profound.It’s been a banner month for the Tottenham MC. Not only has he guested on standout tracks on the aforementioned Playboi Carti and A$AP Rocky albums – appearing on stage with the latter and a giant crash test dummy head in London – he has also released one of his strongest solo tracks ever. Over a minimalist beat that perfectly encapsulates the way he currently straddles grime and US rap, Pure Water sees him announce his own greatness with armour-plated self-confidence.Thirty-four years ago, Prophet self-released 1,000 copies of Right on Time, an album of scuffed, wonky but compelling electro-funk that disappeared without trace. But it was coveted by Stones Throw label head Peanut Butter Wolf, who met with Prophet and got him in the studio to finally do the follow-up. Tonight is a rerecorded version of a track from his debut, which was covered by Nite Jewel in 2011, who turns up here to join in the homecoming: a magnificent, stumbling funk jam. Nite Jewel – one of the most underrated songwriters around today – has her own track on the playlist too, On Your Own, a Hi-NRG synth workout topped with a soaring vocal.The Brooklyn garage rockers keep knocking out classic after classic, with new LP Wide Awake! another essential collection of varied, literate, totally satisfying jams. One highlight, Freebird II – the title typical of their droll hipster humour – features a big, satisfying organ melody matched by a blokey singalong for the chorus. Andrew Savage’s verses are like a positivist spin on those from Human Performance, the title lament from the band’s last album.Miss Red was born in Israel to Moroccan-Polish parents but, with her girlish patois, she sounds more like she was brought up in a Kingston ghetto. Pairing her once more with producer the Bug, who she accosted at a Tel Aviv rave and went on to tour and record with, Dagga is the first track from her debut album. One of the Bug’s hallmark industrial-dancehall riddims rides under Miss Red’s coquettish singsong vocals.Fresh from a brilliant score for the Robert Pattison thriller Good Time, and following a string of albums of densely splintered electronics, Daniel Lopatin has released an ambitious new record in Age Of. It finds space for drunken harpsichords, Anohni, terrifying shouting, tender Bon Iver-style digital songcraft, harsh trap and jazzy synth solos, and yet hangs together: he is the great sonic essayist of our voracious, always-on culture.

May refused to give an answer when asked by Jeremy Corbyn at prime minister’s questions when it would be published.Rumours were circulating in Westminster on Wednesday that Davis had threatened to resign over the details of the backstop plan.A customs union is an agreement by a group of countries, such as the EU, to all apply the same tariffs on imported goods from the rest of the world and, typically, eliminate them entirely for trade within the group. By doing this, they can help avoid the need for costly and time-consuming customs checks during trade between members of the union. Asian shipping containers arriving at Felixstowe or Rotterdam, for example, need only pass through customs once before their contents head to markets all over\u0026nbspEurope. Lorries passing between Dover and Calais avoid delay entirely.Customs are not the only checks that count – imports are also scrutinised for conformity with trading standards regulations and security and immigration purposes – but they do play an important role in determining how much friction there is at the border. A strict customs regime at Dover or between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland would lead to delays that will be costly for business and disruptive for travellers. Just-in-time supply chains in industries such as car making could suffer. An Irish peace process built around the principle of entirely unfettered travel between north and south could be jeopardised.Britain signed up to the idea of a backstop in the deal reached with the EU27 in December but May rejected a draft subsequently presented by Brussels that would in effect keep Northern Ireland in the single market.Any plan that involves a special status for Northern Ireland is anathema to May’s allies in the Democratic Unionist party, who reject the idea of any differential in treatment between the region and the rest of the UK.The EU27 has been waiting for the government to publish its alternative draft backstop proposal, which is expected to include the whole of the UK temporarily applying the EU’s external tariff – a plan that would limit the ability of the trade secretary, Liam Fox, to strike new deals with non-EU countries."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fad1424d83f87c3462e7f6e337e1ebd2017c9063/0_61_3367_2021/master/3367.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a1db6421569bbf84ebdb0397e5114299","title":"mays chamber of confusion flaps about in indecision","story":"Brexit, rail and border questions find the PM winging it, her day saved only by the big pigeon planIt was “Be nice to Chris Grayling” day. And Theresa May’s contribution was to express solidarity with her transport secretary by proving she was every bit as out of her depth as he is. Hopeless, indecisive and confused barely covers it.On days like these, cabinet meetings must resemble a convention of zombies fighting over the only functioning brain cell in the room. The best that can be said about it is that at least it is giving the rest of the world a laugh. It’s just a shame for those of us stuck in the UK who have to live with it.Prime minister’s questions is turning into a breeze for Jeremy Corbyn. Where previously he used to overthink things – admittedly not hard in his case – and tie himself up in knots with his own logic, he now just stands up and says, “how’s it going?”As even May is just about sentient enough to realise that “badly” won’t quite cut it, she has no answer. Because she genuinely doesn’t know. There is no area of government policy over which she has a firm grasp. Least of all Brexit.The Labour leader bounced to his feet and demanded to know if the government was going to publish the long-delayed white paper on its negotiating position before the Commons voted on the Lords amendments to the Brexit withdrawal bill next Tuesday. As it might be quite handy. If not essential to anyone hoping to make an informed decision.May’s eyes rotated in opposite directions and her mouth opened and shut as if gasping for breath while struggling for words. “I agree that we want to publish a white paper,” she croaked eventually. The snag was that no one in the cabinet could agree on what should go in it. Or when it should be published. The white paper remained defiantly white.“OK,” said Corbyn, generously choosing to give her another chance. If she wasn’t going to publish the white paper before next Tuesday could she at least promise to do so before the European council meeting? She couldn’t. It was far better that our negotiators were kept entirely in the dark. If they didn’t know what the government’s position was there was no chance of Johnny Foreigner second-guessing and outmanoeuvring us.That was the highpoint of the exchanges. May didn’t even know if the Brexit sub-subcommittees on maximum facilitation and the customs partnership had even met, let alone reached any conclusions. She couldn’t explain how her 10-mile buffer zone on the Irish border was going to work. There again, no one can as it’s a completely idiotic idea.In desperation May went to her default PMQs algorithm and demanded that Labour come up with solutions of their own. If he had had any, Corbyn might have been tempted to list them. But he didn’t, so he merely pointed out that it wasn’t the opposition doing the Brexit negotiations, before adding that the government didn’t appear to think it was its job to conduct the negotiations either.By now the Tory benches were almost entirely silent. There was a time, when May first became prime minister, that they thought her evasiveness and general air of uselessness was a sophisticated act. A means of luring opponents into a false sense of security. That moment has long passed and Conservative backbenchers have come to realise that behind her veneer of incompetence are only deeper and deeper layers of incompetence. Futility piled on futility.Corbyn ended by comparing the chaos of Brexit to the train wreck of the railways. At the mention of the word railways, Chris Grayling, who had spent PMQs in the recovery position near the speaker’s chair, jerked into life, his eyes full of terror. He just about managed to control the spasms in his neck but his head wobbled rhythmically. Failing Grayling isn’t in a good way and it would be a kindness if he was kept out of sight for a while. A kindness both to the country as well as him.With the prime minister now unable to remember her own name or what she was even doing in the chamber, the Tories’ Chris Davies tried to distract her by asking if she would be happy to sponsor a pigeon. “Yes,” she said. It was the only straight answer she gave all day. The unlucky pigeon was tearing its feathers out."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c5fb4849da495c469e313528dc415f79ad44efe1/409_580_1976_1186/master/1976.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=69a193f042bf5571030b3c107d0a4846","title":"theresa may israel iran nuclear deal benjamin netanyahu","story":"PM tells Benjamin Netanyahu that Britain still backs deal, and raises issue of Palestinian deathsIsrael’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has pressed Theresa May to recognise that the Iranian nuclear deal is on the point of collapse and that a fresh plan is needed to stop Iran restarting its uranium enrichment programme.Netanyahu met May on Wednesday following his talks this week with the other European supporters of the landmark 2015 nuclear deal, the French president, Emmanuel Macron, and Germany’s chancellor, Angela Merkel. Netanyahu has lobbied for European leaders to follow the example of the US president, Donald Trump, and pull out of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) on Iran.Netanyahu told May he was focused on making sure Iran did not get a nuclear weapon and on “how to roll back Iran’s aggression in the region”. The European signatories are scrambling to save the accord, which they see as crucial to forestalling an Iranian nuclear weapon. However, the US president has said the deal is deeply flawed.The Israeli pressure is designed not only to back Trump’s decision to pull out of the deal but also to force European firms to disinvest from Iran.May also raised the subject of the UN’s call for an independent inquiry into the killing of dozens of Palestinian protesters on the day the US moved its embassy to Jerusalem.May stressed she recognised Israel’s right to self-defence but called on Netanyahu to act to alleviate the situation. The Israeli prime minister insisted the protests were driven by the militant group Hamas and that the response was aimed at minimising causalities. Rival groups of protesters gathered outside Downing Street waving Palestinian and Israeli flags before Netanyahu’s arrival. On Tuesday, Iran said it had ordered preparations for increasing uranium enrichment capacity in case the nuclear agreement collapsed. It also announced it had completed a new centrifuge assembly centre at the Natanz nuclear site.The finance ministers and foreign secretaries of the UK, Germany and France have jointly written to their US counterparts seeking assurances that the US will not impose secondary sanctions on EU firms operating in Iran. Their letter says that JCPOA is “the best means through which we can prevent a nuclear armed Iran”.Speaking in France ahead of his meeting with May, Netanyahu was confident that the EU firms operating in Iran would not be able to resist US sanctions.Several big companies, including France’s Total and the Netherlands’ Maersk, have already said it would be impossible to stay in Iran once sanctions were fully reimposed over the next six months, unless they received explicit exemptions from Washington. Boeing also announced it was cancelling plans to provide two Iranian carriers.The European Investment Bank said on Wednesday that it could not help shield trade between the EU and Iran from US sanctions, dashing the hopes of some EU finance ministers that it might be a source of finance for EU firms operating in Iran. The bank said it “should remain a solid and credible institution on the international capital markets, and this would be incompatible with ignoring possible sanctions against Iran”.

So clearly if we don’t have a security policy, they will less safe now than they otherwise would be. The aim, remember, is to save lives, to maintain peace, to maintain security.And in his speech he said all EU citizens, not just British ones, could be at risk without a deal on security on the UK’s terms. He said:The first duty of government is to keep its citizens safe.And it’s in the pursuit of that safety that Britain made an unconditional offer to the European Union.Any move by others to place conditions on our offer will only serve to put the safety of everybody’s citizens at risk. Because when terrorists set off bombs or fire guns — be in it on the streets of Paris, or London, or Manchester or Brussels — they don’t check the passports of their victims first.By building on the prime minister’s speeches, our existing White Papers, our 17 summer papers and countless presentations made directly to the EU about the partnership we want.My general response to this is, in debates in Whitehall between fast and slow, I normally vote for fast. That’s probably a given.The detail of this is being discussed at the moment. It has been through one cabinet committee, it is going to another one, and it would be improper of me to pre-empt the negotiation there. But I suspect it will be fairly decisive. He refused to confirm that the backstop plan would definitely be published tomorrow. Asked about this, he said it would depend on whether the cabinet committee reached a conclusion. According to the BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg, this contradicts Number 10 claims that the matter is settled. (See 4.47pm.)I think the prime minister has already made public the fact that we expect to put a time limit on the backstop proposal.Contingency planning always looks a bit bleak, particularly because we don’t intend to arrive at that contingency. That’s all from me for today.Thanks for the comments.This is from HuffPost’s Owen Bennett.British officials have continued to turn a blind eye to a massive customs scam that has allowed criminal gangs to flood European markets with cheap clothes and shoes, the EU’s anti-fraud office has said.Outlining its annual report , the European anti-fraud office, known by its French acronym Olaf, said that the “scarily” simple customs fraud was probably continuing on the same scale, although the problem had partly shifted from the UK to Hungary and Greece.The commission announced in March it was starting legal action against the UK for €2.7bn (£2.4bn) it said had been lost to the EU budget.While the issue is unrelated to Brexit, it helps explain why member states are so hostile to Theresa May’s preferred option for solving the Irish border conundrum, an unprecedented “customs partnership” that would see the UK taking charge of collecting EU customs revenues.The EU investigators’ announcement that the fraud has continued is likely to deepen distrust. The initial investigation, uncovered a €1.98bn loss to the EU budget between 2013-16, as well as a €3.2bn loss in VAT revenues to France, Germany, Spain and Italy - the EU’s largest states that will have a crucial final say on post-Brexit customs arrangements.Ernesto Bianchi, a director of investigations at Olaf, said the simplicity of the fraud was “scary”, explaining that the fraudsters under-declared the value of of low-cost, everyday goods, such as t-shirts and jeans.Olaf’s report concluded that fraudsters usually brought their goods in to Hamburg, but drove them in lorries to other EU ports where they thought they could get away with under-declaring the value.The British government has said it does not recognise the figures and citied HMRC’s “excellent record in tackling fraud and rule-breaking of all kinds”.Here is some comment on what Davis said in his Q\u0026ampA.Davis says the whole point of a security agreement is to keep people safe. If there is no agreement on security, the public will be less safe than otherwise, he says.I will post a summary shorty.Q: When will we see the white paper?Davis says the negotiations are under way.He says in Whitehall debates, given a choice between fast and slow, he normally opts for fast.But the PM was right to say that the white paper will be published when it is ready.Q: If Tory MPs vote for the Lords amendments on the EU withdrawal bill, can they stay in the party.That is one for the chief whip, he says.Davis says he is not expecting to settle the Northern Ireland issue until October.A cabinet committee is looking at the backstop plan. If that reaches a conclusion, the document will be seen tomorrow.Q: Have you signed off on the backstop plan being published tomorrow. And if you are unhappy about it, can you stay in your job?Davis says it has been to one cabinet committee and is going to another one. It is up to the PM what happens to him.Q: Is it true the backstop will have a time limit not limited by time?Davis says the PM has already said it will be time limited.Q: What is your reaction to the Dutch government’s warning to manufacturers not to rely on British parts?Davis says the Dutch warnings were part of contingency planning.Davis says is is optimistic about Brexit.When I look at the relationship between the UK and the twenty seven remaining members of the EU, there are reasons to be optimistic. And I make no apologies for being so. Our interests are so aligned that the only threats come not from deliberate action, but from what we fail to do. But he says the Brexit talks could fail by accident.The primary risk in these negotiations is now one of accident.That due to a lack of ambition — by resting on third country precedents — we miscalculate somehow. And the cost of that miscalculation is a deal that is unacceptable to both sides. That lets down the citizens we are so keen to protect. Now is the time to redouble our efforts, and open our minds once again. To build an enduring new partnership between the closest of friends and allies. Davis says the UK wants Brexit to be “as smooth and orderly as possible”.We have chosen right from the beginning to recognise the specific responsibilities that lie with us, as the party choosing to leave.And that is why we are putting forward practical solutions to the obstacles that might otherwise undermine the long-lasting, deep and special partnership we want with the EU.One that respects the institutional architecture of the European Union, and the constitutional and economic integrity of the United Kingdom.Here is the key quote so far.It’s sometimes said that the limits of our cooperation have been set by the United Kingdom.That on leaving the European Union — and not being under the jurisdiction of the ECJ — there will be an automatic drop in security cooperation.That we are the only one with a choice.The European Union does have choices.And when I see the positions proposed by the Commission, I see choices being taken there.Ones which lean towards the protection of legal precedents, above operational capability. Davis says the UK wants a comprehensive, deep partnership with the EU on a whole range of matters relating to security.He says the UK has always seen the EU differently. That is why people voted to leave, but confident in the knowledge that they would be able to carry on cooperating afterwards.This is from ITV’s Robert Peston.Davis is now speaking about Galileo.The UK has been instrumental in its design.But now the EU is claiming that UK involvement, as a third country, would put the scheme at risk - even though shutting out the UK could delay the project by three years, he says.He says this amounts to shooting oneself if the foot just to prove the gun works.He says relying on “dogmatic precedents” does not help anyone.The UK is proposing a collaborative approach, he says.Europe’s security is the UK’ security, he says."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/17172011a5702537a284245eeec7e616e20e9979/0_0_500_300/master/500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=652f9147e17228f9fef241af8cf77a4d","title":"oldest known footprints on earth discovered left by ancient bug","story":"Ancient prints bring scientists closer to understanding what were the first creatures to evolve pairs of legsThe oldest known footprints on Earth, left by an ancient creepy-crawly more than 500 million years ago, have been discovered in China.The tracks were left by a primitive ancestor of modern-day insects or worms, according to scientists. Precisely what the creature looked like is a mystery, though: nothing this old with legs has been discovered to date.Prof Shuhai Xiao, a geobiologist at Virginia Tech University and senior author of the research, said the finding brings scientists closer to understanding what creatures were the first to evolve pairs of legs.“Animals use their appendages to move around, to build their homes, to fight, to feed, and sometimes to help mate,” he said, adding that the movement of sediments by the first legged creatures could have had a major impact on the Earth’s geochemical cycles and climate. “It is important to know when the first appendages appeared, and in what animals, because this can tell us when and how animals began to change to the Earth in a particular way.”The fossils, which were found in the Yangtze Gorges area of south China, lie between two rock layers that have been radiocarbon-dated to 551m and 541m years old, meaning the footprints were made sometime between these dates.Previously, scientists had discovered footprints as old as 530-540m years, but none predating the Cambrian period, which also began at this time and marked an explosion in the ersity and complexity of life on Earth. The latest prints date to the Ediacaran period, whose sparse fossil record is populated with soft-tissued creatures including worms and organisms that resembled tiny immobile bags.The fossils are just a few millimetres in width and Xiao’s team spotted them after painstakingly tilting rock slabs at different angles so the sunlight would illuminate any subtle traces left by ancient bugs.“The key challenge is to get the lighting right so that the fossils stand out against the background, because the fossils have very low relief,” said Xiao.On closer analysis, the team found the marks comprise two rows of imprints that they believe were left by a creature scurrying along a riverbed, at a time when life had not yet colonised dry land. The trackways also appear to be connected to burrows, suggesting the creatures periodically tunnelled down into the sediments, perhaps to mine oxygen and microbes as food.The scientists are unsure whether the creature had many legs or just two, and whether it was a member of the arthropod group, which includes bumblebees and spiders, or annelids, which contains modern-day bristle worms. “Unless the animal died and was preserved next to its footprints,” said Xiao, “it is hard to say who made the footprints.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0cb35be3ecb710ebd0923a1d5d033890f3286373/0_357_4400_2640/master/4400.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=af1342b153b277b029dff776c3e83167","title":"made in dagenham yes but women went on strike in halewood too","story":"Female machinists at Ford in Liverpool walked out in 1968 in solidarity, but feel they have been airbrushed from historyWomen have to unite to tackle the obstacles they continue to face in the workplace, a former sewing machinist at Ford in the 1960s has said on the 50th anniversary of the epochal Dagenham strikes that changed the face of history.It was a normal day like any other when female employees at Ford’s Dagenham plant, who felt increasingly frustrated by an unequal pay structure, walked out.The strike, regarded as a watershed moment in the fight for equality, paved the way for the Equal Pay Act of 1970, and has been retold on stage and on screen including in the 2010 movie Made in Dagenham. But the role of females working at Ford’s plant in Halewood on Merseyside, who downed tools in solidarity with their southern colleagues, has been largely overlooked. Frances Kerwin is one of those forgotten heroines. She had only been working at Ford for two weeks when union conveners Bernard Passingham and Rose Boland paid Halewood a visit to discuss the strikes hundreds of miles away. “Our supervisors were saying ‘You can’t do this, you have to stay’ – because women didn’t go on strike then,” she recalled. “But I wanted to join them because we’re all women. My family were union-orientated. My grandfather worked on the docks.”Though there was a real fear that they might lose their jobs, the women of the north voted to walk out of work because “it’s crucial for women to work together,” Kerwin, now 76, said, before jovially comparing herself and her colleagues to “the Yanks that came in at the end of the war to help us win”.Asked if women had come a long way since then, she said “not really”, but pointed to the significance of tennis players winning the fight for equal pay.“In workplaces people are still struggling,” she said. “Women have to unite. When we went on strike, the unions were very strong. At this moment they’re not. They need to recruit women, who can – like us – stand up and be counted. “But young people are now saying: ‘They did that years ago, why can’t we do it?’”In 1968, the female machinists at Ford were classified within the company pay structure as grade B. That meant they were officially unskilled, despite having to pass tests in order to gain their employment. After years battling for recognition as skilled workers, they finally walked out, bringing car production to halt and becoming the focus of national news stories.Since then they have given talks and appeared at film premieres. Earlier this year, some of them even walked down the Baftas red carpet with British actor Gemma Arterton, in support of the #MeToo and #TimesUp movements. These conversations, Kerwin said, are “definitely important”.She added: “Fifty years ago we were the minions. Women had to know their place.”She said she was was infuriated when the Dagenham film came out and did not show the role of the women of the north. “The strike’s success would not have been possible without us. They would have been on their own,” she said.But on Thursday she is travelling down to London to meet the London women she campaigned with 50 years ago, some of whom she is still in touch with. “We made a little bit of history. A lot of them have passed away. Fifty years, it’s a long time, girl, isn’t it?” Kerwin and other former colleagues from Halewood will be joined by Steve Rotheram, the mayor of Liverpool City Region. Rotheram said he led a search to track down the Halewood women so their efforts could be given the recognition they deserve, and thanks to thousands of people who spread the word through social media and local newspaper coverage, he found them.“Without the stand taken by women working at Ford’s plants in Dagenham and Halewood in 1968, the Equal Pay Act would not have followed. The fight has not yet been won, but we owe them an awful lot,” he said.“Those who walked out of the Halewood plant have, in recent years, become a forgotten part of the story … we will be taking a coachload of former Ford workers and their families down to Dagenham to celebrate their achievements on the 7th of June. It should be a special day for all involved.”Danielle Flynn, an apprentice from Jaguar Land Rover’s Halewood plant, thanked “these amazing women from the Halewood plant in its Ford era” for paving the way for women “to forge a successful career in a traditionally male-dominated industry”.The University of East London, which is hosting a separate event with Gwen Davis and Eileen Pullen, two of the original Ford Dagenham strikers, on Thursday, emphasised the strike action was a key moment in the history of women and work.“Not only did the actions of the Ford sewing machinists initiate the 1970 Equal Pay Act but also a period of increased gender equality,” said Elaine Yerby, a senior lecturer at the Royal Docks School of Business and Law.“In this era of #MeToo and the recent gender pay reporting figures that revealed the existence of gender pay gaps in every sector, knowing that the women didn’t realise how brave they were being at the time provides the impetus for those committed to equality at work to continue their fight.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/742d060096b937901b1810445525990e0bd2c768/264_215_4516_2711/master/4516.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=170145acb6504d8ca0ea435de2e16295","title":"scotland england kyle coetzer sunday one off odi","story":"Cricket Scotland is still lamenting the failure to reach the 2019 World Cup but the side are looking forward to a one-off ODIScotland’s cricketers will be in the tree tops near Loch Lomond on Thursday, flying down zip wires and negotiating 22-metre high ropewalks as they prepare for their one-day international against England with a visit to Go Ape.Given the size of the task at the Grange in Edinburgh on Sunday – taking on the world’s No 1 team in 50-over cricket right now – testing out their collective head for heights before ploughing into two days of training, is perhaps no bad thing.Their captain, Kyle Coetzer admits he does not know what to expect from this group-bonding exercise. But as regards facing the Auld Enemy for the first time in four years, there is a healthy dose of respect and a quiet confidence that his players will not simply be providing an easy warm-up for England’s series with Australia.“Any time Scotland plays England, be it football, rugby or even cricket, it’s going to be a bit special,” says the former Durham batsman, who during the 2015 World Cup set the record for the highest score by an associate cricketer with a blistering 156 against Bangladesh.“This match is a fantastic reward for a lot of hard work and for the cricket-watching public here. To have the No 1 team in our backyard is incredible. Yes, they are a dangerous side but this is white-ball cricket and so there is an opportunity to do something special. It only takes one or two guys to take a game away and we have those players.”Coetzer is right. After all, it was only back in March that Scotland came within a whisker of reaching next summer’s criminally elite 10-team World Cup during the qualifiers in Zimbabwe, having looked set to book their place and knock out West Indies only to be denied by a combination of rain and questionable umpiring.Set 199 to win after a fine bowling performance in Harare, the Saltires were 125 for five from 35.2 overs when a deluge washed out the remainder of their final group match. With no reserve day scheduled, a five-run defeat via Duckworth-Lewis-Stern followed.Scottish cricketers know all about the elements, of course, but what stuck in the craw was the dismissal of Richie Berrington four overs before the rain, having been wrongly adjudged lbw for 33 without the opportunity to review. Had this fifth wicket not fallen and the run-rate stayed the same, Coetzer’s men would have gone through.“To be honest, I don’t know if I am over it,” says Coetzer. “Not reaching the World Cup saw Cricket Scotland miss out on around $700,000 (£525,000) too, which would have been huge for the sport, especially the grassroots. People make mistakes – players, umpires, anyone – but to not have the review system in a competition of that importance was … well … it just has to be there in future.”If this lack of technological help is one sore point – the official explanation given was that not every qualifier was televised – then the biggest perceived crime is having the 50-over format’s showpiece made up of so few teams, with Coetzer among a number of associate nation captains to highlight this folly.“You feel as if you are harping on about the same thing and getting nowhere,” he says. “Against West Indies it felt like whole world wanted us to win just to make a scene. And it’s not like we’re wanting a slice of the pie that’s unfair, just a situation that is for the betterment of the game as a whole – and that’s more than just a select few at the World Cup.”While missing out on the World Cup denied Scotland nine matches against the best teams – more than they get otherwise in a four-year cycle – and the make-up of the tournament beyond next year is yet to be decided, Aberdeen-born Coetzer is encouraged that they have now been added to the ICC one-day rankings, describing it as a “step in the right direction for globalising the sport”, as are the recent Test elevations for Ireland and Afghanistan.Sunday will mark his 50th one-day appearance – a source of personal pride – but, given that his debut came 10 years ago, it also highlights how few of their matches get official status and also the tug-of-war that can occur for those also involved in the county system the seamer Josh Davey, for example, missed the World Cup qualifiers due to a clash with Somerset’s pre-season.And the club versus country situation? “It’s a massive issue. I don’t want to speak out of turn but I know I faced huge challenges when I was with Durham. You have split loyalties you want to play for both. Your potential career lies with the county but there were occasions of immense pressure. I missed a game against Australia sitting on a team bus to Hove.”These are just some of the issues that face Scotland. But in the short term, at least, they have three juicy fixtures, with England’s visit followed by two T20 internationals against the world No 1 Pakistan. And if a couple of Scotland players go ape on the day, who knows?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/38d003cbb7d35b711bdb685f2e6c34b2d48ee29a/0_116_3322_1994/master/3322.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=af19a0a27e25be682b31a0246d66a439","title":"french open quarter finals muguruza sharapova nadal halep kerber del potro cilic live","story":"Rafael Nadal was serving to level the match at one set all when play was called off while Marin Cilic and Juan Martín del Potro were in a first-set tie-break, after earlier wins for Garbiñe Muguruza and Simona HalepNote: those are Paris times.I’m going to take my leave for today, but see you tomorrow for Jour Trois of the French Open men’s quarter-finals, along with the women’s semi-finals. I’ll leave you with Kevin Mitchell’s round-up of today’s action on the women’s side:Thanks for readingtweetingemailing etc. À demain!So Nadal will resume tomorrow trailing Schwartzman by a set but serving for the second at 5-3, 30-15, while Cilic and Del Potro will return at a clutch moment, tied at 5-5 in the first-set tie-break. Normally a match that goes into a second day would be scheduled second on the same court but, given the winners will have to play again on Friday, organisers may opt to put the men on before the women’s semi-finals. No sign of the order of play yet.That’s your lot for the day, folks. Play has been cancelled until tomorrow.The Roland Garros Twitter feed now says no play before 7.30pm. Which, given it’s nearly 7.30pm in Paris, isn’t particularly helpful.I wish I had some good news to bring you but I don’t. The covers are still on. Want to watch some match highlights from Halep v Kerber while we wait for a weather update?The only definite at the moment is that there’ll be no play before 7.15pm local time.It’s coming up to 7pm in Paris, so you’d think they’d need to get back on court within the next hour or so, otherwise the organisers may call it off for the day. If the players do return this evening, they could perhaps play until 9.30pm, but that’s only if the light is good, which seems unlikely given the grey skies.They’ve also been hauled off on Lenglen, with Cilic and Del Potro locked at 5-5 in the tie-break.... as Nadal breaks Schwartzman quicker than you can say: “Nadal breaks Schwartzman”. What a transformation from Nadal since the break, who’s more aggressive on his groundstrokes and serve. So Nadal is serving to level the match at one set all, while Cilic and Del Potro are entering the business end of the breaker. If only I had four eyes, 16 fingers and four thumbs. And with Nadal leading 30-15, play has been suspended! Il pleut.Cilic and Del Potro, meanwhile, are into a first-set tie-break. Cilic is a man with serving tics too, with his bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce, bouncing of the ball. It doesn’t get him anywhere at 2-2 Del Potro grabs the mini-break before surrendering it immediately. 3-3 at the changeover ...“Does Rafa still do his routine clothes, ear and face checking before receiving each point?” asks Andrew Benton. “I saw him in Beijing last year, his routine involved right to left touching the ears and his t-shirt shoulders as well as a mini-hoick up of the trousers. He won then, so it must work.” Of course. And don’t forget asking for the towel between every point too. And when he’s serving he sweeps the baseline with his shoe. It seems to be doing the trick. He holds comfortably. Mesdames et messieurs, we’re back under way. Nadal, remember, was broken just before the break, so it’s Schwartzman serving at 3-2. Nadal looks like he’s learned a lesson or two in the locker room as he charges to 0-30. But the pre-rain delay Schwartzman then stands up. He bludgeons a backhand winner down the line. 30-all. Nadal gets a break point at 30-40. Nadal has Schwartzman scampering around but out of nowhere the Argentinian hits a forehand winner on the run. Deuce. Schwartzman throws in a drop-shot, Nadal is wise to it but his slice clips the tape and drops wide. Advantage Schwartzman. Deuce. Advantage Nadal. Schwartzman hits just long and Rafa roars. He’s broken back. Can he kick on from here?The word is that Nadal’s decision to have his wrists taped between the first and second sets was not because of any injury, but instead to stop his sweat dripping on to the handle of his racket.Tik! Tok! Tikity! Tok! The players are warming up. It’s hard to see how the break could have benefitted Schwartzman in any way he didn’t need to change anything, he was playing so well. Nadal, however, will have had plenty to discuss with his team in the locker room and we could see a change in tactics.The good news: after a much shorter break than expected, the players are back out, both on Chatrier and Lenglen.The bad news: the weather forecast for the rest of the day is not that great, so there’s a chance they may not finish today.More from today’s winners on the women’s side.Halep on coming from a set down to beat Kerber:It’s always a tough match when I play against her. After the first set I just stayed strong and didn’t give up. I missed a lot in the beginning. I tried to do too much. I changed the tactics a bit and it worked.Muguruza on thrashing Sharapova:I was up against a great player so I had make sure I brought my best tennis. I wasn’t thinking so much about the result but I just was thinking about not dropping my level, not giving her a single point, and I guess that helped my performance.An announcement that there’ll be no play for at least the next 20 minutes.Ho hum. There’s not much to see here.Why is Nadal so off? He won’t be enjoying the heavy conditions, his topspin doesn’t kick up with the same venom. And Schwartzman seems to have got into his head Nadal hates being dictated to, he’s used to drawing his opponent around on a piece of string on clay. But the rain delay may well help Nadal to regroup. And they could be off court for some time because the covers are now on. During the rain break, some tea-time stats for you to digest:Play’s also been suspended on Lenglen, where there’s still nothing to pick between Cilic and Del Potro. Cilic saved three break points in the ninth game. No, because Nadal instantly slips 0-40 down. He grimaces at his box, now minus Uncle Toni, who stepped down from his duties at the end of last year. He saves the first but is unable to continue the rescue act on the second. Schwartzman is ahead once more! And just to add to the drama, the players are forced off court by the rain.The rain is getting stronger. Perhaps Schwartzman is distracted because he falls break point down having been 40-0 up. A looping Nadal forehand is there to be hit, Schwartzman swats it cross-court, and Nadal can’t get that back into court. Deuce. Nadal is having to work so hard to finish Schwartzman off in these rallies, eventually the Spaniard settles matters at the net. Nadal’s advantage. A wild and wayward backhand from Schwartzman and Nadal breaks back. Could this be the turning point?Sacré bleu! It’s just got even more interesting on Chatrier, because Nadal blazes into the tramlines to go break point down. Again, Nadal hits wide. Schwartzman leads Nadal, 83-2 at the French Open, by a set and a break, I repeat Schwartzman leads Nadal by a set and a break.More on the women’s quarter-finals:It’s hard to take your eyes off this, but what of Cilic v Del Potro? Eight games on the board and 37 minutes in, there hasn’t been a break of serve.It’s raining. But not pouring. So they’re carrying on. Nadal is grimacing at deuce. A 14th forehand winner from Schwartzman and it’s his advantage. Make that Jeu Schwartzman. Schwartzman has been superb so far but can he sustain this over a best-of-five set match? And remember, only two players have ever beaten Nadal here: Robin Soderling in 2009 and Novak Djokovic in 2015. Winning a set against Nadal at Roland Garros is one thing defeating Nadal is quite another. Nadal holds at the start of the second set, the only blot on his service game is a double fault. Nadal’s left wrist is being taped by the trainer. Make that the right too. Given they both are, that suggests there isn’t an injury. But there’s no doubt he’s hurting right now. The spectator is helped out of the stadium and they’re back under way. The pair trade cross-court blows before Schwartzman changes tack with a thunderbolt down the line! Did it go in? Yes! Nadal’s run of 37 consecutive sets at Roland Garros is over! It’s the first set he’s lost here since 2015.... not that they’ve played it yet, because the tournament doctor is helping someone in the crowd. Nadal remains on court, while Schwartzman has gone back to his chair. So Diego, this is your moment. 15-0. A deft volley from Schwartzman and it’s 30-0. Schwartzman steps in with the court at his mercy – and he batters the net! 30-15. He makes no mistakes with the short ball this time, 40-15. Two set points for the Argentinian. I didn’t think I’d be writing that this afternoon. Schwartzman goes for broke on the forehand and it whistles long. 40-30. Nadal grazes the baseline with his backhand before throwing in a drop-shot. Nerveless. Schwartzman again puts a little too much on his forehand. Break point Nadal. But a Nadal error followed by a Schwartzman smash and here’s a third set point ..."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e15df42086587ab3f632f5e78c9b4b33f85735e0/434_505_3071_1843/master/3071.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0f7bdb5450b6edc8932da0a5d62457f7","title":"edinburgh fringe 2018 tackle metoo celebrate blue peter lineup","story":"Lineup for 71st edition includes hard-hitting debuts and plenty of nostalgia An array of provocative debuts will mix with a heavy dose of nostalgia at the 71st Edinburgh fringe festival this August, as creative takes on the #MeToo movement are performed alongside a theatrical tribute to Blue Peter, the world’s longest-running children’s TV show.Launching the 2018 fringe programme with 3,548 shows, the most in its history, the event’s chief executive, Shona McCarthy, said: “Whether this is your first or your 50th time visiting the fringe as a performer or audience member, this is a place where new discoveries wait around every corner.” With venues ranging from a “pianodrome” constructed of 55 recycled pianos in the Royal Botanic Garden to a comedy club hosted in a chicken coop, the programme includes 1,900 premieres, including debuts from the Hi-de-Hi! star Su Pollard, the IT Crowd’s Katherine Parkinson and the singer and actor Jason Donovan.  Weekend columnistBim Adewunmi will present her first play, The Hoard, about the relationship between three sisters.The Assembly Rooms will host Once Seen on Blue Peter, starring former presenters Peter Purves, Janet Ellis, Peter Duncan and Mark Curry along with surprise celebrity guests as they celebrate the world of children’s entertainment.US comedy performers include the spiky Janeane Garofalo, and Judah Friedlander, in the follow-up to his critically acclaimed 2017 Netflix standup show satirising American exceptionalism. As usual, subject matter is eclectic, but emerging themes are sex and consent, including the comedian Ayesha Hazarika’s take on where feminism finds itself in the wake of #MeToo, while a clutch of shows explore the 70th anniversary of the NHS, and mental health. The mixed media performance A Fortunate Man is inspired by John Berger’s exploration of the life of a county doctor 50 years ago, while the director Jeremy Weller’s Where It Hurts shares Edinburgh residents’ experiences of the NHS. The festival will have a particular focus on street theatre, with a new street events arena on the Royal Mile hosting more than 250 shows a day. There are also plans to trial cashless donations for street performers at four stages, after buskers raised concerns that their takings were declining as fewer people carry loose change. McCarthy also emphasised the need to tackle the rising cost of attending the festival. The Fringe Society’s Blueprint document, also published on Wednesday, which lists the priorities in the run-up to the festival’s 75th anniversary in 2022, was proof of “big ambitions to make the fringe more affordable,” said McCarthy.Plans to reduce the long-term cost of performing and visiting the fringe include addressing the cost of accommodation in the city, freezing registration fees until at least 2022, reducing box office commission and exploring affordable ticketing options. McCarthy said she was exploring partnerships with local universities that have empty halls of residence, and was keen to pilot a host-an-artist scheme with Edinburgh residents. The fringe is also working with the tourist body Visit Scotland to map accommodation beyond the city centre and transport provision.This dovetails with a wider move to expand the fringe beyond the city centre: the festival programme will include a map of Leith after the area, which is emerging as an arts hub, had a significant growth in venues last year.Accessibility is another priority, and the festival will provide free sensory backpacks for children and adults on the autism spectrum for the first time. They will include a fidget toy, earplugs and a list of relaxed performances. Earlier this year, the fringe was caught up in a funding row involving Creative Scotland, which was criticised for a series of unexpected choices, leading to the resignation of two board members from the arts body. The fringe was one of those removed from its network of regularly funded organisations, losing £70,000 annually.Cold BloodA dance show with a difference: the beautiful moves are made by three performers’ fingers, which waltz around miniature props and are filmed live and projected on to a huge screen.Trojan HorseAfter shows about the Chilcot inquiry and the 1985 Bradford City fire, the documentary theatre company Lung presents a piece based on the inquiry into a fake plot to Islamise Birmingham schools.Jordan BrookesExpect the unexpected: at last year’s fringe, Brookes’ discombobulating set had audiences in stitches before he even made his proper entrance.

The ballistic shields were donated by a local company and given to students at St Cornelius school in Chadds Ford, Pennsylvania, as a leaving present before high school.In footage of the gifting ceremony, children were left speechless by the sombre tone of the gift. The president of Unequal was also invited to speak, telling students “it’s sad that times have called for such a product to be invented, but we have answered such a call”.Other products on the market include door barricade systems, software that scans social media for the threat of an attack and “active shooter kits”, which claim to offer “the essential items needed to administer first aid prior to the arrival of Fire or EMS personnel”. Students at some schools, including at Majory Stoneman Douglas high school in Parkland, are now only allowed to wear clear backpacks.Some parents are going as far as to remove the children from school entirely. Tim Lambert, president at the Texas Home School Coalition told the Washington Times that they number of calls they receive has doubled in the past few moths, from 600 to around 1,400.At a time of heightened anxiety, the one measure that does not seem to be discussed is gun control. Yesterday, Betsy DeVos said that the new school shooting safety panel created in the wake of Parkland will not consider any gun control measures, or even study the role of guns in school safety. When asked if the commission would be looking at the role of firearms, the education secretary answered “that is not part of the commission’s charge, per se”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f23ff34d3d8cee34a53bbbe8cec0a04abe95d7e8/0_158_4032_2419/master/4032.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=17db40af0d61eb4674b01197f524fa43","title":"everyday racism in america how to fix it","story":"To root out racism, academics and activists say, talk of healing is not enough: the bias at the heart of American politics, policing and society must be addressedIt seems as though every single day, the list grows.Waiting in a coffee shop while black. Selling real estate while black. Moving in while black. Napping while black. Working out while black.Ever since a Starbucks in the Philadelphia area came under national scrutiny for calling the police on two black men waiting for a business associate in one of the company’s coffee shops, new attention has been focused on the long list of mundane activities that black Americans can’t confidently engage in without being treated as suspicious or having the police called.“It’s just part of daily living. It’s what you expect as a person of color when you head out the door in the morning,” said Jeff Chang, the author of Who We Be: A Cultural History of Race in Post-Civil Rights America. “A moment like this just sort of galvanized folks to be able to express all the different ways in which they’ve been impacted by daily racism.”In many ways the newly energized conversation parallels how Black Lives Matter emerged as an ideological clearinghouse for the problem of racialized police violence several years ago. Neither phenomenon was new, but in both cases a stream of high profile incidents managed to snowball into its own trope, in part thanks to social media and smartphone videos. In this case that’s the trope of “everyday racism”. For experts, the genesis is clear. While the US has ended the formal, legal codes of enslavement and segregation that stood for most of the nation’s history, little has been done to change the minds of too many about the racist ideas that those structures rested on. “There has not been a society-wide and intensive challenge to racist ideas in the US,” said Ibram Kendi, the director of the Antiracist Research \u0026amp Policy Center at American University. “You’ve had people saying we need to have ‘national conversations’, You’ve have people calling for ‘healing’, because in their minds it’s just that people are hateful and they need to start loving ... But in terms of a national, widespread effort to reorient Americans’ racist ideas – that has never happened before.”And those ideas run deep, said Jamilah Lemieux, a cultural critic and writer. “Non-black people in this country have been fed a steady diet of propaganda from their parents, their schools, their churches, and from the media that tells them that people of color, and particularly black folks and Latinx people are not to be trusted.“They’ve been taught that we are criminals, that we are violent that we are predators and think we need to be monitored.” Barack Obama’s 2008 election was seen by much of white America as the dawning of a new, post-racial age. The logic held that, if a black man could attain the highest office in the land, then no goal could be considered out of reach for an inidual black person in modern America. This post-racial framing, of course, belies not just the inherited and institutional disadvantages black Americans face in housing, education, wealth, and other socioeconomic concerns, but also the emergence of what some have described as a “newer, slicker” form of racism. After the 2008 election, the anti-racist activist and writer Tim Wise described it as one where whites “hold the larger black community in low regard” but “carve out acceptable space for iniduals like Obama who strike them as different”.And insofar as Obama’s eight years in power fueled a renewed sense of purpose and organization among white nationalists, and triggered what the CNN pundit Van Jones famously described as a “whitelash”, some, including Obama himself, have wondered if his presidency actually set the project of racial equality back – at least temporarily. “Maybe we pushed too far,” Obama worried aloud to an aide shortly after the election, according to a forthcoming book. “Maybe people just want to fall back into their tribe.”That racial tribalism is part of what propelled Trump’s victory, despite the fact that he would go on to repeatedly describe himself as the “least racist person”. Trump’s popularity with unabashed white supremacists stems from things like his frequent ill-informed tweets and comments about inner city violence, and his reported use of the the phrase “shithole counties” in speaking about immigrants from black and brown nations.After the Starbucks incident, numerous other examples quickly emerged via news reports and social media. In New Jersey, two black men had police called on them by staff at a gym after being falsely accused of working out without proper memberships. Police in California swarmed three black women leaving an Airbnb when a neighbor concluded they were in the midst of a robbery. A woman in Oakland called the police on black residents for barbecuing in a park, and, at Yale University, a white woman called police on a black fellow student for falling asleep in a dorm common area.The presence of police is not the defining factor for everyday racism, or what some call “microaggressions”, but it is one of the harshest escalations. For Phillip Atiba Goff, a leading researcher on racial bias in policing and the president of the Center for Policing Equity, part of this has to do with the fact that black people and white people often share space in places like a university campus or a rapidly gentrifying city such as Oakland, California, but don’t always share bonds. “When you have people living close to each other who are not in community with each other, that breeds fear,” Goff said.He worries about what it means that in cases where officers functionally become “deputized as a kind of personal racism valet” – armed respondents to unfounded suspicions by white Americans. But from the perspective of law enforcement it’s a hard circle to square.“You can’t very well instruct your 911 operators to be like ‘yeah Mrs Smith, I know you said there were gangbangers but we know you’re probably just racist,” Goff said. Police have to respond, and are trained to treat every scenario as though it could become dangerous. “So they’re going to show up, and they’re generally going to be aggressive,” Goff added. “And by the time they figure out that you are not the issue, your dignity has been so assaulted that it really is difficult to have a pleasant conversation. For the cops and for the resident.”Thus, more than anything, what needs to be challenged to make real progress on everyday racism is racial bias, whether conscious or unconscious. “The only way we actually win, is to change the social norms,” Goff said.And for Kendi, like many race scholars, an important part of that is paying closer attention to social, economic and political policies that have a biased impact, rather than case by case negative exchanges iniduals have with one another. “Policies are the cradle of the racist ideas circulating in people’s minds that are leading to those interpersonal situations that are negatively affecting people,” Kendi said.“If people are really serious about being able to live freely and black in the United States, then the way really to do that is to be a part of the movement against racist policies.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/09812bcacb6cb5c0502a6cea36a40b99cace44f5/0_169_4200_2521/master/4200.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=53481d7d953817363830406c0e81532c","title":"all eyes on canada as first g7 nation prepares to make marijuana legal","story":"From crime to health to business, Canada’s decision to legalize marijuana is a grand progressive experiment that promises to answer a host of questionsWhen Canopy Growth opened its first cannabis factory in an old chocolate plant near Ottawa four years ago, it did so predicting a bright future. Canada had already legalized medical marijuana, and Canopy predicted full legalization for recreational use to be next.What the company hadn’t predicted, however, was the sudden flood of foreign visitors. Politicians and police authorities from Jamaica, Germany, Denmark, the Netherlands, Greece and Australia have all come knocking, as well as doctors from New Zealand, Brazil and Chile, along with groups of corporate investors and bankers – so many that Canopy now sometimes splits up the groups according to their birthdays.“We knew we’d have to give a lot of tours, so we just cut a window into the wall,” said the company spokesman, Jordan Sinclair. “We put windows in all of the doors.” Canada will be thrust even more directly under the international microscope on Thursday, when a vote in the Senate is expected to ratify Bill C-45, effectively making Canada the first G20 nation to legalize recreational marijuana.“It’s going to be a bit of a science fiction experience for a while,” said Benedikt Fischer, an expert on substance use at Toronto’s biggest psychiatric hospital. “It’s unique in the world, because it’s happening for the first time in a wealthy country. It’s not like in the US, where there are these state experiments. Most people kind of ignore Uruguay. And so the world is really looking at this.”Governments, researchers and business leaders around the world all have their own reasons for keeping tabs. Legalization could affect Canada’s crime patterns, health and countless other factors – but exactly how, no one yet knows. Each Canadian province plans to roll out its newly legalized market in a slightly different way, creating about a dozen mini-laboratories within one massive test case.Even places that have already taken the legalization plunge are hoping Canada will solve some mysteries. After Colorado legalized marijuana five years ago, for example, organized crime reacted by ramping up supplies of “black tar heroin, opiates and harder drugs”, said Dr Larry Wolk, the state’s top public health official.But Wolk says he is interested to watch that process unfold on a bigger scale in Canada, where the new law is expected to deal a much more significant blow to the black market. Any new mix of illicit drugs in the country could have new effects on public health.One delicate balance for Canadian authorities has been guessing at what kind of pricing will be low enough to eradicate illicit sales – yet not so low as to entice new users. Canada’s finance minister, Bill Morneau, recently said the goal is “keeping cannabis out of the hands of kids and out of the black market. That means keeping the taxes low so we can actually get rid of the criminals in the system”.One sign of success will be if Canada not only discourages underground sales, but converts illicit sellers to the new system, said Tim Boekhout van Solinge, a Dutch criminologist.“What I am mainly following … is who will be the new legal growers, and whether authorities manage to get some of the illegal growers to become legal growers,” he said.Each country around the world that has debated whether to relax cannabis laws has had its own priority in mind: from generating revenue to discouraging drug cartels. In Canada, the emphasis has been largely on public health. Cannabis will be sold in fairly plain packaging, and usually through government-run boards that already control liquor sales.“It won’t be like buying Budweiser or branded alcoholic products,” said Steve Rolles of Transform, a UK drug policy thinktank. “It’s going to be more like buying pharmaceuticals from a chemist.”Still, it’s hard to know whether Canada, or any similar western country, will be able to stick to that public-health focus, he said.“We have concerns … that the lessons from alcohol and tobacco wouldn’t be learned, and we might see overcommercialized markets in which profit-making entities would seek to encourage more use and could encourage risky consumption behaviours,” he said.So far, Canada has allowed a few major players to dominate the industry, and their influence remains to be seen, said US marijuana industry expert Mark Kleiman.“You don’t want to build up big vested interests that then resist any change,” he said. “If you have commercial industry in cannabis, they’re going to end up writing the laws.”For epidemiologists, Canada will provide the best-ever data sets on cannabis use.Colorado’s health results have been encouraging, said Wolk. But overall, researchers lack solid data about cannabis use. Some key questions include addiction levels, how cannabis affects mental health, and effects on young people, said Israeli scientist Raphael Mechoulam, often called the “grandfather” of cannabis research.Another current Canadian health debate is how many people will be light, casual cannabis users, and how many will be heavy users.The government still must decide how to approach products that are “very potent” in THC, the psychoactive compound in cannabis, said Mark Ware, a drug researcher and pain specialist who helped lead Canada’s federal taskforce advising the new legislation. Black-market sellers have produced increasingly strong concentrates, he said.“Those have not been the subject of studies up until recently, so the question of whether to regulate those, allow them in whatever context, and then be able to study their impacts on health, that would be very important,” he said. But “once they’re out there, it’s very hard to put them back in the box again”.Canadian police, meanwhile, will grapple with how to crack down on cannabis-impaired driving. That’s already a struggle around the world, regardless of marijuana’s legality, said Rolles. But it’s much more difficult to measure impairment from cannabis than from alcohol, and enforcing a legal limit will prove tricky.Meanwhile, many investors have already made huge profits from cannabis stocks, and a big question for them is whether the bubble bursts – or the value keeps rising.“They’re waiting to see if the sky’s going to fall,” said Sinclair of Canopy. One of about 100 Canadian legal producers of medical cannabis, the company owns a third of the medical market, began trading on the Toronto stock exchange in 2016 and last month became the only cannabis producer on the New York stock exchange."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/426d3741f71e77ebb155decb65dc170ca0fdb616/0_95_2836_1702/master/2836.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a2312eb0ca54ab3c6ee86ce8cf8c1648","title":"andres babis reappointed czech pm push end impasse","story":"President appears to use threat of far-right to attempt to force Social Democrats into dealAndrej Babiš, Czech Republic’s scandal-plagued acting prime minister, has been reappointed in an attempt to end months of political deadlock by strong-arming reluctant opposition MPs into forming a government with him.Babiš was officially rinstalled in a ceremony at Prague castle presided over by Miloš Zeman, the populist Czech president, who appeared to be attempting to use the possibility of a coalition with a far-right grouping to force the Social Democrat party (ČSSD) into agreeing a deal.Babiš’s appointment, for the second time in six months, came a day after large crowds of demonstrators gathered in Prague and other Czech cities to protest against the prospect of a government led by him.A billionaire businessman and Czech Republic’s ssecond-richest man, Babiš has been unable to form a stable administration since his Action of Dissatisfied Citizens party (ANO) won last October’s parliamentary election because mainstream parties have been unwilling to serve under him on grounds that he faces criminal fraud allegations.Despite reservations, the Social Democrats last month agreed to enter a coalition on condition that Babiš resign as prime minister if convicted of the charges, which relate to a €2m (£1.75m) EU subsidy. He denies any wrongdoing. Last year he referred to the allegations as a “pseudo-case” and as a political plot against him.The agreement is subject to approval in an internal members’ ballot, with the result due on 15 June. If confirmed, it would produce a minority coalition dependent on parliamentary support from the Communist party (KSCM), enabling it to wield political power for the first time since the 1989 Velvet Revolution that ended its 41-year rule over what was then Czechoslovakia.By pre-empting the outcome of the Social Democrats’ poll, Zeman, who was narrowly re-elected in a bitterly fought presidential contest in January, appeared to be trying to intimidate members to stop them rejecting the coalition deal.“He is trying to tell them that Babiš will be prime minister no matter what and if you don’t approve the coalition with him, he will have to enter one with the far-right and the communists,” said Jiří Pehe, a Czech political analyst who is director of New York University’s campus in Prague.Zeman, who has gained a reputation for fierce anti-Muslim rhetoric, has openly touted a government consisting of ANO, the Communists and the anti-immigration Freedom and Direct Democracy party (SPD), led by Tomio Okamura. Last year Okamura hosted a conference of far-right leaders attended by Marine Le Pen, leader of the French Front National, and Geert Wilders, leader of the Dutch Freedom party.The Slovak-born Babiš has so far baulked at striking such a deal, fearing it would damage his standing in the EU."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9c1edcedaff3fa091742ba827a7a98b7627869e6/1340_471_3744_2246/master/3744.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=560ec350a92e1c25dff2e52be92c68ea","title":"angela merkel first question time lacks histrionics uk pmqs","story":"German leader handles opposition questions with ease in first Bundestag Q\u0026ampA session It may have lacked the histrionics and bear-pit ambience of Westminster’s prime minister’s questions, but Angela Merkel’s first question and answer session with MPs was nothing if not groundbreaking.Taking its steer from the weekly sessions in the UK parliament, the hour-long session on Wednesday marked the first time a German chancellor had been required to interact directly with opposition MPs.Under the new format, which was agreed to by the coalition government that assumed power in March, questions and answers were limited to a maximum time of one minute each. A three-colour system – green for go, yellow for 30 seconds left, and red for stop – helped steer the proceedings under the watchful eye of the Bundestag’s speaker, Wolfgang Schäuble.Journalists and other spectators who filled the visitor gallery looked on with glee, hoping that the new addition would make for a spectacle a good deal livelier than the average Bundestag assembly. Standing for the full 60 minutes, Merkel delivered her answers with ease no doubt there would have been more squirming had follow-up questions been allowed.“What a shame it’s now over,” she smirked after Schäuble called time. “But I’ll be back.” She has four months to prepare for the next Kanzler Fragestunde – or chancellor’s question time – which is scheduled to be held three times a year.The first 20 minutes of the first session were focused on the G7 summit being held in Quebec this week, which Merkel admitted would be difficult owing to burgeoning strains between the US and other members over steel and aluminium tariffs, the Iran nuclear deal and the Paris climate accord.She rejected the suggestion, made by a member of the far-right Alternative für Deutschland party, that Russia should be invited back into the G7 fold having been banished after its annexation of Crimea from Ukraine. Merkel also dismissed calls by the same party for her resignation over her refugee policy, which saw almost 1 million refugees enter Germany in 2015, saying that the country had “acted very responsibly in an exceptional situation”.A look at the main priorities set out in in the German coalition agreement, which will guide policy-making for the next four years.Efforts to reform the EU will top the incoming government\u0027s agenda as the bloc grapples with rising nationalism, security concerns and an unpredictable US ally in Donald Trump.As well as agreeing to bolster EU foreign and defence policy, the parties say they are ready to raise Germany\u0027s contributions to the EU\u0027s budget once Britain leaves. They also support the creation of a European Monetary Fund, but offer only cautious backing for Emmanuel Macron\u0027s idea of a eurozone investment budget.Smarting from the backlash over Merkel\u0027s decision to open the country\u0027s doors to hundreds of thousands of asylum seekers in 2015, the government now aims to cap the annual intake of people seeking safe haven to about 200,000.At the EU level,\u0026nbspMerkel\u0026nbspsays she continues to expect member states to take in their allocated share of refugees. The chancellor has also reiterated the need to tackle the root causes of migration with development aid for the countries of origin, while better securing the bloc\u0027s outer borders.Europe\u0027s powerhouse economy is booming, with workers enjoying high wages and record-low unemployment, but that has done little to assuage concerns about globalisation and automation in the workplace, as well as growing inequality.With its flush public coffers,\u0026nbspMerkel\u0027s government aims to address these fears through investments in infrastructure, an offensive to improve the nation\u0027s creaking internet networks, pension reform and more funding for education and life-long learning.The jokes were few and far between. A far-left Die Linke politician quipped that Donald Trump revealed more to Playboy than he did to his allies, and Merkel teased the Social Democrats that they were not in a position to criticise policies they had supported in opposition. All in all it lacked genuine confrontation or drama.The furniture of the Bundestag does not lend itself to such behaviour. The room is airy and spacious, without the cramped intimacy of the House of Commons, which forces eye contact and encourages the cut and thrust between political opponents. Merkel chose not to go to the central lectern, standing shyly in front of her seat.Other topics ranged from diesel emissions and rent hikes, to the number of women in parliament and child poverty – offering a broad overview of what concerns the average German. Meanwhile over in London, as one German commentator observed, PMQs was fixated on one topic: Brexit."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/febe99d44574a88adfe6d7f4b44c8455dfdc426c/0_106_5248_3149/master/5248.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=634c46d8d25a511a486f669e765bbbc3","title":"new spanish pm appoints astronaut pedro duque science minister","story":"Pedro Sánchez appoints Pedro Duque, though most cabinet roles have gone to womenSpain’s new prime minister has appointed an astronaut as his science minister in a cabinet dominated by women.Pedro Sánchez announced on Wednesday that Pedro Duque, a 55-year-old veteran of two space missions, would serve as minister for science, innovation and universities in his new administration.Duque, who left Earth in 1998 and again in 2003, responded to his appointment on Twitter, saying he wished his mother was still alive to see it. Beneath it, he posted a cartoon of a woman seeing her son off to work and telling him: “Remember, son, important jobs are the devil’s playground.”It was also announced that Dolores Delgado, a prosecutor specialising in human rights and terrorism cases, would become justice minister.Carmen Calvo, a former culture minister, will serve as deputy prime minister and equalities minister, while Nadia Calviño – currently budget director-general at the European commission – will be economy minister.Barcelona-born Meritxell Batet will be tasked with handling the Catalan independence crisis in her new role as territorial minister, while the former European parliament president Josep Borrell will be the new foreign minister.Borrell, who was born in Catalonia and was a minister in the PSOE government of Felipe González, has been an outspoken critic of Catalan independence.By lunchtime on Wednesday, Sánchez had appointed nine women and three men to his cabinet.

Photograph: Alan BetsonYoung writers featured on what one teacher described as a “radical” English paper as 55,570 students sat the first of the Leaving Cert examinations this morning.Jim Lusby, an English teacher at the Institute of Education, welcomed how this year’s paper one had established a link with English paper two, showing that “there is no ision between language and literature”.The paper featured an extract from Irish novelist Colum McCann, another from the young English writer and Booker Prize shortlister Fiona Mozley and an illustrated poem by Isaac Rosenberg, who was killed aged 27 on the Western Front during World War One.Anne Gormley, head of English at Laurel Hill Coláiste in Limerick, said this year’s English paper showed that efforts were being made to align the junior and senior cycle syllabuses.“The students were challenged to think more for themselves and to think a bit outside the box.”Students were asked to critique the educational system and analyse its strengths and weaknesses, while another question required them to present a poem in visual format. However, she said, asking them to evaluate a film adaptation of a text and compare it with a written version, as well as assessing the advantages and disadvantages of each of these formats within a 30-40 minute timeframe, was intimidating.Studyclix.ie teacher Lorraine Tuffy, who works at Jesus \u0026amp Mary Secondary School in Sligo, said the paper required students to draw from their engagement with studied texts, which was normally reserved for paper two.“The composition options were broad and varied. Question seven, encouraging students to consider the weight of words, is a particularly relevant task. Essay questions were, for the most part, engaging, with student asked to reflect on the value of personal space and quietness in the modern world, leaders and leadership, and language as a weapon.”She said overall students were happy with the paper.Just over 40,000 students sat this year’s higher level paper, while 13,810 took the ordinary level paper.Kate Barry, ASTI subject representative and a teacher at Loreto Fermoy, said there were no major surprises on the ordinary level paper, with a good range of topics and nothing too difficult.“There was a nice question on the impact of technology and another asking them to write about what they achieved in life so far, and what they hope to achieve, and it could not have been more inviting.”However, she said that a question asking candidates to write a diary entry where they represented their school ignored the reality that not all Leaving Cert students were in school and that some of them were in further education or could even be sitting the exam in prison.

Photograph: Dara Mac DónaillThe Students who paid attention to past exam papers will have been richly rewarded by this year’s home economics papers, according to teachers. Several topics which had not appeared in a few years showed up at higher level, much to the delight of students. These included lipids (fats), energy labelling and food additives.Margaret Kinsella, ASTI subject representative and a teacher at Bunclody Vocational College, Co Wexford, said the short questions on the higher level paper were all very approachable and encompassed all areas of the course, including microbiology, nutrition, textiles and budgeting. Sandra Cleary, a home economics teacher at the Institute of Education in Dublin, said this year’s questions were very factual and did not require much opinion from the students. “The short questions had a broad selection and none of them were too difficult. A question on children’s rights and conflict between adults and adolescents was nice and straightforward,” she said.“The topical issues of homelessness and rent in the private sector appeared in elective one, and students who are up-to-date on current affairs would have been at an advantage.”Ms Kinsella said the ordinary level paper, which asked students for three pieces of information per question instead of the usual two, may have posed a challenge for some students.A question on the rising number of women in the workplace may have been daunting. Otherwise, she said, the questions were very doable.(a) Identify and explain the rights of children in society today. (b) Discuss the possible causes of conflict between adolescents and adults.Suggest strategies for resolving this conflict.

Photograph: Aidan CrawleyThe shadows cast on Irish boxing by the Regency Hotel gangland shooting more than two years ago have never faded. In the wake of Tuesday’s shooting, those shadows are now even longer.David Byrne was shot dead in the foyer of the Dublin northside hotel on February 5th, 2016. Patrick Hutch (25) subsequently pleaded not guilty to his murder.The boxing event was hosted by MTK, the Marbella-based boxing outfit co-founded six years ago by Daniel Kinahan, a leading member of the Kinahan crime gang.Last January, two people were shot and injured outside the National Stadium on Dublin’s South Circular Road, where an under-age amateur boxing event was being staged.One, a man in his 40s was known to gardaí. The second, a student in his 20s and not linked to crime in any way, was caught in the crossfire. The intended target fled down the South Circular Road towards Griffith College. A boxing event, featuring five of MTK’s boxers, listed for the Citywest Hotel just a few days afterwards was cancelled when the hotel pulled out on security grounds.Shortly after Citywest’s decision to cancel, MTK Global said it was quitting Ireland because the Irish media had repeatedly slandered and vilified it and its stable of professional boxers. In a statement, Sandra Vaughan, the chief executive and sole shareholder of MTK Global, distanced herself and MTK from Kinahan, saying all ties with him had been cut since February 2017 after a management buy-in.“This witch hunt by Irish media has left me with no choice but for MTK Global to pull out of the Republic of Ireland for the immediate future. We will not host fight nights in Dublin nor will any MTK Global athletes fight on a Dublin card.” In July 2017, it was reported that several MTK boxers were training at Bray Boxing Club, the club run by Pete Taylor, the father of Olympic boxing champion Katie Taylor. However, his daughter, who has since gone on to win International Boxing Federation and World Boxing Association titles, no longer trains there. She spends most of her time based in the USA, near Hartford, Connecticut. The three MTK boxers were heavyweight Sean Turner, a new professional Gary Cully and Irish amateur champion David Oliver Joyce, who competed on the same boxing team as Katie in the Rio Olympics in 2016. Speaking at the time, Pete Taylor explained he was coaching the three boxers for no payment, partly because he knew Joyce from amateur boxing. “It’s my club. I own it. “I can train who I want. It’s all boxing,” he told a Sunday newspaper. There is no suggestion that Pete Taylor or any of the boxers he coached in Bray were connected with crime.Last month, Katie Taylor’s manager, Brian Peters, during a press conference in Meath, was asked if the popular 31-year-old Olympic champion could look forward to a home town fight.He would say no more, though he was questioned on whether it was off the agenda because of concerns about security at boxing events because of Daniel Kinahan’s known interest in boxing.“I’m not sure,” he replied. “If you want to run a show, there are sanctioning bodies, the gardaí . . . there are a whole load of boxes you have to tick to put on a show.”"},{"url":null,"title":"magdalene woman we were slaves to the nuns and the church but no more","story":"  June 5, 2018First time for many to speak freely to other women incarcerated in the laundries   June 5, 2018When I first met her she doubted justice would ever come her way-not from the Good Shepherd Sisters and not from the Irish State   June 5, 2018President apologises at \u0026Aacuteras reception to women who worked in laundries   June 5, 2018Banquet held in Dublin\u0026rsquos Mansion House for some 230 people incarcerated in laundries "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3521688.1528313176!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"cabinet appoints four extra judges after pleas from judiciary","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tCriminal lawyer Tara Burns, currently counsel to the former Garda press officer Dave Taylor at the Disclosures Tribunal, has been nominated for appointment to the High Court.

Leading criminal lawyer Tara Burns has been nominated for appointment to the High Court. She is currently counsel to the former Garda press officer Dave Taylor at the Disclosures Tribunal.The appointments come after an unprecedented plea by the new President of the Court of Appeal, Mr Justice George Birmingham, for more judges to be appointed.Mr Justice Birmingham made his comments last week, on only his second day in his post, after he was forced to postpone a number of appeals due to be heard this week due to a shortage of judges.Minister for Justice Charlie Flanagan is believed to have told his colleagues that the appointments were “essential” for the administration of justice. It is understood that more appointments to the High Court are likely in the near future.Minister for Transport Shane Ross, who has blocked the appointment of judges temporarily in the past because he is pressing for changes in the way judges are appointed, assented to the decision today.Mr Ross did not respond to the request for comment through his spokesperson.However, tensions continue in Government over the vexed issue of judicial appointments, and it is understood there was a series of exchanges between Mr Ross and the Mr Flanagan in recent days.Legislation demanded by Mr Ross which will reform the way judges are appointed is winding its way slowly through the Oireachtas but Mr Ross has privately expressed deep frustration with the pace of the process, and has voiced concern that he is being “strung along” by Fine Gael, according to Government insiders.Mr Ross has repeatedly threatened to block judicial appointments until the new legislation is passed and operational and has on a number of occasions caused nominations to be delayed by weeks. However, three things have diminished Mr Ross’s sway - the pressing need for more judges in some courts, without which court business has been seriously affected the lack of support for Mr Ross among his Independent Alliance colleagues, who have made it clear to him and to the rest of their Government colleagues that while they support Mr Ross, they are not prepared to make it an issue which threatens the future of the Government and the advent as Minister of Charlie Flanagan, who is of a less patient nature than his predecessor Frances Fitzgerald. Mr Flanagan has made it clear that if the courts need judges, he sees it as his responsibility to bring nominations to Government.Recent weeks have seen progress on the Judicial Appointments Bill, which finally passed through the Dáil last week, and will now make its way to the SeanadThe bill will set up an independent body to vet candidates and propose their appointment to the Government. However, the Government lost votes on a number of amendments to the Bill, and it is now expected to seek amendments overturning these in the Seanad. When that happens, it will have to return to the Dáil for final approval. One TD closely involved in the process said there was little prospect of the Bill passing through the Oireachtas by the summer, as Mr Ross had previously insisted.Mr Ross has been persistently critical of the system of judicial appointments in the past, saying that politicians have appointed their “cronies” to the bench, amongst other charges. He wants to limit political influence on judicial appointments, and also wants to limit judicial influence in the process. -the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":null,"title":"miriam lord it took 35 years to build this stunning result","story":"Thirty-five years after it was placed into the Constitution, the electorate voted for the Eighth Amendment to be repealed and for provision be made for the regulation of termination of pregnancy.

It was a wonderful day for Irish women.A day made even better in the happy knowledge that the vast majority of Irish men are looking out for them and want only the best for them. By voting in their droves to repeal, they placed the concerns of women far above the fears of ideologically-motivated crusaders who prize saving souls above having a heart.With repeal looking the likely outcome, there were calls from some quarters for a muted and dignified response. Perhaps it was the reason why there was neither screen nor public address system for the huge crowd at the castle.But no. For all the decades of all the women who suffered, and for all the women who fought and agitated for change, we had to celebrate this historic turning-point in modern Irish society.Some never thought they would live to see the day. Some, like Monica Barnes and Mary Holland and Nuala Fennell and many more, didn’t. The celebration was for them too.It was for Ailbhe Smyth, who never stopped fighting. It was for senator Ivana Bacik, Catherine Murphy, Joan Burton, Catherine McGuinness and many more who were there from the start.Political rivalries were cast aside for the day. “Oh, c’mere to me,” said socialist Bríd Smith, giving Fianna Fáil’s Timmy Dooley a hug.Obstetrician Peter Boylan, looking very cool in his shades turned up and it was like George Clooney had just rambled in, such was the clamour which greeted his entrance. The three co-directors of Together4Yes – Ailbhe Smyth, Orla O’Connor and Gráinne Griffin – arrived to rapturous welcome.Senators Lynne Ruane and Alice Mary Higgins were in floods. Ruth Coppinger was hugging for Ireland. Katherine Zappone, who demanded the referendum as her price for supporting the Government, was ecstatic.“Oh God, I told my husband I’d give up the fags if there was a repeal,” said Fine Gael’s Kate O’Connell, one of the party’s most active campaigners, as she ran out for a smoke.Brendan Howlin arrived in just after Mary Lou McDonald’s big entrance. The Labour party was fighting the cause when all the others didn’t want to know. “We never get the credit,” said Howlin, shrugging. “We carry the flag, but then in comes the fresh faced Leo to take all the glory.”Maybe not. Health Minister Simon Harris pretended to be embarrassed by the “I fancy Simon Harris” poster, but he was secretly thrilled. Wherever he went he was mobbed. No wonder Leo stuck close by him.Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin maintained a low-key presence, but his early intervention and support for repeal and the proposed legislation was a pivotal point in the campaign.It was a courageous move which now sees him on the right side of history and one half of his parliamentary party stranded on the other.As Micheál walked through the crowd, tearful young women hugged him. A man and woman approached. “We’re one of those couples who had a fatal foetal abnormality,” the women said to him. “Thank you. Just, thank you,” she sobbed.Meanwhile, back in the RDS, the Attorney General was chatting to former Supreme Court Judge Catherine McGuinness.She had had eye surgery the day before but the doctor gave her a special dispensation to attend the count. “Theoretically I should have a patch over my eye today.”At Dublin Castle, Frank Crummy (81), who set up Ireland’s first family planning clinic, was resplendent in his repeal jumper, alongside his wife Evelyn.There was a lot of discussion about why so many politicians and pundits called the campaign so wrong. The Together4Yes team remains amused by the old school, outmoded metric used by some of them to evaluate their very effective efforts. It was as if they were affronted at the idea that people outside the Kildare Street bubble might actually know more than they do about what the electorate really wants these days.Independent TD Clare Daly, a politician hugely deserving of credit for the part she played, decided to stay away from the castle bunfight. Instead, a number of Johnny Come Lately politicians with a weakness for self-publicity preened and waved from the platform.It’s always the same.A third of the electorate voted No. “I feel like I’ve lost my country,” a woman told us amid the celebrations in the RDS. She was very sad. She couldn’t be consoled.Cheers and tears and champagne greeted the announcement. The sky fell in briefly when a few drops of rain fell. Everyone danced.Because it was a monumental day. The day when the intelligent, compassionate citizens of Ireland turned to the Catholic Church and the retreating fundamentalists and firmly said: “Thanks, but no thanks.

File photograph: Eric LukeThe mapping of DNA from some of the settlers who colonised Iceland more than 1,000 years ago offers an insight into the fate of thousands of slaves – mostly women – who were taken by Norse Vikings from Ireland and Scotland before they put down roots on the North Atlantic island.Anthropologist Sunna Ebenesersdóttir, of the University of Iceland and the company deCODE Genetics in Reykjavik, analysed the genomes of 25 ancient Icelanders whose skeletal remains were found in burial sites across the island. Sequencing using samples from teeth revealed the settlers had a roughly even split of Norse (from what are today Norway and Sweden) and Gaelic ancestry. It is the first in-depth investigation of how a new population is formed through a genetic process known as “admixture”.When the researchers compared the ancient genomes to those of modern people in Iceland and other European countries, they found contemporary Icelanders, on average, draw about 70 per cent of their genes from Norse ancestry. This suggests that in the 1,100 years between settlement and today, the population underwent a surprisingly quick genetic shift in favour of Norse genes, the researchers report in the journal Science.They confirm that while the ancient settlers, “mainly Norse men and Gaelic women”, are genetically indistinguishable from present-day Irish, Scots and Scandinavians, present-day Icelanders have over the course of 1,000 years, and numerous population bottlenecks, become a distinct new population. “Repeated famines and epidemics led to a substantial loss of sequence ersity from the Icelandic gene pool, causing it to drift away from its source populations in Scandinavia and the British-Irish Isles,” explained Kári Stefánsson, deCODE chief executive and co-author on the paper. Another possibility, he suggested, is that ancient Icelanders with more Norse ancestry held a slight edge in reproductive success over those with Gaelic ancestry, many of whom were enslaved when they came to the island.The Celts were often buried in unmarked graves though, intriguingly, a minority were buried in the traditional Viking way, with their sword and boat.On the study, he added: “This is a fascinating example of how a population is shaped by its environment, in this case the harsh and marginal conditions of medieval Iceland. “It is also another demonstration of how our small but well characterised population can continue to make important contributions to understanding the fundamental genetic and evolutionary processes that shape our species.”Their next step is to expand sample size, and to examine how diseases affected the population.

Photograph: Leon NealPool via Reuters The British government is expected to publish a proposal on Thursday for the backstop to avoid a hard border amid cabinet isions over whether it should have a time limit. Brexit secretary David Davis said the proposal still had to be signed off by a cabinet subcommittee before it could be presented to EU negotiators in Brussels.“The detail of this is being discussed at the moment. It has been through one cabinet committee, it is going to another one, and it would be improper of me to pre-empt the negotiation there. But I suspect it will be fairly decisive,” he said.Mr Davis said the backstop, which would keep Northern Ireland aligned with the EU customs union and parts of the single market after Brexit, would be time-limited.“I think the prime minister has already made public the fact that we expect to put a time limit on the backstop proposal,” he said.Earlier, a Downing Street spokesman said that the backstop was necessary to fulfil the commitments the British government made to avoid a hard border in Ireland, although all sides hoped another solution would be found.“It’s important that that is time-limited, even outside of the fact that we don’t expect or want it to happen,” the spokesman said.Before the last EU summit in March, Britain and the EU agreed that the backstop should remain in place “unless and until” another solution to keep the Border open is found and Downing Street said on Wednesday that it did not “resile” from any commitments it had made.The EU has told Britain that talks on their future trade and security relationship cannot proceed unless there is “sufficient progress” on a legally binding withdrawal agreement, which includes the Border backstop, when EU leaders meet at the end of this month. Mr Davis said on Wednesday, however, that the issue of Northern Ireland was unlikely to hold up progress.“We’re not expecting the Northern Ireland elements of this arrangement until October so I wouldn’t expect any time issue to stop progress between June and October,” he said.Fine Gael Senator and spokesman on EU affairs Neale Richmond on Wednesday night described this month’s summit as “a vital staging point in the Brexit negotiations” ahead of a meeting in October, when the negotiations are expected to be concluded.“Given the ever-looming conclusion of the Brexit negotiations, it is maddening that the British government has yet to present any detailed proposals to bring about a legal interpretation of December’s binding, political agreement,” he told a conference in London organised by the centre-right Wilfred Martens Centre. “At this stage, I say enough of the Brexit kite-flying it is time for real proposals.“The speeches given by the prime minister up to this point have been warm and made all the right noises, but they have not addressed the key issues in any sort of detail and they have not used the necessary technical language it’s been all rhetoric.”\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3521681.1528312484!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"democrats avoid setback in california primary vote","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tGavin Newsom, the Democratic former mayor of San Francisco, emerged as the leading contender for the race as the state’s governor.  Photograph: David Paul MorrisBloombergDemocratic candidates are expected to be on the ballot in all but one California congressional district at the midterm US elections in November, after a night of primaries that was neither the “blue wave” that some in the party had hoped for, nor a complete shutout as others had feared.The battle in California is crucial to the Democrats’ ambitions to win back control of the House in the midterm elections because of the party’s targeting of at least half a dozen Republican districts that voted for Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential race.The Golden State was one of eight that voted for candidates on Tuesday for the House of Representatives, the US Senate and governorships.But under the state’s unusual voting system, the top-two vote winners in this week’s all-party primaries go through to the November vote, regardless of their parties.Because a large number of Democratic candidates ran in some of the state’s congressional seats, the party has been concerned it would fail to qualify for the run-off in those districts as its vote was splintered. That would leave the Republican Party with House seats it could otherwise have lost.Democratic party committees have scrambled in recent weeks to thin out the number of candidates running in some Californian districts. With the votes still being counted on Wednesday, Democratic candidates appeared to be in first or second place in 52 or 53 districts, although the final vote count could take days to be verified.In the state’s eighth congressional district, a Democratic candidate was in third place, trailing the Republican runner up by fewer than 1,000 votes.Meanwhile, Gavin Newsom, the Democratic former mayor of San Francisco, emerged as the leading contender for the race as the state’s governor.Mr Newsom is the favourite to replace Jerry Brown as California’s governor because of the state’s centre-left leanings, but his Republican rival John Cox performed strongly as well.“We’re engaged in an epic battle, and it looks like voters will have a real choice this November – between a governor who is going to stand up against Donald Trump and a foot soldier in his war on California,” Mr Newsom told supporters at a victory party on Tuesday night.The president has found himself at loggerheads with California’s leadership over federal policies on everything from immigration to environmental standards.Also in California, Senator Dianne Feinstein fended off a primary challenge from the left by a Democratic opponent, Kevin de León. Mr de León came in second place and will face off against Ms Feinstein in November in a Democrat-on-Democrat race.In New Jersey, Democratic senator Bob Menendez narrowly defeated his own primary challenge from a little-known publisher – a sign of how a 2017 corruption trial dogged his candidacy despite the jury in the case being deadlocked.First-time Democratic female candidates continued their winning streak in the primaries. In New Jersey, Mikie Sherrill, a female navy pilot, won her Democratic primary in the race to replace retiring Republican incumbent Rodney Frelinghuysen. In November, she will face Republican state assemblyman Jay Webber.President Trump, meanwhile, trumpeted the latest votes as a victory for his party and the White House’s agenda. “Great night for Republicans!” he tweeted on Wednesday. “Congratulations to John Cox on a really big number in California. He can win . . . So much for the big Blue Wave, it may be a big Red Wave.

We have a role to help the public understand how innovation is used to deliver the products that they pick up on the shelves.”The ADHB was established in 2008 to support the meat and livestock horticulture, milk and potato industry in Great Britain as well as cereals and oilseeds in the UK.Please review our commenting policyEdinburgh Festival Fringe encourages a \u0026#39leap into the unknown\u0026#39Ruth Davidson calls for victims to be able to attend parole hearingsSearch for El Fuego eruption survivors focuses on mountain hamletsFrench punk rocker gets suspended sentence after 30 years on the run after €2m bank heistMelania Trump makes first public appearance as her husband says she has \u0026#39had a little rough patch\u0026#39Comment: An Irish backstop and a customs union will never be the Brexit that people voted forUK \u0026#39deeply concerned\u0026#39 by brief abduction of British Pakistani journalist and establishment criticTreasure hunters seek to make a fortune after meteorites hit ChinaIs Britain off the hook?

No-one was injured in the robbery. In jeans and a grey shirt, Bertin told the Toulouse court that the heist had taken two years to prepare in order to avoid violence. Despite their anarchist ways, the court was told that the band carried out a “quasi-military” operation to such an extent that police first through they were dealing with hardened gangsters.However, the group then gave the game away somewhat by ringing the local newspaper to boast of their feat.All were caught within a year except one suspect, Gilles Bertin.The reproduction of a photo made on September 3, 1988 from a police mugshot shows Bertin while he was still on the runHardly any of the money was retrieved and some of the anarchist robbers died from AIDS-related symptoms. Others spent short spells in prison and returned to unglamorous jobs.But Bertin evaded capture, and spent almost 28 years on the run, living in Portugal and Barcelona, Spain, where he has a girlfriend and young son.He received a 10-year sentence in absentia in 2004.Then, in a coup de theatre two years ago, he decided to turn himself in.Before his trial, he told the BBC that his decision to come clean came after a near-death experience with hepatitis.After hospital staff in Barcelona saved him free of charge, no questions asked, he realised that he had contributed nothing to society.I realised I had to tell the truth and come clean about my past, he said.This is the final stage of a long ordeal that I have to go through…But I am really doing this for my seven-year-old son. He still doesn\u0027t really understand what I did during my nearly 30 years on the run - but he needs to know,” he said.Camera Silens performing before their bank heistBertin insisted there was nothing romantic about the robbery, or the life he led afterwards, which meant losing touch with another 31-year old son and his sister.In hiding, unable to talk about yourself or to people from your past, including my son, constantly on the look-out in case the authorities find you - and on top of that I was seriously ill.Looking back, he said: ”I made mistakes but I am not that same person now - at 57 I am more mature and have nothing to do with that period in my life.Hopefully I will be able to explain to my son the choices that I made back then.”In court, his lawyer, Christian Etelin, said he could have “calmly waited for his case to pass the status of limitations (in 2024)” given that there was “very little chance” that police would have seized him at the bar where he had been working for years with his partner and her family.“But to lie about his story had become unbearable for him. He came to forget his past to find a future.”However, the prosecuting judge called for five years, saying that he was “astonished to hear that the seriousness of the charges should be washed away by time or the redemption of the accused.”Please review our commenting policyEdinburgh Festival Fringe encourages a \u0026#39leap into the unknown\u0026#39Ruth Davidson calls for victims to be able to attend parole hearingsSearch for El Fuego eruption survivors focuses on mountain hamletsMelania Trump makes first public appearance as her husband says she has \u0026#39had a little rough patch\u0026#39Comment: An Irish backstop and a customs union will never be the Brexit that people voted forUK \u0026#39deeply concerned\u0026#39 by brief abduction of British Pakistani journalist and establishment criticTreasure hunters seek to make a fortune after meteorites hit ChinaIs Britain off the hook?

Log inIn a notice this week the European Commission has advised continental European businesses to think twice before using parts and components made in Britain.It’s reported that European firms\u0026nbspmight need to look elsewhere for parts if they wish to continue benefiting from EU free trade agreements with other countries such as South Korea and Mexico.But why is the commission issuing this advice? How serious are the economic implications for UK companies? And is there any way around it?It’s a direct consequence of Brexit.Leaving the EU automatically means that the UK becomes a “third country” to the bloc.When the EU did some\u0026nbsp40\u0026nbspfree trade deals with the likes of South Korea, Mexico and South Africa the agreements stipulated that any produce or manufactured good which passed between them tariff-free had to have genuinely originated in the two signatory countries or blocs.This stipulation was necessary to prevent other countries essentially free-riding on the deal. For instance, a firm in a third country could export their goods to one of the two parties to the free trade agreement and then re-export\u0026nbspgoods to the other party without paying the applicable tariffs.To prevent this happening the two countries in the deal impose “rules of origin” checks on imports. For the UK, while it’s in the EU, this is not a problem. Any UK goods pass through fine. Also, any UK components in EU goods are not a problem at all.But with the UK out of the EU’s customs union the situation is potentially very different. Rules of origin specify that a certain proportion of a good has to have been made in the country or bloc to qualify.\u0026nbspThe proportion varies with the good in question, but\u0026nbspit’s often around 50 per cent. For cars the requirement is 60 per cent.If, after Brexit, an EU business has used components sourced in the UK, that could potentially push the proportion of the exported EU good under the threshold, meaning it would fail the rule of origin requirement and be forced to pay the standard tariff.This is why the commission has issued its warning to EU firms to be wary about using UK manufactured goods if they don’t want to have a nasty surprise when they seek to export to third countries with which the EU has a trade deal.Potentially very serious, because the UK is firmly embedded in pan-European corporate supply chains. The UK sends around 44 per cent of its exports to the EU. Among the biggest categories of goods exported are chemicals, pharmaceuticals, aerospace and vehicles.And research by the Institute for Fiscal Studies found the share of the EU’s imports from the UK that were “intermediate” goods and services (ie components) was 69 per cent in 2014, up from 61 per cent in 2000.Not all of those imports will be baked into products and re-exported from the EU, but a fair amount will.Sam Lowe of the Centre for European Reform think tank says that sectors which traditionally find rules of origin burdensome include textiles, food, machinery and vehicles.To give one high profile example of a UK component of an EU export, the wings of the Airbus are currently manufactured in Broughton, North Wales. They are exported and the plane is assembled in Toulouse and then sold all around the world.The natural way to solve the rules of origin problem would seem to be for the UK to form a new customs union with the EU and to “grandfather”, or roll over, the EU’s existing free trade agreements so that they are applicable to the UK, as well as the EU, after Brexit.However, both are far more easily said than done. The UK cabinet is split on what sort of long-term customs arrangement it wants to push for with the EU – and both schemes they are considering have already been rejected by the EU.There is also no guarantee the third countries will simply agree to roll over their trade agreements with the EU for the UK – some may wish to take the opportunity to reopen them.And even if they did grandfather their trade deals, as Peter Holmes and Michael Gasiorek of the UK Trade Policy Observatory have pointed out, when it comes to solving the rules of origin problem the UK would, for various technical reasons, often require not just the agreement of the third country but also the EU as well.Given all these hurdles, it would hardly be surprising if EU firms currently using UK components became nervous about these multiple deals not, ultimately, materialising.The two-year transition deal due to kick in in March 2019 should, in theory, delay the day of reckoning because it is assumed the EU will ask countries with which it has a free trade deal to treat the UK as if it is effectively still an EU member. But it cannot be taken for granted\u0026nbspthat those countries will agree to do this, adding another layer of uncertainty for Continental firms.“Faced with this uncertainty EU firms may well start to source inputs from elsewhere because they don’t want to risk not getting originating status,” says Dr Gasiorek.“This matters most where the tariffs that the EU would face on its exports are high. For some industries where supply contracts may have a long duration, I would expect this to already be an issue.”However, Alan Winters of Sussex University\u0026nbspthinks more firms will delay drastic decisions. “My sense is that there will be some re-sourcing …but a lot of these supply chain are pretty complicated and it’s quite expensive to do so, so they may wait and see,” he says.Mr Lowe points out that the incentive for the European Union side to solve the Brexit rules of origin problem might be blunted due to the fact that if EU companies do start sourcing more in the rest of the EU that’s a potential spur to growth and jobs within the bloc.Of course, the same post-Brexit rules of origin problems work in the other direction and British firms are likely to feel pressure to replace some EU-sourced components with UK-sourced ones.The Society of Motor Manufacturers, for instance, has pointed out that only around 40 per cent of the average UK-made car is currently local content, potentially complicating any future trade deals the post-Brexit UK might seek to strike.You can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?The Independent and its partners use cookies and similar technology to collect and analyse information about the users of this website.

As Vince Cable, the Lib Dem leader, argues, Britain could have a second EU referendum before Christmas this year, giving time for a lengthy 12-week campaign starting next September.Nick Clegg puts a rather different argument. He says that Brexit should be put to a second referendum because people who voted Leave are dying off.\u0026nbspThe “high point” of support for Brexit had passed because “the oldest voters voted for Brexit in the largest numbers” while the young voted to remain in the EU.\u0026nbspMy case is that the first referendum said we should leave without specifying how. In a second referendum, the government would in effect say – here’s the deal we have negotiated... do you approve? What could be more logical? What could be more natural?\u0026nbspNothing except that Ms May has ruled out a second Brexit referendum. In February, in a typically muddled formulation, she told a conference:\u0026nbsp“We are leaving the EU and there is no question of a second referendum or going back and I think that’s important. People in the UK feel very strongly that if we take a decision, then governments should turn not round and say, no, you got that wrong.” But if anybody is going to say, “you got that wrong”, it wouldn’t be the government but rather the people saying to the prime minister that she got wrong the exit terms she negotiated.\u0026nbspThat is what Ms May doesn’t like about the notion of a second referendum.In fact, there is a strong case for holding a second referendum. Since 23 June 2016, the date of the first referendum, we have learnt quite a few things we didn’t know before. Business chiefs, for instance, are worried about the time-wasting bureaucracy of filling in customs declarations after Brexit takes place. That is what a hard border would mean.As to the Brexiteers’ notion that technology could be used to avoid this, Jon Thompson, chief executive of HM Revenue and\u0026nbspCustoms, delivered a stark verdict\u0026nbspwhen he appeared before the Treasury Committee.\u0026nbspThe cost to business of introducing a high-tech customs plan would be up to £20bn a year, he said. That is a frighteningly high price to pay.\u0026nbspWhen we cast our referendum vote, we also hadn’t thought about complex procedures such as car assembly. As a car chassis moves along the production line, components from all over Europe are put into their appointed places. If this is taking place in a British car plant, then many of the components will have come from the continent. If the plant is on the other side of the Channel, then many British-made parts will have had to have been shipped across. In fact, more than two-thirds of the UK’s exports to the EU take the form of intermediate inputs to the production of finished goods and services. Likewise, about 55 per cent of imports from the EU represent products to be incorporated in final production in the UK. If all this were to be subject to customs clearance, then the whole series of complex procedures would come to a halt.No wonder the prospect of Brexit is already having a negative effect on economic activity. As the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, an intergovernmental economic organisation, commented this week: “Economic growth is projected to remain modest at 1.4 per cent in 2018 and 1.3 per cent in 2019, owing to high uncertainties about the outcome of Brexit negotiations.”\u0026nbspThis is about half the rate of growth being experienced by the rest of Europe. Did we know that Brexit would condemn Britain to reduced economic activity?In short, we need a second referendum because we know much more about the disadvantages of leaving the European Union that we did when we were first asked. Moreover, in Ms May we have a prime minister who cannot make up her mind about anything. The Financial Times put this point strongly on 17 May: “It has been 693 days since Britain voted to leave the EU. In another 316, that decision is set to become reality. Yet the government of Theresa May has still not come to an agreement – either with itself or with Brussels – on what the new economic relationship with the continent should be. This was the most basic question raised by Brexit, and it should have been answered before Article 50 was triggered, setting in motion withdrawal.\u0026nbspFailure to do so is testament to political isions and weak leadership.”\u0026nbspSo we shall have to make up Ms\u0026nbspMay’s mind for her.So, in light of this muddle and confusion, what question would be put in a second referendum?\u0026nbspIn the 2016 referendum the question was\u0026nbspshould the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union or leave the European Union?\u0026nbspIn effect, this formulation called for an answer from the gut. Like it or leave it? But in a second referendum, this luxury would not be available.\u0026nbspThere would have to be reference to the terms of disengagement covering such crucial questions as whether the UK would remain a member of some kind of customs union.\u0026nbspAs it is hard to get such detail into a simple question, I suggest the following:Should the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union or leave on such terms as approved by parliament?\u0026nbspIn addition, a simple version of the terms approved by parliament could be sent to every voter and could be made available in voting stations.This would have the merit of emphasising that parliament is the supreme decision-making body in this country. However, as a Remainer, I must remember a key rule about asking questions – never ask one when you might not like the answer. How likely is it that the answer to a second referendum might differ from the first? Remember that voters are likely to be hostile to the holding of a second referendum. They may think – you have asked us once, we gave you an answer, don’t bother us again. With the result that the turnout for a second referendum would likely be low and thus unconvincing.However, Peter Kellner, the experienced political commentator and former president of YouGov, has just published a much more upbeat appraisal.\u0026nbspHe believes that below the surface, public opinion is stirring. In particular, one million Labour voters who backed Brexit two years ago are having second thoughts. His study of recent polling results convinces him that significant numbers of younger Leave voters, as well as those supporting Labour in last year’s election, no longer think Brexit is right for Britain. He also supports the Nick Clegg thesis and argues that the effects of demographic changes since the referendum are growing. “Bluntly,”\u0026nbspas he writes, “older, mainly Leave, voters are dying and younger, mainly Remain, voters are joining the electorate.”Mr Kellner bases his findings in the more than 23,000 voters that YouGov has questioned since the start of the year.\u0026nbspAnd his conclusion is that there is a real prospect that if the people were given the final say on Brexit, they would vote for the UK to stay in the European Union. So let’s have a second referendum.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

While 24 per cent of the former gained entry, only 12 per cent of the latter did.“You see places as prestigious as Oxford with an exclusionary admissions strategy,” Rev Sharpton told The Independent.“Oxford can figure out the most difficult aspects of philosophy and explore the intricacies of science but\u0026nbspcan’t figure out how to get admissions of black students. It seems contradictory – how could you be so bright and so dumb at the same time?”“Ninety-five\u0026nbspper cent of the crowd was white. I told them they need to work with groups like Operation Black Vote, who I have been coming to the UK with since 1991.”Operation Black Vote is a non-partisan, non-profit national organisation that was established in 1996 to tackle the black British and ethnic minority democratic deficit. It centres its energies on voter registration, lobbying politicians and mentoring schemes.“In Oxford, out of 29 colleges, eight colleges did not have one black undergrad admitted between 2015 and 2017,” Rev Sharpton, who Mr Obama described as “the voice of the voiceless and a champion for the downtrodden”, said.\u0026nbsp“Last night I said that we have the great symbolic heartwarming picture of a person of colour marrying into the royal family which we all support, but you have the undercurrent of exclusion in places like Oxford.”While about 3\u0026nbspper cent of the British population is black, according to the most recent census, only 1.9 per cent of the roughly 3,200 students admitted to Oxford in 2017 identified as black Britons.Oxford University – which has been contacted for comment –\u0026nbspadmitted it needed\u0026nbspto do more to improve student ersity after the latest figures were unearthed last month.Samina Khan, Oxford University’s director of undergraduate admissions, said the university was working hard to change.“The reason for that is that you are looking a very different applicant pools. One is very large – that is the white pool in terms of who gets three As and above (at a A-level) – and the other one is very small,” she told the Today programme.“We are not getting the right number of black people with the talent to apply to us and that is why we are pushing very hard on our outreach activity to make sure we make them feel welcome and they realise Oxford is for them.”David Lammy, Labour MP and the former higher education minister, said: “The truth is that Oxford is still a bastion of white middle-class southern privilege. That is what it is.“They have to explain why you are twice as likely to get in if you are white as if you are black and why you are more likely to get in if you are from the south than the north of England when you apply.”Earlier this year, The Independent revealed black students pursuing a place at university were 21 times more likely to have their applications investigated for suspected false or missing information than their white counterparts.\u0026nbspUcas said it was “extremely concerned” by the figures, released under freedom of information rules, and had launched an investigation.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Turkish police dispersing a march in Istanbul with tear gas and rubber bullets in 2015 and banning the event in 2016 and 2017 outright on security grounds underlines\u0026nbspthe ongoing relevance of the demonstration.More recent reports of homophobic violence being carried out in Chechnya\u0026nbsp and Indonesia\u0026nbspfurther emphasise the need for education to encourage greater tolerance.This year\u0027s London Pride parade is scheduled for Saturday 7 July while the UK\u0027s largest event\u0026nbsptakes place in Brighton on Saturday 4 August, coinciding with the Pride Festival held at Preston Park between 3 and 5 August, which is this year being headlined by the one and only\u0026nbspBritney Spears.Other key events taking place across Britain this summer include:In Europe, this summer\u0027s biggest Pride events are:Even further afield, you can celebrate Pride in these cities:or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

A car industry executive told the broadcaster that the change was a “catastrophe” for the car industry.“The hard Brexiteers have built a bomb under the UK automotive industry and the EU have lit it,” they said.Exit from the customs union and the subsequent changes to rules of origin are also likely to be disruptive for British businesses in other ways. UK exporters selling into the EU under any future free trade agreement would have to prove they originate from the UK, which can be a costly and bureaucratic procedure, reducing the competitiveness of British goods compared to EU ones. UK businesses that use components sourced from outside the EU may also not gain preferential access if they are found to be mostly worked on elsewhere.In most cases, a manufacturer needs to show that around 55 per cent of its value was created in the EU. The rules, which are a standard feature of all trade agreements across the world, are in place to stop countries re-exporting goods produced elsewhere on favourable terms.Staying in the EU customs union would remove all of these issues because the UK would continue to coordinate its trade policy with the EU.Commenting on the new warning, the EU’s deputy chief negotiator Sabine Weyand said: “Preferential rules of origin were the subject of my very first meeting on my very first day in the European Commission back in 1994. They have not become any simpler since.”A UK government spokesperson said: “This is simply dealing with what would happen in a ‘no deal’\u0026nbspscenario.“We are in the process of discussing our future partnership with the EU, and in March we reached agreement on the terms of an implementation period that will start on 30 March 2019 and last until 31 December 2020, which will see our market access continue on current terms.“A clear priority is to maintain continuity in our relationships with third countries as we exit the EU, and we’ve agreed with the EU that they will notify the other parties to international agreements that, during the implementation period, the United Kingdom is to be treated as a member state for the purposes of these agreements.“This is in line with the draft withdrawal agreement text published before March European Council.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

If they conclude then you’ll see it tomorrow, but it’s up to them to decide.”He added: “The detail of this is being discussed at the moment. it’s been through one cabinet committee, it’s going to another and it would be improper of me to pre-empt the negotiations there, but I suspect it will be fairly decisive.”Some reports had suggested Mr Davis\u0026nbspwas considering resigning over disagreements with Ms May on the matter.Asked if he would be able to stay in his job if the backstop proposal was published without his approval, the Brexit secretary said: “That’s a question, I think, for the prime minister, to be honest.”He also insisted there would be a time limit on the backstop option, saying: “The prime minister has already made public the fact that we expect to put\u0026nbspa time limit on the backstop proposal.”The government is under mounting pressure to publish\u0026nbspdetails of its Brexit plans ahead of crunch votes on its flagship EU (Withdrawal) Bill next week\u0026nbspand a European Council meeting in three weeks’ time.The UK needs to ensure sufficient progress has been made on sticking points such as the Northern Irish border in order to allow talks to progress to the matter of a UK-EU trade deal.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

The bill seeks to restrict the fees that landlords and letting agents are allowed to impose\u0026nbspon tenants.Melanie Onn, Labour\u0027s shadow housing minister, said: Labour is fighting for a fairer deal for all renters.We recognise the private rented sector is the fastest growing area of housing, and it is right that they are not exploited by unfair fees.This government has failed renters for the last eight years. Labour will hold them to account to make sure the power between landlords and tenants is rebalanced.According to the government’s impact assessment for the Tenant Fees Bill, the average rental deposit stood at £1,161 as of\u0026nbsplast March. It has risen from £979 in 2012 -\u0026nbsp a19 per cent increase in five years.The document admits: “In many cases the amount of deposit taken is much greater.”It continues: “As with letting fees, tenants are often forced to accept the terms of the deposit as set out by the landlord otherwise they will risk losing the property. Tenants can therefore be required to pay unreasonable deposits that are incommensurate with the landlord’s risk.“Tenants have little bargaining power to influence this level of deposit, which is further indication that the lettings market is not functioning in accordance with true market forces.“Government intervention in the form of a cap on tenancy deposits at six\u0026nbspweeks’ rent is necessary to ensure that the level of deposit required by landlords is financially manageable for tenants and commensurate with the landlord’s financial risk. This will result in the money being available to tenants to spend, leading to wider economic benefits.Three in four private renters are asked to pay a deposit when moving to a new property. On\u0026nbspaverage they\u0026nbsphave only 77 per cent of the sum returned to them.The government has been contacted for comment.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Hippos are susceptible to the infection, and can pass it to humans who eat infected meat.\u0026nbspZambia\u0026nbspinitially suspended a planned cull in 2016 following pressure from activists, but Born Free\u0026nbsphas\u0026nbspaccused\u0026nbspthe government of “secretly” overturning the decision and “promoting the cull to trophy hunters”.\u0026nbspWill Travers, chief executive of\u0026nbspthe charity, told The Independent\u0026nbspthe authorities have failed to provide enough\u0026nbspevidence showing\u0026nbspan overpopulation of hippos in the Luangwa River, or to make public any data that\u0026nbspjustifies\u0026nbspthe cull.They are, apparently, using the same flawed rationale for the slaughter as last time – a preventative measure to avoid a future outbreak of anthrax, combined with an assertion that low rainfall will exacerbate the situation, he said.They also appear not to have informed key stakeholders in the Luangwa Valley...\u0026nbspThe negative consequences for thousands of hippo and Zambia’s reputation as a wildlife tourism destination cannot be underestimated.”Umlilo Safaris, a South African trophy hunting company, last month began\u0026nbspoffering customers\u0026nbspa five-day “hippo management hunt” in the Laungwa Valley for £10,500 each.\u0026nbspThe organisation’s Facebook page says hunters can shoot five hippos per trip and keep the animals\u0027 tusks.Richard Kock, professor of wildlife health\u0026nbspat the Royal Veterinary College, told The Independent the government needed to provide\u0026nbspdata to justify the cull.\u0026nbsp“There’s no doubt that hippos can build up numbers until there really are probably too many for the ecosystem,” he said. “And so I think the anthrax may well be a factor in controlling their populations, and it may benefit the environment because they will consume large quantities of herbage, and obviously that will affect other species.\u0026nbsp“I’m also very sensitive to the fact people use these things as excuses for nefarious behaviour. So I would say you need good data and you need good evidence and it should be the scientific authorities who should back up any sort of criteria on culling. And it should be justified.”In a statement, Zambia\u0027s ministry of tourism said the culling was to maintain a suitable habitat for aquatic species and wildlife in general, noting that similar culls had taken place before.The hippos are causing considerable damage to the riverbanks and continue to threaten the sustainability of the river system, a spokesperson said.The move comes months after more than 100 hippos died from a suspected anthrax outbreak in Namibia.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

It said the government had triggered the Argentinian cancellation through its own actions.“Turning the game into a political event caused its cancellation,” Zuheir Bahloul, a member of the Knesset from the Zionist Union party and a former football commentator, told The Independent.In particular, the right-wing culture and sports minister, Miri Regev, had erred in moving the venue from the northern city of Haifa, which was Argentina’s preferred locale to Jerusalem, which Israel claims as its “eternal, unided” capital but whose eastern part Palestinians envision as their own future capital.The issue has become all the more charged since the US last month moved its embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, infuriating Palestinians.Ms Regev also depicted the friendly as linked to the 70th\u0026nbspanniversary celebrations of Israeli statehood.“The moment the Argentinians saw that the game was taking on a political colouring they got cold feet,” Mr Bahloul said.“The result is that the fans, including myself, lost out on the visit of the prophet of the religion of football, a very special prophet\u0026nbspwho, with his team, did not make it to the holy land.”The Palestinian campaign was led by Jibril Rajoub, head of the Palestinian Football Association, who on Sunday called on Arab and Muslim fans to burn pictures and T-shirts of Messi if he attended the friendly.The Israeli government blamed antisemitic elements for the fiasco.Avigdor Lieberman, the hard-right defence minister, wrote on Twitter: “It is a shame that the football nobility from Argentina didn’t withstand the pressure of the inciters and haters of Israel whose only goal is to harm our basic right to self-defence and bring about the destruction of Israel. We will not surrender in the face of a group of antisemites and terror supporters.”Ms Regev blamed Argentina’s decision on “terror groups that began sending messages to players and their families with clear threats to harm their lives and those of their children. Among other things, films and pictures of children’s bodies were sent to the players.”Fans were ided over who to blame for the cancellation.“This happened because of the inappropriate politicisation by minister Miri Regev. We actually deserve this punishment for injecting politics too much into sports,” said pensioner Shmuel Einhar, an Israeli Arsenal fan.Matvey Barsukov, 42, a health worker, disagreed, saying:\u0026nbsp“Argentina should not have caved into the pressure of BDS. Sports, music and culture should bring nations together. Argentina made a mistake and it’s a shame.”Palestinians were elated by Argentina’s move.PLO Secretary General Saeb Erekat said Argentina, its people and team had upheld international law in the face of Israeli violations including killings of innocent Palestinians along the Gaza border.The Argentinian decision “means the world doesn’t surrender to state terrorism, robbery and threats that are implemented by the Israeli government and backed by US President Donald Trump.“The international community won’t surrender to the actions of the Israeli government and its crimes against the Palestinian people.”Israel says its use of force against Palestinian demonstrators is necessary to prevent a penetration of its border that would endanger nearby communities.Fadi Quran, Ramallah-based senior campaigner for the Avaaz online activist network, said: “Argentina’s decision has brought a spark of hope to millions of Palestinians who felt forgotten.“From Palestine we say thank you Argentina for taking a moral stance and reminding the world that Palestinian lives matter.”Mr Quran dismissed Israeli assertions that Argentina’s move came about because of threats to players, saying Avaaz had worked closely with BDS and encouraged 200,000 members in Argentina and Spain to send messages to the Argentinian Football Federation demanding withdrawal from the match.“We got the message to them that they were being played by the Israeli government and they bravely took the right position.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

and it went up to £7.38 from April 1, 2018.The wage increased from £5.60 to £5.90 for 18 to 20-year-olds, and from £4.05 to £4.20 for under 18s.However, apprentices were only entitled to £3.50 if they are under-19 - this increased to £3.70 from April 1, 2018.In April 2018, the minimum wage for 25-year-olds rose from £7.50 to £7.83 an hour.The national limits are legally binding.Anyone who thinks they are not getting the National Living Wage or National Minimum Wage should complain to their employer in the first instance.If this does not get anywhere, the next step is to take the complaint to HMRC who will investigate.Those who are self-employed, voluntary workers, company directors and family members who live in the home of the employer and do household chores do not qualify for either rate.There is no difference in pay for those that live in London compared to elsewhere.The only discrepancy is for people working in agriculture or horticulture.Workers already employed before October 1, 2013 are entitled to the pay set under their contract of employment.This is a voluntary scheme aiming to recognise the actual cost of living, to which 3,000 employers have signed up.Under it, the lowest rate of pay is calculated according to the cost of living in the UK based on the changing cost of a basket of groceries.The amount is set by the charity Living Wage Foundation, and accredited employers include local authorities, NHS trusts, banks, retailers, charities and construction companies.The foundations calculations put the real Living Wage at £8.75 an hour - and £10.20 in London.These rates also apply to over-18s in recognition that young people face the same living costs as everyone else.And while companies are not legally entitled to pay more than the National Living and Minimum Wages, those which have signed up to the real Living Wage scheme have pledged to pay all workers those rates.The rate is calculated every November, and accredited employers are committed to any increases.While theres no legal obligation for your employer to pay you more than the National Living Wage (£7.50 from April 1, 2017), if your company is accredited by the Living Wage Foundation you should be receiving more than that.The foundations head of partnerships Graham Griffiths said anyone concerned can use their online whistleblowing service, and any employer not adhering to the Real Living Wage faced losing its accreditation.Graham said one area where it was challenging to pay the living wage were retail and hospitality but pointed to Ikea, Aldi and Lidl, which have agreed to pay the same rate.The scheme was launched in 2001 by parents in East London, and the foundation was set up in 2011.In 2005 following a growing interest from employers, the Greater London Authority established the Living Wage Unit to calculate what the lowest pay should ideally be.In 2008 Trust for London selected the scheme as a special initiative and made a grant of more than £1million to campaign for it and set up an accreditation scheme for employers.In April 2016 it became the inspiration for the governments higher minimum wage rate, which it rebranded the National Living Wage.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Because 17.4million of us voted to leave, to take back control of our money, our laws and our borders.Before the referendum vote, Parliament decided — quite rightly — that the British people had the right to decide whether we should leave the EU.That is why Parliament passed the Referendum Act and voted to trigger Article 50.And it is why both major political parties agreed in last year’s general election to abide by the referendum decision.Liam Fox says Britain has proved the doubters wrongThere is also great strength in the UK economy that should give us reassurance as we move towards a more independent future.Remember the dire consequences predicted if the British people decided to vote to leave? We were told investors would desert us.What happened?Last year we landed more inward investment projects than ever before, a vote of confidence from the international financial community.We were told we would face an employment crisis.What happened?Employment is up by 600,000 since before the referendum to 32.34million, with record numbers in work.Our manufacturing order books are at their highest for years and our exports have risen by about ten per cent in the past year.Remember how jobs would flood out of the City of London to Paris and Frankfurt?What happened?Last year saw more venture capital on tech, including financial technology, coming to London than all of Germany, France, Spain and Ireland combined.Thankfully, the British people had the sense and courage to ignore the prophets of doom.We can rightly be confident and optimistic about our future outside the EU — and the PM has set out a vision of what that will look like. The UK already has enormous advantages in a competitive global economy.Our system of law is admired across the globe. Our skilled workforce and universities are world class.We have fantastic research and development facilities, some of the best innovators and we are leaders in the digital revolution.And we speak English and are in the right time zone to trade with Asia in the morning and the Americas in the afternoon.The UK is in a strong position. We are not the dependent and supplicant country some would have us believe.We are a leading member of the Commonwealth, a grouping of 53 countries that is home to one third of the world’s population and half of the globe’s top 20 emerging cities.We are one of the highest contributors to Nato, have a permanent seat on the UN Security Council and are members of the G7 and G20.The UK’s future is, and needs, to be global. Based on International Monetary Fund data, it has been calculated that in the next ten to 15 years, 90 per cent of global economic growth will originate from outside the EU.That is where we must concentrate our efforts for exports and investment, alongside maintaining our ties of prosperity and security with our European neighbours. The well-being of future generations depends upon it.Sometimes it is difficult for people in Britain, or the rest of Europe, to grasp the scale of this growth.But when we understand that by 2025, China, alone, will have 221 cities with more than a million people, while the whole of the European continent will have 35, we can begin to see a fuller picture.Of course, the EU will continue to be an important economic and trade partner and we want to have a full, open and comprehensive trade agreement with it that puts the prosperity of European people before the ideology of the EU bureaucracy.But the truth is that our trade relationship with the EU has been changing over the years, since well before the referendum.In 2006, 54 per cent of our exports went to the EU. That has now fallen to 44 per cent, as markets elsewhere have expanded faster.One of the main benefits of Brexit, and being outside the Customs Union, will be having an independent trade policy for the first time in more than 40 years — made in Britain, for Britain.We need to have policies that ensure we are able to take advantage of the opportunities that will lie ahead as Asia and Africa develop growing middle classes with an appetite for the high-quality goods and services Britain provides.We cannot allow our future options to be constrained by the patterns of the past.As we leave the EU, we will take up our independent seat at the World Trade Organisation, the governing body of global trade.We will be champions of the free trading system that has helped take a billion people out over abject poverty over the past generation — one of the greatest achievements in human history.We believe protectionism will always fail and that spreading prosperity through trade is the best route to the global stability and security that is in all our interests.The UK can, and should, be a leader in that quest.It is time for our country to raise its level of ambition, take pride in our achievements and help shape our global future, joining the PM and the Government in delivering a Brexit that works for everyone — in Britain and beyond.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We don’t want to compromise,” he confessed to Vice online news. Now we all know. Our grovelling attempt to buy a friendly, friction-free and costly trade deal was doomed from the start.Brussels was never going to let Britain be better off outside.The Commission was determined to punish us for daring to leave. For believers in ever-closer union this an immutable article of faith.Abandoning the True Path is a heresy punishable by economic death.If we make it a success, we put the sacred Project in peril.In fact we should welcome Barnier’s harsh honesty.It provides an urgent wake-up call to dithering Theresa May who seems to favour a deal at any price.The PM’s weakness has made Britain a soft touch for Brussels and renegade Tories.Mrs May, a Remainer, has surrounded herself with a Downing Street coven of pro-EU fanatics and Whitehall mandarins who want her to cave in.She has a defeatist chief whip who keeps telling her she can’t win Commons votes against Brexit wreckers.And she is terrified of Chancellor Phil Hammond, a defiant Remainer who sabotaged spending on No Deal plans.Meanwhile, officials stoke fake news about a food, fuel and medicines crisis while the tax man invents a ludicrous annual £20BILLION customs bill for British exporters.Theresa May’s government is scaring itself to death.But a Sun on Sunday poll reveals voters don’t buy this rubbish.Most think, rightly, Theresa May has made a total hash of negotiations and must be replaced as PM when we leave next March.Mrs May is a rabbit in the headlights — aware of the trap she is walking into but paralysed by indecision over ways to escape.She seems to believe the EU Commission really can cripple one of the world’s major economies, wreck security ties and revive terrorism in Northern Ireland.And she is ready to cough up a gigantic £39BILLION of taxpayers’ cash for the privilege of surrendering — a prospect which enrages Remainers as much as Brexiteers.Paying that monstrous ransom in return for national humiliation would condemn the Tories to the scrapheap at the next election and hand the country over to a Corbyn-led Marxist nightmare.Ambitious Barnier — a preposterous puffed-up plutocrat — thinks he’s got it in the bag.EU needs all the friends – and money – it can get.In fact, his arrogance is causing alarm among EU leaders who want a deal — and offers Britain a chance to escape not just intact but in triumph.Barnier may have the support of France which has throughout history seen Britain as the great enemy.But many other countries — including Sweden, Holland, Italy and even Germany — regard the UK as their best customer.Trade is two-way traffic. Trade wars are bad news, as Donald Trump is starting to prove.Theresa May may be super-cautious but she has surely learned that boldness pays.She earned her leadership spurs by taking on Police Federation thugs. And she won global credit by standing up to Vladimir Putin over the Salisbury nerve agent poisonings.She must apply those lessons to this month’s crucial EU Council where member states gather to consider Britain’s future, just as Italy bursts into flames.The PM has a choice.She can accept an unpopular compromise which will unravel disastrously if British voters think they’ve been conned. Or she can march into talks with a clear, fair, take-it-or-leave-it offer to Europe from a valued economic and security ally.Her £39bn cheque is the trump card. With Greece destitute, Italy imploding and Austria, Poland and Hungary near revolt over immigration, the EU needs all the friends — and money — it can get.European leaders would have to decide whether to accept the deal or see Mrs May take everything off the table, including that mouth- watering £39bn pile of crisp Bank of England notes.Forget about “cliff edges”. The EU desperately needs that cash.

Easy to carry and it looks rad!When we flagged the sale of the items to eBay and Amazon, they were immediately removed from sale.A spokeswoman for eBay said: All illegal weapons are banned from eBay UK.

With the ban now becoming law, we are delivering on our commitment.Anyone caught making or selling zombie knives now faces up to 4 years in prison.On the governments list of banned knives and weapons, it describes zombie knives as a knife with a cutting edge, a serrated edge and images or words suggesting it is used for violence.The knives have been banned in England and Wales, and Northern Ireland are seeking to implement similar legislation.The knives have been used in two high-profile crimes this week.On June 1 footage emerged of a cyclist using a zombie knife to try and smash the window of a car in an apparent road rage row.And yesterday a moped gang wielding a zombie knife and hammer raided a luxury watch shop on London’s Regent Street. Alf Hitchcock, an expert on knife crime at the National Police Chiefs’ Council, said: “Zombie knives are absolutely horrific weapons.”He added: “There is no place for knife crime within society and this ban is further commitment to keeping communities safe.”At least 37 people have been fatally stabbed - and 62 overall killed - in London since the beginning of the year."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/NINTCHDBPICT000411368002.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"dennis rodman basketball north korea kim jong un married himself women","story":"Its fair to say Dennis Rodman is not your everyday sports star - and his life story is as shocking as he was brilliant on the court.Dennis Keith Rodman was born in Trenton, New Jersey, in 1961 to Shirley and Philander Rodman - who was later to ditch his family and move to the Philippines.Rodman has so many brothers and sisters his dad lost count. Its reported he has either 26 or 28 siblings on his fathers side.After an unhappy childhood the shy and introverted youngster left school measuring just 5ft 6ins and became a janitor at Dallas International Airport.However, after a bizarre height spurt a family friend tipped off the head Basketball coach of nearby Cooke County College.Within a year he was a college sports star and his outstanding playing stats started catching the eyes of NBA scouts.It was the start of a sporting career which would see non-conformist Rodman change the image of basketball forever.Throughout the 1990s he was one of the NBAs biggest stars famed for his on-court skills and off-court fashion sense, outlandish hairstyles and wild personal life...Rodmans outrageous sex life is the stuff of legend - and he really does claim to have done it all.In his 1997 book Bad As I Wanna Be Rodman tells how he didnt have sex until he was 20 when a prostitute did him and his friends for twenty bucks.However, since then it is fair to say he has made up for lost time.He claimed while he was dating Madonna in the mid 1990s, the pop queen used to send him x-rated faxes begging to have his baby.Then there was the time Rodman broadcast himself having sex with six women in a Hamptons hotel room after he forgot to turn off a cordless microphone in his pocket.The basketball giant also claimed his sex sessions with film star wife Carmen Electra used to last for days.The pair got hitched in November 1998 at the Little Chapel of Flowers in Las Vegas. Carmen filed for divorce the following April.In his book I Should Be Dead By Now  Rodman devoted entire sections telling all kinds of weird sex stories - the craziest one involved him bedding a bride-to-be at her hen party.He also claims to have broken his penis THREE TIMES during sex - with one lover thinking she had killed him because of all the blood.The 6ft 7ins sports legend has since claimed to have bedded 2,000 women but considers about 500 of them to be gold diggers.Finally declaring himself fed up with women he then claimed he was bisexual and married himself in a bizarre ceremony to promote yet another book.Rodman played for the Detroit Pistons, San Antonio Spurs, Chicago Bulls, LA Lakers and the Dallas Mavericks in a topsy-turvy career which lasted 12 years.He was nicknamed “The Worm” famous for his aggressive defensive and rebound abilities.During his time at Detroit became one of the elite teams in the NBA. The club won the championship in 1989 and again in 1990.However, Rodman ruffled a lot of feathers in 1987 when he claimed that the only reason Larry Bird won three MVP awards was because hes white.Rodman was selected to the 1990 NBA All-Star team and tapped as defensive player of the year that same season. In 1992 he won the first of seven consecutive rebounding crowns.In 1993, following the retirement of Daly, Rodmans relationship with the Pistons organisation soured and he was traded to the San Antonio Spurs.Prior to the 1995-96 season, Rodman was traded again, this time to the Chicago Bulls, where hed go on to team up with Michael Jordan and Scottie Pippen to win three consecutive NBA titles.However while at the Bulls he landed himself in hot water after headbutting a referee on the court - which landed him with a $200,000 fine.In 1997 he hit the headlines again after kicking a TV cameraman in the groin after he took a tumble on court.Following his tenure in Chicago, Rodman signed with the Los Angeles Lakers for a brief run late in the 1999 season. He concluded his playing career the following year with the Dallas Mavericks.In all, Rodman would finish with five NBA championships, two All-Star appearances, and twice be named the leagues top defensive player. In 2011, he was inducted into the NBA Hall of Fame.During his basketball career Rodman is reported to have earned $30m in wages alone. Hes now said to be worth just $500,000.During his time as an NBA star he is also believed to have earned tens of millions in lucrative sponsorship, TV and book deals.However in recent years his assets have been eaten up by a series of unfortunate business decisions and sometimes just bad luck.In 2012, he appeared in court to face charges that he owed more than $800,000 in child support to an ex wife.Rodmans lawyers claimed at the time that the former superstar was completely broke and could not pay a dime.Since then he has appeared in numerous reality TV shows, including Celebrity Big Brother in the UK, Celebrity Mole, which he won taking the $220,000 first prize, and Celebrity Apprentice in 2013.He has worked on voice-overs for The Simpsons and appeared in the TV show ‘3rd Rock From The Sun’.He has also appeared in several films and briefly had his own MTV reality chat show - The Rodman World Tour.Rodman made his first trip to North Korea in 2013 with Vice Media correspondent Ryan Duffy, to host basketball exhibitions.He met Kim Jong-un there and later declared him a friend for life before suggesting President Barack Obama call the leader due to their shared love of basketball.Describing his bromance, Rodman told Good Morning Britain: I hang out with him all the time.We laugh, we sing karaoke, we do a lot of cool things together like skiing and riding horses.At Pyongyang’s Indoor Stadium in 2014, he previously met the leader Kim Jong-un while watching an exhibition match between US players and North Korean players.In July, 2013, Rodman told Sports Illustrated: My mission is to break the ice between hostile countries. Why it’s been left to me to smooth things over, I don’t know.Since then he has made a few visits to the country - with the most recent being June 2017, taking the tally up to around five trips.He was sponsored by a currency for legalised marijuana and wore branded t-shirts to travel in.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The legal limit for a pilot is 20mg.Monaghan today appeared at Crawley Magistrates Court to plead guilty to the reporting for duty as a pilot when his level of alcohol was over the prescribed limit.Emlyn Jones, defending, said his client drank the booze well in advance of the eight-hour alcohol rule - known as bottle to throttle.Mr Jones told the court: He was not due to take up his responsibilities as pilot of the plane on take-off.He would not have been charged with taking up the role of pilot until three- and-a-half hours into the flight.Mr Jones told the court Monaghan had been on a overnight flight as a passenger the night before, and had spent the day without food or sleep.He added: He turned up for work appalled, astonished and horrified that he was still over the limit.Mr Jones said his client was only a fraction over the drink-drive limit of 80mg per 100ml of blood, and that Monaghan was not falling over drunk and no harm was caused.This was rejected by chair of the bench Dr David Wiggins, who said: I have to say the comparison to drink-driving is somewhat spurious in these circumstances.A pilot in a Boeing 777 is somewhat different from driving on the road, so we are completely ignoring that comment.Asking for the court to consider sentencing Monaghan on Wednesday, Mr Jones, said: He has thrown away the only career he has ever known.He has been a pilot his whole life, and that has gone.Sending the case to crown court, Dr Wiggins told the ex-pilot: I think you need to prepare yourself there is a very, very high chance that it will be an immediate custodial sentence.The 12-hour flight, from Gatwick to Mauritius, was scheduled to leave at 8.20pm, but the plane was left waiting at the gate while airline staff looked for a third pilot.Monaghan is due to be sentenced at Lewes Crown Court on June 12.A spokeswoman for British Airways said: This behaviour is completely unacceptable and not what we expect from our highly professional fleet of pilots.The safety and security of our customers and colleagues is always our top priority."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Lords1.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"peers given telling off for looking like theyre having a snooze in the chamber","story":"A shirty memo from the Governments chief whip in the Lords has been sent around complaining that the high standards of the upper chamber are not being met.Some older members of the House of Lords are regularly seen to be resting their eyes during debates - and several MPs have suffered from the snoozes in the Commons too.Lord Taylor of Holbeach wrote in an email to Tory peers: It has been observed by members of our House that, over recent months, conduct in the chamber has not been of the standard we should expect.He goes on to list a string of offences, including falling asleep in the chamber, audible conversations, and shouting from their seats, The Times reported.The grievances have also been circulated with their opposition members on the Labour and Lib Dem benches too.One Labour source confirmed they would be reminded of the rules. They told the paper: Sometimes they really are closing their eyes.Others are leaning into the monitor to hear more closely and it looks like theyve keeled over.MPs have also been known to look as if they are having a kip too.Earlier this year Tory MP Sir Desmond Swayne nodded off right behind the cameras as Ken Clarke was speaking in front of him.The Conservative MP for New Forest West tried to wake himself up by giving his head a shake, but tiredness overcame him and he could be seen slowly slipping down the green bench.When Sir Desmond finally jerked awake after his forty winks he he smiled to himself, hiding a sheepish grin behind his hands.The pair were talking about the EU Withdrawal Bill in the Commons, but Sir Desmond blamed an early morning swim for his tiredness and later apologised.   Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Heres what we know.The UK government is proposing a backstop arrangement which would keep the Irish border open after Brexit.Theres a need for such a fallback plan in the eventuality that no customs agreement has been decided on by March 2019, when the UK is due to leave the EU.And its seen as vital that a hard border is prevented between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland - which could happen were no deal struck and the two countries suddenly existed in different customs unions.Prime Minister Theresa May has said that she wants a wide-ranging free trade deal with the EU which would eliminate the need for regulatory checks on the Irish border.However, the EU is worried that the UKs vision could limit future trade deals, and not actually succeed in preventing the need for border infrastructure.The so-called backstop plans will outline a temporary customs arrangement with the EU in the eventuality that no permanent solution is agreed before the UKs March 2019 exit date.Full details of the UKs backstop proposal are set to be outlined in Parliament on Thursday, June 7.Cabinet sources confirmed that a four-page draft of the backstop plan had been circulated to ministers - prompting fresh rows within the Conservative Party over the apparent lack of end date to the plans.The EU believes the fallback option should be for Northern Ireland to stay in the single market for goods and the customs union until the UK has come up with a solution for the Irish border.This could keep Northern Ireland in the EU for some time after the rest of the UK has left - potentially around five years - and split the UK in half.But the Democratic Unionist Party, which props up the Conservative government, says it wont support any Brexit which results in divergence between NI and the rest of the UK.May relies on the DUP for their support in government - meaning agreeing to the EUs version of the backstop could destabilise her further.Under Mays vision, Britain would stop being an EU member state in March 2019, remain in the single market and customers until December 2020 and stay in the customs union for several more years after that.But Brussels has two issues with Mays plan.The first is that May wants the backstop to come to an end after a certain time period the EU think this would be self-defeating as its possible no solution for the Irish border would be found.The EU also thinks this risks leaving Britain benefiting from the customs union and single market for years after Brexit - reaping all the benefits without having any of the obligations that full membership would entail.One things for certain - therell be a lot more wrangling over this question yet."},{"url":"https://e3.365dm.com/17/02/2048x1152/ec9cbe28136e52c44fa664708ef9f6a4f521cf1052e3cc23e27be022031a214d_3882306.jpg?20180606192949 ","title":"italys new pm named as little known professor giuseppe conte","story":"The 5-Star Movement defended Mr Conte, saying he \"never boasted\" of holding degrees from foreign universities, but \"stayed abroad to study, enrich his knowledge and perfect his juridical English\".Mr Conte also has to convince his critics that he has the independence to lead the coalition government - and not just execute the wishes of the parties that support him.The law professor, who has a reputation as a snappy dresser, was born in Volturara Appula, a town of 467 residents near Foggia, in the region of Puglia.The 53-year-old currently teaches law in Florence and Rome.He graduated top of his class from the University of Rome in 1988 and now sits on several high-profile boards, publishing legal texts and advising on company administration.:: Why markets are fretting over Italy\u0027s coalitionAn expert in civil and commercial law, Mr Conte has also served on a government administrative justice council.In that role, he presided over a commission that ousted a public administration official who had demanded that female students in his law course for aspiring magistrates wear mini-skirts to class.Although he is not a politician, Mr Conte was named as a potential public administration minister by Mr Di Maio before Italy\u0027s election in March.

Some new road laws have already come into place, with more set to change the way we look after our vehicles later this year. We\u0027ve joined forces with the experts at Halfords to round up the essential bits of information all drivers need to know. So read on to stay up to date with the latest updates to British laws with this essential guide.  1. Learners can use the motorway now   For the first time learner drivers are allowed to take lessons on the motorway. Instructors must be properly licensed and have dual controls. This law should help learners become better prepared for driving on high speed roads - making our motorways safer. This follows a change in December which saw using a sat nav form part of the driving test. This was partly introduced because around a quarter of accidents involving new drivers are caused by them being distracted trying while using one. Tip: For added peace of mind, fit a dashcam. While they won\u0027t prevent an accident, investing in one can offer peace of mind. Having one means that if something were to happen, you\u0027d have video evidence to back up your version of events. Because of this, they can even be used to lower your insurance premium. The Garmin 55 Dash Cam, above, is excellent, can wirelessly send footage to your phone and has amazing, better-than-HD quality video and superb low-light performance. 2. Your diesel must be clean  The quest to clean up diesel continues as MOTs are expanded to check particulate filters. If your car produces any visible smoke during the MOT then it will fail. Similarly if your particulate filter has been tampered with then you will also fail. Make sure your diesel is running well and as cleanly as possible before your test. Tip: Some diesel problems are complicated, but make sure your car has the right oil levels and is using the correct oil. Use the Halfords Oil Finder to pick the right oil for your car - or pop in to your local Halfords store for advice from their expert staff. You can also check the Halfords MOT Advice or book an MOT at a Halfords Autocentre.  3. There are penalties for driving in the wrong motorway lane   Smart motorways have lanes which can be opened and closed via electronic signs on the overhead gantry. This allows for better traffic flow during peak times by using the hard shoulder for additional capacity. If, however, you ignore the signs when a lane is closed you will be liable for a fixed penalty of \u0026pound100 and three points. On many motorways you\u0027ll be automatically photographed if you break this rule and you\u0027ll get a fine as well as notice of penalty points in the post. Tip: A sat nav won\u0027t help with smart motorways, but they can alert you to possible traffic delays and reroute you. And with lifetime map updates, the Garmin Drive, above, is a great way to navigate.  4. Low tyre pressure is now an MOT fail  Before you go to your MOT make sure you\u0027ve checked your tyre pressures are correct. MOT testers are on the lookout for tyres that are underinflated and aside from that it\u0027s important for safety to make sure your tyres are correctly inflated.  Tip: Make sure you have a tyre pressure checker at home so you can keep an eye on your tyres. A footpump or electric pump is a great way to keep tyres at the right pressure. 5. It\u0027s very easy to fail an MOT for a broken car bulb - get a Free Car Check to make sure they\u0027re working As many as 30 per cent of MOT fails are because of lighting or signalling problems. So make sure your horn works and walk around the car checking all the lights – make sure the car is parked safely and the handbrake is on first, or you can reverse up against a wall to check brake and reverse lights.  Tip: Halfords FREE Car Check will ensure your car bulbs are all working as they should. The check also includes:  Wiper Blades Check Car Bulb Check Battery Check Engine Oil Check Windscreen Chip Check Plus a FREE Screenwash Top Up  Just pop in to a store or book online now. 6. Headlight washers are crucial now  It might seem odd, but if your car has headlight washers fitted, and was registered after September 2009, then they must work. Tip: Halfords will top up your screen wash for free as part of the Free Car Check. The MOT also requires your wipers be fully working, and Halfords can check those too.

Dagenham legend Eileen Pullen, 88, is delighted that her great-granddaughter’s generation are prepared to continue her fight for equality. “I’m all for it,” she says. “Things are a lot worse than I thought, women have a big fight in front of them. You can’t be frightened. “If you think you’re entitled to more pay, go for it.”  Eileen was one of the leaders when 185 female machinists at Dagenham, East London, went on strike in 1968 demanding an equal pay grading to their male colleagues. Tomorrow marks 50 years since the day the women, who stitched car seat covers, walked out. The covers soon ran out, halting production across the plant – proving just how integral their role was in the car manufacturing process. Their landmark action, immortalised in the 2010 film Made in Dagenham, is widely credited as a catalyst for the Equal Pay Act two years later. Yet despite being enshrined in law, equal pay has yet to be achieved in workplaces across the country.  The battle fought by Eileen and her colleagues continues today, as bosses are finally being forced to open up about the 18.4% gender pay gap that means women effectively work for free for two months each year. Fellow Dagenham striker Gwen Davis says: “It makes me angry and sad. Should we have to keep fighting for everything?” Gwen, 85, of Romford, East London, is frustrated that women are still subjected to lower pay and harassment at work. Like Eileen, she fully supports the high-profile campaigns that are calling out such ill treatment. “It should all be out in the open,” she says. “Why should a man think he has a right to your body?  “This year is about a lot of things, including equal pay – but overall, for women to be treated with respect. “Now women are protesting it’s revived my hope things will start to change. Women are strong compared to what they used to be, but it shouldn’t have taken 50 years. “I don’t think many people really understand what the word feminist means, still.” Pal Eileen, of nearby Rainham, encourages great-granddaughter Katie, a 20-year-old trainee nurse, to stand her ground. Eileen says: “I’ve been mad this year. I tell Katie to stick up for herself. I say to all women, stand up for yourself, go for it, call people out. We have to.”  Eileen and Gwen have never stopped fighting for equality. In February they were on the Bafta red carpet with actress Gemma Arterton, who starred in the West End musical version of Made in Dagenham. They wore black alongside the star in support of the Time’s Up movement against sexual harassment. They believe tomorrow’s anniversary is an important opportunity to speak out for what they so passionately believe in – especially coming as it does in the centenary year of women getting the vote. Although they shrug off any \u0026shysuggestion that they were personally courageous, back in 1968 it was undoubtedly brave to walk out of Ford.  Support was not always forthcoming – especially when their actions led to the plant closing down and the men getting laid off too, leaving hundreds of families strapped for cash. But they both say they never doubted. “It was difficult but we had to do it,” says Eileen. “We had no hesitation. We all got together, we asked for a meeting, hands were shown and out we walked. We were very angry. Although looking back you wonder how you did do it.” The situation the women were fighting was around grading rather than pay, initially. Despite their job requiring two years’ training, the female machinists were classified as unskilled B-grade workers, the same as floor sweepers, with the equivalent pay and pensions to cleaners.  Every year they would ask to be re-classified as C-grade semi-skilled workers, which is how men with \u0026shyequivalent training were graded. But each year they were turned down. “We had skills the same as the men,” Gwen says. “Yet we were classed the same as the teenage boys who swept the floor.” The final straw was the discovery that some male workers were being paid extra to work on the machines at night – while women were forbidden from working nights or overtime. Both women were married and had children, but say they were lucky that their husbands did not work at Ford, so one source of income kept coming in during the strike.  Both men were supportive – Eileen says her husband would put the tea on when she went off to protests. “He knew we were fighting for our rights,” she says. However, other families were not so lucky, which is why some hostility crept in. “Some said, ‘Get back to work’,” recalls Eileen. “They said we were putting the men out of work. We had to let it go over our heads.” Ultimately, for all their efforts, the women won only a partial victory. Employment Secretary Barbara Castle promised a pay rise bringing them up to 92% of the unskilled men’s wage – an improvement on their existing 85%, but still far from equal pay or the grading change they demanded. Gwen says the women had little choice but to accept the deal.

Critics have lined up to explain to the environment secretary the difficulty of paying for healthy food for people on low incomes. Mr Gove, who heads the government department in charge of food, said people with less money can find comfort in unhealthy foods. He said: “If you have got a difficult life and you have less money, then one of the things that can be a source of comfort, solace and pleasure will be buying and eating and consuming food that is not always going to be best for you in the long term.” Labour’s education chief Angela Rayner, who has spoken before about her family’s struggle to put food on the table when she was growing up, hit out at Mr Gove for being out of touch.  She said: “No Michael food choice is severely restricted to those who suffer poverty it’s mostly based on cost, those who are well off financially can “choose” from a wide range of healthy food options”. Alison Garnham chief executive of the Child Poverty Action Group told the Evening Standard: “Certainly food that is rich in nutrients is generally more expensive but the real story here is that more and more families are forced to use food banks - not for solace but for a square meal - because they don’t have enough money to live on.

The Labour leader claimed the Tory government had ripped up its own timetable, just like our shambolic privatised railways in a withering PMQs clash.  He added: Which will last longer, the Northern Rail franchise or her premiership?  Mr Corbyn surprised onlookers by devoting this week\u0027s Prime Minister\u0027s Questions to Brexit - despite a battle erupting in his own party.  This morning Shadow Brexit Secretary Sir Keir Starmer was forced to slap down unhelpful Labour MPs who want to stay in the \u0027soft Brexit\u0027 EEA zone. But Mr Corbyn insisted it was the Conservatives who were split - and Mrs May dodged a string of his questions.  The Prime Minister refused to say when her crucial White Paper, outlining her plan for Britain\u0027s relationship with the EU, will be published. She insisted she agrees with Brexit Secretary David Davis after reports he is fed up of slow progress and has had to redraft the White Paper five times. She refused to answer whether it will be published before this month\u0027s EU summit and whether MPs will have a chance to debate it first. She refused to say what progress had been made in choosing between the government\u0027s two current options for customs.  She also refused to deny Mr Corbyn\u0027s claims that the government was considering a bonkers 10-mile \u0027buffer zone\u0027 along the Irish border. But she did answer one question - whether she still intends to leave the EU in March 2019 and complete a transition period before 2021. Yes, the Prime Minister replied in a rare one-word answer. Mr Corbyn told MPs: When it comes to Brexit, this government has delivered more delays and more cancellations than Northern Rail. The government\u0027s white paper is delayes. Its customs proposals have been cancelled. And it’s ripped up its own timetable - just like our shambolic privatised railways.  This government’s incompetence threatens our economy, businesses, jobs and our communities. So my question to the Prime Minister is this - which will last longer, the Northern Rail franchise or her premiership? In return Theresa May repeatedly demanded Jeremy Corbyn rule out backing a second EU referendum - which he failed to do. The last time I looked at the order paper it said \u0027Prime Minister\u0027s Question Time\u0027, he complained.

The Prime Minister has promised a “detailed, ambitious and precise” government White Paper, outlining her plan for Britains’ future relationship with the EU. The paper was intended to put Britain on the front foot when it comes to the next crucial set of negotiations on the final Brexit deal. But sustained Cabinet infighting is reported to have delayed the publication of the paper, as Mrs May’s senior ministers failed to agree on the finer points of our relationship with the customs union and the Northern Irish border.  As a result, there are rumblings that the paper won’t be published until AFTER the forthcoming European Commission summit - which begins on June 28th. Which is pretty awkward. And the Prime Minister today repeatedly refused to put a date on the plan’s publication.  First Jeremy Corbyn asked not once, but twice for a date. She refused to answer whether it would be published the summit or whether MPs will have a chance to debate it first. Later in PMQs, Labour MP Steve Reed gave her a third chance to answer the question.   Who won PMQs? Jeremy Corbyn delivers a Brexit bashing to a leaden-footed Theresa May  He said: “The cabinet agreed to publish a Brexit white paper ahead of this month’s crunch EU council meeting, to allow the government to negotiate. The Brexit Secretary said it would be detailed, ambitious and precise. “So will she confirm whether the Brexit White Paper will be published before the EU council meeting, or is she unable to negotiate for the UK because she’s negotiating with her own cabinet?”  Again, Mrs May refused to answer, saying: “What the Government said is that we will be publishing a White Paper, which will be detailed and ambitious, and we will do just that.” The government\u0027s embroiled in a row over its Brexit customs \u0027backstop\u0027.  So what is it? It\u0027s a backup plan that will carry on some EU customs rules in the UK, after December 2020, if there\u0027s no deal. It is designed to stop ports grinding to a halt and Northern Ireland setting up border posts, which could lead to violence. But Brexiteers don\u0027t like it because it has no set end date. They fear it will trap Britain in purgatory, half-in, half-out the EU, for years. The backstop drawn up by the EU, back in March, would have kept Northern Ireland aligned with EU customs rules. Prime Minister Theresa May said this was unacceptable, because it drives a wedge between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. So she drew up Britain\u0027s own backstop plan, which it\u0027s thought will continue some EU customs rules across the whole of the UK. She now has to persuade the EU to accept this - because she has already signed up to follow the EU plan until there\u0027s a better way forward. The reason it\u0027s so important is simple. As time ticks on, the backstop will become less of a Plan B and more of a Plan A. It\u0027ll turn from backstop... to frontstop."},{"url":null,"title":"brave woman born butterfly child","story":"NewsBrave woman born a \u0027butterfly\u0027 child reveals horrific reality of condition from NO fingerprints or skin on back to constant \u0027bubble wrap\u0027 blistersPHOTOS AND VIDEO OF A MEDICAL NATURE INCLUDED.

But it\u0027s not because the brave 27-year-old is afraid of flying or has a habit of getting lost in new places. It\u0027s because she is one of the few people in the world with no fingerprints - which has led to problems at airports. It\u0027s interesting when you try to go to America and they try and take your fingerprints and you say you haven\u0027t got any, said Heather. I went to New York with my mum in 2005 and it was our turn to show our passports. Mum did her fingerprints and when it came to me I said \u0027I don\u0027t have any fingerprints\u0027. He said \u0027Don\u0027t be silly, everybody has fingerprints\u0027. I showed him my hands and he just looked shocked and tried to find me on his computer. He said \u0027Amputee?\u0027 I said, \u0027No, I\u0027ve got hands, they\u0027re here. I just don\u0027t have any fingerprints\u0027. I was taken off to a police room and I was absolutely terrified and burst into tears. Heather was born a \u0027butterfly child\u0027 - a term given to children with a rare condition that makes the skin so fragile it\u0027s compared to the wings of a butterfly.  She has had no skin on her back for 21 years and gets up every morning knowing the day ahead involves hours of bandage changes to protect her open wounds. She regularly wakes up with new blisters that have grown overnight like bubblewrap and need to be popped with sterilised needles. And her daily routine involves attaching a tube to her stomach that feeds her for 10 hours as she sleeps at night. Heather also has to put a lens in her right eye every day after an infected blister ate away at her own in 2007, forcing her to have a corneal transplant. But despite her struggles, she remains incredibly defiant. It affects my life from the minute I get up in the morning to the minute I go to bed, she said. I get the odd comments when I\u0027m out on the streets like \u0027urgh\u0027 but it\u0027s ignorance. She added: On bad days I\u0027m grumpy and I cry. I don\u0027t do anything, I just cry and think \u0027why me?\u0027  There are days when I want to give up. But then I have to have to accept it and have a reality check as it could be worse. Heather\u0027s mum Wendy was shocked and heartbroken when her baby emerged with no skin on her left hand or right foot, and doctors explained her condition. Heather has recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (EB), a skin disorder that causes it to become very fragile and creates painful blisters with any trauma or friction. The life-limiting condition also means she gets blisters inside her eyes and down her throat - a terrifying reality as it means her throat can close over and she needs surgery to open it out again. My back is red raw Research has shown that people with some types of EB face a hugely increased risk of an aggressive and ultimately fatal form of skin cancer, squamous cell carcinoma, according to the charity DEBRA, which supports people with the disorder and their families. They say it tends to occur at sites of increased blistering and scarring but research into the precise link between skin cancer and EB is ongoing.  Heather, from Swindon, has had the disease six times in the last two years.  She has recently had an operation to remove skin affected by cancer on her neck and has this month been given the all clear - for now. She says EB is the biggest condition no one has ever heard of - yet it shapes her life and means she plans her every move meticoulously. Growing up she has learnt to cope with staring, people complaining about her being in hot tubs and pools, accusations that her mum has let her get sunburnt, and struggles to be intimate in relationships. But Heather is unafraid of EB, is determined to raise awareness of it and help DEBRA.Explaining her condition to Mirror, Heather said: I haven\u0027t got any skin on my back, it\u0027s been open since I was six and has never healed in 21 years.  My back is red raw and sometimes it’s described as looking like a piece of liver. It’s sore and very itchy. I’m not supposed to scratch it, but I do sometimes which blisters and rips it. My hands are one of the worst areas, I don’t have any nails from where the skin on my hands has retracted - that\u0027s why they\u0027re so small. I also don\u0027t have any fingerprints. People are shocked and laugh, saying I could rob a bank. My arms don’t go straight because of the creases and scarring I have that restricts the skin. My feet are also different sizes - my right is a child size 12 and my left is an adult size 3. EB affects my skin internally and externally. I even get blisters in my eyes.  EB is life limiting, and it usually kills at quite a young age. With dystrophic there isn\u0027t an average age for life expectancy, it depends, everybody is different. Before Heather was born, her mum had no idea she would have EB. It was only when she came out with no skin on her left hand and right foot - which eventually healed on their own- that doctors diagnosed her. The charity DEBRA supported Wendy, 64, and put her in touch with parents of other sufferers so she could make sense of her daughter\u0027s condition. It was shocking for my mum, Heather said, revealing what she\u0027s learnt about her childhood. She’s told me I used to scream throughout the dressing changes.  It was horrible and heartbreaking for my mum when I\u0027d cry. As a child, mum wanted me to be as independent as possible but wanted to protect me as well. I couldn’t just go out with my friends because I needed help with my wheelchair. I used to swim but I just can’t anymore because my back just hurts too much. When Heather was six she had a gastronomy peg - a feeding tube - put into her stomach because she only weighed two and a half stone. She has used it every night since and it gives her a litre of a special ‘milk’ which contains the fibres, vitamins and minerals she needs to survive. Dr Helen Philips, Global Head of Medical Affairs for Amryt Pharma, said: “It’s estimated that there are more than 500,000 people living with EB worldwide, including around 2,000 people managed in specialist centres in the UK.  EB can be overwhelming and psychologically devastating to live with for both children and their carers.  Parents regularly find themselves as their child’s nurse and main carer, having to go through the difficult routine of changing bandages and dressing wounds while watching their child suffer with intolerable pain.  While significant advancements have been made in the development of therapies aimed at correcting the underlying genetic defects seen in EB, with the expectation that a cure for the disease will be developed in the long term, currently there is no cure for the condition.  Current wound care management involves daily or regular dressing changes to protect the skin, encourage healing and prevent infection.  Depending on disease severity, dressing changes can take several hours each day, often requiring the use of prescription medications to manage their excruciating pain.  The greatest need of those living with EB, and their carers, is to access better ways to manage the daily consequences of their condition, especially their wounds which are often associated with unbearable itch, pain and frequently become infected.  A cure is definitely something to aspire to achieving but short-term solutions are a priority – it is about the ‘here and now’.” As this tube goes into her stomach, she must lie on her back - and the constant friction between the bedsheets and her skin is why her back has never healed. \u2028Her neck is also affected and “anywhere that can rub, including the creases of my elbows, the backs of my legs where I sit down, my hips and armpits, Heather says. The friction from seams of clothing or anyone bumping into her when she\u0027s out can cause blisters or rip the skin off. There are days when I want to give up The young woman also has a restrictive oesophagus and narrow throat so has to be careful with what she eats. She is able to digest soft food but scratchy or chewy foods - for example crisps or steak- can scar her throat and cause it to contract. Until now, she\u0027s had six operations to release her throat after it has tightened.  Heather\u0027s mum helps her with the process of changing any bandages that need re-dressing and to pop any blisters. She applies treatment creams in the morning and has medication to control the pain throughout the day. The morning changes only take about 20 minutes, she says. But every evening her entire back is re-bandaged, a process which takes about two hours. She also has to put her eye drops in as part of her routine.  Heather, who has had several administrative jobs in the past but is currently focusing on her treatment, says: A blister breaks down into a wound - if I don’t feel it, it can be two or three times the size by the morning. If they rip, they need to be dressed. “It’s like bubble wrap, when you pierce it, it deflates. “I wouldn’t get to sleep without my medication, it puts me in a relaxed state. But I still get pain throughout the night. Doing the bandages is part of my daily life. I\u0027ve never known anything different. It\u0027s painful but I\u0027m used to the pain. It\u0027s just physically and mentally exhausting It\u0027s never going to change so I can\u0027t mope - it\u0027s not going to heal it. Throughout the day, Heather says she needs somebody with her to help with her wheelchair. She is able to walk around the house but for longer distances uses her chair. She has to plan outings around dressing changes, and is limited to only going away with people who she knows, trusts and can help with her routine.  Heather says one of the things she\u0027s had to deal with is people staring and making complaints about her. When I was younger on holiday people would tut and assume my mum had let me get sunburnt, she revealed. One complaint that sticks in my head was on a trip to Florida in 2009. There was a couple in the hot tub and after we got in, they got out. The manager then came and said to my mum \u0027what\u0027s wrong with her, maybe she shouldn\u0027t be in a hot tub\u0027. But my mum explained I was more likely to catch something from others than the other way round. It really hurt- to have somebody complain that I could be contagious was so hurtful. When I was 13 someone complained about me being in a pool in Spain as well which was so hurtful, she added. My mum carried leaflets in different languages on holiday to give to people and explained to children that I was born with poorly skin but that I was going to have it for life but that it’s OK.  Mum is incredible, I think that\u0027s where I get my strength from.  Heather has several other people who help her including her best friend Carly, Lorraine who is like her \u0027second mum\u0027 and her first friend Nikii. She is currently single but has had relationships in the past, although she says maintaining them has been difficult. Heather explained: The last one ended as I feel it was too much to deal with. EB is a massive part of my life and expecting somebody to bring that into their day to day life is quite a big thing. In relationships, the intimacy is difficult because I\u0027m not comfortable with my body. I\u0027m not dying. I\u0027m still incredibly fit The thing Heather finds most difficult to deal with though is the regular occurrence of skin cancer. She has had 15 operations in the last two and a half years after biopsies on lumps, abnormal scabs and blisters showed she had cancer on her right knee, right hand, her neck and her foot. The last surgery was on her neck at the start of this month, and she\u0027s relieved to have been given the all-clear.

On June 5 last year, Elley Taylor arrived at Derriford Hospital in Plymouth expecting to find her boyfriend, 20-year-old Marshall Arnott with a few broken bones.  He had been travelling home from work with two friends when their van overturned on the A38 in averse weather conditions.  The three men, who were aged under 25, were all killed. Now a year on, 20-year-old Elley Taylor, mum to Marshall\u0027s daughter Isla, has described how each day since his death has been a battle.  She was already suffering from post-natal depression at the time of the crash which made the trauma of losing Marshall and their dreams of living happily ever after even worse.  “You can’t sugar coat it,” she told Plymouth Live .  But she’s determined to be a good mother and says that Isla, who looks just like her dad, has got her though the darkest time of her life. Isla was just four months old when Marshall, along with his two friends Zachary Graham and Trevor Gorman were killed. “It was horrible,” Elley said. “All I wanted to do was run away and breathe but I had a baby to look after.  “Everyone says to me ‘It’s such a brilliant thing that you’ve got Isla - she’ll help you get though it’. “I had problems having a baby before so it was a really big thing for us. I was so thankful and so grateful but it almost felt unfair. “As soon as I had the baby something awful happened. I hated the world for a long time. “I spent all that time trying for a baby, I had operations for it, and then I had a baby but I lose him. “Even though it is a blessing and I couldn’t have done it without Isla, everyone else got to grieve – if they wanted to sleep for two weeks they could, if they wanted to cry they could cry if they wanted to go and forget it on a night out they could, but I spent the nights doing night feeds on my own for God knows how long. Elley first met Marshall, her affectionately nicknamed Marshmallow, at school aged 16.  They were “obsessed” with one another and the only time they ever spent apart was when she was in hospital. She says: “I loved that idea that I could say to my kids when I grew up that we were together since we were 16. “I used to say I was so fortunate that I found him so young. He was everything I ever wanted. I felt so lucky. I couldn’t fault him in any way. “He was an amazing dad and an amazing family, an amazing brother and an amazing son.”  Since Marshall was killed in the crash, Elley has described each day as a battle and revealed she has even had to fight suicidal thoughts.  Fearing she would one day take her own life to be with Marshall, she wrote a note to Isla explaining why.  “It was on my mind so strongly for so long. I was going down to the grave every day. It was horrible that he was there and I was here, she said. “It got to the point where I felt so empty. “People say it gets better in time but it doesn’t. You just learn not to cry so much. You learn to suffer in silence in a way. That pain will never go. “I want to be with him now. That’s a daily challenge for me to get through each day. There was a really bad time when I wrote a letter to Isla and I wrote a letter to my brother Curtis. “He was so happy. He was so loving and caring – he loved everything that he had in his life. I had post-natal depression. I was already very low and very depressed.  “Being at his grave and taking Isla down there. I used to think ‘why are you down there and I’m up here?’ “The plan was to live happily ever after. This feeling went on for so long. I wrote Isla the letter just in case. “It said that if she was reading this letter I was with daddy and it was okay. “I put it in an envelope and put it to one side.” Even now she feels she has to choose between being with her baby and being with the man she loved. “I want to be with both of them, she says. That’s a very hard thing to live with.  “I said it from the beginning – if I can chose any other way, other than him not being in that accident, that it would have been the three of us together. “I know that would have hurt a lot more people but I wouldn’t have been without him and Isla wouldn’t have been without a dad.” Despite Isla and Marshall only having a few precious months together, Elley is adamant that she will know her dad. Pictures of the young family are dotted around the flat and lovingly crafted photo albums fill the shelves. She says: “A lot of people around me didn’t like to hear his name. It was too fresh but I have his daughter – she had to know who her daddy is.  “I had to teach her so young to remember him. Now she can point him out in a photo. There’s a photo of him by the door. Every morning and every night we kiss him and say hello. “I hope he would be proud. “I feel like she was brought here and I was meant to look after her and I feel that she is looking after me. I feel like she was brought here because she knew I needed somebody. Elley is now looking to the future and has secured a place to study counselling at college in September. She hopes that by being so honest about her struggles will make other people realise they\u0027re also “allowed” to feel sad when bad things happen.

Pretty Frances Watkins, 15, beat dozens of able-bodied competitors to land the top prize and make history. She was diagnosed with cerebral palsy, which affects movement and co-ordination, after being born 10 weeks premature. Despite needing a wheelchair to get around, Frances was determined to enter the beauty pageant. She pulled on her ballgown and put on make-up to take the stage at Teen Natural Beauty Wales and win the event. Her proud mum Marie Watkins, 42, described Frances\u0027 victory as “inspirational”.  She said: “I’ve always told Frances there is no such word as can\u0027t.

I remember there were discussions in recent years to reduce the number of gulls.“Judging by these images I can’t see any justification that any such steps have been taken to cull the gulls or remove eggs from nests.“You just need to look at the roof next to the casino and the gym you can see hundreds of them at any time.”Lynne Short, city development convener, said: “I will be in contact with the refuse teams to survey the bins as it appears the current provisions aren’t adequate enough.”A Dundee City Council spokeswoman said: “Bins have been provided in many areas where, previously, waste bags were placed on the footpaths and became magnets for gulls.“Pest control officers are involved in removing eggs and nests throughout breeding season, and while this greatly reduces incidences of aggressive behaviour and disrupts and reduces the breeding pattern, it can take between five and seven years to take hold.“Gulls are protected by the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981.“It allows for the destruction of birds under certain circumstances, but this is only permissible where it can be demonstrated that they pose a risk to public safety or public health, and only when all other non-lethal methods of control have been discounted.“We would also ask that people do not feed gulls as this only exacerbates the problem.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"promising signs as csaba laszlo begins to create new dundee united","story":"\t\t\t\t\tThe summer of change at Tannadice has only just begun but the new-look Dundee United side is starting to take shape – what kind of shape are they in exactly, though?So far, the Tangerines have decimated last season’s pool with almost a full matchday squad list heading out the door.That left them with a skeleton squad before their business really got started last week.Five faces are in the door with the few players manager Csaba Laszlo wanted to keep given new contracts.More will be coming in during the next few weeks but, right now, how are they shaping up?GoalkeeperDeniz Mehmet looked certain to be the man between the sticks this season but for his knee injury picked up at the end of last season.With Harry Lewis heading back to Southampton after his loan, highly-rated youth keeper Josh Donaldson is the only fit goalie at the club.Verdict: A goalkeeper is certainly on the shopping list.DefenceTwo defenders have been brought in already this summer in Sam Wardrop and Callum Booth.Booth is expected to be first choice at left-back ahead of Jamie Robson while Wardrop will battle it out with Stewart Murdoch on the right.Though Murdoch has slotted in at centre-half, there is a big gap to be filled in that position.William Edjenguele, Tam Scobbie and Lewis Toshney are still around but Csaba and head scout Paul Sturrock are certainly looking for two starting centre-backs.Verdict: Big gap to fill in the middle but full-back positions look solid.MidfieldFit and healthy, Dundee United’s central midfield places are pretty much sewn up.Fraser Fyvie and Sam Stanton are the club’s stand-out talents at the moment and will occupy the middle of the park without doubt when available.In reserve is Scott Allardice after he signed a new one-year deal.Out wide, Fraser Aird has been brought in to play on the left side while Billy King is likely to start on the right.Paul McMullan hasn’t always been Csaba’s cup of tea but showed at the start of last season how effective he can be from the wings while youngster Matty Smith has slotted in out wide at times, though is nominally a striker.Verdict: Centre is strong when fit but numbers needed for a long season.AttackThe biggest capture so far by the Tangerines has been striker Nicky Clark coming from Dunfermline on a free transfer.The former Queen of the South and Rangers man has scored 29 goals in his last 62 matches in the Championship and is tasked with being Csaba’s main goal threat.Also in is former Ross County striker Craig Curran.The battling forward has never been prolific but his job will be to provide ammunition for Clark, while knocking in a few himself.James Keatings, too, is still around at Tannadice after a season beset by injury and personal problems. He’ll seem like a new signing if he can rediscover the form that helped Hamilton, Hearts and Hibs gain promotion to the top flight.Verdict: Looking good up top.Overall: With just 18 first-team players on the books, work is obviously still to be done but initial signs look promising. Adding solid defenders, however, is vital.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b1659e451e1b.jpg ","title":"this is colin the dundee wheelchair whizz who fitted chihuahua bruce with life saving wheels","story":"\t\t\t\t\tHe’s the man who gave a poorly pup a new leash of life.And now Colin Anderson’s almighty creation for Bruce the bionic chihuahua has attracted the interest of hundreds of fellow designers.By day, the 51-year-old helps transform people’s lives – working as a wheelchair technician at Ninewells Hospital.But recently, he was asked if he could use his invention skills to help create a wheelchair for Bruce by a family member who had read about his condition.The Tele previously told how Lochee woman Robyn Boyd and her family helped save the puppy at 10 weeks old with vets recommending he be put down because he required constant care.We then told how Colin had stepped in to help Bruce with his new wheels, which will help the dog build up his strength again.Colin said: “I was contacted and asked if I could design something for Bruce and I definitely enjoy a challenge. I modified a design someone had uploaded to the internet as I thought it was just about perfect for him.“All I had to do was personalise it for the size of Bruce after I measured him, I then used a programme to design a buggy for his body with the correct width of the arc for the front wheels so as not to interfere with his poorly legs.“I get a lot of pleasure from being able to help people with anything they may need designed from a new door nameplate to the wheels for Bruce, you imagine it and I will try to build it, you are only limited by your imagination.“I did see a big difference when I saw him after a week and I think we are just about there.”In addition to both of his front legs being dislocated, Bruce also has underdeveloped joints and non- cancerous tumours in his eyes as well as having stunted growth.He has received daily massages and hydrotherapy treatment – sometimes up to three times a day – in a bid to increase his strength.Bruce was so small on arriving at their home that he could fit into the palm of Robyn’s hand.His wheels – complete with his very own nameplate – were created through a 3D printer with the design meaning Robyn and mum Jayne Kelly can have it adjusted should Bruce grow out of it.Robyn, Jayne and other family members have been out to meet Colin several times so Bruce could test out the prototype.This was the first time that Colin, of Polepark, had designed a prototype for an animal.His creation is now available on free design-sharing website Thingverse, with hundreds of people showing an interest in adapting his work.Colin said: “I’m normally used to working with humans and altering wheelchairs, which I’ve done for about 20 years.“This was the first time I’ve done anything for animals and it’s something I would happily do again if the opportunity came up. It took a couple of trials to get it almost perfect and after a couple of weeks I found a third wheel at the back to stabilise him was ideal.“The advantage of 3D printing is that if he does grow any more it is easy to change the size and print a replacement and the current model is configurable so I can adjust the height later.“I’ve spent about four to five years working with 3D printing and I’ve definitely seen a big difference in the quality of the designs that I’ve been able to come up with.“I’m just glad I was able to help Bruce improve and it’s been quite pleasing to see the reaction that I’ve had to the design.“It means that people can now go and adapt it however they like and to suit whatever situation.“Hopefully that will go some way to making a difference.”VIDEO: Adorable pup Bruce shows off his custom made wheels after being saved by Dundee family\t\t\t"},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7486028.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"She did it  Swindon star Maisie Sly s film wins at the Oscars","story":"                          Swindon\u0027 own Maisie Sly has topped off her trip to Hollywood in style, after the film she starred in, The Silent Child, was announced as the winner Best Live Action Short Film at the 90th\u0026nbspAcademy Awards."},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7590066.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"11 things you d only hear in Glasgow","story":"                          There are some things you will only ever hear in Glasgow or Glesga, as us locals call it,\u0026nbspand this is our definitive list of the best."},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7608211.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Drastic weight loss mum-of-four    too fat to have bingo wings clipped    by Scots medics","story":"                          A woman who was once obese has been rejected for cosmetic surgery to remove excess skin -

The intention is to change it to clear glass and make it more attractive entrance.\"The next phase would be to\u0026nbsp refurbish the shop fronts in Market Arcade and make them more in keeping with the building.It is hoped both phases will be able to secure funding from the Academy Street Townscape Heritage Project to regenerate that area of the city centre.With that funding due to finish in 2020, the proposed improvements are at the top of the list of priorities on the market action plan.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThe third phase focuses on the market hall itself.\"This is the area potentially most subject to change,\" Mrs Murray said.\"We are going to look at having a feasibility study done to see what is physically possible and how much can be developed to create a better and more usable space, better units and a better environment.\"One idea, for example, is to look at whether a mezzanine floor would be possible.\"We also want to try and create a more open area which we could use as a venue, Mrs Murray said.She is particularly keen to see more cafes and restaurants and food units while zoned areas such as a restaurant quarter or a jewellery hub are another possibility.Rents could also be set according to whether units are assessed to be in a strong or weak location.Of the 36 units, 32 are currently occupied and there has\u0026nbsp also been interest from other prospective tenants.\"The Victorian Market is quite unique in Inverness and we need to exploit that,\" Mrs Murray said.\"We are trading healthily but we want to maximise our potential.

We\u0026rsquove got the most roads and schools and most of them in the poorest condition. That\u0027 nobody\u0027 fault, that\u0027 our geography.\"She expected both governments to insist that grant support has risen year on year \u0026ndash something the council has consistently disputed.A spokeswoman for the Scottish Government said: \"Highland Council has had more money this year from the Scottish Government despite UK government cuts to our budget.

signing Chris Forrester today vowed to be an influential goal-scoring playmaker – starting in Europe.The midfielder became Dons boss Derek McInnes’ first major signing of the summer when signing a three-year contract from Peterborough United.Rated as a multi-million star by Peterborough only 18 months ago, the Dons secured the 25-year-old for a fee understood to be £200,0000.Former Posh captain Forrester had a year left on his contract at Peterborough but was slapped on the transfer list at the end of the season by Steve Evans.The midfielder is a former Republic of Ireland U21 cap and broke into the senior squad in 2016 but has still to be capped.Dons boss Derek McInnes’ main priority in the transfer window was to replace the void left by the exit of Kenny McLean.Scotland cap McLean was the Reds’ main midfield playmaker but has left Pittodrie for Championship side Norwich City.Forrester insists he can bring that creative spark McInnes is searching for and aims to hit the ground running in the Europa League.He said: “I am not afraid to get on the ball as that is what I love to do.“I love to get the game going and passing to the lads that can maybe score the goals.“This season I want to be the one receiving the ball, doing something with it and also scoring a few goals.“In the last two seasons at Peterborough I forgot how to find the goal.“Coming up here one of my main aims is to get back in amongst the goals.“I aim to be a goal scoring midfielder as opposed to someone just sitting in the middle and passing the ball.“I want to see myself up there pressing the ball and creating the assists or creating the goal that wins the game.”Aberdeen had also made an enquiry about Forrester’s Peterborough team-mate Jack Baldwin.However, the Reds cooled their interest in the defender.Forrester revealed boss McInnes was pivotal in persuading him to move to Pittodrie.He said: “He (McInnes) said he sees me as an important player for the team which is music to my ears.“He said he sees me coming into the team and being the main passer which is what I liked to hear.“That helped to bring me here.”Aberdeen enter the Europa League at the second qualifying round stage on July 26.Despite playing in England’s third tier, Forrester has no concerns about making his Dons debut on the continental stage.He played in Europe for both Bohemians and St Patrick’s Athletic from the League of Ireland.He said: “My first European trip was with Bohemians when I was 18 and we went to Slovenia to play Ljubljana (Olimpija).“That was a massive experience for me and I did that every year I was in the League of Ireland.“For about five years I went on European trips and had some great results.“We (St Patrick’s Athletic) knocked out Siroki Brijeg (of Bosnia, 3-2 aggregate in 2012).“We also played Legia Warsaw which was a massive game in front of a massive crowd.“We were 1-0 up until the scored an equalizer in the 89th minute (1-1 first leg, 5-0 second for 6-1 aggregate loss).“I have plenty of experience in Europe and hopefully can bring that to the team this season.”Forrester was so highly rated Peterborough club chairman valued him as a multi-million pound player in January 2016.However, after a frustrating season he was transfer listed this summer with a year left on his Posh deal.Forrester said: “As soon as my agent told me about the interest from Aberdeen I knew that I needed a fresh start from Peterborough.“Things didn’t go so well last season.“I could see Aberdeen get over 15,000 at games most weeks and it is a club with stature.“I am looking forward

At times when the builders are working the gulls understandably leave the site but then return during the evenings and at weekends. Several birds were again sitting on apparent nests as recently as May 4, however it looks like many others may have moved elsewhere.Measures have since been taken by the builders to encourage the birds to leave the area prior to laying their eggs and to give them a chance of nesting elsewhere soon. Recently I had a meeting with SNH (Scottish Natural Heritage) and the RSPB and both were sympathetic and understanding of the situation.I also plan to meet with the Scottish Canals environmental scientist soon in the hope that perhaps provision can be made, within the scope of the hub project, to allow for a nesting area for the Common Gulls in future years at the site.This could give rise to an exciting opportunity enabling the public and visitors to the new heritage centre to view these gulls raise their chicks, for which is effectively the rarest colony of nesting birds in the Crinan Canal corridor.Jim Dickson, Argyll Bird Recorder, CairnbaanSir,This week Allt Dearg Wind Farm distributed over £135,000 to the Ardrishaig Community Trust, which holds the village\u0026#8217s share in this locally owned wind farm.Combined with the recent payments to the Tighnabruaich and Tarbert Trusts which hold similar shares in the neighbouring Sròndoire Wind Farm, together with the wind farms\u0026#8217 contributions to the local educational trust, this brings the total direct community benefit payments from these projects to well over £ 1 million.This is a significant milestone for the projects, and highlights the socio-economic advantages of local ownership in wind power. Despite its relatively small capacity Allt Dearg is the single largest contributor of community benefit payments in Argyll.This week the UK Government published the results of its latest tracking survey of public attitudes to energy and climate change. This shows continued growth in support for on-shore wind, and eight in ten agreed that renewable energy developments should provide direct benefits to the communities in which they are located.Some objections to wind farms remain, and our turbines remain visible in the distance. We hope that the views of Allt Dearg and Sròndoire might remind such objectors that we are economically dependent on what we can produce from the limited options available to us in remote rural areas. That our particular wind farms are able to make a significant contribution to local employment and deliver funding direct to our neighbouring communities, whilst supplying around 20 per cent of Argyll and Bute’s annual domestic electricity requirements from a clean renewable resource, is very satisfying.We would like to thank all those who have made these projects the successes they are, and in particular thank those local community councillors and trust members who have given so much of their time in recent years to make this all happen. For our part, we will continue our efforts to grow the industry and economic activity that provides secure employment and opportunity for our local community.We look forward to our community partners being able to invest the fruits of these wind farms into exciting local projects.Mary Broadfoot of Stronachullin and James F Lithgow of OrmsarySir,Loneliness is a major issue in society and affects everyone from all walks of life, regardless of age or ability.That’s why we’re pleased the Scottish Government is looking at the development of a new approach to tackling the issues of loneliness and social isolation – something we have first-hand experience of and how it affects many of the people we support in Scotland.Following a recent survey of over 150 service users of our homecare services in Stirling, Falkirk, Perth and Kinross, and Angus which focused solely on loneliness and social isolation, it was revealed that loneliest people receive far fewer visitors each week. While this is hardly surprising, we did find that those who either lived with family or had family close by were less at risk of loneliness and the negative health impacts associated. Our research also highlighted that respondents, in most cases, simply wanted a chat over a cuppa with someone their own age.Social interactions are something the vast majority of us take for granted as we all lead such busy lives, but for someone who is alone, watching time go by very slowly, it’s incredibly painful for them to sit at home day after day with no communication from the outside world.Charities such as Sue Ryder regularly arrange social events for our service users and their families.But if, as a nation, we’re serious about tackling loneliness as a public health issue then we need to be resourcing our local authorities to put in place services or to commission them from the third sector to ensure that no one feels alone and isolated in Scotland.Pamela Mackenzie, director of neurological services and Scotland, Sue Ryder, StirlingSir,This spring we hope your readers will celebrate the royal wedding with their very own Right Royal Tea Party in aid of Meningitis Now.Putting on a spread fit for a royal wedding is a piece of cake with our free fundraising pack and, as Prince Harry and Meghan Markle have requested charity donations rather than wedding presents, you can fulfil their wishes whilst helping families affected by this devastating disease.A royal-themed Time4Tea can be held anytime, not just on Saturday May 19, the date of the Royal Wedding. And it can take place anywhere – at home, at work, at school.Just pop the kettle on, slice up a cake or two, homemade or bought (you have to have cake at a wedding) and invite friends, relatives and colleagues to enjoy a cuppa or perhaps even a glass of champagne.The serious point is that you’ll be helping to fight meningitis and move us one step closer to our vision of a future where no one in the UK dies from meningitis \u0026#8211 and everyone affected gets the support they need to rebuild their life.Sadly, despite developments in vaccines, meningitis and septicaemia continue to affect thousands every year and kill more under-fives than any other infectious disease. Help us fight back on all fronts by funding research to eradicate the disease, raising awareness and supporting survivors.That would be the perfect wedding present.Find out more at www.MeningitisNow.org and search for Time 4 Tea.Elaine Close, community fundraiser, Meningitis NowSir,Please would the parents of the young girl who may have witnessed a recent incident with a man and dog in Inveraray Main Street be kind enough to contact my husband and I through this newspaper?We saw a man who, we believe, mistreated a dog in the street at 8.30pm on Sunday April 29, and his movements in the immediate aftermath.We are both keen to know that this young person is alright as she appeared to be terribly frightened, running off at speed with her two dogs as he headed straight for her.Knowing she was now fine would put our minds at rest.

Therefore, we support separating pedestrians, cyclists and motorists through an expansion of the network of walking and cycling paths across Scotland.We would like to stress, however, that measures like these will not single-handedly lead to safer roads. The road mentality in Scotland still favours the motorist over more vulnerable road users, which presents a huge barrier to more people taking up active lifestyles.More needs to be done to change our road culture for people in Scotland to feel safer regardless of their means of transportation, ultimately empowering them to lead healthier and more active lifestyles.Perhaps it is time we started to beat the ‘presumed liability’ drum once again?Brenda Mitchell, Road Traffic Accident Law (Scotland) LLP, Edinburgh.Sir,Some people have difficulty getting up and down the steps on the Glasgow bus. We asked West Coast Motors about this and they gave us the answer we wanted.All Citylink buses are fitted with an access ramp, worked by the driver. A platform comes out on to the pavement, with a holding bar, and is then raised up to floor level. This is designed as a wheelchair lift, where two seats at the front have to be arranged to be taken out, to give plenty of room.It was agreed, however, that if someone felt nervous about climbing up or down the stairs, they could also use the access platform. Once they have paid their ticket, they can walk to a seat.West Coast Motors asks anyone wanting this service to please remember two things.Firstly, book your single or return tickets by phone or on the Citylink website.Then, 48 hours before your journey, phone Citylink and tell them the times and details of the booking you have made and let them know you will be using the access ramp. The telephone number is 08712 663333.Kirsty McCuaig and Patricia Crawford, Mid Argyll Buddies.Sir,The ongoing effects of weather, bureaucracy and concern for the future continue to put our countryside under pressure, with few avenues to turn to for support.This can have dramatic consequences for the rural economy and the people who live and work there.The Prince’s Countryside Fund is committed to supporting community-led projects that will re-invigorate and sustain farming networks and the countryside by providing services and amenities through its grant programme.Open for applications until June 14, grants are available for up to £50,000. If you are involved in a community-run or farming support project and think your organisation may benefit – or if you know someone who might –  visit  www.princescountrysidefund. org.uk/grants.The fund has supported a diverse range of projects, including a community transport app in Argyll and projects on Barra, Orkney and Shetland. We are proud to have distributed more than £9 million since 2010 to more than 250 projects led by these grassroots organisations.It is crucial we help rural areas during these times of change to retain a thriving countryside and encourage a sustainable farming sector in the UK and would encourage people to apply for our funding.Claire Saunders, director, The Prince’s Countryside Fund.Sir,At first sight, it seems odd that the controversy over the reported disturbance to common gulls, oystercatchers and black guillemots at the old oil depot in Ardrishaig is focused on a breeding colony of common gulls.I’m no bird expert and hadn’t realised common gulls are less common than the bigger varieties or that they’re a declining species.But among the reasons given for this are predation by mink and the loss of open rubbish dumps and both might be contributing factors in Mid Argyll.It’s surely hardly surprising that the only breeding colony along the canal is at the Ardrishaig end, where the urbanisation around the tidal flats of Loch Gilp and the Lingerton dump offer prime scavenging opportunities.I don’t know whether they lose out to the bigger gull species when it comes to local island nesting sites, or whether the old Gleaner site might offer other advantages, for example, maybe less vulnerable to mink predation – but could it be the gulls are there primarily because of man-made feeding opportunities and that they’ll find an alternative site that’s similarly convenient?Likewise, the smaller populations of oystercatchers and black guillemots, however, although they’re also both amber listed they don’t scavenge and seem to be more dependent on the sea and shore for their livelihoods.Their decline might be of more concern but they’re hopefully less swayed towards easy pickings around Loch Gilp and more evenly distributed to Loch Crinan.Perhaps Jim Dickson and Andrew Tongue can enlighten us further on just how endangered the populations of these three species are in Mid Argyll.Robert Wakeham, Lochgilphead.Sir,Please would the parents of the young girl who may have witnessed a recent incident with a man and dog in Inveraray Main Street contact my husband and I through this newspaper?We saw a man who, we believe, mistreated a dog in the street at 8.30pm on Sunday April 29.We are both keen to know this young person is alright as she appeared to be frightened, running off at speed with her two dogs.Knowing she was fine would put our minds at rest.

Beyond our concerns for public safety, this systematic under-investment is slowing our economy and costing local councils a fortune in compensation for car owners.We recognise the importance of well-maintained roads and we are willing to invest in it.The SNP has consistently neglected Scotland’s roads and the results are obvious for everyone to see.Councillor Alastair Redman, Islay.On Monday May 14, I spotted six swallows over the rear of Meadows Place, hopefully heralding a decent summer.First seen this year.Mike Power, Lochgilphead.Sir,During this week\u0026#8217s Holyrood vote on the UK Government’s Withdrawal Bill, Labour, the Greens and LibDems joined the SNP in an overwhelming rejection of the UK Government’s currently-drafted Brexit plans, voting 93 to 30 against the bill.While the Scottish Government agrees in the need for UK-wide frameworks, it has described the retention of the overall control of agriculture, fisheries, food labelling and public procurement as a power grab.The Scottish Parliament has spoken loudly and clearly, and if the UK Government wants us to believe they value Scotland and devolution, they must respect the vote and remove the proposed power grab.Any constraints placed on the existing powers of the Scottish Parliament without consent would be a democratic outrage.During Prime Minister\u0026#8217s Questions, Theresa May failed to reassure us she will respect the decision of the Scottish Parliament. If she does choose to ignore the vote and force through this legislation, she will be breaking the conventions of the 20-year-old devolution settlement and imposing a power grab upon Scotland against our will.Brendan O\u0026#8217Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"science matters natures patterns","story":"\t\tDorothy H CrawfordUpdated: 20/05/18, 11:47 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe natural world abounds in beautiful patterns, each evolved to enhance survival of a species \u0026#8211 the extravagant, iridescent peacock’s tail, which serves to attract a mate, while intricate orchid flowers entice pollinators and tigers’ stripes provide camouflage.But not all nature’s patterns are quite as showy it is the mathematical symmetries that I find most intriguing.Italian mathematician Leonardo Fibonacci lived in 12th century Algeria when Indian numerals were introduced to the West via the Middle East.  In his book, Liber Abaci (published in 1202), he describes a numerical sequence, now called the Fibonacci sequence, in which each number is the sum of the previous two digits: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 ad infinitum. He formulated this recurrence in relation to rabbit breeding, but it turns out to be exceedingly wide-spread in nature, from tree branching to mollusc shell growth to bee reproduction.Plant leaves are like solar panels, absorbing sunlight to power energy-providing photosynthesis.  Thus, leaves appear in a spiral around the stem, each positioned to optimise sunlight capture.  The ratio of leaves to turns is always a ration of Fibonacci numbers 3 leaves to 1 turn for hazel, 8/3 for pear and 13/5 for almond trees.  The angle between consecutive leaves is always close to 137.5o, called ‘the golden angle’ – perfect for maximising energy production.The number of petals in most flowers also follows the Fibonacci sequence: lilies have 3, buttercups 5, delphinium 8, common marigolds 13, asters 21.  But even more striking are the complex spirals of seed-heads of sunflowers, fir cones and pineapples.  In each case new seeds forming in the centre of the flower push older seeds out into mesmerising patterns of interlocking, clockwise and anticlockwise spirals.The numbers of spirals in both directions are consecutive Fibonacci numbers with 5 and 8 or 8 and 13 in pineapples, 8 and 13 in fir cones, and numbers as high as 144 and 233 recorded in sunflower heads.Why? Because these configurations pack in the most seeds.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column 25","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 21/05/18, 3:33 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Some would argue it has been an eyesore that should have been knocked down long before now and replaced with a more modern building.But it\u0026#8217s sad to see the old Inveraray Community Hall crumble and rot with neglect.What makes the building\u0026#8217s current predicament all the more galling is that there was the chance, according to Inspire Inveraray, to make the building safe six years ago.

As with other gull species which are opportunist in diet, junk food and bits of plastic provided by us humans can be inadvertently consumed.Over many years the Gleaner oil depot, which has a concrete bund in case of oil spillage, has provided a safe nesting site for around 20 pairs. The suggestion that this colony could easily find an alternative site is perhaps wishful thinking as suitable sites nearby in Mid Argyll are already occupied by other gull species or don’t have the required habitat features.Thankfully, however, this should not prove necessary. Following a productive on-site meeting last week with the Scottish Canals\u0026#8217 environmental scientist, the project architect and TSL contractors we noted 10-15 birds sitting on eggs and unaffected by the work going on around them.Planned works over the coming weeks should not affect these gulls, Oystercatchers or Black Guillemots from nesting and will also not impede the building work which is scheduled to be completed by next spring.The Mid Argyll hub project and new canal museum will largely reflect the social and cultural heritage of the Crinan Canal, but should also encompass the important and often decreasing natural history of the Crinan Canal corridor. These breeding birds are also a part of this and should not just be something to ‘chase off’ to somewhere else.Excellent viewing and educational opportunities from the new build will be possible to watch this colony raise their chicks as well as providing a point to lookout for other wildlife on the loch.Nearby, the tidal estuary of Loch Gilp provides us with an often highly under-valued unofficial nature reserve that links Ardrishaig with Lochgilphead, which in winter hosts important numbers of duck and waders, in summer includes breeding Eider ducks and Common Terns and during migration is a vital stopping off point during adverse weather for passage Whooper swans, Brent geese and Black-tailed Godwits to name a few.Increasingly good work is being undertaken by locals and the Phoenix Trust to help clear up some of the increasing amounts of shoreline rubbish.Keep up the good work!Jim Dickson, Argyll Bird Recorder, CairnbaanSir,I have been out and about Islay the past week speaking to my constituents, visiting local businesses and monitoring the roads department\u0026#8217s progress with road repairs.Unfortunately CalMac management\u0026#8217s shocking handling of our local ferry service is really taking it\u0026#8217s toll on many local businesses that depend heavily of Islay\u0026#8217s growing tourist trade. We simply cannot allow CalMac to continue to make the same errors every year without consequences.On another subject, I have been unimpressed with our local roads department management\u0026#8217s sluggish response to a large number of complaints from local residents and myself about the plague of potholes scattered across Islay.There are many roads across Islay that have some potholes marked to be filled while others remain unmarked despite them in many cases being side by side. This scattershot approach to pothole repairs is as random as it is ineffective.In the future we will need to see a more long term resurfacing solution to our local roads with less short term, random and piecemeal patchwork.Cllr Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,In the run up to National Volunteering Week (June 1- 7), Cats Protection would like to extend our thanks to the many thousands of volunteers throughout the country who offer their time and expertise to help cats and kittens across the UK.In 2017, our 10,200-strong volunteer network contributed an incredible 5.5 million hours, each volunteer gifting a wealth of expertise and immeasurable passion to the charity. Their dedication enabled Cats Protection to help around 200,000 cats and kittens nationwide.Cats Protection is always on the lookout for new volunteers to join the UK’s biggest cat community. Though a large part of our work is helping cats, through fostering and rehoming, our volunteers have the opportunity to become involved with a range of interesting activities such as organising fundraising events, helping with publicity or managing funds and resources to benefit the greatest amount of cats.Volunteering can offer the chance to develop skills such as time management, interpersonal skills and teamwork, making CVs much more attractive and, of course, helping cats.Anyone who is interested in becoming a volunteer can go to our website www.cats.org.uk/get- involved/volunteering  to find out more.Julie Meredith, head of volunteering development, Cats Protection,Sir,I really love being active, especially the feeling after and that’s why I’m supporting Bowel Cancer UK and Beating Bowel Cancer’s latest fundraising campaign to get sponsored to do 30 minutes of physical activity for 30 days in June.Step up for 30 is a fantastic way for you to be more physically active to reduce your risk of bowel cancer – the UK’s second biggest cancer killer. This can be anything from yoga, walking in the sunshine (I walk everywhere) or taking your favourite class at the gym.While you’re getting fitter and feeling healthier, you’ll be raising money to fund the highest quality research and essential information and support services that will save lives from bowel cancer.Take on the challenge and sign up at bowelcanceruk.org.uk/stepupfor30.Gaby Roslin, TV and radio presenterPICS:The common gull has been seen nesting at the disused oil depot. no_a21Gleanergull01Gulls at the former Gleaner site. no_a21Gleanergull02\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"lochgilphead kids get kitted out","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 30/05/18, 5:11 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowLochgilphead Soccer Centre is delighted to have taken delivery of a quality rain jacket for each of the kids associated with the centre and Red Star YFC.That’s 120 rain jackets in total.As well as making sure the kids look smart and feel part of the club they will also help keep them dry and warm when the weather is a bit wet and windy.The rain jackets have been sponsored by Mid Argyll Youth Development Services (MAYDS) and the Soccer Centre would like to say a huge thank you to MAYDS for this sponsorship and ongoing support.Five teams from Lochgilphead travelled to the Oban Football Festival on a Saturday April 28.

Children from Ballantrae Primary are set to relocate to Girvan Primary following a major fire at the village school yesterday evening. It is believed that around 30 firefighters were called to the blaze at 8.38pm on Monday.  The fire – contained within the main school building – caused extensive damage to the existing classroom and early years provision at the school. A new extension, which is currently under construction, was unaffected. Fifty-eight P1-P7 children are expected to make the move to Girvan Primary from Thursday, June 7, once suitable arrangements are in place to transport pupils and staff.  Plans are also underway to relocate the 13 early years children to Ballantrae Community Centre, keeping them within the local community. The intention is to introduce the changes for the early years centre from Monday, June 11 however, this will be subject to finalising arrangements with both Ballantrae Community Association and the Care Inspectorate, who will need to register the centre before it can be used. A drop-in session will be held at Ballantrae Community Centre between 4pm-6pm tomorrow (Wednesday) to update parents/carers and to give them the opportunity to ask any questions they may have. Councillor William Grant, South Ayrshire Council’s Portfolio Holder for Lifelong Learning, said: “This is a really sad end to the school year at Ballantrae Primary and I know it will have affected everyone in this tight-knit community. “I’m pleased we have been able to move so quickly to put alternative arrangements in place for children and staff, keeping the loss of education time to an absolute minimum, which is a positive outcome.  “And my thanks to everyone involved in achieving this, especially colleagues at Girvan Primary and Ballantrae Community Centre. “At this time it’s too early for us to have a clear picture of the extent of the damage to the school building and the work that will be involved to bring it back into use. “However, there’s no doubt interim education arrangements will need to run well into the new school year and it could be many months before pupils can return. “Our priority will be to maintain quality learning and teaching for our children during this time and that’s what we will focus on.” Ballantrae Primary’s Head Teacher, Yvonne Templeton, added: “We’re all devastated by what’s happened and really can’t believe it. “Our school is very much at the heart of the community in Ballantrae and I know this will have an impact on everyone not just within the school, but right across our village. “However, we can all be grateful that no one was hurt in the fire. “My focus will be on supporting our children, staff, parents and carers while we’re decanted from the school we know and love, but I know we’ll take the spirit and ethos of Ballantrae Primary wherever we are.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article12651122.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/emp_ayp_310518bella_03JPG.jpg","title":"bella mani boss claims beauty","story":"NewsBella Mani boss claims beauty empire is safe despite tax collectors swooping inBella Mani - Italian for beautiful hands - has operations in Ayr and Prestwick.

Bella Mani - Italian for beautiful hands - has operations in Ayr and Prestwick. But the large salon in Irvine’s Rivergate mall has been shut. However boss Nigel Howard,47, of Alloway, insists the workforce is safe despite a formal winding up notice. He’s a former Ayr United centre half star who played more than 50 games for the club between 1991 and 94. A petition lodged at Ayr Sheriff Court on behalf of Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs wants Bella Mani Salons (Ayr \u0026amp Irvine) Ltd wound up by the court. They also want a liquidator put in place and any parties claiming an interest in the action must get it touch by this Thursday. There are eight branches , some run by differently named companies. Bella Mani Salons (Ayr and Irvine) was launched five years ago with a registered address at the Prestwick Main Street Salon. Bella Mani Salons (Prestwick) has Gabriella Howard as the sole director. The firm has been a salon of the year at the Scottish Hair and Beauty Awards and INAA make-up artisit of the year.  Bella Mani Salons (Kilmarnock) was dissolved last June and Bella Mani Salons (Motherwell) went the same way ten weeks ago. Both these firms had a registered address at the Howard home in Alloway. Nigel is listed as the sole active director of the Ayr\u0026ampIrvine firm, his wife Victoria resigned as a director in 2013, just nine months after the company was incorporated. But on Monday Nigel would not say how much tax HMRC is looking for and that it was “complicated and being contested.” He said: “Staff have been worried but I have assured them everything is fine. This is a dormant company that does not affect day to day running. The Irvine salon is shut and we are moving to a smaller one in the High Street. “I think this is a positive story and we work very hard to keep a total of 64 staff in jobs.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"drive through coffee shop petrol","story":"NewsDrive-through coffee shop and petrol pumps could be built on busy main roadThe ‘Highway Services’ would be located at Bogend Toll near Symington and could create 30 jobs.\u0026nbspShareBySarah Hilley14:45, 6 JUN 2018NewsA77 near Dutch House Roundabout (Image: Alister Firth/Ayrshire Post)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA drive-through coffee shop and petrol pumps are to be built on the A77 if plans get the green light. The ‘Highway Services’ would be located at Bogend Toll near Symington and could create 30 jobs. A Shell petrol station and Londis shop are part of the vision for the site. A raft of documents have been lodged with South Ayrshire Council as part of a planning application. London-based Grove Garages is behind the proposal, which would see two buildings erected.   The company has an agreement with Shell and Londis but is still in talks to sign-up a coffee firm.  The plan includes eight fuel pumps, 11 parking spaces, two car wash bays and pumps for HGVs.  The coffee shop would have a floor space of 260sqm with 29 car spaces and a drive through at the back. A supporting statement said: “The location of the site represents an ideal opportunity for a roadside servies area to cater for the frequent tourist, haulage and commuter traffic using the A77. It said the development would ensure the “reuse of a visually and environmentally poor site in a prominent location alongside one of Scotland’s main tourist routes, the A77.”  The site used to be a field belonging to Dyke Farm. Access to the site would be from the B730 adjoining the A77 north bound carriageway. Cars could enter from the southbound carriageway through the existing flyover. Chargers would also be available for electric cars. A design and access statement said: “The proposals give back purpose to an unused site, which has potential to provide an important service to the local area and indeed the wider area. The design proposals are considered to be respectful to the local environment and are in line with local policy and guidelines. No decision has been made on the application yet.

The Gym Group, which runs more than 120 outlets across the UK, is scheduled to open a 15,000sq ft unit in the early part of 2019. It comes just a week after fellow new investors, Wren Kitchens, announced their intention to take up residence in the park later this year. Heathfield, a 190,000sq ft park, is to lose more than a third of its live trading space in the coming months as names such as Homebase, Carpetright and Maplin bow out. But Alistair Dickie, of the park’s development firm Ediston Properties, insists the quick capture of new tenants has proved there remains plenty of potential for the future. He said: “We are losing something like 72,000sq ft of trading space owing to retailer failures and consolidation in the marketplace. “It goes without saying that is a lot to deal with, but our park – and Ayr as a destination in general – is very resilient. “Interest in the site from new names has not slowed and the acquisition of both Wren and the Gym Group is testament to that. “Since we acquired the park, we have carried out 11 new lettings and the arrival of Wren and the Gym Group takes that to 13. “That proves we are continuing to move in the right direction and our faith in the park remains as strong as ever.”  Ediston, who bought Heathfield in 2011 in a deal worth \u0026pound31.8 million, have attracted big names like M\u0026ampS, Costa and DFS to the site in the intervening years. And Mr Dickie says further investment is to follow as the park looks to rally from this year’s trading setbacks. He added: “We have plans in place to spend a further \u0026pound2 million in September of this year “And moving forward, we have a strong business plan to ensure the prosperity of the park and its future. “I fully believe we are now through the worst of what has been a turbulent spell.” The Gym Group, founded in 2008 by former English squash player John Treharne, operates one other Ayrshire branch in Kilmarnock. It follows a \u0026pound500,000 investment when it took over a Lifestyle Fitness outlet at the Queen’s Drive retail park.

The prolific striker turned down Premiership riches and clubs in England to agree a one-year contract at Somerset Park on Tuesday. Shankland, 22, told the Ayrshire Post: “It’s a great club to be a part of. The main thing for this decision is that I am enjoying my football. The gaffer has been great with me and that’s why I came here. He gave me a chance to get back into football. I am happy and I don’t think there’s any amount of money that beats happiness. The fans have taken to me and that gives you confidence going into every game you play. Shankland smashed 29 goals en route to being named League One\u0027s player of the year as Ayr won the title.  Boss Ian McCall said: Lawrence could have doubled his money elsewhere and had offers from the Premiership up here and League One down in England. But the affection he has had from our supporters has played a huge part in his decision. It’s a huge piece of business for this club. Be in no doubt that Lawrence could easily have gone, but he has made a footballing decision. It is a big, big signing which shows our intent and now we need the fans to respond with an upsurge in season ticket sales.

The pair lost touch over the years but were reunited six years ago. Kim said: “We started chatting as friends but it became apparent the spark was definitely still there between us and a few months later we moved in together. “It was a whirlwind romance - within a year of meeting we had moved in together, got engaged and had a beautiful baby boy.  “We then had another baby in 2016 and it was then we decided to start planning the wedding.” The couple tied the knot at The Vu in Bathgate on Mother’s Day, March 11 this year. Kim said: “We were a bit panicky about the weather as the week before the wedding was storm Edna and everyone was snowed in. “There was still some snow lying around on the wedding day but the sun was shining. “The wedding day was an emotional day from start to finish it was full of tears and laughter and genuinely was the best day of our lives!” The bride wore a Maggie Sottero ‘Lisette’ dress from Opus Couture in West Kilbride, as well as veil and hair piece. The kilts were from MacGregor \u0026amp MacDuff in Prestwick.  The couple’s wedding party consisted of flowergirls - Daughters, Macie O’Donnell and Evie McLauchlan and bride’s sister Molly Miller Page boys were son, Alfie McLauchlan and bride’s brother Jack Miller and the best man was Groom’s brother-in-law, Richard Hunter. Kim continued: “We haven’t managed to get away on a honeymoon yet as we have three children so picking a destination has been quite difficult! “We do plan on going somewhere we just haven’t decided where yet.” KSG Photography captured the couple’s big day, leaving them with beautiful photos to look back on.

But the iconic pile will remain under Malaysian control, after a deal was struck to keep it in South East Asian hands. It follows a purchase of the building by “experienced hoteliers” for an undisclosed fee from countryman, Eng Huat Ung. Student flats and offices are among development plans in the pipeline, the Post has learned. Now bosses are seeking talks with South Ayrshire Council, who in March slapped a Dangerous Building Notice on the site.  Structural engineers are being lined up to tackle the hotel, which has fallen into a state of disrepair in recent years. A source close to the deal said: “You can be rest assured that the new owners are keen to redevelop this building and put it to good use as soon as possible.” Mr Ung snapped up the property in a \u0026pound750,000 deal back in 2010. But attempts to keep it afloat as a hotel quickly failed and two Dangerous Building notices have followed. Bosses at Network Rail, who run the town’s train station underneath, have also grown increasingly concerned for the impact on their platforms. We revealed how a rat infestation was among the ongoing problems uncovered.  And council chiefs warned that a “wake-up call” was needed after issuing their March order on the building. Another source linked to the buy-out added: “The hotel has been in desperate need of a new direction for many years now. “This new investment should be welcomed by all in the town of Ayr and hopefully it signals the start of a much brighter future for a grand building.” A council spokesman said: “We understand the building has been bought but at this stage we have had no official confirmation. “We’ll continue to talk to the owners to ensure the building is kept in a good state of general repair.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"south ayrshire council bosses urged","story":"NewsSouth Ayrshire Council bosses urged to throw Ayr United a title partyCalls are mounting for civic head, Helen Moonie, to hold a bash at County Buildings, following Ayr’s first league title in 21 years.\u0026nbspShareByStuart Wilson12:11, 9 MAY 2018NewsAyr United title celebrations (Image: SNS Group)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailCouncil bosses have been urged to throw Ayr United’s champions an official party. Calls are mounting for civic head, Helen Moonie, to hold a bash at County Buildings, following Ayr’s first league title in 21 years. But the request could be snubbed in favour of a joint sporting celebration, the Post understands. A request for the engagement, lodged in the aftermath of Ayr’s success, is being considered by officials. Former cop Alasdair Malcolm, now a volunteer at Somerset Park, has called for the recognition. He said: “Every effort should be made to mark this fantastic achievement. “Ayr United are an integral part of the local community and, particularly through their Academy programme, have close working relationships throughout local schools and community groups. “The club, which has been a feature of the town since 1910, have had an outstanding season.” Ayr became the first club in the UK to score 100 goals in domestic competition en route to their title.  And their championship was the first to be clinched on home soil for 90 years. Mr Malcolm, secretary of the Ayrshire Golf Association, said: “It would be fitting if the local authority, by way of a civic reception or similar event, would mark the achievement of the management, players, officials and staff.” South Ayrshire Tory leader, Martin Dowey, added: “It is a wonderful achievement and one that is worthy of a civic reception. “A prosperous Ayr United is good for the town and we will be calling on all councillors to recognise the title win.” However, it’s believed there may be other invites on the guest list of any civic celebration. Carrick Rugby Club, three-time winners of the BT National Shield, and Commonwealth gold medallist Paul Foster, are among those in their thoughts. A council spokesman said: “A request has been received and will be considered in line with our civic hospitality guidelines.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"thousands pounds pocketed council after","story":"NewsThousands of pounds pocketed by council after secret VAT grabBut they’ve been caught out by golfers incensed South Ayrshire Council has not passed on any benefit of a government zero VAT ruling on leisure.\u0026nbspShareByStephen Houston14:18, 6 JUN 2018NewsCouncillor Peter Convery brands move on VAT “sleekit”\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThousands of pounds is being pocketed by a council after a secret VAT grab. But they’ve been caught out by golfers incensed South Ayrshire Council has not passed on any benefit of a government zero VAT ruling on leisure. In February HMRC announced there was to be no VAT on council provided leisure activities. And that will include swimming, gym use and bowling at Northfield. But South Ayrshire Council has not let any of its customers know. If effectively means golf charges have soared 24% on last year, rather than the 2.7% the council have boasted about. It means that golfers paying the \u0026pound429 season ticket price would be expecting a \u0026pound71.50 reduction for VAT.  Tory councillor Peter Convery is blasting the move as “sleekit.” And he said: “Surely people are entitled to get some money paid back to them? “This is about principle and this is sleekit. “This is peoples’ money and should never have been included in the original ticket charge. “It is very unfortunate the council cannot see this to any great extent.” In East Ayrshire, where leisure is provided by an arm’s length trust, VAT is necessary on charges. Details of the VAT grab emerged in an email between a golfer and Councillor Brian McGinley.  The golfer, who preferred to remain anonymous, said: “I do not think the majority of season ticket holders will be enamoured to discover that a significant element of their season ticket fee is actually related to a cost that SAC no longer have to bear.” Ayr East councillor McGinley said in the email: “I have ascertained that VAT has been included within the price of a season ticket up until February 18 this year. “Following a court ruling against HMRC whereby sports services provided by local authorities are now classed as exempt for VAT purposes, VAT is no longer remitted to HMRC when income is received for season tickets etc.” A council spokesman would not explain why they had not revealed the VAT windfall, if players can expect a refund or whether is was just being used to mask a huge leap in prices.  He would only say: “We work hard to ensure our golf and leisure provision continues to offer great value for local people and visitors and this is reflected in our current charging structure. “The funding from entry fees and season tickets only makes a partial contribution to our overall operating costs – with the remainder coming directly from Council subsidy – and the 2.7% price increase on last year’s fees reflects the Consumer Price Index. “Reducing inequalities within our communities is a key commitment for the Council and we have extended the concessions available under the Access to Leisure card scheme – which includes a 15% discount for all South Ayrshire residents. The change in VAT application for Council leisure services contributes towards the costs of that important scheme, which will help improve health and wellbeing across South Ayrshire, as well as helping reduce the net deficit cost of running Council leisure services, which was almost \u0026pound11 million in 2016/17.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"troon church mulling over decision","story":"NewsTroon church mulling over decision to allow gay couples to marryThe congregation at St Ninian’s are having time out to pray and think before revisiting the decision.\u0026nbspShareBySarah Hilley15:25, 5 JUN 2018NewsRev Tom Montgomery (Image: Ayrshire Post)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA church is deciding whether to allow gay couples to get married in Troon. The congregation at St Ninian’s are having time out to pray and think before revisiting the decision. The vestry have split views on whether the Bentinck Drive Episcopal Church should give same-gender couples the blessing to walk up the aisle. The Rev Canon Tom Montgomery said: “Jesus was radically inclusive.” Speaking to the Post, he said: “I believe the Lord Jesus would welcome same-gender attracted people and would want them to be happy. Jesus has unconditional love for us all. “I have worked with same-gender attracted people who have had their hearts broken because they can’t express their love openly.” He said it is about “promoting and encouraging respect of all people”. The rector asked for the views of the vestry at a dedicated meeting, where he said there was a “diversity of views” among the congregation.  He added: “At the moment we are praying through the decision of the General Synod and are continuing to seek the guidance of the Holy Spirit.  “There is a wide spectrum of opinion.”   Rev Canon Montgomery would have to get authorisation from the bishop and the Registrar General of Scotland before conducting the marriages. The Scottish Episcopal Church voted to allow same-sex marriage in the church if clergy opt in. Reverend Montgomery said some are all for it while others are reticent because of their upbringing and the Bible’s teachings.  He said: “In the Bible there is no mention in the Gospel about same-gender attraction.”  But he said same-sex relationships are mentioned in a letter of St Paul and the Old Testament’s Book of Leviticus.

This must have been a favoured site well-placed beside a coaching inn on the main road North.\nThe 1860s saw the further development of the railways begun five years previously.\nBefore this Peebles lived up to its reputation of being, \u0026ldquoAs quiet as the grave or as Peebles. With the railways came industry and people and money.\nCommercial Peebles began to develop and the Northgate was no exception. Up until then the Northgate was little more than the road out of town with several pastoral tofts strung out along it. Laird Girdwood, was a larger-than-life character and also one of the prominent proprietors. He was also a member of the Peeblesshire Rifle Volunteers.\nThen as now, such organisations accommodate a little social networking.\nIt is not surprising then that Charles Ker, also a Volunteer and his sister acquired one of these tofts from a comrade. Meanwhile James Ker lived with his wife at Red Lion House in Biggiesknowe. Their toft was more than half an acre in size with a barn whose gable end faced the street and a single-storey cottage attached. Parts of the barn were rebuilt\ninto a new dwelling house.\nThe barn itself is not without interest being the one scene of Laird Girdwood\u0026rsquos Venison Feast to which all the residents of the Northgate were invited everyone, however, to bring his own beverage.\nIt was a resounding success\u0026mdash\u0026ldquoNever before did the rafters ring with such glee. was the reported account of the event.\nA traditional forge and a modern purpose-built engineering workshop were built as well as a \u0026lsquospec\u0026rsquo tenement of four dwellings.\nWrought iron work was much in evidence, with a large garden behind and a rustic rockery at the front of the property. It was then given the name \u0026lsquoKer Place\u0026rsquo after the fashion of the time for such businessmen of which there are several examples in Peebles.\nThe cottage (pre 1823), which is still in place, became part of the enterprise and judging by the size of the lathe bed and fire-scorched rafters some serious work went on there.\nIt also incorporated James Ker\u0026rsquos dispensary for his veterinary work. James had been a student of William Dick at his Edinburgh Veterinary College which he had established at his father\u0026rsquos forge in Clyde Street in Edinburgh where the bus station now stands.\nHe obtained his diploma to practice as a veterinary surgeon and was also made a Fellow of the Edinburgh Medical Veterinary Society for his \u0026ldquovaluable contribution to veterinary science. This may have been in connection with a product he sold commercially as \u0026lsquoKer\u0026rsquos Alterative Sheep Pill\u0026rsquo.\nIt must have been effective since it was still being sold in the 1930s by his son, John Ker. He, also a blacksmith, had qualified as a veterinary surgeon nearly forty years after his father at what was by then called the Royal \u0026ldquoDick Veterinary College.\nJames and his wife died at a young age and his brother and sister, Charles and Elizabeth, carried on the business successfully as well as raising James\u0026rsquos family of two boys.\nJohn Ker, as said, served his apprenticeship as a blacksmith and also qualified as a veterinary surgeon. About 1916 the smiddy closed when the farriers went to war.\nJohn Ker served as a captain with the Royal Army Veterinary Corps and on his return practiced locally as a veterinary surgeon until he died after a short illness towards the end of 1938.

held at Hove Lawns yesterday, has been branded a \"shocking experience\" by\u0026nbspguests, with some saying they counted no more than two cheese stalls.  Several social media users said they left the festival feeling cheesed off and are now calling for a full refund.  Charlotte Bliss, from Eastbourne, said: \"The cooked cheese items also amounted to no more than three stalls with huge queues.\u0026nbsp  \"I am appalled that this was allowed to be called a cheese festival.\u0026nbsp  \"I also purchased another ticket at the gate.  \"I will never attend another event like this in Brighton.\"  In an email to the event\u0027s organisers seen by The Argus, another guest, Flora Adam, said: \"I attended the event this afternoon and am extremely disappointed.  \"The event was in no way as advertised and had very little stands compared to what was promised.  \"Only a few hot foot stands (far from the 30-35 advertised) with no raclette cheese or fondue as detailed in your numerous Facebook promotions.  \"Stands were unprepared for the event and after queuing for 45 minutes we were told that halloumi fries were unavailable at about 2.30pm.  \"The gouda stand was running out of cheese as we left at 3pm.  \"Again, nothing as advertised and well overpriced at \u0026pound44 for two people.  \"I believe trading standards in this instance haven\u0027t been met and request a full refund.\"  Facebook groups have even been set up criticising the event, including one titled The Big Cheese Festival was a Load of Rubbish.  Organisers posted the following message on Facebook: \"Firstly, we would like to thank the thousands who attended The Big Cheese Festival today and who congaed their way around the Main Stage Tent, creating that incredible Festival Atmosphere.  \"We would like to express our sympathy toward some of our amazing cheese and cheesey Street Food Traders who were traveling to the city from across the country, and who due to adverse weather conditions and impassable roads, were unfortunately forced to abort their journeys today.  \"Sadly due to this, a few compromises had to be made and we are disappointed that a larger variety of cheese wasn\u0026rsquot available.  \"Despite this, our cheese traders who were able to attend showed amazing dedication throughout the event, and did not fail to deliver, with food available right to the end.  \"We would like to offer everyone who purchased a ticket 50 per cent discount to next years event.  \"All feedback will be taken on board, please email info@thebigcheesefestival.\"  Did you attend the festival?

Six-year-old Maisie, who plays the main character, Libby, in the film, in what was her first ever acting role, was accompanied to the glitzy ceremony in Los Angeles by her mother Elizabeth, co-star and writer Rachel Shenton, and the short film\u0026rsquos director Chris Overton.  And while a little young to be enjoying a champagne celebration, Maisie will be returning to her Upper Stratton home as one of the youngest actors to have starred in an Oscar-winning film.      THE. SILENT. CHILD. HAS. WON. AN. OSCAR.    I genuinely don\u0026rsquot know what to do now. #Oscar2018 pic.twitter/lfXWlFBCj9  The Silent Child beat four contenders to the award: DeKalb Elementary, The Eleven O\u0026rsquoClock,\u0026nbspMy Nephew Emmett and Watu Wote/All of Us.  The Silent Child follows Libby, a profoundly deaf child born to a hearing family who struggle to communicate with their daughter.  As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.  She was inspired to do so by her experiences with her father, who became deaf following chemotherapy when she was 12.  The film was directed by Rachel\u0026rsquos fianc\u0026eacute Chris Overton, with a \u0026pound10,000 crowdfunded budget.  Maisie earned her role following a nationwide search, during which over 100 children auditioned for the part.  After filming, a surprise screening of The Silent Child was organised by Rachel at Maisie\u0026rsquos school, Red Oaks Primary, in August.  Maisie then flew with her proud parents, Elizabeth, who is also deaf,\u0026nbspand Gilson, who is partially deaf, to the film\u0026rsquos international premiere in Rhode Island \u0026ndash her first visit to the US, and her first time on a plane.  The film was given its first public screening in Swindon last month at the Swindon Arts Centre. Gilson, who spoke before and after the showing, said: \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a great pleasure to be able to finally show this in Swindon.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a film to be appreciated, and to spread a message. Let people know what you\u0026rsquove seen and the emotions you\u0026rsquove felt.      \"Millions of children all over the world live in silence.\"    \u0027The Silent Child\u0027 screenwriter and star Rachel Shenton signed her #Oscars acceptance speech for Best Live Action Short Film. https://t.co/t3Dtf4Uy3c pic.twitter/PYB0M7gRNs"},{"url":null,"title":"IN PICS  East Lothian in the sun","story":"              THE sunshine has inspired East Lothian Courier Camera Club members to capture some stunning images this month.

Rockers Altered Sky are fulfilling their ambition of playing at Download Festival, Britain\u0026rsquos premier hard rock and heavy metal festival, on Thursday, June 7, with plans for a UK summer tour also set to be announced in the coming weeks.  The band, which includes Haddington\u0026rsquos Ana Nowosielska and Amy Blair, will be the main support in the Doghouse Tent, with the gig taking place the day before the main festival gets under way.  Ana, the band\u0026rsquos lead singer, was excited \u0026ldquobeyond words ahead of the festival, which is celebrating its 16th year.  She said: \u0026ldquoIt is up there with a childhood dream.  \u0026ldquoYou would go to Download and see Slipknot and Metallica and we are going to be playing there as well.  \u0026ldquoIt is absolutely amazing.  The band is looking at hiring a van and staying for the four-day festival at Donington Park, which this year is headlined by Avenged Sevenfold, Guns N\u0026rsquo Roses and Ozzy Osbourne.  Ana added: \u0026ldquoDownload is definitely one of our goals.  \u0026ldquoIt is one of the biggest music festivals in the UK, especially for our type of music.  \u0026ldquoIt is very much suited to where we want to be.  Currently the band\u0026rsquos attention is focused on creating their second album, the follow-up to Without Wonderland.  The five-piece will soon head down to Wales to record the album, with a view to it being released in the New Year.  Ana, 28, said: \u0026ldquoEverything has been a lot easier this time.  \u0026ldquoWe were joking the other day and saying we had a good five years to write the first album and now we have had six months to write the second album.  \u0026ldquoThe difference is we are definitely going to see that the album is going to stand by itself.  The band are then hoping to get back on the open road, with a UK tour being organised and the band keen to venture further afield again.  Last autumn, the band enjoyed a 19-date tour which saw them performing in the Philippines and Japan.  Ana told the Courier: \u0026ldquoWe are obviously talking about going back to Asia again. We met so many good people and made so many wonderful relationships.  \u0026ldquoWe would like to tour Europe \u0026ndash hit up Germany and we had an Italian tour in the works a year ago which fell through.  \u0026ldquoThen, of course, we would like to get over to the USA.  Ana grew up on Haddington\u0026rsquos Alderston Meadow and met drummer Amy, who lived on the town\u0026rsquos Long Cram and attended Knox Academy, during a night out in the town\u0026rsquos Mercat Hotel.  The band is completed by Ross Archibald, Ryan Zdrojewski and Tara Behran.

Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard MSP last week met East Lothian Labour Party campaigners at Holyrood as they delivered a petition signed by more than 1,000 people to Kevin Stewart MSP.  While Councillor Lachlan Bruce, ward member for Preston, Seton, Gosford was joined by South of Scotland MSP Michelle Ballantyne, both Conservative, as they sent letters to Mr Stewart calling for the same action (see image inset).  The campaign comes after the minister called in a planning application by Inch Cape Offshore Ltd (ICOL) to build a substation \u0026ndash which would bring energy ashore from a planned offshore wind farm \u0026ndash on a large section of the site, which was recently purchased by East Lothian Council from ScottishPower.  That sparked cross-party condemnation from county politicians, who fear it could jeopardise local plans to create jobs and boost the economy on the site.  Mr Leonard added his signature to the Hands Off Cockenzie petition before it was submitted.  Iain Gray (Lab), East Lothian MSP said: \u0026ldquoMinisters claim the call-in is because the site is of national importance, but even the leader of the SNP Group on East Lothian Council has condemned the decision as unnecessary.  \u0026ldquoBy signing our petition in such large numbers, local people have sent a clear message they want East Lothian to decide on decisions about the future of the site.  Meanwhile, Mr Bruce said he had asked Mr Stewart to send the decision back to the council. He said: \u0026ldquoI think it is only right that this decision is made locally by the council on behalf of local residents. The people who are affected most are local residents and it is the people they elected, not a Government minister from Aberdeen, who should be making the decision.  A Scottish Government spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoThe reporter will ensure that the local development plan and the community\u0026rsquos views are taken into account prior to making a recommendation to ministers, who will make the final decision."},{"url":null,"title":"LOOKING BACK  Remembering the first ever Haddington Festival","story":"              HADDINGTON Festival is celebrating its golden anniversary at the moment, with the event having put a smile on thousands of faces since 1968.

Persimmon Homes is hoping to get the go-ahead \u0026ldquoin principle from East Lothian Council for the mixed-use development, which includes a commercial hub with hotel, retail facilities and cafe/restaurant.  Community facilities such as a residential neighbourhood centre, playing fields, changing facilities and public parks are proposed.  Also planned is the construction of a grade-separated junction on the A1, roads and foot/cycle paths, as well as improvement to the Musselburgh rail halt.  Submission of the planning application in principle follows a Proposal of Application Notice and public consultation exercise for the major scheme, which included an exhibition on the draft masterplan at The Brunton last year.  A planning statement from Holder Planning, acting for Persimmon, read: \u0026ldquoThe application site is allocated for the mixed use development proposed in the soon-to-be adopted East Lothian Local Development Plan.  \u0026ldquoThe proposed development will deliver 1,500 homes across the site. These homes will comprise a range of housing types. Twenty-five per cent of the housing provision will be affordable as defined by the council.  \u0026ldquoA primary school is proposed that will accommodate the requirements arising from residential development on the wider site. It is located centrally in the application site within walking distance of new homes via a network of paths that offer safe and convenient links. The detailed design will be in accordance with the requirements of the education authority, East Lothian Council.  \u0026ldquoThe masterplan proposes enhancing a pedestrian link under the A1 that will link the site areas together, allowing new neighbourhoods and services to the west, identified in the wider masterplan, to gain access to Musselburgh Station and services in Musselburgh.  \u0026ldquoThe proposal incorporates a significant network of multi-functional open spaces and semi-natural landscape areas, including allotments/community growing space, natural play areas, sports pitches and outdoor gym facilities, and seating. This framework of green space will contribute to the legibility of the neighbourhood\u0026rsquos spatial pattern, establishing distinct areas of new housing linked together via a network of green foot and cycle routes.  A new research and innovation quarter for East Lothian offering more than 20 hectares of new commercial space is proposed.  The planning statement added: \u0026ldquoWith strong links to the adjacent Queen Margaret University, the site offers the potential to build upon the reputation of Edinburgh and the Lothians for its research and innovation.  Barry Turner, spokesman for Musselburgh Conservation Society, said: \u0026ldquoThe issue at Craighall is that major development here will be very close to major development in Edinburgh at Newcraighall and in Midlothian at Shawfair, turning the whole area into a cross-boundary urban sprawl and effectively an extension to Edinburgh\u0026rsquos built-up area.  Predicting that the plan for 1,500 houses would be approved, given that was the number in the Local Development Plan, he added: \u0026ldquoAll that we can hope for is that conditions will be put in place to make this amount of housing as acceptable as possible in terms of layout, design, amenities and access to walking and cycling routes and to public transport.  \u0026ldquoOf note is that the secondary-age children here will have to get to Musselburgh Grammar School, which is some distance away and not an easy walk, certainly not from the other side of the A1.  \u0026ldquoThe recently promoted Active Travel Network shows no cycle link to Musselburgh Grammar School. We are worried about the prospect of increased car usage to get kids to and from school thus adding to the gradually worsening traffic problems in the town.  Jim Kirkpatrick, managing director of Persimmon Homes East Scotland, said: \u0026ldquoWe have had extensive engagement with East Lothian Council and the local community prior to the application being lodged and have generally been encouraged by the positive response to our masterplan.  \u0026ldquoThe comments of Musselburgh Conservation Society are noted and we believe the issues raised are addressed in the suite of information provided to the council.  \u0026ldquoThe application is fully compliant with the proposals contained within the emerging East Lothian Local Development Plan and we look forward to working with officers and other stakeholders during the determination process."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7864264.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"SEPA water quality report  how clean is the water at your beach ","story":"              A MUSSELBURGH beach has been branded \u0026lsquopoor\u0026rsquo for its water quality in a report by the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA).

Plans put forward by Dears Pharmacy were turned down by Lothian Health Board at a meeting last month.  A three-person Pharmacy Practices Committee (PPC) panel, chaired by East Lothian councillor Fiona O\u0026rsquoDonnell, unanimously refused the application.  The decision notice, published on NHS Lothian\u0026rsquos website, said that there were \u0026ldquono gaps in the existing provision of services within the neighbourhood as the other pharmacies in the area could provide the full range of pharmaceutical services.  For village residents, that means a trip to Gullane or Haddington.  The report adds: \u0026ldquoThe committee also noted that consultations by telephone were offered by one of the pharmacies in the area.  \u0026ldquoIt was also noted that extended hours provision was offered by Asda at The Jewel on the east side of Edinburgh, a distance of only 13 miles.  It also stated that there was a \u0026ldquohigh level of car ownership in the village and that public transport links were \u0026ldquogood, meaning residents could travel to other pharmacies.  However, the decision has been criticised by Dears Pharmacy and East Lothian MSP Iain Gray.  He said: \u0026ldquoI supported the application for a pharmacy, both because there is none in the village and because it could help keep the Post Office.  \u0026ldquoI was very disappointed with the decision to refuse it. I understand that there are laid-down criteria to be followed but in my view they must be wrong because they led to the wrong decision in this case.  \u0026ldquoI remain convinced that the people of Aberlady would benefit from a pharmacy without having to travel to Gullane, and have promised to support the application again if there is an appeal.  \u0026ldquoI will also be writing to the chief pharmacist and NHS Lothian about my concerns that the process is flawed.  Mahyar Nickkho-Amiry, operations director at Dears, confirmed to the Courier they would appeal the decision.  He described the decision as \u0026ldquoactive discrimination against village residents, adding: \u0026ldquoIt is a slap to the people of Aberlady. Because this is an affluent area, people are being forced to drive to Gullane or Haddington, whereas if the village was less affluent they would have stood more of a chance.  He said that had the proposals been approved, the pharmacy would have brought jobs to the village.  Donald Hay, chairman of Gullane Area Community Council, also criticised the decision.  He said: \u0026ldquoCommunity responses were not taken into account and the net result is the village could end up with no banking facilities, no Post Office and no pharmacy.  \u0026ldquoIt makes bleak reading for the village for the future.  The petition has gathered more than 700 signatures online since it was created.

Between April 1 last year and the end of March 2018, 2,006 three-day emergency food supplies were given to local people.  Excluding holidays and weekends, it means that, on average, between eight and 10 food parcels are handed out Monday to Friday by the charity.  The number of three-day emergency food supplies distributed rose by 12 per cent from the previous year.  The figure mirrors what is happening across the UK, which has shown a 13 per cent increase in food parcels given out.  In 2017-2018 benefit changes/delays accounted for 757 East Lothian cases with 1,666 people affected, including 617 children. In addition, 595 cases were referred for emergency food due to being refused a crisis grant, affecting 937 people, of which 253 were under the age of 16.  A total of 31,604 kilos of food was given out last year by the county\u0026rsquos foodbank, with 50,292kgs donated.  Peter Dicker, foodbank manager, said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquoll continue to provide vital support when it matters most \u0026ndash we\u0026rsquore dedicated to ensuring that people in our community with no money for food are able to access emergency support, and that has only been possible in the last year because of the incredible generosity shown by local people in donating food, time and funds.  East Lothian MSP Iain Gray condemned the figures, saying: \u0026ldquoThese shocking figures underline the fact that problems with changes to the benefits system have made a significant contribution to the rise in foodbank referrals.  \u0026ldquoGovernments at Holyrood and Westminster can no longer sit back and accept the ever increasing number of people being forced to use foodbanks.

As many as 1,600 homes \u0026ndash as well as business units, a supermarket, primary school and various green spaces \u0026ndash are planned for the former opencast mine site at Blindwells.  The first housebuilder is expected to be announced this summer, with work on housing getting under way potentially by the end of the year.  In the meantime, preparatory work has been carried out on the site, which is sandwiched between the A1 north of Tranent and the A198 south of Cockenzie and Port Seton.  Now Hargreaves, which is behind the proposals, is looking to create an access to the site off the roundabout to the north of the A1 at Bankton Junction.  Iain Slater, development and estates director, said the new exit would be permanent, although it would initially be limited to construction traffic.  Other works are planned for the junction, which links the A1 with the A198.  Mr Slater said: \u0026ldquoAs part of the permission the road layout will be altered to allow for the additional cars generated from the Blindwells development.  \u0026ldquoThese works include widening of the A198 approaching the roundabout to increase capacity [as well as] the installation of a filter lane to allow cars leaving the A1 heading east to go round to Tranent without stopping at the roundabout. There are also plans for traffic lights to assist with traffic flows should the need arise.  As many as 350 jobs could be created during the lengthy building period at the site.  Construction work on the 1,600 homes could take 12-15 years, with early plans already drawn up for a second phase further to the east which could see another 1,600 homes, as well as leisure space and a cemetery."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7870497.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Tranent singer Caitlyn Vanbeck  39 s first single takes charts by storm","story":"              TRANENT singer Caitlyn Vanbeck\u0026rsquos first single flew up the charts when it was released on Monday.

It read: \u0026ldquoThe result will be a modern, bright, accessible and customer-friendly store with a focus on quality.

John Muir Park has regularly been used by teenagers who are celebrating the end of their exams.

Andrew Yorkston parked his vehicle in a lay-by near to Drummohr Holiday Park and left the two youngsters in the back seat of the locked car for about 30 minutes on a hot summer\u0027s day.  The six-year-old girl and two-year-old boy were trapped in the locked vehicle and were only rescued after passers-by heard the traumatised girl banging on the car windows and screaming: \u0026ldquoHelp, save us.  The worried passers-by contacted the police and waited by the car to calm the kids before Yorkston eventually appeared, claiming he had \u0026ldquoonly been [away] five minutes and had been relieving himself.  The 27-year-old then drove away from the lay-by, leaving the police to launch a hunt for him and the two children.  On Tuesday, Edinburgh Sheriff Court heard that Yorkston was in charge of the children when he was taking them to a nearby McDonald\u0027s and stopped off unexpectedly at the lay-by near to Prestonpans on August 16 last year.  Fiscal depute Mark Keane told the court that the two-year-old boy and the six-year-old girl were spotted locked in the car at about 5.30pm.  Mr Keane said: \u0026ldquoWitnesses were out for a walk and they observed a stationary car in the lay-by and saw two children within the car who were very distressed.  \u0026ldquoThe six-year-old was shouting: \u0026lsquoHelp, save us.\u0026rsquo  The girl pointed to an opening in the trees and told the passers-by that the man looking after her was down there, the court heard.  The fiscal added that \u0026ldquothe car was locked and the windows were fully up and it was \u0026ldquoa hot day.  \u0026ldquoThe witnesses became concerned about the children\u0026rsquos welfare and decided to phone the police and stay with the car for about 25 minutes.  Solicitor Lesley Cunningham, defending, said that Yorkston, of North Grange Avenue, had stopped for a toilet break and his wife had been left \u0026ldquosuitably unimpressed by his actions.  Ms Cunningham said that her client had \u0026ldquoan underlying drug problem at the time of the incident which was \u0026ldquonow resolved.  The solicitor added: \u0026ldquoMr Yorkston was taking the children to a McDonald\u0027s and stopped by the side of the road for the toilet. He admits now this was foolish in the extreme.  \u0026ldquoFortunately there was no harm down to the children.  Sheriff Adrian Cottam deferred sentence to next month.  Yorkston admitted to being responsible for two children and wilfully abandoning them by leaving them alone within a locked vehicle while windows were fully closed in hot weather conditions at a lay-by on the B1361 near to Prestonpans on August 16 last year."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7806713.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"WHO admits mistaking Prestonpans for Preston on official pollution figures","story":"              THE World Health Organisation (WHO) has removed Prestonpans from its list of most polluted communities. . . after confirming that it had confused the East Lothian town with the English city of Preston!  There was widespread concern when the global monitor named Prestonpans as Scotland\u0026rsquos most polluted town in its latest breakdown of pollution figures earlier this month.  The annual list used readings taken from 2013 and named Prestonpans as the worst offender in Scotland.  WHO released a similar report two years ago which also named and shamed Prestonpans \u0026ndash yet it was thought then that the reported high pollution levels in the town related to the former Cockenzie Power Station, which had been operational until March 2013.  However, East Lothian Council told the Courier earlier this month that it believed the reading was actually down to a geographical error by WHO, claiming that the organisation had confused Prestonpans with Preston in Lancashire, nearly 200 miles away.  And this week, the WHO confirmed that this was indeed the case.  In an email to senior environmental health officials at the local authority, representatives of WHO confirmed that they had confused the two communities due to a computer mapping error.  They said: \u0026ldquoIt is true that there was a mislabel in the datum for Prestonpans, which should have been labelled as Preston.  \u0026ldquoThis error originated in the previous database release when reverse geocoding the coordinates from the EEA (European Economic Area).

Balmore Golf Club  Balmore Golf Club, set in the secluded rolling countryside of East Dunbartonshire\u0026nbspbetween Milngavie and Bishopbriggs, is probably the finest inland Scottish golf course you have yet to play. Central Scotland is blessed with many great courses, but they don\u0027t come any better than Balmore. A bold claim, but the club\u0026nbspare confident that once you play the perfectly manicured 18 holes designed by six-time British Open Champion Harry Vardon, you will agree\u0026nbsp- and be happy to tell others the same.    Founded in 1907, Balmore Golf Club has a proud history, but it has an even brighter future. Significant investments in facilities for the whole family such as a 6-hole Par 3 course with complimentary child membership and an extensive practice facility for keen golfers eager to perfect their game has uniquely positioned the club. It\u0027s a safe, family-friendly environment successfully attracting a new generation of members such as former Celtic and Scotland football star Kris Commons who joined during April\u0027s new member intake:  \"I\u0026rsquove played a lot of great golf courses in Scotland over the years,\" said Kris. \"But I decided to join Balmore Golf Club for two main reasons: the quality of the course itself, plus the stand-out practice facilities which are set up to cater to families. The real clincher was the massive practice area which has two full size greens with bunkers, a six-hole par 3 course, putting green and driving range. My two boys are really keen on golf, so having such an impressive practice facility that they can use to learn and enjoy the game is important. If you haven\u0026rsquot played Balmore yet, then I strongly recommend you give it a try \u0026ndash you won\u0026rsquot be disappointed.    Visit soon to judge for yourself!

The classic links holes, apart from the 1st, are the 5th, another par four with its fairway like an elephant\u0027s graveyard, the 10th, a clever dogleg par five and the 15th, a \"one shotter\" with real difficulty if the elusive green is missed from the tee.

However, for nearly a decade, the ground breaking arts company NVA seemed to have found new hope, and a future, for St Peter\u0027s Seminary in Cardross.  But now that future has been derailed, after the announcement that the company will close in September this year.  NVA, an acclaimed and innovative company led by creative director Angus Farquhar, will cease operations this year, months after losing out in the controversial Regular Funding decisions made by Creative Scotland, the arts funding body.  The closure of NVA: St Peter\u0027s saved from perdition, but cast back into limbo  Last night, the culture secretary, Fiona Hyslop, asked Historic Environment Scotland to study the former seminary, designed and built by the late Glasgow architects Andy MacMillan and Isi Metzstein in 1966, and report on its \"long term options.\"  Ms Hyslop said she would like the building to \"continue to fascinate and inspire the public\" and noted that she was \"very sad\" that NVA is to close, adding \"since its foundation 25 years ago, it has earned a reputation as one of the most innovative public arts companies.\"  The building, an impressive and foreboding modernist ruin in the Kilmahew woodland of Dunbartonshire, is A-listed, and the World Monument Fund has it scheduled as one of the world\u0027s most endangered cultural landmarks.  NVA staged the Hinterland project in the ruins in 2016, and this year have made a film with artist Rachel Maclean, but its long term \u0026pound11m project to transform the \"stablised ruins\" into a cultural centre and performance space is over.  Since 2013, NVA spent \u0026pound2.3m on the building, including removing hazardous waste and asbestos, the restoration of 80 vaults, improving paths, clearing away invasive plants, and woodland management in the 104 acre site.  Revealed: The Mackintosh design you chose for our print giveaway  The building still belongs to the Archdiocese of Glasgow, for which a spokesman said: \"We are sorry to learn of the closure of NVA and the subsequent impact on plans to secure and develop the former St Peter\u0026rsquos College at Cardross.  \"NVA were visionary in their hopes for the college site and it is a great shame that these hopes will not now be realised.  \"The Archdiocese will now consider its options and consider any proposal to develop the site in a way which will secure the architecture of the former college and benefit the local community.\"  NVA\u0027s other works include the Hidden Gardens at the Tramway in Glasgow, The Secret Sign in Finnich Glen, a show in Central Hotel in 1999, Grand Central, and The Path in Glen Lyon in 2000.  It also staged The Storr: Unfolding Landscapes on the Isle of Skye in 2005 and Speed of Light, initially commissioned as part of the UK\u0026rsquos 2012 Cultural Olympiad.  A board statement said: \"In September of last year the trustees of NVA made the difficult decision to withdraw from the capital project plans to rescue St Peter\u0026rsquos Seminary in Cardross, due to increasing risks, both financial and physical.  \"NVA\u0026rsquos original plan for St Peter\u0026rsquos was universally acknowledged as bold, with creative ambition at its heart.  \"It was also recognised as a high risk venture for a small independent arts organisation.  \"NVA has spent many years working with great passion and determination, with the support of the owners of the site, the Archdiocese of Glasgow, to save this iconic building for future generations.  \"We collaborated with public and private stakeholders, the local communities and an amazing design team.  \"Important work was done to begin to preserve and restore the building and to demonstrate the immense creative, intellectual and community potential of the site.\"  The closure of NVA: St Peter\u0027s saved from perdition, but cast back into limbo  However, it adds: \"Despite our best efforts we were unable to guarantee the viable future for the St Peter\u0026rsquos Seminary that we had imagined and hoped for. In the end, we had no choice but to bring the capital project to an end.\"  NVA said it has tried to develop an \"alternative proposal\" for the site, but this has not proved possible and \"has reinforced the many financial and structural challenges facing the company.\"  The board said that NVA is now \"not able to continue\".  A Creative Scotland spokeswoman said: \"NVA has been one of Scotland\u0026rsquos most creatively ambitious companies, producing ground-breaking work that has attracted national and international attention, including their ambitious plans for St. Peter\u0026rsquos Seminary.  \"We appreciate how difficult this decision has been for the Board and staff of NVA and will continue to offer support and advice to all those involved.\""},{"url":null,"title":"Young influencers in Edinburgh digital tourism push","story":"              ONLINE influencers are being recruited to help boost young traveller numbers to Edinburgh.

A survey by the Educational Institute of Scotland (EIS) found 58 per cent were \u0026ldquounlikely to endorse a career in teaching. Only two per cent would be \u0026ldquovery likely to do so.  The greatest concern was spiralling workload with 85 per cent saying it had increased in the past year - despite a pledge by John Swinney, the Education Secretary, to tackle the problem.  Read more: John Swinney\u0027s war on workload a long way from being won  Changes to the curriculum were seen as a key area of dissatisfaction while teacher shortages and stagnant pay were also highlighted.  The findings comes after a sustained period of upheaval in education with significant changes to the curriculum and associated exams.  Schools are finding it increasingly difficult to recruit staff in some subjects creating additional work for the remaining staff.  Concerns of individual teachers were also included in the EIS survey with one stating: \u0026ldquoThe curriculum becomes more cluttered every year ... everything taught at a rushed and superficial pace.  Another said: \u0026ldquoStaffing shortages have created a significant increase in workload.  Teachers said the fall in the number of support staff to deal with children with conditions such as autism and dyslexia was creating extra pressure.  Another said: \u0026ldquoWorkload has reached a point that it significantly impacts on my home life.  \u0026ldquoI have less time with my family and feel more stressed. I am so tired at the end of the school day and then have more work to do at home. It is depressing.  Read more: Workload blamed for teacher exodus  Larry Flanagan, general secretary of the EIS, described the survey results as \u0026ldquoworrying reading.  \u0026ldquoDespite statements from the Scottish Government, local authorities and national education bodies that promised action to tackle excessive levels of teacher workload, the results of our survey indicate little has improved and some difficulties actually seems to have grown worse, he said.  \u0026ldquoWe have frequently been told that meaningful pay rises are unaffordable, but that extra teachers are being employed and that workload is being tackled.  \u0026ldquoThese survey results confirm that teachers are seeing little improvement, and that severe pressure continues to be piled onto our overworked, undervalued and underpaid teachers.  Opposition parties blamed the Scottish Government for the concerns.  Iain Gray, education spokesman for Scottish Labour said: \u0026ldquoScotland has thousands fewer teachers since the SNP came to power, and with most professionals not recommending the job it could get even worse.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos time John Swinney restored teachers\u0026rsquo pay and gave our children the resources they need to succeed in school.

Food giant Heinz is set to ditch the famous name for the first time in 104 years claiming that as only 14 per cent of buyers actually used the gloopy white sauce on salads, the old name no longer reflects its modern purpose.  A spokesman for Heinz said that the name no longer \"fairly represents the product\u0027s ingredients or usage occasions.\"  Parent group Kraft Heinz said it was working with brand design specialists Jones Knowles Ritchie on overhauling one of Britain\u0027s longest running kitchen staples.  It would be the first name change for the product since its launch in 1914.    Fans of the traditional name went on social media to express their anger.  It is believed Heinz is considering adopting the name Sandwich Cream to better reflect how the country uses the condiment and to appeal to \"younger shoppers\".  UK sales of the brand dipped 5.4 per cent to \u0026pound28.8 million last year.  A Heinz spokesman added: \"As a market leading business, Kraft Heinz continues to audit its portfolio in order to meet the needs of consumers.  \"There are consumers now who haven\u0027t grown up with the brand in the household and just don\u0027t know about the iconic zingy flavour or what to eat it with.\"  The consultation process means the earliest a new name will be introduced is in September.    The condiment became a national favourite during the 1940s, Heinz says, when ketchup was unavailable and salad cream was used to add flavour to bland war-time rations.  In 1999, it was revealed that Heinz were about to ditch the brand but once the leak was published it led to a major protest by shoppers and it saved the brand.  The publicity helped sales and Heinz took advantage by relaunching Salad Cream in new-look packs and putting the price up."},{"url":null,"title":"UK Government defends RBS shares sale at   2 1bn loss  saying it s  value for money ","story":"              THE UK Government has defended the sale of a 7.7 per cent stake in Royal Bank of Scotland at a \u0026pound2.1 billion loss to the UK taxpayer, insisting it was \"value for money\".  Lord Bates, the Treasury spokesman, dismissed criticism of the move from Labour and the Liberal Democrats in the Lords.  Answering an urgent question, he said the sale would raise \u0026pound2.5bn, representing \"value for money for the taxpayer\".  The Conservative peer said RBS was a \"smaller, simpler and safer organisation\" than the one the Government was forced to recapitalise in 2008 at a cost to the taxpayer of \u0026pound46bn and the sale price reflected that \"reality\".  But Liberal Democrat Baroness Kramer demanded: \"Why sell now crystallising a loss that rises to in excess of \u0026pound3bn when financing costs are included and when there is no pressure..?\"  She warned that by acting now the Government could be selling shares on an \"inaccurate prospectus, ignoring growing allegations that liabilities to those abused by RBS\u0027s global restructuring group... are inadequately quantified, not declared and not provided for within the accounts\".  But Lord Bates said that when the Government paid 502p per share in 2008 it was an \"essential injection of capital\" at a time of financial crisis the bank was now, he insisted, in a very different organisation.  Labour spokesman Lord Davies of Oldham said the shares were being sold at a \"massive level below\" the 2008 bailout with the taxpayer bearing the cost and leaving the public to \"lose on the deal significantly\".  Lord Bates hit back, telling him: \"You may say we sold it too cheaply. I might say that you bought it too high.\"  He said the price was \"near the top end of the yearly average\" and the Government had signalled it shouldn\u0027t be in the business of \"running these banks\".  Tory former Cabinet minister Lord King of Bridgwater backed the sale as being an \"entirely sensible procedure to bring in some money while we can\".  Lord Bates said the Opposition was forgetting what the situation was in 2008 and the \"incredible damage done to our economy, which we are still having to clear up\".  He said the sale proceeds would go directly to reduce the debt accumulated in 2008.  Outwith Parliament, Gordon Brown, who was Prime Minister when the bank was bailed out, said there was \"no excuse\" for selling the shares at under their potential value.  Sir Vince Cable, the Lib Dem leader, also insisted there was no need to sell the RBS shares now.  \u0026ldquoThere was no need for the Conservatives to cost the taxpayer more than \u0026pound2bn, he declared.  \"There is continuing uncertainty on a number of RBS\u0026rsquo legacy issues. Ministers should instead have been using their position as the biggest shareholder to make sure management put the bank in order so that the share price recovered before selling any of the stake,\" he added."},{"url":null,"title":"Scotland s last great auk to be immortalised in bronze","story":"              STANDING three feet tall, with a curved black beak and glossy black and white feathers, it was one of the most impressive birds ever to call Scotland its home.  The great auk was the country\u0026rsquos answer to the penguin \u0026ndash large, flightless and ungainly on land, yet fast and agile in the water. Yet in the end they became Scotland\u0026rsquos dodo, wiped out by the carelessness of men who hunted them for their meat and feathers, and doomed the species to extinction.  Today, all that remains of the great auk is their little cousins \u0026ndash puffins, razorbills and other seabirds of the same family \u0026ndash and a few preserved remains floating in jars and stuffed carcasses on museum shelves.  Now preparations are being made to commemorate one of the final members of the species to be killed in Scotland with a bronze replica.  The great auk was one of a pair which nested on the Orkney island of Papa Westray, and met its demise at the hands of hunters in 1813. Six years later, in 1819, the bird\u0026rsquos stuffed remains were purchased by the Natural History Museum, and it is only British specimen in existence.  A clay statue was made of the bird to mark the spot where it had been shot, at Fowl Crag, on the north of the island, but this was damaged in a recent storm and lost its head. Although it has been repaired, the replica is only 10in tall and plans are being made to use scans which were taken of its stuffed remains to have a life-size version made in bronze. Jonathan Ford, the ranger on Papa Westray who repaired the damaged clay version, said that a new statue would be a fitting tribute to one of the last great auks of Scotland.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquoll always keep the original statue \u0026ndash there\u0026rsquos a lot of history with it and it\u0026rsquos got a long association with the island. But the bronze statue would be life-size and a model of the actual bird which was taken from here, so it would be like it is coming home. They used to be widespread on Papa Westray, and it is very sad that the last ones were driven into extinction.  Great auks ranged over much of the north Atlantic for thousands of years and could be found nesting in crags and cliffs from America to Europe.  Used as a food source, their remains have been found in sites that were home to Neanderthals in Gibraltar 100,000 years ago, while early humans daubed their images on cave walls 35,000 years ago.  One great auk bone dating from the fifth century was uncovered recently near the Scottish Seabird Centre in North Berwick, indicating they were also eaten by medieval Scots.  However, they were hunted relentlessly in the 18th and 19th century as European ships spread out across the globe, with sailors using them as living larders they could pack on to boats. Their feathers, which were rich with oil, were also highly prized both as a fuel source and by the down industry as filling for quilts.  Tales have come down from the era of great auks being herded on to boats in large flocks, or used as fuel on treeless islands because they burned so easily.  Their persecution was famously cruel, with hunters advised to strip their feathers while the birds were still alive before leaving them to perish from the elements.  Britain banned the killing of the bird in 1794, except by fishermen. But by then it was too late.  The final great auk found in the British Isles is said to have been taken on a sea stack off of St Kilda, by fishermen hunting gannets.  They tied its feet and took it onboard their boat, only to become superstitious and fearful a few days later during a storm. Believing the bird to be \u0026ldquoa maelstrom-conjuring witch, they beat it to death. The last known great auks were killed on the island of Elday, off the coast of Iceland, by sailors hunting them for a museum collector in 1844.  Scottish Seabird Centre chief executive, Tom Brock said: \u0026ldquoThe really important thing is it reminds us that animals are still going extinct, even in Scotland. We should not take them for granted. One of the great auk\u0026rsquos close relatives, the puffin, has been put on to the red endangered list.  \u0026ldquoWe must protect and conserve safeguard seabird populations or more species will go the same way as the great auk."},{"url":null,"title":"Corbyn to push for  new single market  deal in crunch Commons vote","story":"              LABOUR is to push for a \"new single market\" deal for the UK after Brexit as the UK Government faces crunch votes in the Commons next week.

The Hidden Gardens, behind the Tramway in Glasgow\u0027s south side, still stands.  And in the last ten years the small arts charity, led by Angus Farquhar - who previously had been in the industrial music group Test Department - also wrought significant change at St Peter\u0027s Seminary. For NVA to take on, and try to transform, the modern ruin, did always seem like an ambitious, perhaps extraordinary, task.

But ultimately, without a major national institution to step in (which, at some point, perhaps NVA was half expecting to happen) and provide funding, scale and stability, the project proved too much. The public money that was raised for the project and not used was paid back last year. The company will close without lurching into bankruptcy, I am told. But NVA is over, and who knows if art work like Speed of Light or The Path in Glen Lyon will be attempted again.  What cannot be lost in the closure of NVA is the role of Creative Scotland, the nation\u0027s arts funder. In January, in the Regular Funding round which has been the cause of much controversy and debate, NVA were not granted regular funding. It had been funded before. At the time it seemed a surprising decision, but was somewhat lost in the tumult surrounding similar decisions in theatre and music.

It was rather moving, and brought home the extent to which the metropolis truly is a multicultural city. It\u0026rsquos sometimes hard to believe that the indigenous white population is still in a majority here.  Step off the train back in Scotland and you are in a different world. Scotland remains a conspicuously white nation. Indeed, the most visible social difference now between Scotland and England today is arguably not nationality, but race. Despite a significant increase in immigration in the past decade, Black And Minority Ethnic \u0026ndash BAME \u0026ndash still really means that: minority. In the last census there were only around 40,000 Afro-Carribbeans recorded as living in the whole of Scotland.  Which makes it doubly ludicrous that the Home Office seems determined to expel those few who make it here, such as the student nurse, Denzel Darku. He has lost two appeals against deportation on the grounds that he cannot prove he is dependent on his father, who lives in Edinburgh and is an EU citizen. This is typical of the Catch-22 rules that have grown up like a dense thicket around our immigration law since Theresa May introduced her \u0026ldquohostile environment to migrants five years ago.  READ MORE: Home Secretary Sajid Javid expresses \u0027sympathy\u0027 to student nurse battling to stay in Scotland  It makes no sense that this capable and responsible young man, who was a member of the Scottish Youth Parliament and carried the Queen\u0026rsquos Baton at the Commonwealth Games, is likely to be deported after his final appeal next week. The Home Secretary Sajid Javid said yesterday that he was \u0026ldquosympathetic, but this will cut little ice with the hard-faced men and women of the British immigration service, for whom \u0026ldquocomputer says no is the whole of the law.  It is often said that hostility to immigration grows in inverse proportion to the number of immigrants actually living in a given area. Hence, diverse London voted for Remain, while Brexit, and Ukip, are stronger in white English townships. But that rule doesn\u0026rsquot seem to apply to Scotland. There is racism if you care to look for it, of course. But it is obvious from the composition of the Scottish Parliament that race and immigration are not significant political issues in Scotland. You rarely see those \u0026ldquoMigrant Crisis front pages that have disgraced English news-stands in recent years because newspaper readers don\u0026rsquot buy them.  At First Minister\u0026rsquos Questions in Holyrood, the Scottish parties united to jeer and goad Ruth Davidson and the Scottish Tories when they failed to voice support for the First Minister in her defence of Mr Darku. Some Tory MSPs allegedly cried \u0026ldquosend him home, which to me seems most unlikely because casual hostility to immigrants is not tolerated in Ruth Davidson\u0026rsquos party. Woe betide the Scottish Tory councillor who makes even a daft joke about immigrants. To be fair to the Conservatives, they have never seriously attempted to make race and immigration an issue in Scotland, because they know there are no votes in it.  READ MORE:\u0026nbspNicola Sturgeon attacks \u0027shameful\u0027 Tory silence on deportation case  Yet in England, immigration remains a massive issue that underpinned the Brexit vote, and still has politicians of all parties running scared. This week, Mrs May repeated her nonsense proposal to reduce immigration to the tens of thousands \u0026ndash a target which would be economically ruinous to Britain if it were even remotely achievable. The UK economy has benefited from immigration, largely in recent years from the European Union. Migrants invariably come to Britain to work and to pay taxes, which have helped to pay for public services and run the NHS.  Scotland needs immigrants more than the rest of the UK because our population is ageing faster than the rest of the UK. This in turn is partly because low-growth Scotland continues to lose qualified younger workers because of the lack of jobs here. This is not going to change any time soon. The Scottish Fiscal Commission has forecast that Scottish growth will remain at near-recession levels of less than one per cent for the next five years. If there are able and industrious young people who want to come to Scotland to work and contribute, like Mr Darku, we should be doing everything possible to keep them here.  It beggars belief that the UK Government doesn\u0026rsquot see this. The refusal to meet the First Minister\u0026rsquos calls for the devolution of immigration policy makes no political sense. Mrs May could undermine the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos \u0026ldquopower grab claims about the impact of the EU Withdrawal Bill, by promising a regionally-based immigration regime, such as exists in Canada or Australia. It would shoot Ms Sturgeon\u0026rsquos fox. She\u0026rsquod find it harder to argue that Scotland was losing out because of Brexit and Westminster insensitivity to Scottish concerns.  One suspects Mr Javid would introduce such a policy if he could, and is plainly embarrassed by UK policy as a whole. Michael Gove, the UK Environment Secretary and one of the leading figures in Vote Leave, said before the Brexit referendum that immigration was one of the powers that should come to Scotland after Brexit. All that would be necessary would be to ensure that those migrants who came to Scotland to work were recorded as living here. This will happen anyway since they now have a Scottish tax code.  READ MORE: Home Secretary Sajid Javid expresses \u0027sympathy\u0027 to student nurse battling to stay in Scotland  It\u0026rsquos not as if the UK\u0026rsquos existing immigration policy makes any sense. Mr Javid is desperately trying to find a way of removing the Tier 2 cap that has been preventing much-needed doctors and other highly-qualified people migrating to the UK. Daft earnings requirements are denuding the NHS of nurses and other lower paid workers. It is absurd that 450,000 international students are included in the immigration statistics, since few will remain here. The Windrush scandal has visibly changed attitudes towards our racist immigration rules, which led to British citizens being deported, and others denied housing because of their colour. England needs a new immigration system as much as Scotland. Theresa May needs to overcome her fear of Ukip and let her apparently open-minded new Home Secretary create one."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/7885945.jpg?type=article-full","title":"Revealed  The Mackintosh design you chose for our print giveaway","story":"              HE is revered around the world as an architect, designer and artist of astonishing talent and vision.

I kept changing my mind when trying to guess which print readers would choose as their favourite, however this watercolour drawing has such a mysterious air that it really captures the imagination.  \u0026ldquoI like to think of the female in the sketch as Mackintosh\u0026rsquos Mona Lisa. She is an enigma with a serene expression in a composition full of unanswered questions. Exhibited in London in 1896, this drawing was transformed into a painted mural frieze for the interior of Miss Cranston\u0026rsquos Buchanan Street tearooms.  Ms Brown added: \u0026ldquoIn the week we celebrate the 150th anniversary of his birth, it\u0026rsquos fantastic that readers are receiving their very own Mackintosh print to remind them of the creative genius of Glasgow\u0026rsquos greatest cultural icon. I hope this work will inspire people of all ages to go out and discover his beautiful buildings and designs.  The exhibition at Kelvingrove is among a diverse array of events being held across Glasgow to celebrate Mackintosh\u0026rsquos birthday, including a family friendly party on Sunday at Scotland Street School, which the architect designed between 1903 and 1906 and is now a museum.

Mr Buckland provided her with plenty of fluids as she was extremely malnourished.  It is not known what happened to her mother.  Once she was fit to travel, the seal was flown to Glasgow by Loganair, free of charge, and then taken to the Scottish SPCA National Wildlife Rescue Centre in Fischcross, Clackmannanshire, to continue her recovery.  Mr Buckland, from the Southern Isles Veterinary Practice, accompanied the pup on her journey on Monday evening.

MSPs voted unanimously in favour of the reform, which also lets people apply to have past convictions scrubbed, or \u0026ldquodisregarded, from their criminal records.  Consensual sex between men over the age of 21 was illegal in Scotland until 1981, and the age of consent was only lowered to 16 in 2001.  Although the pardon is essentially symbolic, it is wider in scope than a version south of the border, as it applies both posthumously and to those still living.  It also covers the full range of previous discriminatory laws which applied to gay man, including \u0026ldquoimportuning, which was essentially chatting someone up in public.  Such behaviour was legal at the time between men and women, and women and women.  When the SNP Government introduced the Historical Sexual Offences (Pardons and Disregards) Bill last year, Nicola Sturgeon offered an unreserved apology to the men it was intended to help, and said it was \u0026ldquoshocking the law had punished them until so recently.  As the Bill passed its third and final stage at Holyrood on Wednesday by 119 votes to zero, Justice Secretary Michael Matheson said the legislation marked a \u0026ldquoproud day for Scotland.

Green MSP Patrick Harvie said the previous legal regime amounted to \u0026ldquoindefensible actions by the state against its own citizens, in defiance of their dignity and their basic human rights.

It will bring the total number of staff in the UK to 27,500 by the end of 2018, with Amazon having invested more than \u0026pound9.3 billion in its local operations since 2010.  Mr Gurr said: \u0026ldquoThe UK is a fantastic place to do business so we are delighted to continue our investment in the British economy and provide quality, permanent roles for people the length and breadth of the country.  \u0026ldquoWhether you are looking for an entry-level role or in highly-specialised fields such as speech science or machine learning, we are proud to be expanding our UK workforce so we can further improve our products and services like AmazonFresh, Prime Video and Amazon Alexa.  The 2,500 jobs mark a slowdown from the 5,000 jobs Amazon added to its UK workforce last year, but Mr Gurr said: \u0026ldquoThat honestly is simply a reflection of where calendar years happen to fall.  He added: \u0026ldquoBroadly speaking over the long period I\u0026rsquod say it\u0026rsquos a continuing story of investing at the rate of which we\u0026rsquove always wanted to invest.  The news comes days after the GMB union accused the company of \u0026ldquoterrible conditions and poor treatment of workers at Amazon warehouses.  It cited a series of Freedom of Information requests showing ambulances had been called out 600 times to 14 Amazon warehouses over the last three financial years, and that in more than half of those cases patients were taken to hospital.  The union also noted a survey of GMB members working at Amazon warehouses, which found that 87% were in \u0026ldquoconstant or occasional pain due to their workload.  When asked about the quality of jobs available at Amazon, Mr Gurr told journalists on Wednesday: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquore very transparent, we\u0026rsquore proud of the conditions. We provide \u0026hellip health insurance, we provide pensions, we provide shares.  \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquore very proud of the working conditions across all parts of our business."},{"url":null,"title":"Banners unfurled at top of Grenfell Tower ahead of one year anniversary","story":"              Banners have been unfurled at the top of Grenfell Tower emblazoned with the message: \u0026ldquoForever in our hearts.
