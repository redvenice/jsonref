This is such a moment.\u0027The Prime Minister calls on all MPs opposed to the deal – from Tory Brexiteers to arch-Remainers hoping for a second referendum – to study their consciences.She writes: \u0027MPs of every party will face the same question when the ision bell rings. It is a question of profound significance for our democracy and for our constituents. The only way to both honour the result of the referendum and protect jobs and security is by backing the deal that is on the table.\u0027Tory Brexiteers argue that, far from softening in their opposition to the Withdrawal Agreement, opposition has actually \u0027cemented\u0027 over the holidays, with party members using festive social events to convey their scathing view of the exit terms.Rebel ringleader and former party leader Iain Duncan Smith today brands Downing Street\u0027s attempts to cajole MPs into backing May\u0027s deal as \u0027stupid\u0027.He writes in today\u0027s MoS: \u0027Even the most loyal of advisers must know that attitudes simply haven\u0027t changed.\u0027And he warns any minor additions or legal protocols offered by Brussels to buttress the PM\u0027s \u0027charm offensive\u0027 would be worthless.He argues: \u0027The European Court of Justice has historically sidelined protocols and other such devices, meaning the backstop will bind us without the power to withdraw.\u0027He adds that further talks with Brussels would be fruitless as \u0027the problem has been that while our negotiators have behaved towards the EU as friends, they have treated us as adversaries.\u0027But Downing Street is still pinning its hopes on a \u0027white smoke\u0027 moment from Brussels – legally binding concessions over the backstop – by next weekend.Mrs May is on standby to travel to Europe to welcome the proposals if they are deemed to be sufficiently persuasive.If that fails, Tory whips are plotting a backbench amendment to the vote – pencilled in for January 15 or 16 – which would order yet more talks between Mrs May and the EU.That would further delay the main vote on Mrs May\u0027s deal.No 10\u0027s former legislative adviser Nikki da Costa, who resigned over the terms of the deal in November, said yesterday that party managers would hold back the \u0027trick\u0027 if they believe they are still heading for a triple-figure defeat.She said: \u0027If the EU hasn\u0027t moved far enough, the Government may seek to spell out in an amendment what further assurances looks like. The hope would be if that was passed, the EU would feel reassured that it is worthwhile moving further, because the majority has been proven to exist for that package.\u0027I expect any amendment will be quietly tested with MPs for 24 to 36 hours before it\u0027s tabled, to see if it is going to get the support.\u0027          Sir Vince Cable (pictured above) said the Prime Minister could be playing with fire if she refuses MPs the right to vote on her deal           In the exclusive article Theresa May also attacks Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn (pictured above)But Lib Dem leader Sir Vince Cable said the PM would be \u0027playing with fire if she refuses MPs the right to vote on her deal\u0027.Yesterday, the stretched Tory Christmas truce collapsed completely when devout Remainer Ken Clarke dismissed the 2016 referendum as \u0027one opinion poll\u0027.Mr Duncan Smith hit back, describing him as a \u0027wrecker\u0027 who \u0027typifies what those who have never accepted the referendum believe\u0027.In her article, Mrs May also attacks Jeremy Corbyn for his \u0027cynical\u0027 Brexit policy, saying: \u0027He tells one group he would keep the UK in the single market, while promising another group an end to free movement. Throughout, he has provided the opposite of leadership, serving not our national interest but always his own political interest.\u0027Mrs May\u0027s words come as hundreds of lorries tomorrow take part in a \u0027No Deal rehearsal\u0027 for potential chaos at Dover, with truckers testing government plans to use the disused Manston Airport as a holding pen for HGVs.But critics have suggested TV footage of lorries backed up in rush-hour is a fresh round of Project Fear spin.People\u0027s vote would be a disaster movie says Brexit TV drama writer  By Harry Cole for the Mail on SundayJames Graham says people assume he is a \u0027massively leftie, liberally, Remainy, 12-year-old-looking playwright\u0027, but the man behind tomorrow night\u0027s highly anticipated Brexit TV drama has delighted Leave supporters by criticising calls for a second referendum.Channel 4\u0027s Brexit: The Uncivil War, starring Benedict Cumberbatch, has surprised critics with its even-handed portrayal of the 2016 poll.And speaking ahead of its screening, Mr Graham, 37, says he is not looking for a re-run, describing the last bout as \u0027toxic\u0027 and \u0027traumatic\u0027.

But late author James Pope-Hennessy, who interviewed members of the Royal Family, former courtiers and ladies-in-waiting, omitted some of the juiciest — and funniest — material, knowing it would never get past the royal censors.Here, in this extract from his newly-published private jottings, is an extraordinarily detailed account of the few days he spent in 1957 with the Duke and Duchess of Windsor at the converted mill house they had just bought near Paris. It was 21 years since the Duke — Queen Mary’s eldest son — had, as Edward VIII, abdicated the throne in order to marry Wallis Simpson, a orced American socialite.At 12.30, I was at the Gare du Nord (in Paris), where the long blue station wagon (Cadillac) of the Duke and Duchess of Windsor was waiting, with a plump pigeon-shaped English chauffeur, dressed in discreet black with a black rosette in his cap.We drove out through jammed streets to Le Moulin de la Tuilerie, which the Duchess has converted into her Petit Trianon. The car hooted at the wooden door in the gatehouse, and this was opened. We drove to the front door where the liveried butler (French) and an English footman were waiting.I was directed to walk across the sunny courtyard to the French windows of the Duke’s study, a colossal room made from a barn, with great log fires smouldering either end, French windows in the middle, maps of his world tours on the walls, souvenirs and uniform buckles everywhere.

Just then his hair was blown out in tufts on either side of his head, and he was looking crumple-faced and wild.          The Duke and Duchess of Windsor standing on stone stepsHe has his father’s eyes, and some, I fancy, of his mannerisms. He was drinking milk for what the Duchess calls ‘that lil’ old ulcer’. I should say she is on the whole a stupid woman, with a small petty brain, immense goodwill and a stern power of concentration.Like her house, she is tremendously American, and specifically Southern — it was like being back in Montgomery, Alabama, without the tree moss.I should therefore be tempted to classify her simply as An American Woman par excellence, were it not for the suspicion that the Duchess is not a woman at all. She is one of the very oddest women I have ever seen.She is flat and angular, and could have been designed for a medieval playing card. The shoulders are small and high the head very, very large, almost monumental the expression is either anticipatory (signalling, ‘I know this is going to be loads of fun, don’t yew?’) or appreciative — the great gig-lamp smile, the wide, wide open eyes, which are so very large and pale and veined, the painted lips and the cannibal teeth.There is one further facial contortion, reserved for speaking of the Queen Mother, which is very unpleasant to behold, and seemed to me akin to frenzy.Her high smooth flat forehead is cloven by a deep vertical line of concentration. Her neck makes her age (61) apparent — a tendency to wattles. Her jawbone is alarming, and from the back you can plainly see it jutting beyond the neck on each side.          James Pope-Hennessy (pictured above) had interviewed many members of the royal household          The couple had visited the Bahamas in 1942 - the Duke of Windsor had served as the Governor there She is wildly good-natured and friendly but with both of them one somehow feels that so much enthusiasm might suddenly gel up and one would be in the limbo reserved for the many, many people who have treated them badly or turned out a disappointment. I like having my jokes laughed at but there’s no need to make the mill-beams rock with appreciation of them.The house itself is full of very pretty colours and ideas and objects. Every conceivable creature comfort is conscripted, to produce a perfection of sybaritic living. They are like people after a cataclysm or a revolution, valiantly making the best of infinite luxury.It is, of course, intensely American, but I would think consciously aimed. The Queen Mother at Clarence House is leading a lodging-house existence compared to this.  James Pope-Hennessy said the couple (pictured above) were not what he had expected them to beMy room in the stables was very pretty and convenient, and prepared or planned by a perfectionist there was nothing on earth that you might conceivably want that wasn’t there — every kind of writing paper, nail file, brush, fruit, ice-water the bathroom loaded with scent bottles like a counter at a bazaar.After pottering in my bedroom, I wandered up the hill past the millstream, attracted by a stream of German oaths. Round the corner of the house I found the Duke, wearing a cerise felt baseball cap. He was jumping about rather wildly, and shouting ‘Jawohl, Jawohl’ and other military German expressions to a troop of French gardeners who were lugging the stone base of a sundial on to its mount.The Duchess, flat against the inside of the drawing room window, was looking on in a disinterested angular way, one hand on the window pane.‘Are the gardeners German?’ I inquired. ‘Well, no — one is Alsatian and one is Spanish, and that lil’ boy is only 14.‘But as the Dook’s German is sort of better than his French, he likes to talk German with them.‘Now I hope you’ll get in your talk with the Dook this afternoon,’ she continued. ‘You must catch him but you’ll find the Dook is kind of a slow starter’ — said with a great wide smile.          The Duke and Duchess of Windsor, sitting in the drawing room of their Paris home, with their four Pug dogs at their feeAbout 3.30pm the Duke came in, sitting on the sofa opposite my chair to talk. The pugs gambolled about — Disraeli, Trooper and Davy Crockett.‘We did have a fourth, called Peter Townsend (the orced Battle of Britain pilot whom Princess Margaret had wanted to marry),’ the Duchess explained with her least nice grin. ‘But we gave the Group Captain away.’ The whole atmosphere was intensely unstrained and unshy, owing, I should say, to the Duchess and the job she has done on the Duke. He talked with complete freedom, even of the delicate subject to which he obliquely refers as ‘1936’.‘My mother (Queen Mary) loathed the country,’ he said. ‘She used to say to me: “I was born in Kensington and I am a Londoner.” She hated Sandringham Balmoral was a bit better but we were always there too long. Sandringham was dreadful.’He added: ‘Off the record, my father (George V) had a most horrible temper. He was foully rude to my mother.‘Why, I’ve often seen her leave the table because he was so rude to her, and we children would all follow her out not when the staff were present, of course, but when we were alone.’I remarked that I was puzzled by the shutting down of his mother’s high spirits after marriage.          King George V with the his Consort, Queen Mary pictured on a visit to Liverpool‘Well, you’re right there, I think. My father was a very repressive influence. I well remember when he used to go banging away for a week or two at some shoot in the Midlands we used to have the most lovely time with her alone — always laughing and joking.‘She was a different human being away from him.’He said suddenly: ‘You realise there are only three completely royal persons alive now? My sister, my brother and myself.’          The Dowager Queen Mary with her son Edward, who abdicated as King in order to marry Wallis Simpson, an American orceeTea was a serious, perfectionist meal, with the Duchess struggling manfully with the teapot (she evidently hates tea, and looks very out of place pouring it out but the Duke drinks, she assured me, cup after cup all day ‘He leaves haff the cup, too, so it gets cold,’ she added.When we got to the drawing room again, the Duchess settled herself on a low wide day-bed, her legs tucked up she does not curl up but somehow dismantles herself, so that she looks like a puppet lying in the wings of a toy theatre.Duchess: ‘We-e-ell, and has the Dook been much help?’          This photo taken in 1937 shows King George VI and Queen Elizabeth with Queen Mary and at the front their children Princess Elizabeth and Princess Margaret on the balcony at Buckingham Palace, after the Coronation ceremony at Westminster Abbey‘Oh, a tremendous help, Duchess I can’t tell you.’Duchess: ‘He was pretty close to his mother, you know. I suppose you’ve had to see everybody about yah book?’ ‘Oh yes,’ I said. ‘The Duke’s sister has been very helpful, and the Queen Mother.’Duchess (in a slightly steely tone): ‘I don’t think the Queen Mother would know about Queen Mary.’ She went on: ‘Just everything happens to me. When I was over in England last, I wanted a new maid so I intervood one who told me she had been five years with the Queen Mother!‘Well, I brought her over here but I had to get rid of her.‘I had a Balenciaga dress with a crinoline. Well, Irene ironed that crinoline so that you couldn’t see what it was by the time she’d finished. I took it back, but even Mr Balenciaga himself couldn’t decide just what she had done to that crinoline.‘And she just burned up five more of my dresses. Well, that surprised me, because I thought that, after all those years with the Queen Mother, if she hadn’t learnt to iron a crinoline, what had she learned?’  Official portrait of Queen Mary (left) in 1935 and another from 1912 (right)‘And, you know, whenever I see pictures of those poor girls (Princesses Elizabeth and Margaret) with their suits all screwed up under the arms, I think of Irene. I’d like to take those girls’ clothes apart and loosen them up.’Before dinner, having had my bath and changed, I was standing by the fireplace in the hall, when the front door flew open and the Duke scampered in, making a yelping noise on seeing me he was wearing red trousers, a fur coat, and a peaked flying cap with fur ear-flaps. He was followed by the valet carrying some clothes.He dashed upstairs. When he came down again, very spick and  in a Balmoral tartan kilt, he smiled with great charm: ‘I say, you saw a pretty quaint apparition just now? Whatever did you think, I wonder? Why they put me into red pants I can’t imagine.’Presently, a tapping of high heels and the creak of stiff silk announced the Duchess, who wound her way down the staircase sheathed in a red-orange very tight, almost hobbled, dress. After dinner, the Duke lugged me off for a preliminary look at his papers, which were in a spare bedroom.A tall white tin filing cabinet, with five or six drawers, stood on a groundsheet at the foot of a green chintz bed. He unlocked it and we sat down side by side on the bed.‘There’s a lot of valuable stuff here, you know,’ he said. ‘Unlike the Duchess, I am very well documented. But I keep them all under years, not under people. Let’s take a look now at 1936.’          The Duke and Duchess of Windsor look lovingly at one another He seized one of the two 1936 files and showed me various letters — until we reached one from Queen Mary, begging him not to broadcast (his abdication speech).‘Surely you might spare yourself this strain and emotion,’ he read out. A look of real disgust crossed over his face.‘She even tried that! Well, I ask you...if I hadn’t done that...’We began to talk about the abdication. ‘People can say what they like for it or against it, I don’t care but one thing is certain: I acted in good faith. And I was treated bloody shabbily.’  Wallis Simpson (left) poses wearing her wedding ring. Queen Mary (right) in an official portrait One random example of this treatment, with which I strongly sympathised, was the fact (attested by receipted bills) that he had produced £4,000 of the £8,000 for the St George’s Chapel monument for his father, Queen Mary paying the other half, and he had not even been invited to the dedication of it nor had it ever been published anywhere that he had contributed.I said: ‘I think one of Queen Mary’s chief difficulties in understanding your dilemma was the fact that she had never been in love herself.’‘No, I don’t think she had,’ he said. ‘You’re right. My mother was a cold woman, a cold woman. And I, you see, I suppose I had never really been in love before. No, I hadn’t. I thought I had, but I hadn’t ever been in love.’  The Duchess of Windsor  (left) pictured at the villa she shares with her husband the Duke of Windsor in 1951. They are pictured together (right) in 1939 after returning from France Before we went back to the drawing room, he said with tired charm: ‘Well, I did my best, you know. I tried to bring the monarchy into touch.’But didn’t George V and Queen Mary start that, with their industrial tours in 1913 and so on?‘In a way they did, but not really. And think of my grandfather (Edward VII).’ His face lit up mischievously and boyishly: ‘Why, look at my grandfather. He’d just sit in an open landau, receive an address, snip a ribbon and declare something open, returning to dine with his girlfriends.

There are some in Parliament who, despite voting in favour of holding the referendum, voting in favour of triggering Article 50 and standing on manifestos committed to delivering Brexit, now want to stop us leaving by holding another referendum. Others across the House of Commons are so focused on their particular vision of Brexit that they risk making a perfect ideal the enemy of a good deal.Both groups are motivated by what they think is best for the country, but both must realise the risks they are running with our democracy and the livelihoods of our constituents.Our genius for pragmatism is a defining British trait. At moments of profound challenge, we always find a way forward that commands the confidence and consent of the whole community. This is such a moment.\u0027LEAVE would win second referendum by even BIGGER margin\u0027:...Ministers plan for a \u0027practice traffic jam\u0027 to prepare for...May\u0027s 11th-hour bid to break Brexit deadlock: Prime Minister...Share this article    Theresa May has said that Jeremy Corbyn (pictured above) had taken a very different approach to BrexitThe approach of Jeremy Corbyn and the Labour leadership has been very different. Their Brexit policy is a cynical tissue of incoherence, designed to avoid difficult decisions. He did not even bother to read the deal before he came out against it. He tells one group he would keep the UK in the single market, while promising another an end to free movement. Throughout, he has provided the opposite of leadership, serving not our national interest but always his own political interest.MPs of every party will face the same question when the ision bell rings. It is a question of profound significance for our democracy and for our constituents. The only way to both honour the result of the referendum and protect jobs and security is by backing the deal that is on the table. MPs should approach that vote with confidence. The deal delivers on the issues that the British people care about.Outside the EU, we will create a skills-based immigration system that everyone can have confidence in. Out of the Common Agricultural Policy, we will design support schemes for our farmers built around our needs. Out of the Common Fisheries Policy, we will decide ourselves who fishes in our waters. And as we retake our seat at the World Trade Organisation, we will be a champion of free trade and its potential to drive prosperity for everyone.          According to Theresa May MPs across the House of Commons are only focused on their own particular version of BrexitWe will also redouble our efforts to improve the lives of the British people. Nowhere is that work more important than when it comes to our National Health Service. Just as in delivering Brexit we should be inspired by the strength of our democracy, so as we strengthen our most precious public service, we can be inspired by the values that set it apart. Our NHS has a simple premise: high-quality healthcare, free at the point of use, available to everyone on the basis of clinical need, never the ability to pay. On that rock-solid moral foundation, generations of dedicated NHS staff have built one of the best health services anywhere in the world.Conservatives have made it a priority, protecting its budget and investing more in it every year. As a result, over the past eight years clinical outcomes have improved for almost every condition. But as the demands on our NHS increase, we need to act now to secure its future. That is what our NHS Long-Term Plan will do.It is powered by a historic multi-year investment: £20.5 billion extra a year in real terms by 202324, with the money starting this year. Making this investment was a big decision. Even with the full control of our money that Brexit will deliver, this commitment means we will have less room for manoeuvre in other areas. But when I visit hospitals and meet the NHS staff who devote themselves unsparingly to the care of their patients, when I talk to people who owe their lives to the treatment they have received from their local hospital or GP, and when I reflect on the debt that I owe to an NHS that has helped me every step of the way as I live my life with Type 1 diabetes – I am in no doubt that it is was the right decision.          Theresa May has praised the \u0027high quality\u0027 healthcare that the NHS offers to patients across the UK But money alone is insufficient – it has to be tied to a credible plan to improve care and an absolute focus on cutting waste right across the NHS, so that every penny of taxpayers’ money drives clinical improvements. Our aim is nothing less than to provide the best possible care for every major condition, from cradle to grave.So we will drive up safety in maternity services and provide more support to new parents, so every baby can get the best start in life. We will give people more control over the care they receive throughout their lives by expanding the use of personal health budgets. And as we get older, the NHS will support us all to age well, bringing different teams together to make sure older people can remain independent for longer.For every major physical health condition we will help people live longer, healthier lives through better prevention, detection, treatment and recovery. For the hundreds of thousands of people suffering with mental health problems, we will provide greater support than ever before at every stage.We will achieve this by investing in our NHS’s greatest asset – its staff. That will mean tens of thousands more doctors, nurses and other health professionals – all enjoying a more fulfilling career with better training, support and progression. We will also make it easier for them to do their jobs by investing in new technology. With digital access to their GP, everyone will be able to make appointments, manage prescriptions and view their health records online.Our plan builds on the NHS’s great strengths and secures it for the future. It shows what we can achieve with a strong economy and a focus on what matters most to the people we serve.So this is my appeal to my party, to Parliament and our country: in this New Year let’s discover a new spirit of common purpose. Let’s agree a Brexit deal that moves us forward into a brighter future with confidence. Let’s secure the future of our NHS. And let’s make 2019 a year to be proud of. "},{"url":null,"title":"Has Queen handed Meghan Markle role patron National Theatre","story":"    Meghan and Harry meet the cast and crew of Hamilton backstage after their performance  at Victoria Palace Theatre Royal insiders believe Meghan’s career as an actress makes her a ‘natural fit’ for the position.

This is such a moment.\u0027The Prime Minister calls on all MPs opposed to the deal – from Tory Brexiteers to arch-Remainers hoping for a second referendum – to study their consciences.She writes: \u0027MPs of every party will face the same question when the ision bell rings. It is a question of profound significance for our democracy and for our constituents. The only way to both honour the result of the referendum and protect jobs and security is by backing the deal that is on the table.\u0027Tory Brexiteers argue that, far from softening in their opposition to the Withdrawal Agreement, opposition has actually \u0027cemented\u0027 over the holidays, with party members using festive social events to convey their scathing view of the exit terms.Rebel ringleader and former party leader Iain Duncan Smith today brands Downing Street\u0027s attempts to cajole MPs into backing May\u0027s deal as \u0027stupid\u0027.He writes in today\u0027s MoS: \u0027Even the most loyal of advisers must know that attitudes simply haven\u0027t changed.\u0027And he warns any minor additions or legal protocols offered by Brussels to buttress the PM\u0027s \u0027charm offensive\u0027 would be worthless.He argues: \u0027The European Court of Justice has historically sidelined protocols and other such devices, meaning the backstop will bind us without the power to withdraw.\u0027He adds that further talks with Brussels would be fruitless as \u0027the problem has been that while our negotiators have behaved towards the EU as friends, they have treated us as adversaries.\u0027But Downing Street is still pinning its hopes on a \u0027white smoke\u0027 moment from Brussels – legally binding concessions over the backstop – by next weekend.Mrs May is on standby to travel to Europe to welcome the proposals if they are deemed to be sufficiently persuasive.If that fails, Tory whips are plotting a backbench amendment to the vote – pencilled in for January 15 or 16 – which would order yet more talks between Mrs May and the EU.That would further delay the main vote on Mrs May\u0027s deal.No 10\u0027s former legislative adviser Nikki da Costa, who resigned over the terms of the deal in November, said yesterday that party managers would hold back the \u0027trick\u0027 if they believe they are still heading for a triple-figure defeat.She said: \u0027If the EU hasn\u0027t moved far enough, the Government may seek to spell out in an amendment what further assurances looks like. The hope would be if that was passed, the EU would feel reassured that it is worthwhile moving further, because the majority has been proven to exist for that package.\u0027I expect any amendment will be quietly tested with MPs for 24 to 36 hours before it\u0027s tabled, to see if it is going to get the support.\u0027          Sir Vince Cable (pictured above) said the Prime Minister could be playing with fire if she refuses MPs the right to vote on her deal           In the exclusive article Theresa May also attacks Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn (pictured above)But Lib Dem leader Sir Vince Cable said the PM would be \u0027playing with fire if she refuses MPs the right to vote on her deal\u0027.Yesterday, the stretched Tory Christmas truce collapsed completely when devout Remainer Ken Clarke dismissed the 2016 referendum as \u0027one opinion poll\u0027.Mr Duncan Smith hit back, describing him as a \u0027wrecker\u0027 who \u0027typifies what those who have never accepted the referendum believe\u0027.In her article, Mrs May also attacks Jeremy Corbyn for his \u0027cynical\u0027 Brexit policy, saying: \u0027He tells one group he would keep the UK in the single market, while promising another group an end to free movement. Throughout, he has provided the opposite of leadership, serving not our national interest but always his own political interest.\u0027Mrs May\u0027s words come as hundreds of lorries tomorrow take part in a \u0027No Deal rehearsal\u0027 for potential chaos at Dover, with truckers testing government plans to use the disused Manston Airport as a holding pen for HGVs.But critics have suggested TV footage of lorries backed up in rush-hour is a fresh round of Project Fear spin.People\u0027s vote would be a disaster movie says Brexit TV drama writer  By Harry Cole for the Mail on SundayJames Graham says people assume he is a \u0027massively leftie, liberally, Remainy, 12-year-old-looking playwright\u0027, but the man behind tomorrow night\u0027s highly anticipated Brexit TV drama has delighted Leave supporters by criticising calls for a second referendum.Channel 4\u0027s Brexit: The Uncivil War, starring Benedict Cumberbatch, has surprised critics with its even-handed portrayal of the 2016 poll.And speaking ahead of its screening, Mr Graham, 37, says he is not looking for a re-run, describing the last bout as \u0027toxic\u0027 and \u0027traumatic\u0027.

The resulting images reveal a stark depiction of how climate change has taken its toll on the glaciated landscape.For a forthcoming exhibition on Ruskin and Turner, Emma Stibbon was commissioned to go to Chamonix and record the glaciers around Mont Blanc where, in the early 1800s, Turner painted sublime watercolours that inspired Ruskin to embark on his Alpine tours decades later, photographing and drawing awe-inspiring glaciers such as the Mer de Glace.In June, the same month in which Ruskin produced his daguerreotypes (early photographs) of the Mer de Glace more than 160 years ago, Stibbon found his viewpoint for her own images, using another early photographic process, cyanotype. While Turner and Ruskin observed the drama of a sea of ice almost at the level they stood, Stibbon looked down into an exposed deep valley with “a dark moraine-covered floor, almost completely devoid of ice”. She saID: “It’s unrecognisable.”Her commission forms part of the Ruskin, Turner \u0026amp the Storm Cloud, exhibition opening at the York Art Gallery in March and Abbot Hall, Kendal, in July. It is part of a worldwide programme of exhibitions, conferences and publications to mark the 200th birthday of Ruskin, a writer, artist and social reformer whose achievements are sometimes eclipsed by scandals, including his ill-fated, unconsummated marriage to Effie Gray and a libel action brought by painter James McNeill Whistler. “When we think of the Alps,” said Stibbon, “we think of iconic white peaks. By the end of this century, there probably won’t be any snow.”Suzanne Fagence Cooper, research curator at York Art Gallery and author of a new book, To See Clearly: Why Ruskin Matters, said Stibbon’s images show the glacier retreat “very clearly”, and capture a “sense of real loss”.While Ruskin events extend to Japan and America, in the UK there is a cinema screening, from 22 February, of Effie Gray – the 2014 film written by Emma Thompson – and the exhibition, John Ruskin: The Power of Seeing, from 26 January at Two Temple Place, London. It features more than 190 exhibits revealing how Ruskin’s influence is still felt.Robert Hewison, author of the recently published Ruskin and His Contemporaries, said: “Ruskin was, by the end of his life, treated as a kind of prophet – although not in his own country – for predicting both economic and ecological deterioration. Climate change appears to show that he was right.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/729d30ec72e9934d0c257f4eefafd1777aaed412/270_469_2283_1370/master/2283.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5f624acc052bc3cb34d88e2c44a30506","title":"cold snaps the siberian city of yakutsk in pictures","story":"Yakutsk, in eastern Siberia, is one of the world’s coldest cities temperatures in January average -40C.

With the publication of her second YA novel coming up next month, here’s your chanceAngie Thomas is the author of the bestseller The Hate U Give, a novel for young adults that was inspired by the Black Lives Matter movement and which tells the story of Starr Carter, a 16-year-old African American girl who is drawn to activism after witnessing the police shooting of a childhood friend. Published in 2017, the book has been on the New York Times young adult bestseller list for 96 weeks and has won many awards, including children’s book of the year at the British book awards, and the Waterstones children’s book prize for 2018. Writer Nikesh Shukla described it as “one of the most important books of 2017” and it has also recently been made into a successful film.Thomas grew up in Jackson, Mississippi, and she was the first black student to graduate in creative writing from the city’s Belhaven University. Her second book On the Come Up, published in February, is a love letter to hip-hop and tells the story of Bri, a teenager who dreams of becoming the greatest rapper of all time. Thomas was a rapper as a teenager.We are offering readers the chance to put a question to the award-winning author: submit them in the comments section below, email us at review@observer, or tweet @ObsNewReview by 10am on Monday 14 January. Here are some Angie Thomas quotes to inspire you...“I grew up in a neighbourhood called Georgetown, which is the ’hood...I would hear gunshots at night… but one thing I did love about my neighbourhood growing up was the sense of community.”“When I couldn’t find myself in books, I found myself in the rhymes written by MCs who looked like me and shared my experiences.”“I’ve always seen writing as a form of activism. If nothing else, books give us a glimpse into lives that we may not have known about before they can promote empathy.”“Freedom of speech isn’t necessarily free, especially when you’re young and black.”“Every time a black girl comes up to me and says, ‘Thank you. It’s the first time I’ve seen myself in a book like this’, that’s better than hitting the New York Times bestseller list.”“Hashtags are nice, but I would ask people to put in some work! You know, organise! Speak out! Do things! Be active about it! Don’t just put that hashtag and ignore it. We can make change happen if we actually speak out and do things and work…”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b1032a4d73f34643cf25b59723738f87ff21a75b/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=258cbcc7f42d62c7092e5d44aaf7e751","title":"john le carre eric hobsbawm tinker tailor marxist academic","story":"Marxist intellectual asked author why MI5 man in A Perfect Spy had a name so like his own, new biography revealsTheir names stand high among the roll call of British men of letters of the modern age: both revered authors with an international following, but publishing in very different corners of the literary world. One, John le Carré, is the creator of a succession of brilliant spy thrillers, including The Spy Who Came in from the Cold and The Little Drummer Girl, the other, the late Eric Hobsbawm, was a leading exponent of leftwing historical thought, a man who was also the subject of state surveillance for many years.Now the first biography of Hobsbawm, A Life in History, due out early next month, is to reveal an unlikely correspondence between the two men that centred on the name of a character in one Le Carré novel. In the 1986 book A Perfect Spy, later made into a BBC television series, Le Carré makes reference to a character called “Hobsbawn” who was under the control of the British security services. The real man, Professor Hobsbawm, was not pleased.Speaking this weekend, Le Carré told the Observer he imagines that back in the early 1980s he had simply reached for a name that would have the right political associations for those familiar with leftwing theory.“I can’t imagine from this distance that I was unaware of Hobsbawm’s distinction or his politics,” Le Carré said. “I suspect that what I did in midstream was picture a Marxist intellectual under MI5 control, and then give him an analogous name that would resonate with the knowing.”The written exchange between the two in the mid-1980s was cordial, but there were glimpses of steel underneath. The Marxist historian requested the name be changed in all subsequent editions of the thriller. No such change was made.Today Le Carré recalls writing Hobsbawm “an appropriately humble disclaimer” and receiving a courteous reply. “He acted with grace. I was grateful for his forbearance,” the novelist said. Hobsbawm, who died in 2012 at the age of 95, had been alerted to the offending page in A Perfect Spy by a reviewer.“The name is I can assure you more consistently misspelt than any other I know. It is also entirely identifiable with a fairly limited number of real persons,” his first letter argued. Hobsbawm went on to concede that his legal case was shaky. “I don’t suppose anyone will regard a fictional membership of MI5 as actual defamation, though speaking as one who has had a file since at least 1942 it makes me slightly uneasy,” he wrote.The academic was also curious, he added, to hear how it had happened. “My question is simply this: how on earth did you hit on the name? Is it an esoteric joke, something dredged up from among subconscious associations, or what?”Le Carré, now 87, whose real name is David Cornwell and who was an intelligence agent for both security services in the 1950s and early 1960s, wrote back quickly to reassure him.“I’ve no idea why I chose a name similar to yours, since I have never consciously heard of you, or your namesakes. There was no coy joke and I certainly wouldn’t risk some wasteful court action by doing such a thing. I choose names for their musical contrast \u0026amp impact: yours (or mine) stuck out as a sort of optical and aural loner in the pack, something to set the fellow apart.”Hobsbawm’s biographer, Richard J Evans, suggests, in contradiction, that it is “perfectly possible” that Le Carré had “picked up the name from a half-remembered file he had seen while working for the intelligence services”.The matter did not end there. The professor wrote back to the author once again requesting a name change. His identification with the name in the book had already been made by a critic in the New York Review, he pointed out. “I am not pleased at the prospect of jokey conversations on the subject of my putative relations with MI5. We shall never find out whether it is actionable to put someone who sounds like me into your novel as a security official, because it would be both pompous and ridiculous to try to find out. But it is mildly uncomfortable to figure as such for someone who, like myself, has an old-established track record on the Marxist left.”Nevertheless, the correspondence ended on a conciliatory note, with the professor revealing he was an admirer of Le Carré’s fiction. A Perfect Spy, the author has since said publicly, in fact drew heavily on his own difficult private life. It told partly of Le Carré’s troubled relationship with his father and writing it had been a cathartic exercise. “I cried and cried when it was over,” he has said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/831a399b338ebf028989e7d4ebf37f9939e13235/64_4_6719_4032/master/6719.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ec03eb938f103c98ed0ebacc6d1967af","title":"happiness index wellbeing survey uk population paul dolan happy ever after","story":"The ‘success’ narrative is at the heart of our idea of wellbeing, but the evidence tells a different tale, argues behavioural scientist Paul Dolan in this extract from his new bookThere are countless stories about how we ought to live our lives. We are expected to be ambitious to want to be wealthy, successful and well educated to get married, be monogamous and have kids. These social narratives can make our lives easier, by providing guidelines for behaviour, and they might sometimes make us happier, too. But they are, at their heart, stories – and ones that may not have originated with present-day people in mind. As such, many of these stories end up creating a kind of social dissonance whereby, perversely, they cause more harm than good.Since we’re talking about stories, let’s start with an experience of mine. It’s about a working-class kid who becomes a university professor and who is expected to change his behaviour in accordance with a (harmful) narrative about how academics ought to behave. A couple of years ago, I took part in an interesting panel discussion on “emotion versus reason” at the HowTheLightGetsIn festival in Hay-on-Wye. Walking across the field to get some food, I was approached by a man in his 50s. Our interaction started with him saying how much he liked my first book, Happiness By Design. Then he asked, pointedly: “But why do you have to play the working-class hero? You do it in your book and, look at you, you’re doing it now.”Ordinarily, I would embrace being a hero of any kind but, in this context, I was made to feel like an arsehole. The man proceeded to lecture me on how “when you reach a certain level you have to modify your behaviour”. He told me that I should not swear: apparently I used the word “fuck” twice in an hour-long panel discussion. Why shouldn’t I swear? Perhaps because it is a sign of a poor vocabulary andor low intelligence, and yet no such correlations have ever been found. Swearing is only ever harmful when it is used in an aggressive or abusive way, and not when used as a means of conveying excitement and emphasis. In these circumstances, the evidence shows that it does more good than harm, so the idea that swearing is bad is a fucking stupid one.But I digress. This man was insistent that, in my role as a professor at the London School of Economics and Political Science, I ought to be setting a “better” example to those who looked up to me. In doing so, he was appealing to a social narrative that places the burden on me to act in a particular way based upon my middle-class profession.This social narrative and others like it have withstood generations of change. They have been shaped by power structures, cultures, laws, families, the media, historical practice and even evolutionary advantage. As well as satisfying some of our innate desires, such narratives have developed rules of thought and action that help to make a complicated world easier to navigate. By looking to the narrative for clues about how to live, we are provided with a coherent path to follow. Not only do we want to fit in, but we can also, like my festival friend, get angry with those who do not.His behaviour and his reaction to me demonstrate just one way in which these stories can harm us and the people around us. They become what I refer to as narrative traps, which together form the myth of the perfect life.The stories around wealth and success, in particular, are social narratives that we can’t seem to get enough of. Now, it should be obvious that the absence of either of these two things can cause anxiety and misery. I will not suggest otherwise. The narratives suggest, however, that no matter how much we have of each, we are expected to be reaching for more. The assumption is that ever more happiness is achieved with ever more money and more markers of success. The trap comes from the fact that the happiness hit from adherence to these narratives gets ever smaller the further up the ladder you go and, eventually, can become reversed. To be happier we need to move from a culture of “more please” to one of “just enough”.Likewise, the most recent American Time Use Survey (ATUS), which allows analysts to estimate levels of happiness associated with a range of daily activities, showed that happiness goes up with increases in income at the lower end of the scale, but then it falls with higher incomes. Contrary to what most of us might predict, those earning over $100K are no happier than those with incomes of less than $25K. Those with the highest incomes report the least sense of purpose in their experiences. Perhaps “having it all” makes what we do feel less meaningful.Data suggest that being rich can lead to time and attention being directed towards activities that fuel the attainment of more wealth, such as longer working hours and longer commutes, and away from activities that generate more happiness, such as time outside and time with family and friends. This discrepancy between the big effect on happiness that we imagine increased wealth should bring and the small effect we experience goes a long way towards explaining the narrative trap of reaching for wealth. But most people, including those on incomes above £50,000, truly believe misery would continue to fall with higher income above this point. And most people, irrespective of income, would continue to reach for more long after they have earned their 50 grand. This is the addiction problem.If you are not struggling to make ends meet, I propose that you rein in the social narrative that encourages you to endlessly pursue more money. Invest your time and effort into doing all you can to ensure that those who are struggling are provided with the living conditions, wages and financial support that will help them to cover the costs of their living expenses. (Helping other people is great for our own happiness.)A just-enough approach to wealth is not made any easier by the demands placed on us by family commitments, especially as your family grows, and social expectations. Social media, in particular, facilitate showing off beyond our wildest dreams. Even without the constant bombardment to reach for more wealth, “just enough” can still sound like a weak counter-narrative to “keep striving for more”. But even if it appears boring to accept that you (may) have enough wealth already, it can also be tremendously liberating. Once you have enough money to afford the basic things you want in life, you can stop constantly worrying.Attending to being wealthy also means that we harshly judge others for being happy with what they have – we might call them unambitious or lazy – thus preserving the status quo and making it more likely that more people will be miserable with what they have. So we need to stop judging others as lazy, uninspiring or unambitious when they report being happy as they are. The narrative of reaching for wealth stigmatises those who do not want more money. Let’s instead celebrate those who choose to devote their time and effort to causes of social worth rather than question them for not accumulating more personal wealth.The desire for wealth has truly far-reaching consequences. It usually means the overconsumption of goods, resulting in global greenhouse gas emissions and unnecessary land, material and water use. Repeated spending on items that are easily replaced means more production and excess waste, both of which have serious environmental consequences.If you are a parent, reinforcing the narrative at home that some money can be enough will help children learn from an early age that the relentless pursuit of money is not inevitable. If you are a policy-maker, perhaps you could start by publishing lists of the top taxpayers, rather than the top earners. When I searched for “the world’s richest person” on Google, the answer came up immediately (Jeff Bezos was giving Bill Gates a run for his money when I last looked). But when I looked up “the world’s highest tax- payer”, the search returned lots of information on which countries had the highest tax rates. If we know that we are hardwired to compete and to compare, then let’s use this to write social narratives that we can all benefit from.When it comes to the success narrative, the first box to tick is to be employed. But beyond having a job – any job – one of the most widely used measures of success is having a good job, and doing well in your career. In Happiness By Design, I told this story: A few weeks ago, I went out for dinner with one of my best friends, whom I have known for a long time. She works for a prestigious media company and basically spent the whole evening describing how miserable she was at work she variously moaned about her boss, her colleagues, and her commute. At the end of dinner, and without a hint of irony, she said: “Of course, I love working at MediaLand.”This story highlights the very common inner conflict between the social narrative of success, which values status and recognition in a job, and personal experiences of happiness in the job. My friend was experiencing pain and pointlessness at work, but the narrative she told about her job was totally unrelated. A job that makes us miserable is not a good job, but we can convince ourselves it is if it has high status. MediaLand is somewhere my friend had always wanted to work, her parents were proud of her, and her friends were a little bit jealous. So the narrative she created for herself comes from the broader social narrative of status.More recent data also suggests that the most conventionally “successful” occupations are not ones where the happiest workers are to be found. In 2014, the Legatum Institute published a report that looked to see which occupational groups were paid the most and which ones had the highest average life satisfaction. Predictably, chief executives and other senior officials were the highest paid, but they were no more satisfied than their secretaries, who were obviously paid much less. Some other professions whose members were happier than their bank accounts might suggest were the clergy, farmers and fitness instructors.It could well be that those who choose careers like floristry or fitness might be happier to begin with than those who choose to go into law. We need good longitudinal studies (which follow the same people over time) to find out more. We might expect that many of those choosing careers as lawyers care more about what others think of them than those who choose careers analogous to being “just a florist”. However, there are aspects of jobs like floristry that make them more likely to generate happiness than working in a law firm. These include working with nature, regularly seeing the fruits of your labour, generally being around people who want to be with you, and feeling as though you have control over your workload. More than four out of five florists say that they are able to hone their skills every day, which makes them feel happy. Focusing on the likely daily experiences of the jobs we choose to take can help us avoid the unnecessary pain and pointlessness that often accompany adherence to the narrative of what a “good” job looks like.The success narrative not only applies to what jobs we have but also to how long we spend working. It suggests that we should work longer and longer hours so that we can be wealthier and more “successful”. As incomes rise, it seems that we pay more attention to the income forgone from not working and so we work more to capitalise on the increased value of our time. Time is money. Moreover, paying attention to time as money has been shown to diminish the pleasure experienced from leisure activities. Little wonder, then, that daily happiness in the US is actually lower for those on high incomes compared to those on middling ones. There is no time for enjoyment when you are using all of your time reaching to be rich.When we look again at the ATUS, happiness and sense of purpose are both at their highest among people working between 21 and 30 hours a week, and misery increases in tandem with the number of hours worked thereafter. The results are consistent across genders. Many people do also choose to work long hours. Some people love their work so much that they want to spend as much time working as possible. I have felt like that at times in my career, and most of all when I have been working on my books, and I know many of my colleagues and collaborators have, too. But this is a quite rare and extremely fortunate position to be in.Many more people “choose” to work long hours because the social narrative of long work hours is so persuasive. Most unpaid overtime (and perhaps some paid overtime, too) is undertaken out of a desire to progress at work and not from any underlying pleasure or purpose from working those hours. The expectation of prolonged working hours permeates a number of different professions, from banking, advertising and law to education and other public services, as well as poorly paid positions in the arts. There is huge pressure on staff to be the first one in and the last to leave, so everyone comes in earlier and leaves later.Last year, I was involved in a TV series called Make Or Break? for Channel 5. A typical filming day lasted about 16 hours, from leaving the hotel to returning, and this was for six days out of seven, over a period of four weeks. Now, I’m not asking you to feel sorry for me, because being a TV presenter is hardly the worst job in the world (although the four-hour daily round trip in a van across dirt tracks to sit around in the heat of the Mexican summer waiting to film was about as bad as it gets for an impatient git who melts in temperatures above 20°C). The long days were justified on the grounds that this is “just how TV is”, as if historical precedent and industry expectations were explanation enough for overworking people. Long hours in TV are seen as a badge of honour, when instead they adversely affect happiness and, I suspect, productivity too.As for the social narratives surrounding love and marriage, the narrative traps are everywhere. Think back on your bedtime stories as a child and I bet these words are lodged somewhere in your brain: “ …and they fell in love, got married, and lived happily ever after.” These imagined happy endings stick with us as adults. An overwhelming majority of us report considering marriage as part of our ideal lifestyle and we often project this preference on to others, too. An unmarried 40-year-old is “unlucky” or has yet to meet “the one”: as if being married is something for all of us, and that there is some one – one person – out there for every one of us.This is wilfully overoptimistic. Any given relationship is much more likely to end than it is to result in living happily ever after. Two in five marriages in the UK end in orce. We have to come to terms with those odds. We expect passionate love to be nothing but pleasurable (when, in fact, it can be quite damaging, just like any other compulsion) and to last for ever (when, for the vast majority of us, the high dies after about a year), and our spouse to satisfy all of our needs (which no one human being ever can). Against this background, as Esther Perel, a psychotherapist who has written a lot about marriage, has asked: “Is it any wonder that so many relationships crumble under the weight of it all?”When a relationship ends, particularly a long-term one, so many people are heard to say “what a shame” or “such a waste”. But if for the most part during that relationship both partners were happy, how can it be a shame or a waste of time? A breakup is most likely to be in the best long-term interests of both parties. How many of you are knowingly with someone now who is worse than a previous partner? We are highly adaptive creatures who are very good at moving on. So, if in doubt, best get out. Don’t let the narrative fool you into staying past the point it would be better for you to leave.Divorce hurts the children of couples who separate, though, right? Well, yes, to a degree. Researchers from the University of Virginia have shown that children of orced parents do experience negative emotions, including anxiety, shock and anger, in the short run however, for the vast majority of kids, these feelings have dissipated within a couple of years of their parents’ orce. Those born into high-conflict relationships report greater happiness as adults if their parents split up compared to those whose parents stayed together. So, on balance, it’s probably better to be the child of orced parents than to be the child of parents who stayed together and who argue a lot. The social story of staying together for the sake of the children potentially harms the children more than accepting when a relationship has gone wrong and walking away from it in a way that preserves the kids’ happiness. We should perhaps start using the word “congratulations” for orce, as well as for marriage.There are many decision-makers who could start to tackle the narrative traps of love and marriage. Parents could warn their children about the dangerous fairytale narrative that love always means living happily ever after. This would then result in less psychological, financial and health-related support being required for the eventual fallout from a less than perfect marriage. Schools could do more to provide teenagers with the basic facts on love: that you can expect the passion to diminish would be a good place to start. This will help youngsters to see through the fog of social narratives so that they can make more informed choices.The legal system also needs to rethink how it deals with marriage and orce, and the welfare of children affected by both. There are good libertarian and egalitarian grounds for the state to stop incentivising marriage (eg, by removing the tax breaks for married people that are not available to single people). It can, instead, allow for a range of different contracts between two or more iniduals, so that people can specify the rights and responsibilities in the relationship that best suit their unique set of circumstances. Where the state does intervene in family matters, it should focus directly on strengthening the relationships that each parent has with their children. In this way, governments can focus on what really matters – strong parenthood to the benefit of children – without having to interfere in the relationship between the parents.Going against the grain of social narratives can be challenging. As I said earlier, it is likely that the task is being made harder by the powerful role played by social media, which, overall, have made visible, and consequently magnified, the importance of having achieved according to the main narratives.It seems glib yet still important to say that social media are not the problem, it’s just that we don’t know how to control our consumption. And it’s not all doom and gloom: social media might also lead to the formation and reinforcement of groups that are anti-narrative. You can find Becoming Minimalist, a group with more than 800,000 members, which actively celebrates spending less money with an emphasis on sustainable living. And then there’s The Childfree Choice group on Facebook with a following of more than 20,000, which allows people who decide against having kids to share experiences and promote the benefits. This can act as a nice counterbalance to the prevailing narratives.Returning to the guy who accosted me at that festival at Hay-on-Wye, he was very clear that I had a duty to act in a certain way. As far as he was concerned, I was “playing the working-class hero” in a distasteful way. Judging by some of the comments that have been written about me online, he is not alone. One of my favourites, for what it’s worth, was “Maybe happiness can be found in the wearing of unpleasant spectacles? And chavvy watches” in response to a photo of me in the gym, wearing my white specs and a sports watch, for a piece I wrote for the .When I stated publicly a while ago that I do not like to read fiction, I was judged very harshly for this by other academics as well as in the press. So not only am I expected to conform to stories about how LSE professors ought to behave when I am working, I am expected to use my leisure time in ways that conform with the stereotype, too. I have often felt obliged to rein in who I am because I do not conform to what is expected of me in my career. It rarely feels pleasurable to go against the grain, but it often feels purposeful. But it shouldn’t always feel so bloody hard.I would like those of you who feel more of an obligation to fit in, at work or elsewhere, to not be chastised if you really would like to behave in ways that are not consistent with the prevailing social stories. Ultimately, insofar as we have any choice over such matters, each of us has to decide for ourselves when we conform and the circumstances under which we want to stand out. We can each live our lives in ways that reduce our own misery as much as possible, properly accounting for the impact that our actions have on other people.We can make decisions on behalf of others according to the same misery-minimising rules. We should have more respect than we currently do for those who forsake social narratives that simply aren’t for them.

He is an expert on the measurement of happiness and acts as a wellbeing adviser to the government and a number of NGOs. His first book, Happiness By Design (2014), which argued that finding a sense of purpose as well as pleasure in life makes us happier, became a bestseller January, looks at how social narratives – “the stories about how we ought to to live our lives” – can hurt us as much as they may help.Born in 1968, Dolan was raised in east London and Essex and was the first person in his family to go to university. He studied economics at Swansea before moving into the field of behavioural science at the University of York. A former visiting scholar with Professor Daniel Kahneman, the bestselling author of Thinking, Fast and Slow, at Princeton university, Dolan held posts at the universities of York, Newcastle, Sheffield and Imperial College London before joining the LSE.When asked in 2014 what makes him happy, he said: “Happiness is situated in what we do and who we spend time with. It does not reside in some story we tell ourselves about what we think should make us happy.”Dolan says he finds happiness in his work, going to the gym, evenings out with friends, having new experiences, talking to taxi drivers… What makes him unhappy? Other people’s weddings, reading novels and overlong family holidays, he says. He concludes: “I am a very lucky man: not because I have a great job and family and all that stuff but because I have a sunny disposition. Now that makes me happy.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f23579310b7fe937dcf82e5883a71136641cbe73/0_179_4384_2631/master/4384.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=631c68f52ba1f9b09b0b5ab40091ad72","title":"government shutdown entrepreneur girl bella berrellez","story":"When the government shutdown hit family finances, enterprising Bella Berrellez responded by setting up a company selling organic body scrubsAs the partial federal government shutdown ends its second week, many workers without paychecks, as well as their families, are becoming increasingly worried about their personal finances.That problem was on the mind of one fifth-grader in Gaithersburg, Maryland (a DC suburb), whose mother was furloughed from her job at the Food and Drug Administration back on 28 December. But instead of complaining, she, like any good entrepreneur, took action: she opened up a business.The business is called Bella’s Sweet Scrubs and it’s owned by 11-year old capitalist and marketing whiz Bella Berrellez.Bella’s company sells sugar scrubs, which is something I’ve never heard of. But please don’t take my ignorance as criticism. I’ve learned that a “scrub” is kind of a paste that you use in the shower and it’s a very popular thing.The products sold by Bella’s Sweet Scrubs are made of organic sugar, organic coconut oil, organic olive oil, organic dye and organic essential oils. They’re handmade by Bella herself and she sells them on her Etsy site for only seven bucks a jar.Bella claims in a report by local television station WJLA that by scrubbing your body with her product just two or three times a week, your skin will be “nice and soft” and smell like lavender, eucalyptus or even purple rain, whatever that is. If you live in Montgomery county, Maryland, she’ll even personally deliver your purchase for an additional 50 cents (a price that I – with all due respect - would recommend revisiting). Another nice touch is that she includes a handwritten letter with each order. Not bad.Also not bad is Bella’s marketing acumen. Ask anyone who’s succeeded in business and they’ll tell you that timing is important – and Bella’s timing couldn’t be better. She not only launched the business to solve a potential financial problem but she chose to sell something cool and trendy: a natural, organic, homemade, healthy product.But more importantly, she used her age and her story – which ties directly into a leading national news story – to get lots of media coverage, including a four-minute segment this week on a local television morning show. Oh, and I’m writing about her too. There’s nothing like free PR to help promote a new startup and I personally know a few entrepreneurs – decades older than Bella – who would kill for the same kind of exposure.But with all her media success, Bella’s still humble about the operation. “I was just thinking of creative and fun ways to contribute to the family,” she told local TV station Fox 5.So here’s your chance to help out a furloughed worker and support a young entrepreneur.

The coin, which was introduced in 2017 and boasts features designed to thwart criminals trying to produce copies, has been described by the government as “the most secure of its kind in the world”. The move means those living overseas may soon be able to spend bespoke versions of the pound coin, replacing the older coins currently in use. Many territories and dependencies have coins based on older versions of UK currency and they will now have the choice to use this cutting-edge technology and design to protect their cash, the government said. Currently, many of the UK’s territories and dependencies use their own versions of the pound which are pegged against sterling. To produce their own 12-sided coin, overseas territories and crown dependencies will inform the Royal Mint, who will ensure the same security standards are met before approving and supplying them with the necessary blank or struck coins. Features of the new coin to thwart counterfeiters include intermittent milled edges and the denomination and year date incorporated in micro-text on the coin. It replaced the round pound which had become vulnerable to sophisticated counterfeiters – with around one in every 30 in circulation being a dud. The Treasury said the new versions of the coins are expected to feature images celebrating the heritage of the territories, with their history and culture pictured on the reverse side. Ministers believe this will symbolise the close links between the UK and its territories. The Isle of Man, Jersey and Guernsey are crown dependencies of the UK. The UK overseas territories include Akrotiri and Dhekelia Anguilla British Antarctic Territory Bermuda British Indian Ocean Territory British Virgin Islands Cayman Islands Falkland Islands Gibraltar Montserrat St Helena and dependencies Turk and Caicos Islands Pitcairn Island and South Georgia and South Sandwich Islands. Robert Jenrick, exchequer secretary to the Treasury, said: “The Great British pound is internationally recognised and as we extend the new one pound coin to our territories and dependencies, we will see new designs emerge that together symbolise our shared history. “In the same way that the rose, leek, thistle and shamrock are used on our coin to represent the four nations of the UK, these new designs will reflect the rich and varying British communities across the world. “From the Falklands to Gibraltar, this move sends a clear message of our unshakeable commitment to our territories around the globe.” Tariq Ahmad, minister of state for overseas territories, said: “This is an exciting opportunity for our currency to reflect the breadth and variety of the British territories. “Each will be able to create a design that reflects their own distinctive heritage as part of the British family. “As well as helping to boost their identity, these new coins will also bring increased security to each of these economies.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bccf5baffddf300f4b9101daa714e187120683bb/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ea28802a8bef713d168ab2bd18c60967","title":"forget these modish posters army recruitment targets the vulnerable","story":"It’s time advertising campaigns focused on hard truths rather than dealing in mythsThe British army’s much-derided, Lord Kitchener-inspired recruitment campaign (reportedly costing £1.5m) could be more symptomatic of desperation than of insight into a young person’s mindset. (Since starting work with Capita in 2012, the army has never reached recruitment targets.)Perhaps there are those who self-identify as a “snowflake” (“The army needs YOU and your compassion”), “Me, me, me Millennial” (self-belief), “phone zombie” (focus), “binge gamer” (drive), “swinger” (team spirit). That last one was a spoof, but there’s the problem – they all come across as spoofs. At best, it’s all a bit trendy teacher – accentuating the positive taken to absurdity. Yet still, this isn’t an example of an army recruitment drive at its worst.The real story here is waning recruitment numbers – the army has 77,000 trained troops compared with a target of 82,500, with almost half of applicants dropping out of the lengthy process in 2017-18. There’s also the question of what the besieged, underfunded army can offer recruits. Don’t be a hippy and simply answer “nothing” because, hey man, war is bad. (I imagine that those who have experienced combat have a clearer-eyed view of war than politicians sitting on their derrieres in parliament.) Like the RAF and navy, the army can offer a great deal – from employment, education and training to teamwork, purpose and confidence. It’s also a job that could get someone killed or leave them with appalling physical and psychological disabilities.This is the problem of modern forces recruitment – how do you get young people to sign up for that? To be more precise, which young people and how young are they?And this is where recruitment drives truly go awry. In September 2018, around the army’s “This is belonging” campaign, a briefing document emerged showing the “target audience” was “16-24, primarily C2DE”, attracted to risk, easily influenced and money-driven, but not good at money management. That’s a fair number of wayward, adrenaline-fuelled kids in the lowest socioeconomic brackets with limited education and prospects. It also emerged that the campaign is targeted during exam periods, when the young are most anxious about their future. It’s also little known that the UK is the only European country to recruit soldiers at 16. The UN committee on child rights is among organisations to challenge the UK about this.Perhaps this is recruitment’s true dark side – not some bungled campaign aimed at personality types who wouldn’t consider joining up even if you offered them a spliff and free latte every time they drove a tank in the right direction. Rather, that it has been known to target very young hotheads, who may not fully comprehend what they’re signing up for. When it comes to deriding army recruitment techniques, let’s focus on that."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0d0b00676d61eba5a65fdb487a4cfcfd57b46aff/0_58_2461_1477/master/2461.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=52f88c4910adc70332436fe8dddf1479","title":"its the thought that counts with brexit gifts","story":"Thank you, all my aunts, for the rabies vaccine, zombie knives and baked beans.

I will put these in the Anderson shelter in the cellar with the cheese crackers to stock-pile in the event of no-deal Brexit food shortages. I understand that you remember the war and what fun it was, especially jiving with the GIs in exchange for nylons and so you are doubtless looking forward to the camaraderie the coming hard times will generate in dancehall toilets and picture house cloakrooms. I think you will find, however, that ‘our coloured friends’ will still be here, as they are from Africa and Pakistan, not Poland.

Thank you very much for the autobiography of Michael Caine that you gave us for Christmas this year. It is interesting how things in the 60s were different to things in the 40s and things now are different to things in both those times, though some other things have stayed the same, or gone back to what they were like in the first place, having been different for a period of time in the middle, which was bad. As Mrs Gove said to Michael Gove on Brexit day, ‘You were only supposed to blow the bloody doors off!’ You’re right, though, Lady Caine seems very elegant and ‘westernised’ and is not like the other Muslims. Not a lot of people know that!”“Dear Auntie Savage. Thank you very much for the set of illegal zombie knives you sent me for Christmas this year. They will, as you suggest, come in handy in fighting the civil war that is sure to engulf the country if ‘the will of the people is not respected’. I agree that we should all practise with them by stabbing things, perhaps our own feet? And yes, you are right, hands are probably better than feet, but some feet could pass for hands and have been quite ‘handified’. I think you’ll find we voted to leave!”“Dear Auntie Zavvi. Thank you very much for the record tokens you sent me for Christmas this year. There is no need to worry, as HMV, despite being in administration due to the pincer movement of downloads, streaming, online sales and Amazon’s tax avoidance, have agreed to honour the tokens. That said, I am going to put them in the Anderson shelter in the cellar, alongside the book tokens Auntie Gladioli sent, to use as hard currency in the event of a no-deal Brexit. You are right, too. Nipper the HMV logo dog is not like the other dogs. He listens to an old Edison Bell cylinder phonograph like a Victorian English man and seems quite ‘humanised’.”“Dear Auntie Eva.

As we return, haggard and hungover, from the Christmas break, the Brexit deal is heading back to parliament. And presumably the debate will also continue where it left off. Prepare for a succession of Brexiteers touting the idea of a “managed no deal” as an appealing alternative to either the deal on offer or the prospect of a no-deal outcome. They’re wrong.It’s worth tracing the “logic” deployed by proponents of this approach, because it has gone through three distinct stages.The EU intends to treat the UK as a third country – as is its right and, in some respects, its obligation – from day one. And our much-vaunted WTO membership will do little to mitigate this situation. Moreover, as Alex Stojanovic, a researcher at the thinktank the Institute of Government, has pointed out, the WTO makes no provision for things such as truck drivers licensing, pilot certification, or transfer of data. In other words, the potential consequences of a “chaotic” Brexit go far beyond just the implications for trade and supply chains, but extend to medicines, transport and the status of EU citizens in the UK and that of Brits in the EU.Recognising this, the proponents of no deal have pivoted. Their new approach is a rebranding exercise – not simply “no deal”, still less “crashing out”, but the far more cuddly sounding “managed no deal”. David Davis, for example, explains that it is simply an “illusion” to suggest that no deal means, er, no deal. “Leaving without a withdrawal agreement is not the same as leaving without agreements.”But while the EU has indeed set out some contingency plans for no deal – and it is true that those will enable us to avoid the most catastrophic scenarios – these are very different from the kind of side deals that Davis seems to envisage. They are distinctly one-sided, temporary, and intended to defend the EU against the worst of the disruption resulting from a no-deal outcome. And they leave important gaps.So, for instance, while they would allow point-to-point flying between UK and EU cities, as yet they provide no concessions on ownership rules. That means, for example, that International Airlines Group (which owns British Airways and Iberia) will have difficulties maintaining its EU licence. Equally, key areas such as medicines and data are simply not covered. And Michel Barnier has insisted that mini-deals to supplement these basic plans are off the table.How to solve the Irish question in the event of no deal is perhaps the most glaring omission from the narratives spun by those who claim no deal is not something we should worry about. Showcasing his trademark disdain for detail, Mr Davis airily dismisses the notion that a no-deal outcome would require a border in Ireland – Shanker Singham says we won’t need one, apparently. This argument is unlikely to reassure the 1,000 English and Scottish police officers who will be taken away from their day jobs of actually fighting crime to be trained – at the request of the Police Service of Northern Ireland – for deployment in Northern Ireland in the case of Brexit-related disorder.The third leg of the no-deal argument, then, is not to claim that no deal will be easy or painless – but that it will be just as painful for the EU27, which will suffer disruption to their largest single trading partner and the massive hole in the EU budget that will result. The logic here is that some member states simply won’t tolerate the minimalist arrangements being proposed. After all, around 13,000 Irish truckers use the UK as a land bridge to the EU, via the Channel Tunnel. The Spanish will be concerned about Iberia’s rights. The French would not want long queues at Calais.If we just hold our nerve, then, up to and possibly even after 29 March, the EU27 will come to their senses and give us what we want – a stripped-down version of the withdrawal agreement that includes a two-year transition period, avoiding any immediate disruption, and which does not include the “backstop”. Versions of this argument have been advanced both by Boris Johnson and, extraordinarily, by the leader of the House of Commons, Andrea Leadsom.But this simply reflects a fundamental misunderstanding of the UK’s bargaining position. The EU insisted from the start on the withdrawal agreement as a precursor to talks on trade because member states identified as the priority issues the rights of EU citizens, the Brexit bill and the Irish border, and it was prepared to leverage the threat of no deal ruthlessly to ensure that. Repeated assertions that the EU was somehow bluffing, and would eventually back down, have proved to be just that – assertions.It also speaks to a fundamental misunderstanding of what article 50 is all about. For all its flaws – and there are more than enough of these to make one wonder why Lord Kerr is so keen to claim authorship – it provides a unique way of managing the passage from membership to non-membership. Not least, it allows for a transition period – basically a unique form of EU relationship with a third state – to be agreed by qualified majority vote. Should there be no withdrawal agreement, there would be no such mechanism to allow for a temporary new relationship to be agreed.Of course the EU has much to lose from no deal. But both sides know, and have known all along, who has more to lose. As we get closer to 29 March – and even more so, in the weeks after, as reality bites – our negotiating position becomes weaker, not stronger. Our basic choices and trade-offs will not have fundamentally changed – they will just have become even more constrained. So while the snake-oil salesmen have repeatedly reformulated their product, it’s still not a cure for the UK’s current woes.• Anand Menon is director of The UK in a Changing Europe, and professor of European politics and foreign affairs at King’s College London"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/626f9f64766c136f8ee017934ba73910d2d5a6a1/0_95_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f009a52a7b7d20171addf9c00b621b94","title":"your pictures share your photos on the theme of healthy","story":"Wherever you are in the world, this week we’d like to see your pictures on the theme ‘healthy’The next theme for our weekly photography assignment, published in print in the Observer New Review is ‘healthy’.Share your photos of what healthy means to you – and tell us about your image in the description box.The closing date is Wednesday 9 January at 10am.

Consistently named as one of the most scenic drives in the world, this route from Calgary to Edmonton through the Rockies is hard to beatWith a flourishing bar and dining scene, and a number of erse and arty neighbourhoods, cosmopolitan, multicultural Calgary is much more than just the gateway to the Rockies. Direct flights from London (daily from Heathrow, and multiple times a week from Gatwick) also make it a convenient starting point. Load-up and learn, with a food tour of the historic Inglewood neighbourhood. The tour stops at the high-end Rouge, in what’s now a heritage site, as well as taking in Alberta’s First Nations arts and food culture.Style-up and get your cowboy threads sorted year-round at the Alberta Boot Company, or head to Smithbilt for the distinctive white hats that have become a symbol of the city – so that when the Calgary Stampede rodeo comes to town in July, you look the part.Head for the hills to start your roadtrip. Banff national park – Canada’s oldest – is an easy hour-and-a-half drive from Calgary. But don’t skip the picturesque and vibrant mountain town of Canmore, just outside the park’s boundary, where the peaks of the Rockies provide the backdrop to numerous music and arts festivals throughout the year.For a town with a population of just under 14,000 people, the town is overflowing with dining and drinking destinations. And it also claims the honour of being home to the largest number of Olympians per capita in Canada, who use the altitude to train. (If you can’t beat ‘em, join ‘em.)In the summer, hit the bike trails. A 13-mile trail connects to Banff, with an additional 50 miles of other pathways to follow. In winter, try out one of the newest crazes in these parts: fat biking. Extra-large tyres will take you across otherwise inaccessible snow-covered trails. Don’t fret, there are hand-warmers too. Afterwards, head on to Banff to warm-up at the thermal waters of the Upper Hot Springs.It’s impossible to be bored in Banff with the myriad activities on offer. If you want action and adventure, try white-water rafting, rock climbing and horse riding. If you want to take it easy, just find a patio, order a coffee and sit and watch the clouds move over the mountains that hug the town. If you want something in between, how about a round of golf? Banff has some of the most beautiful courses in the world. You certainly can’t skip town without a fondue from the unironically kitsch Grizzly House.Put simply, Lake Louise doesn’t look real. Its searing blue waters reflect back the towering glacier that created the lake 10,000 years ago. While in the winter the lake freezes over and becomes a fairy-tale setting for ice skaters and sleigh rides, in the summer it’s populated by canoes with travellers keen to glimpse the ice close-up. When you get tired of taking in the views from the genteel-surrounds of the Fairmont Chateau Lake Louise – if such a thing is possible – take the steep 2-mile (3.5-km) hike from the hotel to the Disney-esque Lake Agnes Tea House. First built by the Canadian Pacific Railway in 1901 as a shelter for hikers, this lakeshore log cabin sits in a valley of its own, and has been serving tea since 1905.The spectacularly scenic Icefields Parkway hugs hillsides and traces its way past more than 100 ancient glaciers on its 146-mile (235-km) route from Lake Louise to Jasper national park.With dramatic waterfalls and sweeping lakes at nearly every turn, you’re going to want to stop often. Head to the highest point of the parkway to stop at the viewpoint for the glowing turquoise waters of Peyto Lake. And leave time to explore the Columbia Icefield, the largest ice field in the Rocky Mountains. You can tour it in a massive all-terrain vehicle or, if you fancy a bird’s eye view, by helicopter. And at the Glacier Discovery Centre, tours will take you to walk on the up-to-300m thick ice of the Athabasca Glacier.Sweet little Jasper – home to just 4,500 people – has charm. Surrounded by natural beauty, it’s an adventure sports hub, and a key stop for the iconic Rocky Mountaineer train. You’ll be spoiled for choice for places to eat. Papa George’s – a family-run Jasper institution since 1925, offers comfort food, such as fluffy buttermilk pancakes, in a homely environment. Head out of town for one of the great Rocky Mountain experiences – a cruise across Maligne Lake. Here, you’ll find the stunning Spirit Island – its tiny grouping of trees, surrounded by crystal blue water, has made it one of the world’s most photographed beauty spots.Head east from the mountains to the metropolis. Nicknamed “festival city”, Edmonton always has something going on – from music festivals to fringe theatre, to farmers’ markets. Make sure you check out the atmosphere of the historic Old Strathcona, which has plenty of quirky, independent shopping, restaurants and bars. Encompassing more than 90 miles (150km) of multi-use trails and over 20 major city parks, the lush Edmonton River valley is the largest expanse of urban parkland in North America.

Focusing on Colette’s early power struggles with her egotistical husband (Dominic West) and her challenging of traditional gender boundaries, it’s an empowering and entertaining tale of a woman finding her own voice in a society in flux. Beautifully shot by cinematographer Giles Nuttgens, with production designs inspired by the French films of German director Max Ophüls, Colette convincingly conjures a late-19thearly-20th century milieu, to which it adds a thoroughly modern sensibility.In late-1880s rural Burgundy, vagabond spirit and self-proclaimed “country girl” Sidonie-Gabrielle Colette is courted by literary entrepreneur Henri Gauthier-Villars, marriage to whom opens the door to an exciting new world in Paris. Initially dazzled by his cosmopolitan lifestyle, our heroine soon becomes aware that her husband’s expenditure exceeds both his talent and his fidelity. Fortunes change, however, when her semi-autobiographical tales of a young girl’s journey to maturity (penned at her husband’s instruction, sometimes under lock and key) become a popular sensation.Published under Gauthier-Villars’ popular nom-de-plume “Willy” (he calls it “a brand”), the ghost-written Claudine à l’École strikes a chord, particularly with young female readers. A series of novels, stage productions, and trend-setting “Claudine” haircuts and accoutrements follow, making Willy and Colette (as she is now known) the toast of the town, while still maintaining the pretence of his authorship. But Colette’s burgeoning relationships with socialite belle Georgie (a theatrically accented Eleanor Tomlinson) and later with the stereotype-defying Missy (Denise Gough, owning the role) encourage her to redefine herself, taking back control of – and credit for – her life and work.Leeds-born Westmoreland began working on Colette nearly 20 years ago with Richard Glatzer, the longtime partner with whom he made a string of movies including the wonderful coming-of-age gem Quinceañera and the moving drama Still Alice, for which Julianne Moore won a best actress Oscar. After Glatzer died in 2015, Westmoreland continued work on the script with Rebecca Lenkiewicz, the British playwright whose impressive screenwriting credits include Pawel Pawlikowski’s Ida and Sebastián Lelio’s Disobedience. Between them, the trio have concocted a screenplay that gives each key character a distinctive register from the hilariously pompous witticisms of Willy, a role West attacks with tangible relish, to the proud impertinence of Missy, a trailblazer who proves that women can wear the trousers, even when the law says otherwise.At the centre of it all is Colette, whose charismatic personality we watch grow from wide-eyed wonder to defiant self-determination. “On my bad days, I feel like I can’t find myself,” explained Moore’s Alzheimer’s-afflicted linguistics professor in Still Alice, and that line came back to me as I watched Knightley’s writer trying to find her place in a world in which her own identity has been effectively stolen from her. “No one can take away who you are,” Colette’s mother (Fiona Shaw, excellent) reassures her distraught daughter, but Willy seems to be intent upon doing just that – subsuming her identity under his own overpowering ego.On some levels, Colette bears thematic comparison to such recent releases as Björn Runge’s The Wife, in which Glenn Close’s character buries her talent for the sake of her celebrated-writer husband’s career, or Haifaa al-Mansour’s Mary Shelley, in which Elle Fanning’s author is overshadowed by her more celebrated poet partner. But here, the focus is on the creation of identity itself, and what it means to be the author of one’s own destiny. Just as Glatzer and Westmoreland’s 2013 film The Last of Robin Hood scratched away at the scabby subject of celebrity, so Colette cleverly unpacks the idea of life as performance, raising pertinent questions about the control of a public image, and its impact on private lives. Particularly intriguing are the scenes in which Colette’s travails become the stuff of pantomime in the form of increasingly provocative theatrical productions, staged with a hint of carnivalesque chaos and evoking the spirit of Fellini.In her best role since Saul Dibb’s 2008 period drama The Duchess, Knightley brings Colette to life with a performance that blends grit with glamour in seemingly effortless fashion. Typically eye-catching costume design by Andrea Flesch (who did such striking work on Peter Strickland’s The Duke of Burgundy) add to the film’s appeal, as does the astute casting of supporting players Rebecca Root and Jake Graf, and the sharp use of locations in the UK and Hungary, which double handsomely for France.• Colette is in cinemas from Wednesday 9 January"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6c0ef65a86d2d0138f92cf4723520995268bac15/0_337_4900_2939/master/4900.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a3725c0f2792a50a5f51a2fbabf80c00","title":"nigel slater pie recipes beef cauliflower","story":"Whether it’s topped with mash, pastry or crisped roast veg, nothing pleases like digging deep into a pie to reveal its hidden treasureIt has been a full week since the New Year’s resolutions, so I think it’s safe to talk about pie. The crust, be it pastry, mashed vegetables or toasted breadcrumbs, is there to protect the filling from scorching in the oven and to provide substance. The crust is also there to hold a secret. Dig down through the depths of potato, parsnip or pastry and you will find treasure to savour – pieces of lamb with root vegetables and thyme minced beef with soft onions and red wine, or perhaps golden smoked haddock with mussels and prawns. I chose to top the one I made this week, a rather nostalgic filling of beef, celery and thyme with frills of tight young kale leaves, with a 50:50 mash of Maris Pipers and Jersusalem artichokes.Later in the week I capped a smooth purée of roast cauliflower, rosemary and cream with more florets of toasted cauli. The crust this time was on the bottom, a crisp pastry case with pecorino. The topping of golden cauliflower curds allowed it to (just) sneak in under the title of pie. I am not sure whether it matters if your crust is as crisp as puff pastry or as soft as a roasted brassica, what matters is that you have your filling hidden. A delicious surprise as you dig in.I know I go on about it, but preheating a baking sheet is a thoroughly sound idea, allowing the base of your pastry case to cook crisply.Serves 6For the pastry:plain flour 150gbutter 75gpecorino 35g, gratedegg yolk 1iced water a little For the filling:cauliflowers 2, largerosemary 6 sprigsolive oil 8 tbspdouble cream 250mlYou will also need a 22cm diameter tart tin with a removable baseMake the pastry first. Put the flour and butter in a food processor and reduce to fine crumbs. Add the pecorino and egg yolk and blend briefly, then introduce enough water (about 2-3 tbsp) to bring to a soft rollable dough. With lightly floured hands, pat the dough into a ball then cover and chill in the fridge for 30 minutes.Set the oven at 200Cgas mark 6 and place a metal sheet on the middle shelf.Trim the leaves from the cauliflowers. Remove the florets, slicing the crown from each (leave about a centimetre of stalk on each), and put them in a mixing bowl. Reserve all the trimmings, you will use them in the filling.Roughly chop the stalks and trimmings and put them in a bowl. Pull the needles from the rosemary stems and ide equally between each bowl. Pour half of the oil into each bowl, season with salt and black pepper and toss gently to coat the florets and trimmings.Tip the trimmings into a small roasting tin, the florets into another and roast both for about 45 minutes, until tender and lightly toasted. Remove and set aside. Blend the stalks and trimmings in a food processor or blender until smooth.Remove the pastry from the fridge, roll out and line the tart tin. Fill with foil and baking beans, place on the heated baking sheet and cook in the preheated oven for 20 minutes. Lift out the baking beans and foil, then return the tart case to the oven for 5-7 minutes until dry to the touch.Lower the oven to 180Cgas mark 4. Fill the tart with the creamed cauliflower trimmings, then scatter the roasted florets over the surface, brushing them with any oil form the roasting tins. Bake for a further 10 minutes then serve.It is worth dotting some bits of butter on top of the mash, or even furrowing it with a fork, like a ploughed field, if you want to create a crisp outer crust.Serves 4For the filling:olive oil 3 tbspbeef 500g, dicedonions 3, mediumcelery 2 sticksplain flour 2 heaped tbsp bay leaves 3thyme 6 bushy sprigsbeef stock 1 litre, hot kale 75g, picked from its stalksFor the mash:floury potatoes 500gJerusalem artichokes 450gbutter 25gWarm the oil in a deep casserole over a moderately high heat, add the cubes of beef and let them brown evenly, turning them over in the pan as necessary. While the meat browns, peel and roughly chop the onions. Transfer the meat to a dish, then add the onions to the pan.Roughly chop the celery. When the onions are golden, add to the celery and continue cooking for 3 or 4 minutes without letting the celery brown. Stir in the flour, and brown lightly, then the bay leaves and thyme sprigs, pour in the hot stock and bring to the boil.Lower the heat so the liquid simmers gently. Partially cover with a lid and then leave for an hour, stirring occasionally.For the mash, peel and boil the potatoes in deep, lightly salted water, then do the same with the artichokes. Don’t be tempted to cook them in the same pan.Boil another pan of water, add the kale leaves, remove after 2 minutes and refresh in a bowl of iced water.Drain the potatoes and artichokes as each becomes tender, add one to the other then crush with a vegetable masher. Set the oven at 200Cgas mark 6.When the beef is almost tender and the sauce has thickened nicely, ladle into a baking dish. Spoon the mash on top then bake for 20 minutes until the crust is starting to colour.

The knock-on effect was considerable, with Tottenham rediscovering their propensity for bottling it on the big stage when they woke up to find themselves Liverpool’s main title rivals, and Jürgen Klopp having to insist after beating Arsenal that a double-digit lead over the defending champions at the end of December was not necessarily an occasion for putting out bunting.So it has proved by early January, a game in hand and a head-to‑head victory having brought City right back into the picture. The question for the rest of the league season is which City we are going to see, working on the assumption that Liverpool will remain fairly consistent. That may seem a large assumption to make but to get to where they are at the moment Liverpool have improved by 13 points on where they were at this stage of last season, whereas City were still unbeaten in the league after 21 games 12 months ago and consequently nine points better off than they are now. Klopp claims Liverpool this season have not yet been seen at their best, and he may be right, though they are regularly playing and picking up points in the manner he demands. While they may still be a work in progress, not quite the finished article, Liverpool are recognisably a Klopp team now and unlikely to react to their first defeat of the season by departing from the script and losing a couple more of their upcoming games.That is what City did, and that is why all the pre-Christmas predictions of a relentless march to the title and a team close to perfection have had to be hastily revised. Even when keeping the title race alive by beating Liverpool in the last game, City displayed some most un-Guardiola-like characteristics, using a centre-half at left-back and bringing in Vincent Kompany to lead a back-line determined to give the ball some welly.On the positive side Guardiola set out his stall to match Liverpool’s spirit and physical intensity and achieved a notable victory. To be slightly more critical, City would have been in trouble had Kompany been dismissed for his lunge on Mohamed Salah, as he certainly could have been. City have not been noted in the Guardiola years for physical intensity and, though it brought a result in an important game, it was slightly odd to see the manager adapt his principles so significantly. Kompany, for instance, had not started a game against top-six opponents since last season. For a coach fond of preaching the virtues of stability this was close to chopping and changing, even if he was fully vindicated by the win.So it should be interesting, to say the least, to see how Guardiola approaches the rest of the season. It has been pointed out that most of his titles in other leagues have been processions rather than fights, with peak Barcelona and Bayern Munich rarely having to come from behind, though the City manager has just answered any critics who thought he might shrink from confrontation.Klopp, on the other hand, may not need to alter his approach too much. If there were a few problems in defence on Thursday it was because players such as Sergio Agüero, Leroy Sané and Raheem Sterling are good enough to ask questions of most defences. Liverpool do not have to play City every week and, when they face less stellar opponents, the chances are that Salah and Roberto Firmino will shine again and Virgil van Dijk will return to being imperious in defence. That is the theory, anyway, though one can readily understand Liverpool supporters feeling anxious until upcoming fixtures against bogey teams in Palace and Leicester are out of the way.While this might turn into the closest title race for several years it is worth bearing in mind that it will not take place in isolation. Both City and Liverpool will be involved in the knockout rounds of the Champions League from February onwards, both have FA Cup third-round games this long weekend and City will shortly have a Carabao Cup semi-final to deal with. Fighting on all fronts is a high-risk strategy, though City have the squad for it, particularly when Kevin De Bruyne makes a full return from injury.Klopp is already being implored by some Liverpool fans to give his youths and reserves an outing at Wolves in Monday’s Cup tie, yet inevitably Europe will cast the biggest shadow over the title race. José Mourinho used to maintain that reaching the last eight of the Champions League was the minimum requirement for any club wishing to regard itself as a big player in Europe and for differing reasons City and Liverpool will probably want to go further than that.Guardiola is aware the City hierarchy view success in Europe as the ultimate goal, even if many others at the club would gladly swap it at this point for another domestic title. Liverpool have been seen at their best and worst in Europe this season but appear incapable of taking the challenge lightly, even with the possibility of a first title in 29 years on the horizon. Liverpool fans, in particular, might feel it is worth sacrificing everything to concentrate on league progress for the rest of this season, though in reality that is usually much easier said than done and the chances of ending up with nothing are high.First things first, though: now we know how quickly a 10-point gap can erode, the next instalment of rare and welcome excitement at the top of the Premier League revolves around seeing whether a four‑point lead will last to the middle of next month."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5ab56d9e6f7230eb5d055824ce791ae99e0d8954/0_59_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=93b5765607b6a3efc38a9fe48a3361c7","title":"west ham v arsenal womens super league live","story":"Leaders Arsenal survived a first-half scare to beat West Ham 4-2, two goals from Danielle Van de Donk proving decisive around the hour markThanks for joining me today, and hope you’ve enjoyed it. Do continue your footballing afternoon with Rob Smyth and Woking v Watford now I’ll be back later with Newport v Leicester. Bye!Couldn’t argue with the result or margin in the end, with Arsenal completely dominating the second half after those scares in the first. They go three points clear. Over to you, Man City!90+2 min: A late Arsenal sub, Little receiving warm applause as she comes off. Kuyken comes on.90+1 min: We will have three added minutes, I believe.89 min: Little is destined not to score! Van de Donk has all the time in the world to tee her up eight yards out and, in fairness, Spencer saves brilliantly. The corner is hacked away a bit desperately by Rafferty. Time is almost up.87 min: Ross takes it, going for the hat-trick, but it’s into the wall.86 min: Lehmann, West Ham’s best player, is in some pain after winning a free-kick in a dangerous position 25 yards out. She gets up and now this is a chance to get a shot in ...85 min: Arsenal are still pressing and win *yet* another corner. It’s worked short again and Mead is played in to tee up Arnth, who is unattended 12 yards out but clips over the bar.83 min: Van de Donk wriggles her way into winning a free-kick about 30 yards out. But first Arsenal make the game’s first change, Quinn replacing Evans. The set-piece is taken short and no serious danger results.80 min: Now Lehmann is booked, too, as things get just a little niggly.79 min: It’s a slight surprise that Little is still on, I guess, but the gaps are there for Arsenal and the tempo isn’t too high now so this is a nice comeback game for her. Rafferty, meanwhile, takes a ball in the face from Mead and although she’ll be OK she needs a bit of attention.77 min: Van de Donk is booked for a late one on Flaherty. She does have a spiky side to go with the knack for important goals.75 min: West Ham show for the first time this half and almost make something of it, the dangerous Lehmann crossing to Ross from the right. This time, though, her shot is blocked. Then Little has a *glorious* chance to score after Spencer fumbles a cross from Arsenal’s right flank. She’s literally a yard out but can’t sort her feet out and the ball somehow squirts wide!73 min: Arsenal have total control of the ball here, and West Ham would probably like to get off with the deficit at two. I think they’ve done well overall though and what this game has shown, in general, is that the mid-table sides in this ision are far more competitive than they were - say – a decade ago.70 min: Miedema can’t quite lay on a chance for Walti and West Ham spirit the ball back to Spencer, who gets away with a rather scuffed clearance.67 min: Arsenal could easily get another couple here. West Ham just haven’t been in this half. A minor delay now though as Mead receives some treatment.I’d fancy that is that. The source is familiar. Mead’s corner from the left is well dealt with but the ball is returned to her. She yet again has time to swing a cross in and West Ham make two mistakes: Spencer comes out for a ball she can’t get and nobody from the home side tracks the diminutive Van de Donk, who steals in to head into the vacant goal.62 min: I’d be very surprised, on the last 17 minutes’ evidence, if West Ham can come back again but this has been a surprising enough game to make one reserve final judgment.It was starting to look a matter of time. McCabe’s low first-time delivery from the left is deflected, leaves the West Ham defence rooted and runs all the way to Van de Donk at the far post. She makes no mistake, and that’s her ninth goal of the WSL season.57 min: Miedema tries to let a Van de Donk cross run onto her left foot and the ball squirms away from her. She’s not been at her sharpest so far, several shooting opportunities having been passed up on, but she’s the last person on the pitch you would write off.55 min: And another Arsenal corner, but Flaherty nods it away and perhaps West Ham have learned from the first half’s errors in that department.54 min: Nearly a dream comeback for Little. An Evans centre is miscued to the back post by Miedema and Little, improvising, tries the backheel. Spencer has to bundle it behind from point blank range. The corner is well defended.52 min: Bloodworth shoots well wide, but it’s been all Arsenal since half-time.50 min: Spencer is uncertain again, having to navigate her own defender Flaherty to claw away a Van de Donk cross. West Ham cannot afford to continue this sloppily.48 min: Off the line! West Ham are again at sixes and sevens, Spencer fumbling a long ball forward and inviting the chip from Little, whose effort is sailing towards goal but headed away by a covering defender!46 min: West Ham are a little lucky within seconds, presenting the ball to Miedema inside their own box – but neither she nor Little can get shots off.They’re back out at Rush Green. Can we expect a second half of similar see-sawing drama?I’ll be back for the second half shortly but, in the meantime, Rob Smyth has some buildup to the big men’s FA Cup clash between Woking and Watford:Well, what a half! West Ham had a fine first 20 minutes and deserved the lead but were overrun for the next 20, conceding two identical goals and finding themselves at severe risk of going in with the game beyond them. But Arsenal’s defence has looked wobbly: it was exposed again by the clinical Ross, right out of the blue, a few minutes ago and the second period is set up tantalisingly now.Out of nothing! It’s a bit like West Ham’s first, coming from a poorly defended long kick from Spencer. Visalli is allowed to head the ball on, completely uncontested, and sends Ross running in behind the defence. She sets herself and finishes superbly across Peyraud-Magnin and I, for one, did not see that coming.42 min: More joy down the right for Arsenal brings their latest flag kick. Mead doesn’t beat the first defender this time and West Ham are closer to being able to regroup at the break.40 min: Evans makes a superb surge down the right and finds Miedema, who eventually works it across to Mead. She tries to curl into the far corner and it’s deflected narrowly wide off Longhurst. Across she goes to take the corner and Arnth gets a head on that one too, but it’s defended.38 min: Rafferty puts it in from the right and it beats everybody, flying out to the left. It was a fine delivery and Flaherty wasn’t too far from getting something on it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b9471d0e164b780d1afe1dfef696f4e555b9ef52/0_98_2590_1555/master/2590.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=761a7023d4a4548a85adffcff956a9fc","title":"woking v watford fa cup third round live","story":"32 min: Woking 0-1 Watford Penaranda, who has faded after a lively start, hits a dismal free-kick which deflects behind for a corner. Nothing comes of it.30 min: Woking 0-1 Watford Usually it’s the team in front who want to hear the half-time whistle, but it’s the opposite today. Woking will be very happy if it stays like this for the next 15 minutes, so that they can regroup and try to unnerve Watford as the stakes get higher later in the game. At the moment, Watford are in control.29 min These are the latest scores in the other 2pm kick-offs:28 min: Woking 0-1 Watford Gerring is booked for an earthy challenge from behind on Success. That was straight outta 1991.26 min: Woking 0-1 Watford A lovely move from Watford. Hughes angles a good ball into Success, who flicks it deftly into the path of the onrushing Cleverley. He moves into the box before hitting a shot that is blocked by Gerring.25 min: Woking 0-1 Watford Woking have had more of the ball since going behind, though the gap between the teams is still obvious. The pitch is in excellent condition, which is helping Watford. 23 min: Woking 0-1 Watford Casey’s high, hanging cross from the left is met by Gerring, whose towering header is comfortably saved to his right by Gomes. It wouldn’t have counted as Gerring has been flagged offside, erroneously I think.22 min: Woking 0-1 Watford Watford break three-on-three from a Woking free-kick. Quina has options left and right instead he lumps it into orbit from 25 yards.21 min These are the scores in the other 2pm kick-offs. Raheem Sterling has given Manchester City the lead against Rotherham.19 min: Woking 0-1 Watford That could have been 2-0. Janmaat’s low, near-post cross from the right is met by Success, whose snap volley is saved crucially by Ross. Watford are playing extremely well.18 min: Woking 0-1 Watford Replays suggest Hughes’s shot took a slight but important deflection off the head of Jolley, which is probably why Edser then misjudged his attempted header off the line.15 min: Woking 0-1 Watford Success is booked for ing. Moments before the goal, by the way, Masina had a shot cleared off the line by Edser. That led to the corner which led to the goal.Watford take the lead from a left-wing corner. Masina angled it sharply back for the unmarked Hughes, who curled an emphatic first-time shot into the far corner. Edser, on the far post, tried to head it clear and ended up misjudging the flight of the ball. Had he stayed on the post, standing upright, it would probably have hit him in the face.These are the scores in the other 2pm kick-offs:11 min: Woking 0-0 Watford Woking are starting to come into the game. Luer bursts into the box on the right before being crucially dispossessed by Masina.9 min: Woking 0-0 Watford Watford have started with a lot of authority, and Woking haven’t really been able to build any momentum as a result.7 min This is a really eyecatching start from the Venezuelan debtuant Penaranda. He cuts infield from the left, beats Collier and curls a fine shot which bounces just past the far post with Ross probably beaten.5 min “A defender denies an attacker a goalscoring opportunity and gets sent off,” says Kevin Ryan. “An attacker es in the penalty area, thus seeking a clear goalscoring opportunity for his side and receives a yellow card. Doesn’t seem quite to add up in this Dude’s opinion. What do you think?”The punishments fit the crimes, no?4 min The lively Penaranda charges infield from the left and drags the ball back to Quina, whose stinging shot from the edge of the box is blocked by Collier. The sound of leather on bare thigh brought back a million unpleasant memories of the stinging kiss of the Mitre Mouldmaster on a cold day in the school playground.3 min The debutant Penaranda scuffs a tame shot through to Ross from 25 yards. Watford have started well though.2 min Success tries an acrobatic overhead kick from inside the D. Goalkick to Woking.1 min Woking, in red-and-white halves, get the match underway. Watford are in their turquoise away kit.The players emerge to a lively, hopeful atmosphere at Kingfield. This is Woking’s biggest crowd for 22 years. It’s time for business.Watford have made 11 changes from the side that drew 3-3 at Bournemouth in the week, and hopefully allayed Alan Dowson’s fears of a cricket score. Woking are without their leading scorer, Max Kretzschmar, who has a hamstring injury.If you can’t wait until 2pm for your next hit of pharmaceutical grade liveblog euphoria, Nick Ames is currently following West Ham v Arsenal in the WSL.We’ll also have updates from the other 2pm games, which are:Hello. That’s enough of the pleasantries let’s do some time travel! I’ve prepared 1.21 gigawatts and set the DeLorean to 5th January 1991, the date when Woking - and Tim Buzaglo in particular - became part of FA Cup folklore. Buzaglo scored an expert hat-trick as Woking beat West Brom 4-2 at the Hawthorns in the third round of the FA Cup, an achievement which registered 9.7 on the footballromanceometer - and which briefly turned him into a slightly discombobulated celebrity. Woking met Everton at Goodison Park in the next round, and played very verily in a 1-0 defeat. The glory of that cup run often overshadows some memorable giant-bothering a few years later. They beat a number of Football League sides from 1994-97, and also drew away to Premier League side Coventry before losing a replay 2-1. That match, 22 years ago, was the last time Woking reached the third round of the competition. The achievements of the 1990s mean they remain one of the FA Cup’s most evocative giantkilling names - even though, paradoxically, they have never knocked a top-flight side out of the competition.They could change that today against Watford at Kingfield, but it would be a serious shock. Woking are five tiers and 110 places below Watford, and their manager Alan Dowson says it will “be a cricket score” if Watford pick anything like their best team.Woking went part-time in the summer after being relegated from the National League. They are having an excellent season, mind you, and are on course for instant promotion: they are second in the National League South, five points behind the leaders Torquay with three games in hand. There is added interest in the game because of the presence on their coaching staff of Martin Tyler, Sky Sports’ peerless commentator and all-round good guy. He has provided the soundtrack to umpteen FA Cup shocks in the last 40 years, but he’d probably swap all of them for a bit of romance today. Let’s get it on, sugars.Kick off is at 2pm.

Unlike most previous examples, Bandersnatch is not a cautionary tale of how current technologies might evolve to further ruin our hearts, minds and communities. It is, rather, a period piece set in early-1980s Britain, when young video-game programmers were becoming millionaires selling their games in WH Smith. Unlike all previous Black Mirror episodes, Bandersnatch is a nonlinear film that allows the viewer to steer the plot using simple AB choices at key moments in the drama. Like the Choose Your Own Adventure books of the period, these choices range from the mundane (“which cereal would you like for breakfast?”) to the life-imperilling, and each path winds to one of a number of possible endings.That Netflix should choose to invest in the required technology, then use it with one of its prestige shows is, regardless of how you judge the results, thrilling, and demonstrates that games still have the capacity to enter new rooms of culture to woo those who might otherwise reject the form. Bandersnatch may even prove a tipping point for interactive fiction. This year also promises Telling Lies, a pseudo-sequel to Her Story, one of the best games of the genre to date, which also uses filmed footage (clips of police interview tapes) to reshuffle the narrative in beguiling ways.The opportunity to shape stories is one of the base appeals of video games, and 2019 promises a range of opportunities for the wannabe authors. Judgment is an atypical example from Japan, a narrative-led investigative game in which you play as a lawyer handling cases that range from murder to adultery and beyond. The Last of Us Part 2 is more familiar fare, a sequel to the developer Naughty Dog’s luxuriously violent, occasionally po-faced cinematic study of post-apocalypse America.For something a little more saccharine, January marks the long-awaited arrival of Kingdom Hearts 3, a byzantine collaboration from Disney and Final Fantasy creator Square Enix (and surely an intellectual property lawyer’s nightmare), whose mythology has become so complex that the games have become a punchline to many a meme. Years of delays suggest a chaotic gestation, but there’s a slim chance Disney has wrangled director Tetsuya Nomura’s creativity into something that honours the glittering characters, ranging from Mickey Mouse to Frozen’s Olaf creativity that he has, in games past, failed to place into a fitting context.Nomura’s countryman Hidetaka Miyazaki has more favourable form his Dark Souls games may require just as much work from a player to work out what precisely is going on, but his talent for world-building and atmosphere is unparalleled. Miyazaki’s new game, Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, is set in a reimagined late-16th century Sengoku-period Japan, where you play as a shinobi (mercenary) whose prosthetic arm seems to have done nothing to spoil his ability to fight.For those players who prefer to write their own stories, Dreams, from the British studio and LittleBigPlanet series creator Media Molecule, is a suite of creative tools that can be used to turn ideas into playable vignettes. Worlds are summoned and shaped, soundtracks composed and creatures raised via a toolbox that is more paint palette than accounting software, and the game may become something of a story factory for the young and ingenious.A new version of Animal Crossing for Nintendo’s share-price boosting Switch console will allow millennials to experience a storyline closed to all but the most privileged as they move to the countryside and take on odd jobs in order to pay the mortgage on a newly acquired detached property, while opting to befriend or besmirch their neighbours. Finally, for those who can’t be bothered with small talk, Untitled Goose Game (also for Switch) allows us to enact honking terror on a village as a mischievous loosed goose.

The number of years left on a lease is crucial when it comes to remortgaging or selling your home, and any potential buyer will struggle to be accepted for a mortgage once the unexpired lease term falls below 70 years. As the government consultation on leasehold homes continues, the issue of extending a lease has become one of the central topics.The “enfranchisement” process covers both extending a lease and buying the freehold to your home – inidually if it’s a house, or collectively in a block of flats. The Law Commission has already put forward proposals to provide a better deal. It wants to see the process become cheaper and easier.So what does the future hold for this complex process? Leases on both flats and houses are normally for 99 or 125 years from when the property is built. In theory, the property is returned to the freeholder when the lease expires – leaving the person who’s paid the mortgage empty-handed.That’s a long way off for many people, but there are other more pressing issues. Firstly, the mortgage issue. Secondly, archaic rules mean lease extensions get much more expensive after the lease falls below 80 years.There’s already a statutory process for extending a lease. The 1993 Leasehold Reform Act gives flat owners who have owned their property for at least two years the right to extend their lease by 90 years and have the ground rent reduced to zero. Flat dwellers also have the option to buy the freehold to their block, but they’ll need to club together with neighbours to do so. The rules are different for houses – you’ll only get an additional 50 years – and it might be better to buy the freehold instead.Extending a lease can be a long and tortuous process – and it comes at a cost. The premium to be paid is a matter of negotiation between the leaseholder’s and freeholder’s surveyors – they deal with complex calculations around the current length of the lease, the location, the ground rent, the value of the flat with the lease as it is, and the value when it is extended.Both sides also need a solicitor. Currently, the leaseholder pays for everything – the premium, their own surveyor and solicitor, and the freeholder’s, too.The consultation and possibility of a new formula for lease extensions puts existing leaseholders in a dilemma. Every year they wait to extend their lease, the more expensive it gets.So should you hold on and see what the government decides? “If you have a physical need to extend your lease, say your lease is approaching the 80-year mark or you need to sell, then you should consider taking action now,” says Louie Burns, managing director of Leasehold Solutions, a firm which helps leaseholders. “If not, our advice is that it would be prudent to wait for the outcome of the Law Commission’s proposals.”Leaseholders may be tempted to negotiate an “informal” lease extension with the freeholder. This can be quicker – the statutory process can take up to a year – and, on the face of it, cheaper. For starters, you’ll only need to pay your own legal and surveyor’s costs, not the freeholder’s, too.But if ever the phrase “false economy” applies, it’s here. When you extend your lease via the statutory process, your ground rent is reduced to nothing. But an informal extension could see it increase.As Paula Higgins, chief executive of the HomeOwners Alliance, says: “With an informal lease extension you have none of the security or protection provided by the lease extension legislation. The freeholder can set the terms of the lease however they want, including hiking ground rents.”An informal lease extension also doesn’t necessarily give you an additional 90 years – some unscrupulous freeholders might just extend it back up to 90 or 99 years. This means you, or a future owner, will have to go through the whole lease extension process again.Burns also warns: “You have no legal right or protection when you enter into an informal lease extension with your freeholder. It’s a take-it-or-leave-it deal.”“Your flat could easily become unsalable after the deal is concluded. Our advice is to always use the statutory route when extending your lease.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9bc966c0ec44ecd79e769f975bbb9bda8e0e9544/0_243_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d8a6f5657e219fb831d552b40066460c","title":"national youth orchestra karabits review barbican","story":"Barbican, LondonThe National Youth Orchestra work hard and have fun with some frenetic percussion and inventive improvOne thing guaranteed to enliven early January’s flat musical calendar is the National Youth Orchestra throwing itself at a masterpiece. Sibelius’s Symphony No 2 found Kirill Karabits pushing his 164 players as hard as any of his professional orchestras, drawing out string playing of depth and warmth and some beautiful woodwind work. The third movement, taken as fast as anyone ever plays it, hurtled into a finale whose closing moments positively glowed. This is, one could argue, the main purpose of the NYO: good old-fashioned training on works that will follow the musicians through their lives.Another, especially given the NYO Inspire programme, is making orchestral playing look fun – presumably the thinking behind opening with Rick Dior’s Science Fiction, a frenetic, shallow mashup of Latin rhythms and B-movie clips. The dozen-strong percussion section was out front, backed by wind and brass, flanked by harps. Pay too much attention to the aliens getting zapped on the screen above and you would have missed the theremin player casting spells into thin air. Where were the string players? Out back, ready to process into the auditorium to provide rhythmic clapping and wordless singing towards the end.Then, in a gesture that was semi-effective but that other orchestras could learn from, they returned, with violins, for some improv to cover the lengthy stage rearrangement for John Adams’s Doctor Atomic Symphony. Adams’s music, based on themes from his 2005 opera about the first atomic bomb test, weakens without its dramatic context, but his trademark gatherings of momentum were effective, the trumpet and trombone solos brilliant. It was persuasive work from a young orchestra who are engaging with 21st-century music and the big ideas that inspired it.• At Royal Concert Hall, Nottingham, on 7 January.

But the Super Bowl’s half-time slot next month appears to be facing an unfamiliar problem: a lack of people willing to perform.As the National Football League digs in its heels in a dispute with Colin Kaepernick, the star quarterback who refused to stand for the national anthem in protest at police brutality against racial minorities, the show this year has become more about politics than music. The fact that the Super Bowl is taking place in Atlanta, arguably the capital of black music in the US, has only added to the storm.Some of the biggest names in pop and rap, including Rihanna and Cardi B, have turned down the opportunity to appear, while one group that has reportedly been booked, the Adam Levine-fronted pop-rock act Maroon 5, is facing pressure to pull out. Rapper Travis Scott, the only performer reportedly secured to join the show, is facing pressure from hip-hop superstar Jay-Z and civil rights groups to pull out. With four weeks to go, producers of the 13-minute event are scrambling to find additional performers for what Variety last week called “music’s least wanted gig”.Gerald Griggs, vice-president of the Atlanta chapter of the NAACP civil rights group, told the Observer it had contacted performers who had signed up to ask them to rethink their participation. He said: “The majority of artists we’ve reached out to are standing in solidarity against the NFL. They do not want to be associated because of the protest that was started by Mr Kaepernick against racial injustice and police brutality.”Kaepernick, who was the quarterback for the San Francisco 49ers and led them to the Super Bowl in 2013, accuses NFL owners of colluding to keep him out of the league after his decision to “take the knee” during the national anthem at games sparked a mass protest movement. In 2017 the player filed a collusion grievance against the NFL, claiming team owners had conspired to keep him off the field due to his protests. He is seeking damages equal to what he would have earned if he were still playing in the league. The NFL denies the allegations. For protesters who back Kaepernick, the Atlanta show is the ideal venue to send a strong message about the league’s refusal – backed by Donald Trump – to support him and other players’ right to refuse to stand for the anthem. Trump, who was angered by the protests, said that if players refused to stand, NFL owners should “get that son of a bitch off the field right now”.The Super Bowl half-time show – which last year was headlined by Justin Timberlake, and has previously engaged Lady Gaga and the Rolling Stones and witnessed an epic, rain-soaked performance by Prince – “is the biggest stage in the world to bring our message to the world about the atrocities that are happening in the United States, and particularly in Atlanta, that have not been addressed,” said Griggs.“We appreciate the entertainers for lending their voices in opposition and standing with us. We call on artists like Travis Scott to pull out.”The first star to clearly link the Super Bowl show to Kaepernick was Rihanna. In October she confirmed she had been approached to perform but had decided to support the quarterback. “She said no because of the kneeling controversy. She doesn’t agree with the NFL’s stance,” a representative told US Weekly.“The offer and exposure would have been great for Rihanna as she’s planning a new album and tour but she stuck to what’s right in her eyes,” a source told Entertainment Tonight.With typical flamboyance, Cardi B initially said she wanted a solo slot and $1m to perform (artists are not paid for the half-time show, but are given a “gift in kind” by the NFL), though a representative later said “she was not particularly interested in participating because of how she feels about Colin Kaepernick and the whole movement”.So far Maroon 5 have been absent from the conversation. The band has not been formally announced by the NFL, but a representative called the invitation “a dream come true” and its participation has not been denied.Levine has come under pressure from comedian Amy Schumer, who has vowed not to appear in any commercial during the game, to also skip the show. “Once you witness the truly deep inequality and endless racism people of color face in our country, not to mention the police brutality and murders,” she wrote on Instagram, “why not kneel next to your brothers? Otherwise how are you not complicit? I think it would be cool if @maroon5 backed out of super bowl…”Griggs said: “We would implore them to rethink their participation. The protest Mr Kaepernick is making over the number of people killed by law enforcement has not been resolved. We would hope they would use their celebrity status to send that message to an even broader audience by pulling out.”The apparent decision to pass over Atlanta rappers in favour of more mainstream performers has also been criticised. Even those not directly associated with Atlanta, like Cardi B, are linked to the city through the management of the label Quality Control Music, also home to Migos and Lil Yachty.The NFL has not commented on the controversy."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2e15053c1a046bd74ad02675d646ace5d2f9fd49/0_329_7148_4289/master/7148.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2ef58b1127cd27ede16f27a90d822479","title":"caroline lucas mp peoples vote brexit green party","story":"In the pre-Christmas parliamentary shambles of pantomime refrains, bluster and obfuscation over Brexit, a handful of politicians stood out for crisp and persuasive performances.Along with Labour’s David Lammy and the Conservatives’ Anna Soubry, they included the sole MP from the Green party, Caroline Lucas, who won plaudits for highlighting the ways in which Theresa May had “turned faith-breaking into a new art form”.And, to cheers and applause during Channel 4’s television debate last month, the Brighton MP pithily articulated the case for a people’s vote on the realities of Brexit. “I would always prefer to back a @UKLabour voice over anyone else but have to say @CarolineLucas absolutely owned the #c4brexit debate,” tweeted Alastair Campbell.However, the praise is small comfort for Lucas. “Parliament has made itself a laughing stock, frankly,” she told the Observer. “Those scenes before Christmas were deeply depressing. We have a political leadership that’s chronically unable to lead. And, sadly, we’ve probably got to rock bottom in terms of the external perception of parliament’s ability to navigate a way through this – which is another reason to go back to the people.”Lucas, 58, is a leading advocate for a second referendum and will be a key speaker at The Convention, a gathering to consider the complex issues surrounding a potential second referendum, in central London on Friday. Its organisers say it will draw on new voices and new thinking, and will be run by, and for, young people.In an interview in a crowded cafe in Brighton, Lucas said: “There is a big vacuum left by the Labour leadership, which I think is incredibly disappointing. On many issues, Jeremy Corbyn and I are in agreement. But on this, I think he’s got it wrong, he’s letting people down and he’s letting his own party down.”“It’s the option that is garnering more and more support in parliament, literally by the day, with an increasing number of Conservatives coming out for it as well. But unless the Labour frontbench swings behind it, it won’t get a majority – and that’s what makes Corbyn’s position so absolutely critical.”Some young people who had deserted the Greens “to flock to Corbyn with real hope for a different kind of politics” were now returning to her party’s fold, she said. “Some are now coming back to us because they’ve been so disappointed that there’s no political leadership coming from Corbyn on what is pretty much a national emergency.”The depth of the crisis meant politicians should put the country’s interest above party politics. “The only responsible thing to do is to work with others around shared objectives. It doesn’t mean I’m close to Anna Soubry on 100 other issues, such as the environment or social justice, but on this one issue I think we’d be letting down the people of this country if we didn’t try to work together for the common good.“I think that’s one of the few positives that have come out of this – actually recognising that it is possible to work on particular issues cross-party, and that doesn’t mean that you’ve sold out any of your policies, it just means you recognise the overwhelming threat facing this country, and you put that first.”But, she insists, she and others in the People’s Vote campaign were not trying to re-run the 2016 referendum, but to offer voters a chance to review their choice in the light of information that was not available last time around.“There’s a carpentry saying, ‘measure twice, cut once’. When you’re going to do something that’s very difficult to reverse, just double-check. The idea of crashing out of the EU with no deal was never discussed in the referendum campaign, and every single Brexit option will make the country poorer.“So it’s very hard for MPs to vote without double-checking on a set of policies that will make their constituents worse off. Many MPs in some of those northern constituencies, like Anna Turley in Redcar, are supporting a people’s vote on the grounds that it’s right for their constituents to have the opportunity to look at new information and check they’re happy. And, if they are, then Brexit goes ahead.”Lucas has been travelling around the country, visiting pro-Brexit areas. “People who voted to leave did us all a service, in a sense, by giving the establishment a bloody good kicking. To the extent that many of them voted to leave because they felt the status quo in this country is intolerable, they were absolutely right.“These are communities that have proud histories but which have been hollowed out by de-industrialisation, decades of neglect, compounded by ideologically driven assaults on national and local public services in the name of austerity.“But the tragedy of this was that Brexit was sold as a way of addressing those very real grievances and yet everything we have learned since has reinforced the sense that Brexit would actually make all that worse.“I’m not interested in simply trying to reverse the vote in a way that doesn’t tackle the causes of Brexit.”If there were a second referendum, the campaign in favour of staying in the EU should be run by young people rather than establishment figures, she said.“That’s one of the positive things that have happened in the past year or 18 months: the emergence of young people running campaigns such as Our Future Our Choice. They are going to be absolutely crucial.“A new campaign around a second referendum has to be about a different kind of future – a hopeful, positive vision of how EU membership is crucial for environmental protection, human rights, labour standards and how we can extend the EU project to answer some of the challenges we face today. It’s not about preserving an economic status quo.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/723e2e183de03d4065245ec87d4db7dc518b43bc/0_0_7080_4247/master/7080.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=105cff2d93d8e5accfac8c1f65e49629","title":"jack monroe i am an alcoholic mea culpa","story":"The food writer, journalist and campaigner opens up about how alcohol took over her life once fame struck. This is her mea culpa My name is Jack Monroe, and I am an alcoholic. I said those words out loud to myself 10 days ago, waking up after yet another binge with a friend, watching Richard Curtis films until 4am, mixing cocktails and bitching about work until we passed out on the sofa.My life can be defined by a kind of alcoholic bulimia. I either binged on it, or deprived myself of it out of misplaced puritanism and later, unaffordability. My parents did not drink in front of me as a child. I had no fake ID and looked 14 until my first grey hairs came in a couple of years ago.I had my first taste of alcohol at a friend’s house party, aged 14 or 15, drinking alcopops in their living room while their parents were away, with some other kids from our church youth group. I enjoyed the feeling it gave me. I was shy, I stammered, I didn’t have many close friends. At the next party I was drinking neat vodka from the bottle until I was sick.At the next, a barbecue with some friends from my local karate club, I was carried to a cab by a burly, furious male driver with my trousers falling down, covered in my own vomit, having downed an entire litre bottle of Southern Comfort. I was 16. I was also lucky that the cabbie dropped me back to my nan’s – I was too frightened to present myself at home in such a state at four o’clock in the afternoon – and saw me safely inside. My nan cleaned me up and put me to bed.I spent my late teens working in a nightclub, back in the good old days when club nights ran from Wednesdays through to Mondays and the drug of choice was WKD rather than today’s MDMA and GHB.Working behind the cocktail bar was a different kind of escapism, a creative outlet with a newfound respect for alcohol. I didn’t drink as I was also working day shifts in a coffee shop and, later, the fire service, and needed my wits about me to pull off my 60-hour working weeks.I left the nightclub when I was pregnant (needless to say, I was sober throughout), and the fire service two years later. I was on the dole, which led to a period of extreme poverty. Needless to say, I did not drink when I could not afford to feed myself and my son. I used the odd can of Sainsbury’s Basics lager in a stew or casserole, but I didn’t drink it. I want to be absolutely clear about that.I fell into a permanent habit of problematic drinking when I moved to London in 2014. I had my first book out, my second on the way, and had been uncomfortably catapulted into the public eye. It started with a glass of wine in the evenings. Every evening. Then two. Then a bottle. Then I started at lunchtime. I had a drink before I did any public talks, to calm my nerves.I joked with a runner at the Observer Festival of Ideas when he asked if I needed anything, “a whisky would be great”. He returned with two doubles. I laughed it off at the time, but it became a habit. I turned up on the BBC’s This Week with Michael Portillo, after a Pride party at the US ambassador’s residence. It was 11pm. I needed six double espressos before I could go in front of a camera. My friends waited for me in a car outside to take me back to the party. I was unhappy, but smiling for the cameras. I was drinking slugs of whisky before going on breakfast television.I was a disaster, screaming at the top of my lungs in plain sight, surrounded by enablers and bad choices, and I was going wrong. But I was functional, and so it didn’t look like a problem. Not to me.I moved back home to Southend in 2015 for a quieter life. I didn’t want to be having boozy lunch interviews with journalists any more. I couldn’t stand the parties I needed to get smashed at to feel like I fitted in. I longed for my simple life back, standing at the stove, scrawling recipes in notebooks, blogging, reading, going for walks.I would love to say I had a great awakening, one last bender, some voice from the heavens but, in truth, I am just tired of being tired. I have a chronic illness that is in the process of diagnosis, and sobriety won’t cure me, but alcoholism certainly fogs the waters when it comes to separating what can be treated and what I’m making worse.I’m furious with myself about the jobs I’ve turned down, the potential opportunities I’ve lost, the deadlines I’ve missed. I hope that this year the bridges I soaked in whisky and watched burn down will begin to be rebuilt.This is my mea culpa. I’m sorry I was unreliable. I’m sorry I swore on television. I’m sorry I missed so many of my son’s class assemblies. I’m sorry my manuscript was late. I’m sorry to my ever-patient agent and her assistants for having to pick up the pieces every time I disappear on a three-day binge. I’m sorry to every editor I ghosted, every friend I’ve flaked out on, every person I’ve verbally lashed out at in a paranoid and depressive comedown.I’ve been a fucking atrocious, ghastly mess for a very long time, but I’m out of excuses. Yes, I’ve had a difficult road to here. Violence, sexual abuse, trauma, PTSD, poverty, low self-esteem. But I know that trying to black out my past with oblivion will just damage my future. I made the decision to stop running from my fears, and to walk slowly and deliberately towards self-nurture, self-respect, and better mental and physical health.It hasn’t been easy. At the time of writing this, I have been sober for exactly a week. The change has been remarkable. My house is tidier than it has ever been. I have reclaimed my evenings, and my early mornings, free from mental fog and headaches and grumps. My creativity has kicked back into action: in a bid to keep busy, I wrote, created, tested and photographed 50 new recipes last week – that’s half a book!I spent new year at two parties: one with my friends Vix and Rhys and their friends, who filled their fridge with iced coffees and flavoured waters and the other with my partner and her friends, who had got cinnamon Coca-Cola in and didn’t comment once on my not drinking. I found a little new self-confidence, standing in rooms of old and new friends, making conversations I would remember, cracking jokes, not being too loud or boorish or inappropriate.This, incidentally, is how to be a friend to a newly sober person. Get options in. Put the booze out of their sight and reach. Make them feel included. Don’t offer them a drink, not even jokingly.I almost failed last week, a hundred times. Walking past the pub on the way to the supermarket, I felt as though a hook had landed in my breastbone and an invisible fishing line was reeling me towards the door. The pain was physical. I was shaking. My back was sweating. I put my shopping down. “Just one,” it whispered. “Nobody would know.”I must have stood there for 10 minutes before, with an almighty heave of resolve, I picked my shopping up and marched home. I didn’t look back. My shoulders and my arms and my heart were aching, but I didn’t look back.Last Thursday evening, my son, eight years old, crawled into bed with me at 3am. “I can’t breathe, Mama,” he wheezed. He was having a severe asthma attack. I bolted upright, grabbed Vaporub and an inhaler, sat him up, folded his arms across his chest the way paramedics had taught me, leaned him forward to open his airways, and listened to his breathing. I was wide awake, lucid, and this was an emergency. I know from my own childhood that asthma attacks can be fatal. I was poised to call 999 if there was even the slightest worsening in his chest.I lay awake beside him for the rest of the night, listening intently. I whispered to my partner on the other side of the bed, again and again, “Thank fuck I’m sober”. And that’s why I’ll stick at it. Because this week, I’m a better writer, a better cook, a better girlfriend, a better mother, than I have been in the last five years.I have been tracking what I spent on alcohol last year by going through old receipts and bank statements. I will be moving the equivalent amount to a savings account for every week I stay sober. By the end of the year I should have a lump sum, a gift of security for my future, and forgiveness for my past.This is my mea culpa. This is a new beginning. My name is Jack Monroe. I’m an alcoholic. And I am recovering, one day at a time."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d1fded38eec0808f0fcc55f068363588c0c28063/0_146_5312_3188/master/5312.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2631d0d7d707a586c0639139959c6e29","title":"tenants rights massive overhaul social housing commission grenfell","story":"Renters need better deal to prevent another Grenfell disaster, says the Social Housing CommissionSweeping new powers must be given to social tenants as part of an overhaul needed to ensure a Grenfell-style disaster never happens again, a powerful cross-party commission will warn this week.It found that social tenants are being failed by a system that leaves them waiting an average of eight months before their complaints are investigated, even when their safety could be at risk.“I doubt they’ve ever had to live in poor housing or know what it is like to feel invisible, like no one cares,” she said. “The case for investing in social housing is overwhelming. We cannot solve the housing crisis without it, but the system must be made more responsive to tenants at the same time.”The commission is demanding a regulator with similar muscle to the body set up in the aftermath of the financial crisis to fix a system that has left social tenants feeling ignored or branded as troublemakers for raising serious concerns. The panel is also calling for a “significant expansion” of new social housing as well as comprehensive changes to the way the sector is run. The commission has spent a year researching the housing emergency, with 31,000 people responding to its consultation exercise.One of the main findings is how the current regulatory system is failing social renters. In 2017-18 the average time taken for a decision by the housing ombudsman was eight months. Deep frustrations were expressed to the commission by both private renters and those in social-rented accommodation. The commission’s full report is published on Tuesday.The commissioners – who also include the former Treasury minister Jim O’Neill, Ed Daffarn of Grenfell United, which represents survivors, and Gavin Kelly of the Resolution Trust thinktank – want a new regulator for landlords based on the Care Quality Commission or the Financial Conduct Authority, which was set up after the crisis of 2008 to protect consumers.The commission also proposes a new national tenants’ organisation to give social housing residents a voice at a regional and national level and the scrapping of rules that slow down tenants from complaining to a regulator.There has been growing clamour for an overhaul of renters’ rights after the Grenfell disaster in 2017. The next phase of the official inquiry into the fire is not expected to go ahead until the end of the year.Daffarn said: “Social housing is not like choosing a doctor – you can’t just up sticks and move if your housing association gets a low rating. Much more is needed to put power in residents’ hands. We need a new regulation system that will be proactive and fight for residents, with real repercussions for housing associations or councils that fail in their duty.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f622c7e63830bfbb9244abd5a2cde161aa638dd9/0_273_5069_3041/master/5069.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2a01cf3c65a093eff6d5accd11c4c586","title":"premiership rugby union rfu","story":"Proposals for a revamped English top flight have not even left the drawing board yet, according to the Premiership Rugby chairman Ian Ritchie.Reports have surfaced of a rift between Premiership Rugby and the Rugby Football Union amid suggestions the English clubs could form a breakaway competition if its demands for an end to promotion and relegation are not met, but Ritchie described that as a “ridiculous” and “precipitous” representation of where things really stood.Minutes of a Premiership Rugby board meeting have been reported on Sunday, where an “unregulated competition” is mooted “if the RFU were to be unwilling to support change”. There would be serious consequences for any breakaway league such as this - for instance it would not be covered by existing anti-doping controls and any players involved in such a competition would be ineligible for England duty.But Ritchie played down any suggestion of disagreement with the RFU over the matter and said discussions of how the Premiership may look in future were at the early stages, and that nothing had even been put to the RFU for consideration yet.“Like any board, you would expect all boards to discuss issues like Premiership promotion and relegation, and we’ve been doing that for some time,” he told BBC Radio 5 Live’s Sportsweek programme. “To be clear, we’ve got an eight-year agreement with the RFU - we work very closely in partnership with them - and we’ve not put any proposals to them about this yet. And nor have we finalised our own, so I think what we need to do is consider this further. And I think it’s a bit precipitous to say that there’s a rift between us because we’ve not had the discussions yet.”Premiership clubs are due to receive around £230m soon from a deal with private equity firm CVC and are looking at ways to ring-fence their financial security. One method would be removing the threat of relegation to the Championship.Ritchie added: “We all have views over the years of promotion and relegation and what happens with teams going up or down. But the uncertainty of that and how it works is another matter to consider, how it works on the economics of the game and the business.”Premiership Rugby’s existing agreement with the RFU, understood to be worth £30m to the clubs annually, covers compensation for player release for international duty, use of academies and payments for English-qualified players among other areas."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/344a659bdc1f7829e7d9e2bce08198f67321ff83/0_328_5262_3157/master/5262.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4760437ca18d52ae6834a7b29e1dcacc","title":"pinter five and six review starry cast bring shorter works into the spotlight","story":"Harold Pinter theatre, LondonJane Horrocks, Rupert Graves and others shine in Patrick Marber and Jamie Lloyd’s bold revivals of the playwright’s shorter playsThe former was written for Bristol students, the latter for BBC radio. Yet seeing them together in Patrick Marber’s production, as part of Pinter Five, you realise they are both about reclusive figures dealing with the demands of family. For all the tonal variety of Pinter’s plays, there is an extraordinary imaginative unity.What strikes one most about Marber’s version of The Room is the pervasive fear. The fingers of Jane Horrocks as the immured Rose are forever nervously clutching the backs of chairs. Even Nicholas Woodeson as her supposed landlord seems paralysed by terror when he announces she has a visitor. When Riley (played by Colin McFarlane) turns up, the fact that he is black and blind unleashes even greater panic. Yet Pinter once told me he saw Riley as a redemptive figure, and Horrocks’s seeming surrender to his request to return home, as well as the way his stick resembles a shepherd’s crook, gives the play a strangely spiritual quality.The idea that one can never escape the claims of kith and kin also animates Family Voices.On radio, it all takes place in the consciousness of a young man who imagines the letters he might exchange with his mother. In Marber’s bold staging, Luke Thallon as the son vividly impersonates the eccentric figures in the Dickensian lodging house he inhabits, including a highly sexual girl and a predatory guy named Riley. But when Thallon finally assures Horrocks as his estranged mother that he is coming back one hears uncanny echoes of The Room. Nostalgia, in the original sense of a return home, is the key to both works.They are teamed with a hilariously macabre revival of Victoria Station (1982), in which McFarlane gives a brilliant display of baffled rage as the controller of a minicab firm desperately trying to communicate with Rupert Graves as a wayward driver.The idea that Pinter’s plays are full of hidden connections is richly confirmed by the works in Pinter Six. I myself once paired Party Time (1991) with Celebration (2000) in a drama school production partly on the pragmatic grounds each play had nine characters. But Jamie Lloyd’s exuberant revival reminds us they are even more strongly riveted because both are about the insulation from reality of the super-rich.Party Time is the more overtly political in that a group of wealthy materialists rattle on about their new health club, seemingly oblivious to the roundup of dissidents on the streets outside. As staged by Lloyd, with the characters lined up facing the audience, it resembles a cocktail party from hell. Celebration is much wilder and funnier in its exposure of the coarseness of a group of rich diners in a posh London restaurant. Lloyd pushes it to the limits creating an air of drunken frenzy, and there are exemplary performances by Ron Cook as the rampantly misogynist host, John Simm as an oily banker and Katherine Kingsley as his mutinous wife. But Abraham Popoola, who plays a tortured victim in Party Time, reappears as an interventionist waiter, reminding us that there is a world elsewhere and that Pinter’s plays are all cut from the same imaginative cloth.

As a gay man of colour he didn’t fit the everyday indie rock frontman mould – he shattered it. As part of our Tales of the everyday extraordinary series, we look at his extraordinary influence. Images captured on the Google Pixel 3 by Laura McCluskeyNobody could accuse Kele Okereke of standing still. Following the release of his acclaimed 2017 solo effort, Fatherland, he’s spent the second half of this year on a sold-out international tour with his band Bloc Party, who are revisiting their beginnings by performing their seminal debut album, Silent Alarm, in its entirety. Meanwhile, he’s somehow found time to co-compose the score for the highly anticipated new musical Leave to Remain, which opens at the Lyric Hammersmith in January, with songwriter Matt Jones.And while his professional life continues to metamorphosise, his personal life has also taken on a new dimension as he, along with his partner, welcomed a baby girl into their lives. They called her Savannah. When I interviewed Okereke for Attitude magazine last year, I reminded him that he’d once proclaimed that his solo album came about because all his bandmates wanted to stop and have babies, but he wanted to wait until he was 35.“Did I say that? Wow!” he said. “I’ve always wanted to be a father, but as a gay man I didn’t know if it was possible.”While being a gay parent in the UK these days isn’t exactly a revolutionary act, back in the mid-noughties a queer black singer fronting an indie rock band was nothing short of extraordinary. This was a scene dominated by straight white men where a certain type of swaggering masculinity was the default, yet here was a softly spoken, soulful gay man whose band was leading the race.Even though Okereke himself didn’t formally come out until his solo career took off, during Bloc Party’s reign his queerness was hiding in plain sight. He was never a flamboyant performer in the Freddie Mercury mould, and he didn’t openly embrace his sexuality the way a new generation of queer singers including Olly Alexander, Troye Sivan and Hayley Kiyoko would come to do. But his tender masculinity and softly coded lyrics spoke volumes.As a young, gay, indie music fan myself, who was many years away from landing the job of deputy editor of Attitude, I can attest to the importance of seeing someone like Okereke up on stage back then. And even though he might have been deliberately singing ambiguously, when Okereke launched into I Still Remember, from sophomore album A Weekend In The City, the queer intent was clear. The song is about two teenage lovers, both too afraid to make a move (“You should have asked me for itI would have been brave”). Here was someone who saw the world differently, here was someone like me.Fast forward 11 years and there’s nothing coded about Okereke now, or the songs he sings. On Fatherland he duets with Years \u0026amp Years’s Olly Alexander, on a track called Grounds for Resentment. “It’s the first time I’ve ever sung a romantic duet with another boy, and that’s important,” he says. “I feel, as a gay singer, you can fall into the trap of thinking we’re not really allowed to express desire. That as a gay man singing about love and desire, everything has to be coded.”That trap has opened wide now and Okereke can proudly count himself among a legion of queer musicians whose sexuality is everyday, yet still extraordinary.Okereke’s boundless musical curiosity has since seen him move into theatre as he scores a highly anticipated new play, out early 2019. Leave to Remain tells the story of a gay couple whose marriage forces two very different families to come together.While it’s clear that Okereke’s not short of projects to give his attention to, his primary focus for the foreseeable future is his own family. When I asked him if he has any doubts about raising his daughter as a gay parent he’s firm in his response: “We’re going to do all that we can to make sure she has the strength to stand in her own convictions,” he says. “That’s how I’ve lived my life. I’ve had to go out and be myself in spite of what everyone was telling me.”Find out more about the Google Pixel 3 here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/19e52fb7454f217de6cb8f78ec5885bb8692b6e8/0_69_2071_1243/master/2071.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0e259990db7ea7c4dc19ebf87fa8d328","title":"tell us about a great retreat experience for the chance to win a 200 hotel voucher","story":"Whether it was yoga or mindfulness, painting or running, we’d love to hear about retreats worldwide that have soothed, inspired or made you thinkMaybe you rebooted your mind with a meditation holiday, kickstarted an exercise campaign or spent a week immersed in learning a new skill.

Every evening after the six o’clock news, this fellow had to say : “Tomorrow it will be very hot in the north, pleasantly warm in the middle, and perishing at the bottom.”What a shape. That was what attracted me to this long, thin country. Could a Chilean woman at the top possibly have anything in common with a man born 4,270 kilometres (2,653 miles) below her? How can a country function when it is 25 times longer than it is wide? I went to find out. This is the story of a love affair with a land where I spent six months travelling from the Peruvian border to Cape Horn it is also a story of return and of the ever-changing past. The working title of the book that resulted from that first journey was Keep the Mountains on the Left. If I did that, I couldn’t get lost.The Juan Fernández archipelago, 650km out in the Pacific off the coast of Chile, was, at the time my first visit, occupied by 550 people and two cars. The largest island was called Robinson Crusoe, as for four years it had been the home of the man on whom Daniel Defoe based his character, in real life the mercurial Scottish mariner Alexander Selkirk. Most of the men, when I pitched up, were called Robinson or Alejandro, and they fished, collectively, for langosta de Juan Fernández – large red crustaceans resembling pincerless lobsters which fetch high prices in the fancy restaurants of Santiago. I went out fishing for langosta with a Robinson and an Alejandro across the bay where the captain of the fabled German cruiser Dresden blew up his magazine in 1915 after the British warships Kent and Glasgow cornered his vessel. We ate langosta for lunch cooked over a fire in the boat, and I managed 13 hours without a bathroom to use.I stayed at the tip of Tierra del Fuego at the southernmost police station in the world, with three policemen who were on the lookout for Argentinian invaders from Ushuaia, the lights of which town we could see twinkling opposite. When I asked my new friends what we would do in the event of an invasion, they didn’t have an answer. But they often put the generator on to watch Argentinian soaps. Prevailing south-westerlies had twisted the beech trees into alphabet configurations alongside the cold Beagle Channel where Yaghan people once paddled their canoes. The Yaghan – long gone – lived off shellfish, and had a monosyllabic verb meaning “to unexpectedly come across something hard when eating something soft”, like a pearl in an oyster.To reach Cape Horn I accompanied a coffin on a 100ft supply boat heading for a north American cruise ship on which a passenger had expired, a round trip of 16 hours. The black curve of a finback whale broke the surface of the grey water, and uninhabited islands dripped from the end of the continent like water from a leaky tap. In the Roaring Forties (westerly winds) we had a hell of a time getting the coffin off our deck, into a Zodiac and on to the cruise ship.The book I wrote about that journey flourished, and this month is its silver anniversary.On my second visit to Chile, 13 years after the first, there were no vats of pisco sour, no strange men and, disappointingly, no bad behaviour of any kind. I took my eight-year-old son, Wilf, with me. I had caught my first fish in Chile, and I wanted him to do the same. We made a three-day horse trek from Cochamó to La Junta in the region of Los Lagos – the lakes – following an 18th-century trading route over the Andes. (It was there that I realised I was too old to travel on small horses up steep slopes.)How had Chile changed? In the south the salmon industry had ushered in prosperity. You could get decent coffee almost everywhere, and people didn’t hate the Argentinians as much as they had on my first visit because of the spectacular collapse of that neighbour’s economy. Bolivia seemed to have taken up the baton of public enemy number one. While my son and I were there, Chileans returned their first female president.And then there was Pinochet. On my first trip he was no longer at the helm, but I sensed him everywhere, stalking the national imagination and permeating life itself. Memories were fresh, and the wily monster was still crouching in his lair. In the intervening years the world had witnessed the bizarre sequence of events surrounding Pinochet’s detention in London and Surrey from winter 1998 to early spring 2000. I had gone down to London’s Devonshire Street to stand with protesting Chilean refugees, holding candles to the white curtains of the private hospital where the old man was being treated for a spinal hernia.He was finally spirited home and, back on Chilean tarmac, rose from his wheelchair, Lazarus style (perhaps Ernest Saunders is a better example than Lazzers). History will judge both Pinochet and his UK supporters.I saw Wilf learning to love Chile as I had done. It was deeply gratifying. I was one step away from Chile that second time: you don’t have the same sense of the open road when you travel as a parent. Responsibility is a roadblock.Wilf and his brother were adults when I made my third visit a few months ago. I was free again. To prepare for a Patagonian road trip I fished out my old notebooks and, re-reading them, met myself coming back.I said I’d travelled to Cape Horn, but on my original journey I had spotted something like a slice of cake suspended from the bottom of every map, even those on boy scouts’ arms. This turned out to be Chilean Antarctica – for Chile is one of the seven claimants of Antarctic territory (claims not recognised by anyone). It was actually illegal to publish a map without this triangle of ice. It made me realise what territory means to a young country. So I had hitched a lift south from Punta Arenas on a Chilean air force plane. At the first iceberg, I saw my next book in front of me – the first ever travelogue about the Antarctic. What happened next is another story.Travels in a Thin Country is a young woman’s book. Re-reading it now from the misty vantage point of middle age, I hardly recognise the solitary figure who shouldered a carpetbag for 4,185km. But she was me once. And now the past is all there is for a writer like me: the present isn’t around for long enough. Would I do it differently? Yes. There would be fewer passive tenses in the book and way fewer adjectives.As for the weatherman, he told me that the real difference in his country is east to west, from the Camanchaca sea mists that creep across a narrow band in the north to the mountains joining the Andes and the coastal Cordillera like rungs on a ladder. I saw for myself that people got shorter and darker as one climbed inland. The country surprised me at every turn. Let’s give the last word to the Chilean Nobel laureate in literature, Pablo Neruda: “He who does not know the Chilean forests, does not know the planet.”Sara Wheeler’s book, Chile: Travels in a Thin Country, is published in paperback (Abacus, £9.99). On Monday 7 January she is giving a talk about her return to Chile, at the Royal Geographical Society, 1 Kensington Gore, London SW7 (rgs.org)In Patagonia by Bruce Chatwin (published in 1977)Still viewed as one of the most influential modern travel books, In Patagonia combines personal anecdote (Chatwin’s childhood fascination with his grandma’s giant sloth skin inspired his journey) with a vivid interest in everything from Darwin and the Welsh to a log cabin built by Butch Cassidy.Venice by Jan Morris (published in 1993)Widely acclaimed as the classic evocation of Venice and the best book every written about the city, or any city. Not quite a history book or a guide, it’s more an immersion into every aspect of Venetian living.Siberia by Colin Thubron (published in 1999)Thubron charts his 15,000-mile journey into Siberia after the fall of communism. He depicts a land of strange, often bleak physical extremes, from the ice-bound graves of ancient Scythians to the world’s deepest lake, Baikal, which reaches depths of a mile."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/baf52b6b241890b0dd64b2c2d161b6b45964952b/0_0_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d8a902b895e74f76d65a238e0961eae6","title":"drc officials postpone presidential election results","story":"Delay in announcement is expected to increase tensions after government cut internet accessThe Democratic Republic of Congo’s top electoral official has said the announcement of the results of the presidential election has been postponed.Corneille Nangaa said the results of the election on 30 December will not be made public as expected. He said the official electoral commission will confirm the delay later on Sunday.The postponement in announcing the results is expected to increase tensions in the DRC.The Democratic Republic of the Congo\u0027s sheer size, its political history and its myriad problems are all reasons why observers have followed its election so closely.DRC is a vast, resource-rich country, its population of 80 million spread over an area the size of western Europe. But it remains one of the poorest places in the world, racked by war and disease and with massive inequality. In the east, where scores of militia commanders battle for control of mines, an outbreak of Ebola has killed more than 300. Across the country, aid agencies estimate that 4.3 million people are displaced.\u0026nbspIt is still recovering from a civil war triggered by the fall of the dictator Mobutu Sese Seko in 1997, in which 4 million people died. Joseph Kabila has been in power as president since his father, the victor of that conflict, was shot dead in 2001.The country’s problems have been exacerbated by the refusal of Kabila to leave power after the end of his second mandate two years ago, which is why December’s much-delayed election was invested with so much hope and trepidation.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspDRC has never known a peaceful transition of power since its hasty independence from Belgium in 1960. Chaos at polling stations on the day of the vote and a block on internet connections and SMS services\u0026nbspsince have severely dampened hopes that the election would bring a measure of political stability.The Catholic church, an influential voice in the majority-Catholic nation, said that data reported by its 40,000 election observers in polling stations show a clear winner.

Membership of the Friends of the Canal and River Trust (CRT), the waterways’ version of the National Trust, hit 28,000 this year. Towpaths are teeming with walkers, anglers and cyclists, and there are thousands of volunteers working on 98 canal restoration projects from Devon to West Sussex to Cumbria. The Inland Waterways Association (IWA), the charity that champions canal restoration, is working towards reopening 2,500 miles of “dead” canals which lie derelict.Wright’s 11-year-old daughter, Emma, who is home-educated, is an ardent advocate of barge life. Her YouTube channel, Narrowboat Girl, which documents their slow journey along the canals, stopping for a while here and there, has attracted more than 100,000 views. “It’s so cool,” said Emma. “I’m learning all the time on the water and the towpath, about birds, animals and plants.”Due to be published early this year, a report by the restoration hub of the IWA will emphasise the benefits of canal restoration in terms of economic regeneration, wildlife and plant ersity, architectural heritage, tourism and education. Putting freight back on the canals is also viable, which is why an inland port is being planned in Leeds.Mike Palmer, the report’s main author, said the canal network was “a huge linear national park – a leisure park, a vital wildlife sanctuary, an important industrial heritage site and an environment-friendly transport system all rolled into one”.While the report is being digested, the IWA volunteers will be hard at work on projects, which include:• De-silting work on an abandoned stretch of the Wey and Arun navigation near the Surrey-West Sussex border.• The completion of a two-year restoration of a hopelessly derelict lock on the Grantham canal in the east Midlands, bringing the Lincolnshire town a step closer to returning to the national network it left more than 80 years ago.• A redoubling of fundraising efforts by the Lichfield and Hatherton Canals Restoration Trust, which raised the money to build an aqueduct over the M6 toll road 16 years ago despite the fact that there is no canal there (there will be, eventually). Unless work on a tunnel under a railway and a new roundabout starts within a year or so costs will increase enormously. The trust must raise £1m by the end of this year in a campaign led by the actor and canals supporter David Suchet: it has just passed £530,000.• Taking the next step on one of the most daunting challenges faced by any of the nation’s restoration projects, the Missing Mile on the Cotswold canals, a stretch that was more or less obliterated when the M5 was built. Motorists on the A419 will see narrowboats crossing the middle of a roundabout there is also junction 13 of the M5 to deal with, plus a major gas pipeline and two more roundabouts. It should be finished by 2023, bringing Stroud back on to the national network.The IWA’s report aims to change the attitude of funders, politicians, government departments, local authorities, restoration groups and even health professionals. As well as the economic and environmental benefits of canals, it will stress the effects on health, a point made by Philippa Moreton, a retired doctor who advised many of her patients to take towpath walks in Wendover, Buckinghamshire, where she worked.Moreton said: “Regular exercise in a beautiful, peaceful natural environment with water has an added bonus. It gives a sense of wellbeing, reduces stress and helps depression. Walking beside a canal not only helps patients with diabetes, hypertension, lung disease and arthritis but also patients with mental health problems.”The report will recommend focusing on micro-projects rather than the entire length of a canal. Restoration should be seen by government agencies and volunteers as a national issue, rather than as a hotch-potch of local groups working in isolation. “There was a big gap in terms of looking at things strategically,” said Palmer, who chairs the waterways recovery group, the IWA’s volunteer taskforce.There are long-running disputes with road builders and planners in Swindon on the route of the abandoned Berkshire and Wiltshire canal on the new Bedford and Milton Keynes waterway and on the Lichfield and Hatherton canal.“Everybody is struggling with planning permission, with highway crossings, with water abstraction rights,” said Palmer. “This report will say to the government, to the Environment Agency, ‘you need to do better on this’. It’s quite likely that even the bosses of any ministry don’t actually understand that it’s a major issue. They just think it’s dozens of little local issues and don’t spot that they’re joined up.”Despite this lack of political will, Britain’s canals have had their advocates. In the 1960s, the Queen Mother and the transport minister, Barbara Castle, were among those who spoke up for canals at a time when the attitude of many, especially in local politics, was that they were dirty, dangerous and of no value.John Dodwell, who has been active in restoring the waterways since 1961 and who chairs the Montgomery Canal Partnership, said that a 1970 conference in Oxford on the urban future of canals “was instrumental in turning the tide with town planners and highway engineers”.He said: “We need something similar now, especially with road builders.” Dodwell welcomed the IWA report and pointed out that there were no national planning guidelines covering the restoration of canals.One of the best examples of a self-contained, landlocked restoration that has improved life is in Stroud. The Cotswold canals restoration, a big project that will eventually reconnect the Severn and the Thames, has been heavily supported for 10 years by Stroud district council.Several miles have been reopened, and the council has moved its offices to Ebley Mill, which was a moribund part of town a few years ago. David Marshall, the council’s canal project manager, said: “The canal used to be a place to avoid – rubbish, derelict, broken locks – and now it’s a place to come to. What we’ve done so far stands on its own two feet.”The Cotswold project has more than 7,000 members, more than any other canal trust. Palmer, whose main aim is to generate more externally-funded projects on the waterways, said: “We want more people to be involved in the waterways.“The purpose of our report is to show that you don’t need to fully restore a canal in order to gain all the benefits. If you start with a small piece of restoration and plan it well you will get the benefits right from day one. It might be restoring a kilometre here, restoring a canalside warehouse that becomes a community centre. A lot of people just want somewhere safe to walk, or a cycle path. And when people see one kilometre restored they want the next, and the next…”One day it will be possible, as it was 150 years ago, to travel by inland waterways from Littlehampton in West Sussex to the Lake District. By road, on a good day, that would take six hours. At the more sedate pace of the canals, where the speed limit is 4mph, it would take weeks.But what’s the rush? The yearning for a slower life, revealed to millions of television viewers by Timothy West and Prunella Scales in the nine series of Channel 4’s Great Canal Journeys, is one of the big attractions of the inland waterways.The most popular writer on canals was Tom Rolt, the godfather of canal restoration who helped found the IWA. In his hugely popular and still in-print 1944 book, Narrow Boat, he said that canal travel “seemed to me to fulfil in the fullest sense the meaning of travel as opposed to a mere blind hurrying from place to place”.He wrote: “To step down from some busy thoroughfare on to the quiet towpath of a canal, even in the heart of a town, is to step backward a hundred years or more and to see things in a different, and perhaps more balanced, perspective.”Fiona and Emma Wright could not agree more."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7c17fd6f39417778335e3f53db11b276360d52f8/0_25_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ccceb91303ccc4c872d76db48d7ba1e3","title":"strongman authoritarian leaders days numbered jamal khashoggi saudi prince","story":"The trial of 11 people charged with the murder of dissident Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi opened and was quickly adjourned in Riyadh last week. It may be that the outcome is fixed in advance. Yet that the hearing took place at all could be seen as progress of a kind. It suggests even a state as autocratic, inward-looking and undemocratic as Saudi Arabia is not immune to international opinion and can be forced, in extremis, to respect the human right to justice.The Khashoggi affair has provided a chastening lesson for Mohammed bin Salman, the Saudi crown prince, who is widely believed to have ordered the journalist’s slaying in Istanbul in October. Until then, Salman was riding high, courted by Donald Trump, lauded at home for modest social reform and feared, if not respected, across the Arab Middle East for his war of attrition in Yemen and determination to face down Iran.Salman’s subsequent fall from grace was swift. His reversal of fortune confounded the accepted narrative of an inexorable, global rise of like-minded, authoritarian “strongman” figures, riding waves of reviving nationalism and intolerant, rightwing populist and unilateralist sentiment. Yet there were signs elsewhere, too, that this toxic surge may be nearing its high point.While the evidence for this incipient shift can be exaggerated, the extreme political trajectories that sent some governments and leaders veering off wildly into the far-right blue yonder from 2016 to 2018 may be beginning to self-correct. In other words, the wheel is turning and a more traditional, moderating left-right cycle could reassert itself. A critical turning point approaches, at which the conduct of global affairs may begin to “normalise” – or will become yet more dangerous and chaotic.Viktor Orbán, long viewed as the standard bearer of anti-migrant, anti-EU, nationalist revanchism in Europe, is a case in point. Hungary’s prime minister remains firmly in control at home – for now. But his hard-right policies, particularly a so-called “slave law” undermining workers’ rights, are increasingly under attack. Last month saw large street protests in Budapest in support of opposition demands for the law’s repeal and the restoration of an independent judiciary and media.But this level of voter alienation is nothing new and may actually be decreasing, according to the survey. Britain’s Brexit trauma appears to have had a cautionary effect, with fewer Europeans than previously favouring similar national action. Mainstream voters may also be more conscious that far-right politicians, even when they gain decisive power as in Italy last year, do not have better answers to their problems – and may make matters worse.Kickback against overly authoritarian or anti-democratic leaders is more problematic in states suffering extreme forms of “strongman” governance, such as Egypt under Abdel Fatah al-Sisi. Sisi won a rigged presidential election last year, and there is talk of abolishing term limits so he can remain in office indefinitely. But many Egyptians have other ideas, as a predecessor, Hosni Mubarak, discovered to his cost. Rule by fear, aggravated by utter incompetence, can only last so long.How Trump reacts to tougher Congressional resistance and deepening legal entanglements is the story of the next two years. He may play it by the constitutional book, but that seems unlikely.If, like failing authoritarian leaders everywhere, he tries instead to impose his will by any available means – such as declaring a bogus “national emergency” – the resulting domestic and global disruption will be severe."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e31a7509ee7ff69585f9d39066d698ea54349565/0_48_3600_2161/master/3600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d5009960b1db69388802a4ee6777b816","title":"sultan muhammad v steps down as malaysias king","story":"Palace statement announces head of state’s abdication ending weeks of speculationMalaysia’s king has abdicated, royal officials have said, ending weeks of speculation about his future.The announcement on Sunday follows a leave of absence by the head of state and rumours he had married a former Russian beauty queen.Sultan Muhammad V’s decision marks the first time a king has abdicated in the Muslim-majority country since Malaysia gained independence from Britain in 1957.“The National Palace informs that his majesty has resigned as the 15th king effective January 6,” a statement from the palace said on Sunday.The palace did not give any reason for the 49-year-old royal’s move.There had been a question mark over the reign of the king, who ascended to the throne in December 2016, since he took a leave of absence for medical treatment in November.Reports then circulated online that the king had married a former Miss Moscow in Russia, although royal officials in Malaysia have so far not commented on the rumours.Malaysia is a constitutional monarchy, with a unique arrangement where the throne changes hands every five years between the rulers of the nine Malaysian states headed by centuries-old Islamic royalty.Speculation had intensified about Sultan Muhammad V’s future this week when the country’s other royals reportedly held a special meeting."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3749141.1546777783!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"fingal council accused of driving dog walking underground","story":"Dog owners stage a protest in Malahide, Co Dublin against a new bylaw introduced by Fingal County Council requiring that dogs are kept on a leash unless in designated off-leash areas. \t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t Fingal Dog Owners Group, in Malahide Co Dublin over the weekend ahead of the protest march calling on Fingal County Council to reverse the new restrictions for dogs in public parks. Photograph: The Chants of “no lead, no problem” echoed around Malahide at the weekend as more than 100 dog owners marched through the north Dublin village in protest at regulations imposed by their local authority.The demonstration was organised by the Fingal Dog Owners Group, which says it is pushing back against a “restrictive and discriminatory” Fingal County Council bylaw requiring dogs to be on leashes in public parks, except in designated zones or, in smaller parks, before 11am and after 6pm.The council says bylaw 4.7 was a response to “reports of serious incidents involving dogs in Fingal’s public parks” which local officals said included people being bitten or scared by dogs in public spaces. It sees dog-owners fined if they do not comply.The group was founded as a response to the law and has grown to have some 1,400 members on Facebook.Most of those who attended the march said they understood the point of the restricted-hours policy but adequate lighting should be installed for walkers’ safety during those times.However, they feel the designated areas rule means they are being forced into “caged pens” with their animals. Steel structures in which dogs can go ‘off leash’ are being erected in some of the area’s larger parks.Dermott Byrne, the owner of a Collie-cross named Otto, said he believed the law was more to do with raising revenue than anything else.“If you remove the dog owners from the parks, the vacuum will be filled with anti-social behaviour,” he said.“I walk a dog to relieve stress. It’s good for your mental health...But when you’re constantly looking over your shoulder it’s no longer enjoyable. The council is driving dog-walking underground.”John O’Callaghan, who organised the march, claimed the bylaw was “totally unnecessary”.The group says it made a Freedom of Information request to obtain records of all dog-related attacks in the Fingal area for the year 2017. The response stated that 83 had been reported, although it was not specified if the victims were humans or animals. None of the incidents listed occurred in a public park, with housing estates the most common location for the attacks.“We were absolutely confident that there was no proof (to justify these measures),” said Mr O’Callaghan.Vanessa Hartford , who has Multiple Sclerosis, says she is unable to walk the uneven fields to reach the designated ‘off-leash’ area in Malahide Castle Park.“The field they want us to walk through is not accessible. They preach about health and safety, but there is nothing safe about that,” she said. “Older people will lose their balance trying to walk across that with their dog on a leash.”Ms Hartford uses a stick when walking and says that managing a dog on a leash is a struggle. “I walk my dog every day, and it is essential that I do that.”Catherine O’Leary (45), who was kitted out in pup-patterned leggings for the occasion, said the bye-law posed a “big problem”.Ms O’Leary’s eight-year-old son, Tom, was born with a chromosomal disorder and she says only learned to stand by leaning his weight on their service dog, Gerri.“We thought Tom would never walk and then Gerri helped him to his feet,” she said. “It’s just an inconvenience to hold a lead and a buggy. It’s really unfair on people with disabilities not to be able to let their dog off the lead.”Ms O’Leary added: “I won’t let them take this away from us. It’s too important.”The council said the bye-law was adopted to “to reflect the needs of all of Fingal’s park users” and aims to “make parks and open spaces safer, cleaner and more enjoyable for everyone”.Council officials met the dog owners’ group in December to “discuss their concerns” and brief them on the council’s plan for “extensive provision of dedicated dog-off leash areas and facilities in Fingal”. A further meeting is planned.“Dog owners remain free to walk their dogs throughout the parks in Fingal provided they keep their dog on the leash other than in designated off-leash areas or at designated off-leash times,” the council said. “In all residential open spaces, dogs may be off-leash at all times provided again that they are under adequate control.”"},{"url":null,"title":"state","story":"Belfast 1994 archives: American embassy official described meetings with NI politiciansBelfast 1994 archives: Cahal Daly told NI minister an internal

accused conflict interest rejects nda debate","story":"John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, refused to allow Maria Miller to ask an urgent question on the use of gagging clauses by the wealthy and powerfulHouse of CommonsMaria Miller, the Tory MP, last night accused Parliament of a conflict of interest over Britain\u0027s MeToo scandal after it emerged she had been blocked from questioning the Government over it.The Daily  can reveal John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, yesterday refused to allow Ms Miller, who chairs the women \u0026amp equalities Commons select committee, to ask an urgent question on the use of gagging clauses by the wealthy and powerful, including the Topshop tycoon Sir Philip Green.Helen Jones, chairman of the petitions select committee, also rejected calls to allow a parliamentary debate on non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) after two separate petitions demanding a change to the law between them secured 250,000 signatures. It came as Topshop was forced to cancel a launch party for its latest collection after designer Michael Halpern pulled out.Ms Miller declined to comment on Mr Bercow\u0027s refusal but, writing for The Daily , highlighted the Commons\u0027 own use of NDAs, on which it spent £2.4million between 2013 and 2017. Perhaps Parliament would be better placed to challenge this abuse of the law if it weren\u0027t also caught up in the use of NDAs, she argued.There have been more than 50 severance agreements, most including confidentially clauses, relating to House of Commons staff alone over the past five years. Last week, Ms Miller called on Mr Bercow to resign over a report into bullying in the Commons, something he himself has been accused of. Andrew Bridgen, one of Mr Bercow\u0027s most vocal critics, said: He should recuse himself from any further participation in the House\u0027s response to the culture change required. In fact, the best thing he can do is stand down as Speaker.A spokesman for Mr Bercow, who has denied bullying or any knowledge of pay-offs to alleged victims, said it might be thought premature to grant an urgent question on NDAs given the Government\u0027s response to Ms Miller\u0027s committee\u0027s report on misconduct in the workplace was expected shortly.Ms Jones said her committee would love an NDAs debate but could not sanction it unless a petition was lodged on Parliament\u0027s website. The impact of the scandal on Sir Philip\u0027s retail empire began to emerge last night after Mr Halpern withdrew from a launch party for his line. He is understood to have felt unable to attend after Sir Philip was named as the businessman behind an injunction preventing The  publishing allegations against him of sexual harassment and racial discrimination. A fashion insider said: His brand is about female empowerment. That\u0027s his ethos. He couldn\u0027t go ahead with this, it wouldn\u0027t be a good look. It would be awkward.

It\u0027s difficult to impose strict limits on your children\u0027s screen use if you are constantly on screens yourself. It\u0027s much better to be authoritative about screens if you practise what you preach,” he said.“We suggest that age appropriate boundaries are established, negotiated by parent and child that everyone in the family understands. When these boundaries are not respected, actions need to be put in place with parents making consequences clear.”Four ways to keep your child safe onlineProf Russell Viner, the college’s president, said: “If you are authoritative - tough love and giving clear boundaries and warmth, that works.”The chief medical officer is currently considering setting new recommendations on screen time for children. But the college shied away from recommending a daily screen time limit for all children, saying more research was needed, particularly on the use of social media.So far, many studies on screen time have focussed on television habits, failing to keep up pace with the advent of websites and smart phones.Next week the head of the NHS is expected to unveil plans to expand children\u0027s mental health services to deal with the fallout from an explosion of social media.Simon Stevens has said the NHS has been left “picking up the pieces” of an epidemic of mental illness fuelled by digital overload.It comes after The  launched a duty of care campaign calling for more stringent regulation of sites like Facebook and Instagram, in order to protect children from harm.The expansion of mental health services for children - and the rollout of a four week target for treatment - are expected to form part of a 10-year plan for the NHS.Comment: A curious tale of what Neville Chamberlain knew about Hitler\u0026#39s evil intentions at MunichKing of Malaysia abdicates amid rumours of marriage to ex-Russian beauty queen Thousands of Belgians brave the cold to take a dip in the North SeaTheresa May says UK will be in \u0026#39uncharted territory\u0026#39 if MPs vote down her Brexit dealWidow of train stab victim moved to Britain because she admired how \u0026#39civilised\u0026#39 it was Homeless man narrowly escapes death after falling onto subway tracksComment: Childhood obesity is not \u0026#39spiralling\u0026#39, and four other inconvenient facts for the anti-sugar zealotsComment: Britain must rediscover its confidence, and lead the world it is responsible for creatingArmy recruits taught \u0026#39how to fail\u0026#39 as way of exposing weaknesses before serviceComment: Stop wittering on about the weather.

The selection of the next king can be decided by a vote in the Council of Rulers, made up of all nine royal households.  The monarch\u0027s role is largely ceremonial, since administrative power is vested in the prime minister and parliament.But the monarch is highly regarded, particularly among the ethnic Malay Muslim majority, as the supreme upholder of Malay tradition.  Sultan Muhammad V, ruler of northeast Kelantan state, took his oath of office in December 2016, becoming one of Malaysia\u0027s youngest constitutional monarchs.Comment: A curious tale of what Neville Chamberlain knew about Hitler\u0026#39s evil intentions at MunichThousands of Belgians brave the cold to take a dip in the North SeaTheresa May says UK will be in \u0026#39uncharted territory\u0026#39 if MPs vote down her Brexit dealWidow of train stab victim moved to Britain because she admired how \u0026#39civilised\u0026#39 it was Homeless man narrowly escapes death after falling onto subway tracksComment: Childhood obesity is not \u0026#39spiralling\u0026#39, and four other inconvenient facts for the anti-sugar zealotsComment: Britain must rediscover its confidence, and lead the world it is responsible for creatingArmy recruits taught \u0026#39how to fail\u0026#39 as way of exposing weaknesses before serviceComment: Stop wittering on about the weather.

as overseas territories and Crown dependencies will be able to design and mint their own versions of it.The coin, which was introduced in 2017 and boasts features designed to thwart criminals trying to produce copies, has been described by the Government as the most secure of its kind in the world.The move means those living overseas may soon be able to spend the bespoke versions of the new pound coin, replacing the older coins currently in use.Many territories and dependencies have coins based on older versions of UK currency and they will now have the choice to use this cutting-edge technology and design to protect their cash, the Government said.Currently, many of the UK\u0027s territories and dependencies use their own versions of the pound which are pegged against sterling.To produce their own 12-sided £1-coin, overseas territories and Crown dependencies will inform the Royal Mint, who will ensure that the same security standards are met before approving and supplying them with the necessary blank or struck coins.Features of the new £1 coin to thwart counterfeiters include intermittent milled edges and the denomination and year date incorporated in micro-text on the coin.It replaced the round pound which had become vulnerable to sophisticated counterfeiters - with around one in every 30 in circulation being a dud.The Treasury said the new versions of the coins are expected to feature images celebrating the heritage of the territories, with their history and culture pictured on the reverse side.Ministers believe this will symbolise the close links between the UK and its territories.The Isle of Man, Jersey and Guernsey are Crown dependencies of the UK.The UK overseas territories include Akrotiri and Dhekelia Anguilla British Antarctic Territory Bermuda British Indian Ocean Territory British Virgin Islands Cayman Islands Falkland Islands Gibraltar Montserrat St Helena and Dependencies (Ascension Island and Tristan da Cunha) Turk and Caicos Islands Pitcairn Island and South Georgia and South Sandwich Islands.Robert Jenrick, Exchequer Secretary to the Treasury, said: The Great British pound is internationally recognised and as we extend the new £1 coin to our territories and dependencies, we will see new designs emerge that together symbolise our shared history.In the same way that the rose, leek, thistle and shamrock are used on our coin to represent the four nations of the UK, these new designs will reflect the rich and varying British communities across the world.From the Falklands to Gibraltar, this move sends a clear message of our unshakeable commitment to our territories around the globe.Lord (Tariq) Ahmad of Wimbledon, Minister of State for the Overseas Territories, said: This is an exciting opportunity for our currency to reflect the breadth and variety of the British Territories.Each will be able to create a design that reflects their own distinctive heritage as part of the British family.As well as helping to boost their identity, these new coins will also bring increased security to each of these economies.Please review our commenting policyComment: A curious tale of what Neville Chamberlain knew about Hitler\u0026#39s evil intentions at MunichKing of Malaysia abdicates amid rumours of marriage to ex-Russian beauty queen Thousands of Belgians brave the cold to take a dip in the North SeaTheresa May says UK will be in \u0026#39uncharted territory\u0026#39 if MPs vote down her Brexit dealWidow of train stab victim moved to Britain because she admired how \u0026#39civilised\u0026#39 it was Homeless man narrowly escapes death after falling onto subway tracksComment: Childhood obesity is not \u0026#39spiralling\u0026#39, and four other inconvenient facts for the anti-sugar zealotsComment: Britain must rediscover its confidence, and lead the world it is responsible for creatingArmy recruits taught \u0026#39how to fail\u0026#39 as way of exposing weaknesses before serviceComment: Stop wittering on about the weather.

His attackers were never caught. Similarly, Hwang Jang-yop was the chairman of the Standing Committee of the Supreme People’s Assembly when he defected to South Korea in 1997, but was found dead in his home in October 2010. Officially, Mr Hwang’s death was from natural causes but rumours that he was poisoned refuse to go away, particularly as he died on the anniversary of the founding of the North Korean People’s Party. “These people live in constant fear of retaliation from the North, whose agents are happy to carry out very public and horrific assassinations, like the killing of Kim Jong-nam in Kuala Lumpur airport last year”, Mr Petrov said. Kim Jong-un’s half-brother died after being smeared with the VX nerve agent, although Pyongyang has denied any involvement in the incident. Prominent North Korean defectors are routinely assigned bodyguards by the South Korean government, but Mr Petrov said is “impossible” for them and their families to be fully protected in all situations. “If they really want to, they will track someone down and make an example of them”, he said. Please review our commenting policyComment: A curious tale of what Neville Chamberlain knew about Hitler\u0026#39s evil intentions at MunichKing of Malaysia abdicates amid rumours of marriage to ex-Russian beauty queen Thousands of Belgians brave the cold to take a dip in the North SeaTheresa May says UK will be in \u0026#39uncharted territory\u0026#39 if MPs vote down her Brexit dealWidow of train stab victim moved to Britain because she admired how \u0026#39civilised\u0026#39 it was Homeless man narrowly escapes death after falling onto subway tracksComment: Childhood obesity is not \u0026#39spiralling\u0026#39, and four other inconvenient facts for the anti-sugar zealotsComment: Britain must rediscover its confidence, and lead the world it is responsible for creatingArmy recruits taught \u0026#39how to fail\u0026#39 as way of exposing weaknesses before serviceComment: Stop wittering on about the weather.

As she went over the hill her silk riding hood was blown away by the wind. Thirteen farm workers in the field rushed to help and chased the hood all over the field. It was finally caught by one of the farm workers, but being too shy to hand it back to the lady, he gave it to one of the others to hand back to her. She thanked the farm worker who had returned the hood and said that he had acted like a Lord, whereas the worker who had actually caught the hood was a Fool. So amused was she by this act of chivalry and the resulting chase, that she donated 13 acres of land on condition that the chase for the hood would be re-enacted each year.

Together, the trio produced such viral R\u0026ampB spoofs as “I’m On a Boat”, “I Just Had Sex” and “Dick in a Box”, the latter winning an Emmy in 2007, its title engraved on the statuette’s base, according to custom.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialKieron Passaway of Vice recently argued the group’s 2008 follow-up, “Jizz in My Pants”, simultaneously a parody of hyper-sexualised music videos and male anxiety,\u0026nbspmarked a turning point in internet\u0026nbsphistory, bringing YouTube to prominence as a venue for professionally-produced original content and a “new frontier for toilet humour”.While the playful vulgarity The Lonely Island often trade in is nothing new, owing a debt to the “gross-out” comedies of the Nineties perfected by the Farrelly\u0026nbspBrothers and the American Pie series, the group bring it off in surprisingly sweet-natured, inclusive style and their affection for and knowledge of the genre they\u0027re satirising\u0026nbspis\u0026nbspobvious.Everything you need to know about the Golden Globes 2019The production values of their videos are extraordinarily high, an asset Samberg attributes to Schaffer’s technological prowess, as is the calibre of guest stars appearing in cameos.

An exception is the high-kicking Daredevil, with Charlie Cox’s blind lawyercrimefighter banishing all memory of Ben Affleck\u0027s turn donning the red jumpsuit in 2003. With New York’s Hell’s Kitchen neighbourhood as backdrop, Daredevil is caked in street-level grit and features a searing series one performance by Vincent D\u0027Onofrio as the villainous Kingpin. The perfect antidote to the deafening bombast of the big screen Marvel movies. Did he do it? Does it matter considering the lengths the Durham, North Carolina police seemingly went in order to stitch him up? Sitting through this twisting, turning documenting about the trial of Michael Peterson – charged with the murder in 2003 of his wife – the viewer may find themselves alternately empathising with and recoiling from the accused. It’s a feat of bravura factual filmmaking from French documentarian Jean-Xavier de Lestrade, which comes to Netflix with a recently shot three-part coda catching up with the (very weird) Peterson clan a decade on. Stranger Things: the Euro-Gloom years. Netflix’s first German-language production is a pulp romp that thinks it’s a Wagner opera. In a remote town surrounded by a creepy forest locals fear the disappearance of a teenager may be linked to other missing persons cases from decades earlier. The timelines get twisted and it’s obvious that something wicked is emanating from a tunnel leading to a nearby nuclear power plant. Yet if the story sometimes trips itself up the Goonies-meets-Götterdämmerung ambiance keeps you hooked. 625 A Series of Unfortunate EventsThe wry and bleak Lemony Snickett children novels finally get the ghastly adaptation they deserve (let’s all pretend the dreadful 2004 Jim Carrey movie never happened). Neil Patrick Harris gobbles up the scenery as the vain and wicked Count Olaf, desperate to separate the Baudelaire orphans from their considerable inheritance. The look is Tim Burton by way of Wes Anderson, and the dark wit of the books is replicated perfectly (Snickett, aka Daniel Handler, is co-producer). If you’re curious as to how Cary Fukunaga will handle the Bond franchise, his limited series, starring Emma Stone and Jonah Hill, drops some delicious hints. It’s a mind-bending sci-fi story set in an alternative United States where computers still look like Commodore 64s and in which you pay for goods by having a “travel buddy” sit down and read you adverts. The Breaking Bad prequel is starting to outgrow the show that spawned it. Where Breaking Bad delivered a master-class in scorched earth storytelling Saul is gentler and more humane. Years before the rise of Walter White, the future meth overlord’s sleazy lawyer, Saul Goodman, is still plain old Jimmy McGill, a striving every-dude trying to catch a break. But how far will he go to make his name and escape the shadow of his superstar attorney brother Chuck (Michael McKean)? Don’t tell Channel 4 but Charlie Brooker’s dystopian anthology series has arguably got even better since making the jump from British terrestrial TV to the realm of megabucks American streaming. Bigger budgets have given creators Brooker and Annabel Jones license to let their imaginations off the leash – yielding unsurpassable episodes such as virtual reality love story San Junipero and Star Trek parody USS Callister, which has bagged a bunch of Emmys. David Fincher produces this serial killer drama based on the writings of a real-life FBI psychological profiler. It’s the post-Watergate Seventies and two maverick G-Men (Jonathan Groff and Holt McCallany) are going out on a limb by utilising the latest psychological research to get inside the heads of a motley assembly of real-life sociopathic murders – including the notorious “Co-Ed” butcher Ed Kemper, brought chillingly to live in an Emmy-nominated performance by Cameron Britton. A right royal blockbuster from dramatist Peter Morgan (The Queen, Frost  Nixon). Tracing the reign of Elizabeth II from her days as a wide-eyed young woman propelled to the throne after the surprise early death of her father, The Crown humanises the royals even as it paints their private lives as a bodice-ripping soap. Matt Smith is charmingly roguish as Prince Philip and Vanessa Kirby has ascended the Hollywood ranks on the back of her turn as the flawed yet sympathetic Princess Margaret. This drug trafficking caper spells out exactly what kind of series it is with an early scene in which two gangsters zip around a multi-level carpark on a motorbike firing a machine gun. Narcos, in other words, is for people who consider Pacino’s Scarface a touch too understated. Series one and two feature a mesmerising performance by Wagner Moura as Columbian cocaine kingpin Pablo Escobar, while season three focuses on the notorious Cali cartel. Reported to be one of Netflix’s biggest hits – the company doesn’t release audience figures – the fourth season turns its attention to Mexico’s interminable drugs wars. A cloud hangs over Aziz Ansari’s future after he was embroiled in the #MeToo scandal. But whatever happens, he has left us with a humane and riveting sitcom about an Ansari-proximate character looking for love and trying to establish himself professionally in contemporary New York. One of Netflix’s early blockbusters, the sprawling soap opera updates Dallas to modern day southern Florida. Against the edge-of-civilisation backdrop of the Florida Keys, Kyle Chandler plays the local detective and favourite son of a well-to-do family. Their idyllic lives are thrown into chaos with the return of the clan’s black sheep (an unnervingly intense Ben Mendelsohn). The story is spectacularly hokey but searing performances by Chandler and Mendelsohn, and by Sissy Spacek and the late Sam Shepard as their imperious parents, make Bloodline compelling – a guilty pleasure that, actually, you shouldn’t feel all that guilty about. You can almost smell the shoddy sanitation and horse-manure in this lavish murder-mystery set in 19th New York. We’re firmly in Martin Scorsese\u0027s Gangs of New York territory, with a serial killer bumping off boy prostitutes across Manhattan. Enter pioneering criminal psychologist Dr Laszlo Kreisler (Daniel Brühl), aided by newspaper man John Moore (Luke Evans) and feisty lady detective Sara Howard (Dakota Fanning). Judd Apatow bring his signature gross-out comedy to the small screen. Love, which Apatow produced, is a masterclass in restraint compared to 40 Year Old Virgin, Knocked Up etc. Paul Rust is Gus, a nerdish movie set tutor, whose develops a crush on Gillian Jacobs’s too-cool-for-school radio producer Mickey. Romance, of a sort, blossoms – but Love’s triumph is to acknowledge the complications of real life and to disabuse its characters of the idea that there’s such a thing as a straightforward happy ending. Hipster LA provides the bustling setting. Who says reality TV has to be nasty and manipulative? This updating of the early 2000s hit Queer Eye for the Straight Guy has five stereotype-challenging gay men sharing lifestyle tips and fashion advice with an engaging cast of All American schlubs (the first two seasons are shot mostly in the state of Georgia). There are laughs – but serious moment too, such as when one of the crew refuses to enter a church because of the still unhealed scars of his strict Christian upbringing. A high-gloss revamping of the traditional TV food show. Each episode profiles a high wattage international chef across its three seasons, the series has featured gastronomic superstars from the US, Argentina, India and Korea. A disastrous group interview in which actor Jason Bateman “mansplained” away the bullying co-star Jessica Walter had suffered at the hands of fellow cast-member Jeffrey Tambor meant season five of Arrested Development was fatally compromised before it even landed. Yet Netflix’s return to the dysfunctional world of the Bluth family stands on its merits and is a worthy addition to the surreal humour of seasons one through three (series four, which had to work around the busy schedules of the cast, is disposable by comparison). Netflix does Bladerunner with this sumptuous adaptation of the cult Richard Morgan novel. The setting is a neon-splashed cyberpunk future in which the super-wealthy live forever by uploading the consciousness into new “skins”. Enter rebel-turned-detective Takeshi Kovacs (Joel Kinnaman), hired to find out who killed a (since resurrected) zillionaire industrialist while dealing with fallout from his own troubled past. Rumoured to be one of Netflix’s most expensive projects yet, for its second run, Anthony Mackie (aka Marvel’s Falcon) replaced Kinnaman as the shape-shifting Kovacs.2125 Rick and MortyDan Harmon, creator of cult sitcom Community (also on Netflix), finds the perfect outlet for zany fanboy imagination with this crazed animated comedy about a Marty McFlyDoc Brown-esque duo of time travellers. Every genre imaginable is parodied with the manic energy and zinging dialogue we have come to expect from Harmon.Mad Men’s Alison Brie is our entry point into this comedy-drama inspired by a real life all-female wrestling league in the Eighties. Ruth Wilder (Brie) is a down-on-her luck actor who, out of desperation, signs up a wrestling competition willed into being by Sam Sylvia (podcast king Marc Maron). Britrock singer Kate Nash is one of her her fellow troupe members: the larger than life Rhonda “Britannica” Richardson.Deadpan animated satire about an idiot super spy with shaken and stirred mother issues. One of the most ambitious modern comedies, animated or otherwise, Archer tries on different varieties of humour for size and even occasionally tugs at the heart strings.Breaking Bad for those with short attention s. The saga of Walter White took years to track the iconic anti-hero’s rise from mild mannered everyman to dead-eyed criminal. Ozark gets there in the first half hour as nebbish Chicago accountant Marty Byrde (Jason Bateman) agrees to serve as lieutenant for the Mexican mob in the hillbilly heartlands of Ozark, Missouri (in return they thoughtfully spare his life). Bateman, usually seen in comedy roles, is a revelation as is Laura Linney as his nasty wife Wendy. There is also a break-out performance by Julia Garner playing the scion of a local redneck crime family.A heavenly comedy with a twist. Eleanor Shellstrop (Kristen Bell) is a cynical schlub waved through the Pearly Gates by mistake after dying in a bizarre supermarket accident. There she must remain above the suspicions of seemingly well-meaning but disorganised angel Michael (Ted Danson) whilst also negotiating fractious relationships with do-gooder Chidi (William Jackson Harper), spoiled princess Tahani (former T4 presenter Jameela Jamil) and ex-drug dealer Jason (Manny Jacinto).A cartoon about a talking horse, starring the goofy older brother from Arrested Development… on paper little about BoJack Horseman screams “must watch”. Yet the series almost immediately transcended its format to deliver a moving and very funny rumination on depression and middle-age malaise. Will Arnett plays BoJack – one time star of Nineties hit sitcom Horsin’ Around – as a lost soul whose turbo-charged narcissism prevents him getting his life together. A valentine to the Spielberg school of Eighties blockbuster, with Winona Ryder as a small town mom whose son is abducted by a transdimensional monster. ET, Goonies, Close Encounters, Alien and everything Stephen King wrote between 1975 and 1990 are all tossed into the blender by Millennial writer-creators the Duffer brothers. It was clear Stranger Things was going to be a mega-smash when Barb – the “best friend” character eaten in the second episode – went viral the weekend it dropped.

When adjusted for inflation, credit card debt is fractionally below a peak reached in Early\u0026nbsp2010 as the country emerged from one of the deepest recessions in its history.People with low incomes or living in poverty were turning to credit cards because of their heavy marketing and easy availability, according to David Steele of The Money Charity.Credit card lending continues to rise as interest rate hike loomsWhen personal loans are added in, each UK household has almost £8,000 of outstanding consumer credit.The Money Advice Service (MAS) estimates that 8.3 million people in the UK are over-indebted, and that 22 per cent of UK adults have less than £100 in savings, making them highly vulnerable to a financial shock such as losing their job or incurring unexpected bills.The precarious position of so many household could pose a wider threat, according to the BoE which warned more than a year ago that banks were in danger of underestimating the risks they face from being too lax in lending to consumers.\u0026nbspIf the economy were to enter a new downturn, lenders could incur £30bn of losses on their lending on credit cards, personal loans and for car finance, the BoE said in July 2017.But consumer credit, which includes credit cards, store cards, car finance and other loans grew 7.1 per cent in the year to the end of November to £215.4bn.Despite ongoing fears about the future of the economy as the UK prepares to leave the EU Britons have increased their total amount of credit card debt in every month since July 2013 as wages have lagged behind the rising cost of living.Earnings growth picked up to the highest level for a decade in the final quarter of 2018 but this has done little to make up for 10\u0026nbspyears of wage stagnation that has left average inflation-adjusted earnings still languishing below their pre-crisis levels.Sue Anderson of StepChange, which provides free advice for those facing debt problems, said credit cards are the single most common issue the charity encounters.\u0026nbsp“More than two thirds of people we helped in the first six months of last year had credit card debt, with an average of around £7,600 on their outstanding borrowing on cards,” Ms Anderson said.\u0026nbspConsumer credit growth slows in DecemberConsumer credit growth hits new 11-year highMore than a third of single mothers in debt, research findsOil-hungry companies are contributing to huge debt problems in Africa“Credit cards can be useful and convenient, and when used as originally intended for short-term purposes, can be a helpful way of timing payments.\u0026nbsp“But if borrowing builds up without being paid back on a monthly basis, it can become expensive and increasingly difficult to pay off – which is why the regulator is now requiring firms to take steps to help their customers address persistent credit card debt. If you are struggling to manage, seek free advice from a reputable debt charity.”The figures highlight a ide in the UK between those able to borrow at close to record-low rates against the value of their homes and others pressured into taking out high-cost credit in order to make ends meet.While interest rates have remained close to historic lows as the economy continues to grow slowly, the average APR on credit card lending bearing interest was 18.5 per cent in October 2018, higher than the 15 per cent seen in 2006 before the financial crisis.What to do if you want to reduce your credit card debt“Don’t panic,” says David Steele of The Money Charity. “Don’t get pressured into doing something before you have had time to take advice. There are usually managed ways out.”Contact\u0026nbspStepChange\u0026nbspon 0800 138 1111.

Transferring a debt from a card with a high rate of interest to one with low or 0 per cent interest could help you pay off the debt faster.Make an assessment of all of your borrowing across cards, loans, overdrafts etc. Make sure you are paying off those with the highest interest rates and charges firstWhen charges are taken into account, overdrafts can sometimes be more expensiveHowever, remember that credit cards should not take priority over debts such as Council Tax, rent or utilities, where the consequences of not paying may be worseA January 2018 report from the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) found that one in four of the UK’s poorest households are in arrears with debts or are spending a quarter of their income or more on debt repayments.Borrowers could face a further squeeze with the BoE\u0026nbspexpected to raise its benchmark interest rate further this year, a move that will probably be passed on to consumers.However, millions of consumers do not pay any interest on their credit card debt, either because they clear their balance each month or because they have secured a 0 per cent deal. Just under 45 per cent of credit card balances pay no interest, according to UK Finance, an industry trade body.Those paying high interest rates may be able to transfer their balance to a cheaper card or consolidate their debts into one loan with a lower rate.The average APR for a £5,000 personal loan in October 2018 was 7.7 per cent while for a £10,000 loan it was 3.8 per cent.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

If you were a bored teenager in the late 20th century, there was always Woolworths to loiter in.An American import, Woolworths first arrived in the UK in Edwardian Liverpool. The inaugural “penny and sixpence store” opened its doors on 5 November 1909 with a ceremony featuring a live orchestra, circus performers and fireworks.Pennsylvanian entrepreneur Frank Winfield Woolworth soon had 40 British branches up and running, proving his doubters within the US head office wrong. They initially feared venturing across the Atlantic might lead them into a commercial “bear’s den”.By 1930, the 400th branch of Woolworth was opened in Southport, Lancashire. By the time the brand’s popularity peaked in the 1960s, the company had 1,141 branches around the country.\u0026nbspKirkby New Town, Lancashire, in 1967 (George W HalesFox PhotosGetty)Woolworths began to run into trouble in the 1980s and responded by pulling out of the Irish market and abandoning its out-of-town hypermarket format stores as a failure. It also vacated its big city centre department store premises like Briggate in Leeds in favour of open single-storey shops.At the turn of the millennium, the company tried various means to stay afloat, attempting to rival Argos with a “Big Red Book” ordering scheme and hiring oddly matched celebrities like Jackie Chan and Kelly Osbourne for their advertising campaigns.\u0026nbspBy late 2008, administrators Deloitte had been called in and all remaining 807 stores were gradually closed, resulting in 27,000 job losses. Investor Theo Paphitis was among those interested in saving the day before abandoning the project as a lost cause.The last of the company\u0027s stock was being sold off at bargain prices.Asked about the closure, Brixton shopper Lucy Ferguson hit the nail on the head when she said: “The problem was, you never really knew what Woolworths sold.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

When adjusted for inflation, credit card debt is fractionally below a peak reached in Early\u0026nbsp2010 as the country emerged from one of the deepest recessions in its history.People with low incomes or living in poverty were turning to credit cards because of their heavy marketing and easy availability, according to David Steele of The Money Charity.Credit card lending continues to rise as interest rate hike loomsWhen personal loans are added in, each UK household has almost £8,000 of outstanding consumer credit.The Money Advice Service (MAS) estimates that 8.3 million people in the UK are over-indebted, and that 22 per cent of UK adults have less than £100 in savings, making them highly vulnerable to a financial shock such as losing their job or incurring unexpected bills.The precarious position of so many household could pose a wider threat, according to the BoE which warned more than a year ago that banks were in danger of underestimating the risks they face from being too lax in lending to consumers.\u0026nbspIf the economy were to enter a new downturn, lenders could incur £30bn of losses on their lending on credit cards, personal loans and for car finance, the BoE said in July 2017.But consumer credit, which includes credit cards, store cards, car finance and other loans grew 7.1 per cent in the year to the end of November to £215.4bn.Despite ongoing fears about the future of the economy as the UK prepares to leave the EU Britons have increased their total amount of credit card debt in every month since July 2013 as wages have lagged behind the rising cost of living.Earnings growth picked up to the highest level for a decade in the final quarter of 2018 but this has done little to make up for 10\u0026nbspyears of wage stagnation that has left average inflation-adjusted earnings still languishing below their pre-crisis levels.Sue Anderson of StepChange, which provides free advice for those facing debt problems, said credit cards are the single most common issue the charity encounters.\u0026nbsp“More than two thirds of people we helped in the first six months of last year had credit card debt, with an average of around £7,600 on their outstanding borrowing on cards,” Ms Anderson said.\u0026nbspConsumer credit growth slows in DecemberConsumer credit growth hits new 11-year highMore than a third of single mothers in debt, research findsOil-hungry companies are contributing to huge debt problems in Africa“Credit cards can be useful and convenient, and when used as originally intended for short-term purposes, can be a helpful way of timing payments.\u0026nbsp“But if borrowing builds up without being paid back on a monthly basis, it can become expensive and increasingly difficult to pay off – which is why the regulator is now requiring firms to take steps to help their customers address persistent credit card debt. If you are struggling to manage, seek free advice from a reputable debt charity.”The figures highlight a ide in the UK between those able to borrow at close to record-low rates against the value of their homes and others pressured into taking out high-cost credit in order to make ends meet.While interest rates have remained close to historic lows as the economy continues to grow slowly, the average APR on credit card lending bearing interest was 18.5 per cent in October 2018, higher than the 15 per cent seen in 2006 before the financial crisis.What to do if you want to reduce your credit card debt“Don’t panic,” says David Steele of The Money Charity. “Don’t get pressured into doing something before you have had time to take advice. There are usually managed ways out.”Contact\u0026nbspStepChange\u0026nbspon 0800 138 1111. Their professional advice is completely free and the line is open between\u0026nbsp8am\u0026nbspand\u0026nbsp8pm\u0026nbspMonday to Friday, or\u0026nbsp8am\u0026nbspand\u0026nbsp4pm\u0026nbspon Saturday.Before you call, fill out\u0026nbspStepChange’s online budget form which helps their advisors understand your particular situation.The charity offers a number of options to help, including debt management plans which allow you to lower your monthly repayments.Other tips from the Money Charity:Pay off more than the minimum amount if you canSome credit cards let you transfer the balance from another card. Transferring a debt from a card with a high rate of interest to one with low or 0 per cent interest could help you pay off the debt faster.Make an assessment of all of your borrowing across cards, loans, overdrafts etc. Make sure you are paying off those with the highest interest rates and charges firstWhen charges are taken into account, overdrafts can sometimes be more expensiveHowever, remember that credit cards should not take priority over debts such as Council Tax, rent or utilities, where the consequences of not paying may be worseA January 2018 report from the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) found that one in four of the UK’s poorest households are in arrears with debts or are spending a quarter of their income or more on debt repayments.Borrowers could face a further squeeze with the BoE\u0026nbspexpected to raise its benchmark interest rate further this year, a move that will probably be passed on to consumers.However, millions of consumers do not pay any interest on their credit card debt, either because they clear their balance each month or because they have secured a 0 per cent deal. Just under 45 per cent of credit card balances pay no interest, according to UK Finance, an industry trade body.Those paying high interest rates may be able to transfer their balance to a cheaper card or consolidate their debts into one loan with a lower rate.The average APR for a £5,000 personal loan in October 2018 was 7.7 per cent while for a £10,000 loan it was 3.8 per cent.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Without the constraints of physical controls, these virtual tools can take on the fluidity and precision of our natural human hand motion.Project\u0026nbspSoli\u0026nbspFounder Ivan\u0026nbspPouyrev\u0026nbspexplained his motivation behind the endeavour in a video posted in 2015.Capturing the possibilities of human hands was one of my passions, he said. How could we take this incredible capability, the finesse of human actions, and apply it to the virtual world?He explained that\u0026nbspthe technology can fit onto a single chip measuring\u0026nbsp8mm\u0026nbspby\u0026nbsp10mm, allowing it to fit in a large variety of devices.What is most exciting about it is that you can shrink the entire radar and put it in a tiny chip, he said.\u0026nbspThat\u0027s what makes this approach so promising.

He also said the company expected revenue records in a range of markets, including the US, Germany and Italy and other parts of east Asia.Despite those successes, the difficulties would encourage Apple to make changes in the future, he wrote.External forces may push us around a bit, but we are not going to use them as an excuse, he wrote.\u0026nbspNor will we just wait around until they get better.This moment gives us an opportunity to learn and to take action, to focus on our strengths and on Apple’s mission — delivering the best products on earth for our customers and providing them with an unmatched level of service. We manage Apple for the long term, and in challenging times we have always come out stronger.

Instead it was a gripping start to Sky Atlantic\u0027s impressive run, with James taking the lead as Nelly, the womanising bum who gains a new lease of investigative energy when his estranged daughter Jody vanishes. A smart script kept us guessing right up to an ending that denied us the closure we had expected. A second series has been commissioned.  210 9) Cunk on BritainHow much you enjoyed Philomena Cunk\u0027s history of Britain depended on how funny you find Diane Morgan\u0027s resting confused face. I find it hilarious. Her interviewees are kind of in on the joke but clearly briefed to take it as seriously as possible. They’ll be mid-flow and she will cock her head and drain all the interest from her face. “What\u0027s the most political thing that\u0027s ever happened?” she asked Robert Peston, who did his best to answer with a straight face. Co-producer Charlie Brooker\u0027s fingerprints are everywhere in the way Morgan\u0027s vain, poorly informed, easily distracted Cunk operates within a ruthlessly satirical production, which sends up the tropes and cliches of every dodgy documentary and history programme. She might not be the comic creation we need, but she is the one we deserve right now. You either love Julia Davis or think her sick filth ought to be banned. Sally4Ever proved yet again that there is nobody working today – or at least nobody with the same platform – with a blacker sense of humour. Sally (Catherine Shepherd) was already surrounded by monsters: her loser of a boyfriend (Alex MacQueen) and tricky colleagues played by Julian Barratt and Felicity Montagu. Then Emma (Davis herself) arrived, a tornado of sex and bad intentions. Beneath the shagging, drugs, excrement, manipulation and malice were pockets of tenderness, but you had to look pretty hard to see them. Luckily there were also gales of laughter. N.b. If you have yet to see it, please do not watch it with your parents or children on Boxing Day and then write in to complain.This was a spiritual successor rather than a sequel to The Night Manager. It was still a Le Carré adaptation on the BBC sprinkled with famous faces, but the differences were as pronounced as the similarities. Park Chan-Wook, the Korean auteur, directed with a high sense of style. Florence Pugh was dazzling as the ingenue actress Charlie, recruited for a dangerous mission across Europe, ably supported by Alexander Skarsgard and Michael Shannon as her spook handlers. Some viewers switched off after the first episodes, which took time to set the scene. They missed out on a vivid, beautifully told thriller. Hugh Grant… can act? That was the first surprise in this smooth, stylish BBC retelling of the Jeremy Thorpe scandal. He burst convincingly out of the charming fop mould he has slept in so comfortably for thirty years. What have we been missing all this time? The other shock was remembering how recent it all was. The government is still up to a lot of nonsense, but the days of this kind of cover-up, for these reasons, is surely over. Or is it?Edward St Aubyn\u0027s Patrick Melrose novels have the kind of precisely drawn interiority that makes any kind of adaptation seem doomed to fail. Instead, the Sky Atlantic series brought them convincingly to life. It is not a happy tale. In flashback we saw Patrick\u0027s childhood in the shadow of his monstrous father David (Hugo Weaving), and the decades of self-loathing and substance abuse that followed. At the centre of all this was Benedict Cumberbatch, as good as he\u0027s ever been. His Patrick could be brilliant, witty, cruel and pitiful, sometimes in the same smack-addled sentence. Weaving, Jennifer Jason Leigh as David\u0027s wife Eleanor and Pip Torrens as his ghastly friend Nicholas Pratt all put in memorable performances, too. At an age where most of us are long past doing anything, David Attenborough is still changing our expectations of what a nature documentary can do. Like The Rolling Stones, he has been on his farewell tour since about 1970, but unlike Jagger \u0026amp Co, the returns are not diminishing. Is he fuelled by anger at the world\u0027s response to climate change? Or simply driven by some massive internal dynamo, a soul-quest to improve our ability to relate to penguins? Whatever the motivation, Dynasties was wonderful, telling complex stories of the animal kingdom with beautiful photography. It\u0027s unusual for a TV writer to attract more attention than the stars or director. Perhaps the world is changing. Or perhaps it\u0027s simply that the writer of Killing Eve was Phoebe Waller-Bridge, star of Fleabag, Star Wars and one of the country\u0027s outstanding new talents. Here she turned her hand to a spy thriller, an adaptation of Luke Jennings\u0027 novels about a beautiful assassin, Villanelle (Jodie Comer), and the MI6 agent given the task of hunting her down, Eve Polastri (Sandra Oh). Both leads demanded attention: Comer the magnetic murderer, Oh the harassed but brilliant spy. The script swerved between comedy, action and drama often enough to keep everyone guessing.  Yes, the national team have played on television in a World Cup before, but I\u0027m including this because the outcome, an England penalty shoot-out victory, was so unusual as to count as a whole new format. At a time when we all watch things at different times, here was something unmistakably live. We watched Gareth Southgate\u0027s men knowing that the rest of the country was, too, poised in living rooms and pub gardens, ready to bury their heads in a sofa or throw their pints in the air. No other TV programme sold as many waistcoats. The ageing patriarch and his scheming children. Not an original concept. Trust, the drama about the last days of Getty family, proved that it was possible for a series built on this premise to have actors, scenery, direction, script, etc etc, and still somehow fall short. Succession, by comparison, felt alive. If US production values and ambition gave it its scale, its heart was dark and British. We can thank Jesse Armstrong, co-creator of Peep Show, and his all-star line-up of British writers, including the Lucy Prebble, Tony Roche and Georgia Pritchett. They made the Roy family expats themselves, and you could hear the old aristocratic froideur in every withering put-down. But we cared for them, too. One of the many TV professionals I consulted for this list thought Succession was so much better than everything else this year that the top 10 should just have it listed in bold and then nine blank spaces. I wouldn\u0027t go that far but it\u0027s certainly at the top.Lennie James\u0027s missing-child thriller Save Me looked as though it might be a paint-by-numbers affair.

Ben Chu investigatesClick to followThe IndependentShadow chancellor John McDonnell (right) has suggested Labour could include a pledge to reduce the working week in its next manifestoAs a society we can’t seem to make up our minds about work. Do we want more of it? Or less?There’s a chilling fog of fear over what technological advances will mean for our jobs, with an endless supply of alarming forecasts about how robots and algorithms are set to displace human workers.But there’s also a furnace of angst about low productivity and under-investment by firms in just the kind of innovations that induce those nightmares of a “jobs apocalypse”.Boss wants to make four-day working week trial permanentSome lament the supposed proliferation of pointless, soul-dismantling, “bullshit jobs”. Yet no one gets out the bunting when a struggling company announces redundancies.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialThe UK’s official labour market surveys suggest\u0026nbspmany of us want fewer hours at work, presumably driven by a desire for a healthier “work-life balance”.Yet those same surveys also show that many people also want more hours, that the post-financial crisis curse of “underemployment” has not yet been lifted.Some complain about the raising of the state retirement age and the depressing prospect of being forced to work longer than they planned. But for others the big problem is ageism, the risk of being pressured out of jobs they enjoy prematurely.When it comes to work, we’re rather like those two diners in the Catskill mountains: “Boy, the food at this place is really terrible... Yeah, I know and such small portions.”Yet onto this terrain of confusion and apparent contradiction some stride confidently.To Alex Williams, a Corbynite academic, automation should be embraced by the left as the emancipation of labour, provided the gains are comprehensively redistributed.The Trades Union Congress seems to have been influenced by this cocktail of technological optimism and socialist assertion. Its general secretary\u0026nbspFrances O’Grady\u0026nbsprecently demanded a four-day week by the end of the century, declaring: “Bosses and shareholders must not be allowed to hoover up all the gains from new tech for themselves.”The Labour Party is keen too. The shadow chancellor John McDonnell has made favourable noises about the four-day week and is reported to be asking the crossbench peer, Robert Skidelsky, to head an inquiry into the subject.Yet this isn’t just a British story. There are tectonic rumblings from abroad too. The IG Metall union in Germany earlier this year won the right to a four-day week for its almost 900,000 members. One technology start-up, founded by former Google employees, has a “Free Friday” policy. Even a think tank close to the authorities in China has called for the most populous nation on the planet to have a four-day working week as soon as 2030.Any project that can unite German metal bashers, Silicon Valley coders and Chinese Communist apparatchiks clearly has an unusually wide appeal.So is the four-day week a big idea whose time has come? Or is it an unworkable left-wing fantasy? And even if a four-day week is economically feasible, should we really desire it? Or is it a case of being careful what you wish for?When Marei Wollersberger and her colleagues established an east London-based data design agency, Normally, as a four-day week operation in 2014, the motivation was largely personal.“We wanted to lead happier lives basically – enjoy ourselves more, not just to defer our enjoyment to retirement age,” she told me.But there was another goal: “There was also a motivation to be more productive.”The economics of the four-day week revolve around the concept of productivity, the amount we produce per hour worked.The size of the economy – the size of our national income – is derived from the value of all the goods and services produced by businesses and households.On the face of it, if we all worked one less day a week, our personal output would drop by around fifth. Multiply that fall across the overall economy and you’ve got an economy that is considerably smaller, implying lower income and lower living standards for all, one way or another.Yet what if working fewer hours were to stimulate our productivity? What if we produced more per hour working four days than we did per hour working five?In that case there might be no overall drop in total output, and therefore no decrease in living standards. If our productivity rose enough we might even have a higher income than we did before.Wollersberger says the model has worked in stimulating performance at her company. “You’re more productive – you achieve exactly the same or more in four days as you would in five,” she says. “And I honestly believe it’s better work.”\u0026nbspA New Zealand financial firm called Perpetual  found similarly gratifying results when it trialled a four-day week recently.“There was broadly no change in company outputs pre and during the trial,” said its boss. “No reduction in job performance and the survey data showed a marginal increase across most teams.”Created with Sketch.Business news: in pictures Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Coca-Cola has paid £3.9bn for Costa Coffee.

Flybe said it cancelled 994 flights in the three months to 31 March, compared to 372 in the same period last year.Bear in mind that no change in output despite a fifth less time at work implies a stunning increase in productivity.But beware cherry-picking. The results of a Swedish trial involving 70 nurses working a six-hour day were more mixed. While there was some boost to worker productivity, the city of Gothenburg also had to hire more nurses to cover the hours lost.Intuitively, this seems much more likely to be the result of moving to a four-day week in services sectors that are, currently at least, heavily reliant on face-to-face human interactions such as healthcare or teaching.That’s not to imply the shift in working patterns should be ruled out as impractical. There are benefits in terms of lower stress and happiness to set against those financial costs. But it’s probably unrealistic to expect the move to always pay for itself, at least in the short-term.And some experiments have flopped. Treehouse, an online educational firm in Oregon, was one of those companies which got media publicity for its four-day week in 2015. But Treehouse’s founder recently lamented that the working practice killed the work ethic in his company and called the experiment a “terrible thing”.The only way is down?Inidual “micro” trials are certainly useful, but they aren’t necessarily a reliable guide to “macro” economic impacts.The closest thing that we have to a state-mandated four-day week is France’s 35-hour week, introduced in 2000 under the Jacques Chirac-Lionel Jospin cohabitation.Jospin\u0026nbsp(left) and president Jaques Chirac (right) (AFPGetty)The first thing to bear in mind is that this does not mean all French people work a four-day week. The regulation simply means overtime kicks in after a worker has completed 35 hours and they accrue the right to holiday lieu days. Yet it does establish a social norm of fewer hours and a financial incentive for firms to limit them.Opinions are mixed about its results. France has a high unemployment rate relative to the UK and other developed countries and it’s notable that Emmanuel Macron campaigned for president promising to increase the flexibility of the system.And though the level of French productivity stands comparison with the most productive nations in the world, there’s no evidence that its growth rate has risen since it introduced the 35-hour week.This might incline us to scepticism about the value of the the state having any role in limiting working hours.\u0026nbspYet that could be the wrong conclusion. For the historic trend is clear. In the late 1900s, UK workers put in more than 2,500 hours a year on average. That’s down to 1,680 hours in 2017. There’s been a similar steep fall in other developed countries over the past century and a half.That reflects the fact that the five-day working week, as opposed to six days with only Sunday off, only become standard practice in the 20th century.It was the industrialist Henry Ford who was the pioneer in the US, giving his factory workers a five-day shift in 1926 while keeping their wages steady. This prefigured legislation and Congress’ 1938 Fair Labor Standards Act, which mandated a maximum 40-hour working week (effectively five working days).We primarily think of John Maynard Keynes as the great promoter of employment for his pioneering theories on the economic benefits of government-funded job creation during the Great Depression.\u0026nbspBut it was this secular decline in hours worked, despite the agonising surge in unemployment in the 1930s, that led Keynes to look forward to a 15-hour working week in The Economic Possibilities for our Grandchildren by the year 2000.The question is whether the recent flattening out is the end of the decline in hours worked,\u0026nbspor merely a pause.\u0026nbspAnd is a government nudge necessary to get history moving again?There’s also the question of consumption. One of the reasons Henry Ford instituted a five-day working week was revealed in a 1926 interview: “Leisure is an indispensable ingredient in a growing consumer market because working people need to have enough free time to find uses for consumer products, including automobiles.”In other words, it was less a paternalistic concern for his workers’ well-being\u0026nbspthan a recognition that it would create help create more customers for Ford.There’s an echo of this macroeconomic concern today, with government-linked Beijing researchers suggesting a four-day week could boost the domestic tourism and entertainment sectors and help rebalance the overall Chinese economy to consumption and away from excessive investment.But perhaps the major economic question about moving towards a four-day week is whether it\u0026nbspcould somehow boost our long-term productivity growth rate (perhaps by inducing more investment in automation by firms) or whether a shorter working week could only ever be the fruits of productivity growth with an origin elsewhere.The truth is that we don’t know the answer. Yet it’s vital to recognise that countries and societies have autonomy too, even now.\u0026nbspThe US has a considerably larger GDP per capita than any developed country in Europe. But the bulk of this gap is due not to a vastly higher level of productivity but the fact that Americans, on average, work many more hours than the French, Germans or Swiss or British and so on.The trade-off between work and leisure is different between our two continents. Both Europeans and Americans, by global and historical comparisons, have very comfortable standards of living. Choosing more leisure over extra working hours is not, whatever some might employers might argue, necessarily a route to penury and decline.Doing nothing for ever and everThe Victorian historian and essayist Thomas Carlyle believed in the redemptive power of work.“A man perfects himself by working,” he enthused. “Foul jungles are cleared away, fair seed-fields rise instead, and stately cities ... Even in the meanest sorts of labour, the whole soul of a man is composed into a kind of real harmony the instant he sets himself to work.”The (possibly apocryphal) epitaph on a Hertfordshire gravestone took a different view of the intrinsic value of hard labour.“Here lies a poor woman who always was tired​”One does not need to be a Carlyle-style work zealot to appreciate that there is some intrinsic psychological value to labour. Work is where many of us find not just an income, but friends, stimulation and status. But we can also see where that Hertfordshire washerwoman was coming from.This dichotomy underlines that not all jobs are the same, or are experienced the same by the worker. For every occupation that that does help to clear away someone’s jungles of mental disorder there will be one that is felt as detestable drudgery.One of the deficiencies of the debate over the four-day week, as with discussions of the appropriate retirement age, is a failure to acknowledge the vast ersity of both jobs and workers. Labour is not homogeneous.Working until 70 might seem entirely reasonable, even desirable, to the university professor, the politician or the TV presenter. But to the cleaner, the firefighter or shop assistant – especially jobs with a physically arduous component – it may have considerably less appeal.\u0026nbspAnd so views erge too on the desirability of the four-day week.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Frances Connolly, 52,  and Patrick Connolly, 54, from Moira, County Armagh in Northern Ireland, who scooped a £115 million EuroMillions jackpot in the New Year\u0027s Day lottery draw, during a photocall at the Culloden Estate and Spa in Holywood, Belfast, as they announce their winThe offshore patrol vessel HMS Mersey leaves Portsmouth Harbour as it is deployed to patrol the English channel following an increase in migrants crossing in small boatsRail protestors wearing masks with the faces of Prime Minister Theresa May and Transport Secretary Chris Grayling outside Kings Cross St Pancras station in London ahead of a visit by Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn to highlight \u0027rising rail fares and falling standards of service on Britain\u0027s railways\u0027 as part of Labour\u0027s Rail Action DayPolice restraining a man after he stabbed three people at Victoria Station in Manchester last night.

He confirmed he will remain in post and thinks it is important to continue working with Cabinet colleagues to ensure the best Brexit outcome for the countryOne of the most significant developments in the UK and broader Western economy over the past decade is the rise of the gig economy and self-employment. Around a sixth of the British workforce is now self-employed.This was brought home to me recently when I met the Romanian father of one of the friends of my young son. The father had been a chauffeur for a wealthy family in Chelsea. But he’d resigned after his son had started school and had signed on with Uber so he could pick his lad up directly from school and shift his driving work to airport shuttle-runs at night instead. “I wanted the flexibility and my previous employer couldn’t provide that,” he told me, as we watched our boys career around the playground.His work-life balance was not to be found in limiting the hours he worked (indeed he wanted to keep those the same or even increase them) but in the flexibility of his arrangements.Survey evidence suggests this is a common story. The majority of Uber drivers like the personal control over their working hours made possible by the platform. Drivers who valued flexible working reported higher levels of life satisfaction, as well as lower levels of anxiety.However, there was also a minority of Uber drivers who would prefer to work fixed hours in a more conventional work setting. And these workers reported lower levels of life satisfaction and higher levels of anxiety.A question of representationThis brings us back to the apparent paradox of many people in the UK workforce wanting fewer hours but many others wanting more.\u0026nbspDavid Bell, a labour market economist from the University of Stirling\u0026nbspwhose work, along with Danny Blanchflower of Dartmouth College in the US, has highlighted this ergence, says that the groups who want fewer hours tend to be older, while those who are underemployed seem to be younger.One of the implications is that younger people in the workforce may need the money from more hours because they are under greater financial pressure, perhaps because they have families, or perhaps because they have suffered a greater real wage squeeze since the financial crisis.\u0026nbspThis suggests that Corbynite left is correct in stressing that to consider the economic and social case for a four-day in isolation is a mistake. Incomes plainly matter too, as well as the level of inequality.\u0026nbspOne has to consider the role of income redistribution and employment policies. Give people higher incomes and more “outside options” for employment, perhaps through a jobs guarantee or even a universal basic income, and the desire for extra hours in their current job may well melt away. They may begin to make different work-leisure trade-offs than they do now.Perhaps one of the reasons why we some people languish in ultra-flexible gig economy jobs they don’t appreciate – like those disgruntled Uber drivers – is that, despite what most economic analysts say, there is actually hidden slack in our economy – and that if the slack was eradicated they could find the kind of regular job they wanted elsewhere.But that still leaves a circle to be squared, presuming that different people, all else equal, are still likely to put different weights on work and leisure. How do we give those who would prefer a four-day week more freedom to choose it, while protecting the interests of those who don’t?The empowerment of ordinary workers is Professor Bell’s answer. Let inidual employees have substantive input into determining the trade-off, rather than leaving it up to politicians or employers.This is how I know the NHS won’t survive without EU staffOver a million young women say they’re paid less than male colleaguesDJ jailed for raping boy, 3, in toilet at working men’s clubTrailblazing images of early 20th-century working conditions“One of the things that might help is a strengthening of worker representation, which has declined so dramatically,” he says. “Rather than jumping in to impose a four-day week you want to think first about whether workers’ interests are being properly represented.”This would be going with the historical grain, given the driving role of new trade unions in the achievement of an eight-hour working day in the 19th century and early 20th century.It’s notable not only that IG Metall workers in Germany this year were able to achieve a four-day working week through negotiation with bosses – but that they also had sufficient bargaining power to protect their overall levels of weekly pay.A fundamental question that underpins this broad discussion about the future of working hours is a philosophical one: what makes us happy and fulfilled as human beings?Modern psychological studies do partially back up Carlyle’s Victorian pompous sermonising: formal work can be as positive for human happiness as leisure, sometimes more so.\u0026nbspA job does seem to bring a valuable sense of social usefulness. Involuntary unemployment is clearly harmful for people’s mental health.But how much work do we want or need? Keynes in the 1930s called this desire for work “old Adam” and predicted that three hours a day in the future would be “quite enough to satisfy” this inherited instinct.Perhaps the right thing to do is not to dictate to people, or engage in speculation on what the future of work will look like, but rather to help them decide for themselves.Four day working weekOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

I find it hilarious. Her interviewees are kind of in on the joke but clearly briefed to take it as seriously as possible. They’ll be mid-flow and she will cock her head and drain all the interest from her face. “What\u0027s the most political thing that\u0027s ever happened?” she asked Robert Peston, who did his best to answer with a straight face. Co-producer Charlie Brooker\u0027s fingerprints are everywhere in the way Morgan\u0027s vain, poorly informed, easily distracted Cunk operates within a ruthlessly satirical production, which sends up the tropes and cliches of every dodgy documentary and history programme. She might not be the comic creation we need, but she is the one we deserve right now. You either love Julia Davis or think her sick filth ought to be banned. Sally4Ever proved yet again that there is nobody working today – or at least nobody with the same platform – with a blacker sense of humour. Sally (Catherine Shepherd) was already surrounded by monsters: her loser of a boyfriend (Alex MacQueen) and tricky colleagues played by Julian Barratt and Felicity Montagu. Then Emma (Davis herself) arrived, a tornado of sex and bad intentions. Beneath the shagging, drugs, excrement, manipulation and malice were pockets of tenderness, but you had to look pretty hard to see them. Luckily there were also gales of laughter. N.b. If you have yet to see it, please do not watch it with your parents or children on Boxing Day and then write in to complain.This was a spiritual successor rather than a sequel to The Night Manager. It was still a Le Carré adaptation on the BBC sprinkled with famous faces, but the differences were as pronounced as the similarities. Park Chan-Wook, the Korean auteur, directed with a high sense of style. Florence Pugh was dazzling as the ingenue actress Charlie, recruited for a dangerous mission across Europe, ably supported by Alexander Skarsgard and Michael Shannon as her spook handlers. Some viewers switched off after the first episodes, which took time to set the scene. They missed out on a vivid, beautifully told thriller. Hugh Grant… can act? That was the first surprise in this smooth, stylish BBC retelling of the Jeremy Thorpe scandal. He burst convincingly out of the charming fop mould he has slept in so comfortably for thirty years. What have we been missing all this time? The other shock was remembering how recent it all was. The government is still up to a lot of nonsense, but the days of this kind of cover-up, for these reasons, is surely over. Or is it?Edward St Aubyn\u0027s Patrick Melrose novels have the kind of precisely drawn interiority that makes any kind of adaptation seem doomed to fail. Instead, the Sky Atlantic series brought them convincingly to life. It is not a happy tale. In flashback we saw Patrick\u0027s childhood in the shadow of his monstrous father David (Hugo Weaving), and the decades of self-loathing and substance abuse that followed. At the centre of all this was Benedict Cumberbatch, as good as he\u0027s ever been. His Patrick could be brilliant, witty, cruel and pitiful, sometimes in the same smack-addled sentence. Weaving, Jennifer Jason Leigh as David\u0027s wife Eleanor and Pip Torrens as his ghastly friend Nicholas Pratt all put in memorable performances, too. At an age where most of us are long past doing anything, David Attenborough is still changing our expectations of what a nature documentary can do. Like The Rolling Stones, he has been on his farewell tour since about 1970, but unlike Jagger \u0026amp Co, the returns are not diminishing. Is he fuelled by anger at the world\u0027s response to climate change? Or simply driven by some massive internal dynamo, a soul-quest to improve our ability to relate to penguins? Whatever the motivation, Dynasties was wonderful, telling complex stories of the animal kingdom with beautiful photography. It\u0027s unusual for a TV writer to attract more attention than the stars or director. Perhaps the world is changing. Or perhaps it\u0027s simply that the writer of Killing Eve was Phoebe Waller-Bridge, star of Fleabag, Star Wars and one of the country\u0027s outstanding new talents. Here she turned her hand to a spy thriller, an adaptation of Luke Jennings\u0027 novels about a beautiful assassin, Villanelle (Jodie Comer), and the MI6 agent given the task of hunting her down, Eve Polastri (Sandra Oh). Both leads demanded attention: Comer the magnetic murderer, Oh the harassed but brilliant spy. The script swerved between comedy, action and drama often enough to keep everyone guessing.  Yes, the national team have played on television in a World Cup before, but I\u0027m including this because the outcome, an England penalty shoot-out victory, was so unusual as to count as a whole new format. At a time when we all watch things at different times, here was something unmistakably live. We watched Gareth Southgate\u0027s men knowing that the rest of the country was, too, poised in living rooms and pub gardens, ready to bury their heads in a sofa or throw their pints in the air. No other TV programme sold as many waistcoats. The ageing patriarch and his scheming children. Not an original concept. Trust, the drama about the last days of Getty family, proved that it was possible for a series built on this premise to have actors, scenery, direction, script, etc etc, and still somehow fall short. Succession, by comparison, felt alive. If US production values and ambition gave it its scale, its heart was dark and British. We can thank Jesse Armstrong, co-creator of Peep Show, and his all-star line-up of British writers, including the Lucy Prebble, Tony Roche and Georgia Pritchett. They made the Roy family expats themselves, and you could hear the old aristocratic froideur in every withering put-down. But we cared for them, too. One of the many TV professionals I consulted for this list thought Succession was so much better than everything else this year that the top 10 should just have it listed in bold and then nine blank spaces. I wouldn\u0027t go that far but it\u0027s certainly at the top.Lennie James\u0027s missing-child thriller Save Me looked as though it might be a paint-by-numbers affair.

At the centre of all this was Benedict Cumberbatch, as good as he\u0027s ever been. His Patrick could be brilliant, witty, cruel and pitiful, sometimes in the same smack-addled sentence. Weaving, Jennifer Jason Leigh as David\u0027s wife Eleanor and Pip Torrens as his ghastly friend Nicholas Pratt all put in memorable performances, too. At an age where most of us are long past doing anything, David Attenborough is still changing our expectations of what a nature documentary can do. Like The Rolling Stones, he has been on his farewell tour since about 1970, but unlike Jagger \u0026amp Co, the returns are not diminishing. Is he fuelled by anger at the world\u0027s response to climate change? Or simply driven by some massive internal dynamo, a soul-quest to improve our ability to relate to penguins? Whatever the motivation, Dynasties was wonderful, telling complex stories of the animal kingdom with beautiful photography. It\u0027s unusual for a TV writer to attract more attention than the stars or director. Perhaps the world is changing. Or perhaps it\u0027s simply that the writer of Killing Eve was Phoebe Waller-Bridge, star of Fleabag, Star Wars and one of the country\u0027s outstanding new talents. Here she turned her hand to a spy thriller, an adaptation of Luke Jennings\u0027 novels about a beautiful assassin, Villanelle (Jodie Comer), and the MI6 agent given the task of hunting her down, Eve Polastri (Sandra Oh). Both leads demanded attention: Comer the magnetic murderer, Oh the harassed but brilliant spy. The script swerved between comedy, action and drama often enough to keep everyone guessing.  Yes, the national team have played on television in a World Cup before, but I\u0027m including this because the outcome, an England penalty shoot-out victory, was so unusual as to count as a whole new format. At a time when we all watch things at different times, here was something unmistakably live. We watched Gareth Southgate\u0027s men knowing that the rest of the country was, too, poised in living rooms and pub gardens, ready to bury their heads in a sofa or throw their pints in the air. No other TV programme sold as many waistcoats. The ageing patriarch and his scheming children. Not an original concept. Trust, the drama about the last days of Getty family, proved that it was possible for a series built on this premise to have actors, scenery, direction, script, etc etc, and still somehow fall short. Succession, by comparison, felt alive. If US production values and ambition gave it its scale, its heart was dark and British. We can thank Jesse Armstrong, co-creator of Peep Show, and his all-star line-up of British writers, including the Lucy Prebble, Tony Roche and Georgia Pritchett. They made the Roy family expats themselves, and you could hear the old aristocratic froideur in every withering put-down. But we cared for them, too. One of the many TV professionals I consulted for this list thought Succession was so much better than everything else this year that the top 10 should just have it listed in bold and then nine blank spaces. I wouldn\u0027t go that far but it\u0027s certainly at the top.Elba\u0027s character\u0026nbspwas joined by his murderous sidekick Alice Morgan, played by Ruth Wilson, in the series.

We should then go back to the EU with a discussion about a customs union.”Mr Corbyn also urged Labour supporters demanding he stop Brexit to “recognise a number of things”, saying: “About 60 per cent of Labour voters voted remain, about 40 per cent voted leave. We have to recognise why people voted in those directions.Conservative and Labour MPs join forces to stop no-deal Brexit“Labour is unique as a party, because it’s got to bring all sides together – hence my view on a customs union, on access to the market.”However, some estimates have put Labour voters’ backing remain at more than 60 per cent – while one recent poll found their support for a further referendum to be 80 per cent.The interview triggered a backlash from some Labour MPs, Chris Leslie, the Nottingham East MP, tweeting: “If Jeremy Corbyn facilitates Brexit he’ll share responsibility for the job losses, trade barriers and decade of austerity to come.Angela Smith, the Penistone and Stocksbridge MP, said: “We need to get the message over to Jeremy Corbyn that Labour members and supporters want a People’s Vote.”Created with Sketch.Newspapers react to Theresa May pulling the vote on her Brexit deal Show all 11Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.And Vince Cable, the Liberal Democrat leader, said: “There you have it, Jeremy Corbyn refuses once again to take the blinkers off. He is ignoring the concerns of his own supporters and the economic damage experts warn Brexit will do to the UK economy.”In reality, the chances of a snap election in the new year are slim, with Theresa May having ruled it out – and many Tories opposed to her deal happy to run down the clock to a no-deal Brexit.Instead, Mr Corbyn is under pressure to swing behind a fresh referendum if – as seems certain – the prime minister loses the “meaningful vote”, in the second week of January and his vote of no confidence in her government fails.Some Labour insiders believe Labour backing for a referendum is all-but certain in those circumstances, given the party\u0027s inability to set out what the other “options on the table” it could pursue might be.Expats set to lose healthcare under no-deal Brexit, NHS toldThink homelessness is bad now?

I don’t think anybody can say exactly what will happen in terms of the reaction we’ll see in parliament.”Strikingly, Ms May appeared unable to point to any significant progress in persuading the EU to give ground on the Irish border backstop, since last month.She said she was still seeking “further assurances from the EU on the issues raised”, as well as on how to give parliament a stronger role over future trade negotiations.Last month, when fighting off the vote of no confidence by Tory MPs, the prime minister vowed to secure a new “legally binding” power for the UK to break free of the backstop, if implemented.But, in the interview, she said the “crucial element” was speeding up a future trade deal, to remove the backstop – designed to avoid border posts and checks in Ireland – quickly.Created with Sketch.Newspapers react to Theresa May pulling the vote on her Brexit deal Show all 11Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.However, experts have warned trade talks will take many years, while the backstop would be in place from January 2021, unless the transition period is extended as an alternative.MPs will resume debating the withdrawal agreement on Wednesday, with the vote expected on 15 or 16 January.

And, as an extension looks ever more likely, it could be a while before they need to look at getting their CVs in order.Got an unanswered question about Brexit?

The impact would be particularly bad for farmers.\u0026nbspTariffs of 40 per cent could be slapped on meat exports to the EU and subject to strict inspection regimes by the French. There would be holdups and delays at Calais and we could lose the benefits of leaving the common agricultural policy.”Despite Ms May having told Tory MPs\u0026nbspshe would not fight the next election and the pressure on her to announce her resignation after Britain leaves the EU in March,\u0026nbspMr Gove predicted that she will still be prime minister this time next year and said he thought more highly of her now than he did when the pair\u0026nbspwere cabinet colleagues in David Cameron’s government.He said: “I respect her more now. She has shown an amazing deal of resilience, integrity and determination.

Political commitments can be useful too.”Earlier this week DUP deputy leader Nigel Dodds MP said his party’s principled objections to the current EU withdrawal agreement remained and he pressed the prime minister to deliver on her commitments to deal with the backstop.\u0026nbspSpeaking after a meeting with the prime minister in Downing Street, he said the backstop, as currently proposed, “flies in the face of the government’s commitments on Northern Ireland as we leave the EU”.MPs to back Brexit deal and let Britain ‘turn corner’ in new year messageOfficials in Brussels are not expecting the first vote to pass, though they are understood to be no less in the dark about the prime minister’s plans for when she loses than anyone in the UK.The possibility remains for the UK to ask for an extension of Article 50, or to revoke it unilaterally –\u0026nbspwhich would both mean a summit would not be needed.But even the expected extent of possible further clarifications considered by the EU would be unlikely to impress MPs. It is understood that further assistance may simply involve re-adding paragraphs deleted from the previous statement by leaders in December.Created with Sketch.Brexit march for a final say – in pictures Show all 65Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Final Say campaigners take part in the peoples vote march for the future in London 20102018Red smoke from a canister hangs in the air as around 100,000 demonstrators march through London during a People\u0027s Vote anti-brexit demonstration savings banners and placardsMayor of London Sadiq Khan takes part in the People\u0027s Vote March for the Future in London, a march and rally in support of a second EU referendum.MP Chuka Umunna (left) and MP Vince Cable (right) as MP Anna Soubry (centre) addresses Anti-Brexit campaigners at a rally after the People\u0027s Vote March for the Future in London, a march and rally in support of a second EU referendum.

Support for the current deal rises to only 28 per cent among Leave voters.Created with Sketch.Newspapers react to Theresa May pulling the vote on her Brexit deal Show all 11Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Writing in\u0026nbspThe Mail on Sunday, the prime minister called Labour’s Brexit policy “a cynical tissue of incoherence, designed to avoid difficult decisions”.Ms May claimed Mr Corbyn “did not even bother to read the deal before he came out against it”.She also warned opponents in her own party that they “must realise the risks they are running with our democracy”.The YouGov poll shows reveals that if\u0026nbspthe choice was to remain in the EU or leave under the terms of Ms May’s\u0026nbspdeal negotiated by the government, the result would be 63 per cent to 37 per cent in favour of staying tied to Brussels.If the choice was EU membership or a no-deal Brexit, the poll indicated a 58 per cent to 42 per cent win for Remain.Labour MP David Lammy, a prominent supporter of campaign for a second referendum, said: “On the biggest issue of our generation, Labour risks complicity in the Conservative Party’s historic mistake. Although we are in opposition, due to the government’s weakness we have the opportunity to save our country from catastrophe and so we should seize it\u0026nbspwith both hands.“If we do not, this poll shows it is Labour, not the Tories, that will be punished at the ballot box. We not only risk fatally harming our chances at the next election, we will betray millions of voters – particularly the young – who saw us as a beacon of hope and put their trust in us only 18 months ago.“The time for prevarication and pussyfooting around on Brexit has long passed – we must now give voice to the clear majority of people who are demanding a final say.”Those surveyed were scathing of Ms May’s handing of Brexit, with 73 per cent saying the negotiations are going badly and 86 per cent saying the process is “a mess”.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

He confirmed he will remain in post and thinks it is important to continue working with Cabinet colleagues to ensure the best Brexit outcome for the country“If some of those MPs can be persuaded to back the prime minister’s deal, it won’t be because they’ve come under pressure to do so from their local party members over the Christmas break,” said Prof Bale.\u0026nbspThe study found that 59 per cent of Tory members opposed Ms May’s deal, compared to 38 per cent who supported it and 3 per cent who did not have an opinion.More than half, 53 per cent, also said that the deal “does not respect the result of the referendum”, comparing to 42 per cent who said that it does.People were then asked how they would vote in a referendum where there were three options – to remain, leave with the deal or leave without one – and in which they are able to put down a first and second preference.Some 57 per cent opted to leave with no deal as their first choice, with only 23 per cent putting Ms May’s deal and 15 per cent backing the option to remain in the EU.Forty per cent\u0026nbspthen put the prime minister’s proposals as their second choice, with 19 per cent putting no deal and 6\u0026nbspper cent opting to stay as a member of the bloc.The survey showed large majorities of members think both that a no-deal Brexit will have a positive impact on the economy in the medium to long term and that warnings of disruption have been exaggerated.A slim majority, 51 per cent, said they thought Ms May was doing “well”, but almost as many, 48 per cent said she was doing “badly” to some degree.But despite wavering support for Ms May and her deal, an overwhelming majority of members – 83 per cent – opposed the idea of having an election, while 82 per cent would not back a further referendum.Yesterday, the prime minister’s Northern Irish partners in government raised the stakes further in the Brexit talks, saying there is “no need” for key parts of the deal she agreed with the EU.Nigel Dodds, DUP deputy leader,\u0026nbspargued that the withdrawal agreement she is seeking “flies in the face” of the government’s own commitments relating to the border between the north and the republic.His comments came after a meeting in Downing Street, and are a blow to the prime minister as she desperately tries to convince the Northern Irish party and her own MPs to back her proposals ahead of a vote in the coming weeks.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

We’ve just accomplished the most distant flyby.”Nasa administrator Jim Bridenstine said: “In addition to being the first to explore Pluto, today New Horizons flew by the most distant object ever visited by a spacecraft and became the first to directly explore an object that holds remnants from the birth of our solar system.“This is what leadership in space exploration is all about.”The radio message from the robotic craft was picked up in Madrid by one of Nasa’s big antennas. The data took six hours and eight minutes to traverse the massive breadth of space between Ultima and Earth.According to Nasa, scientists had not discovered Ultima Thule when the probe was launched in 2006, meaning the mission was unique. In 2014, astronomers found Thule using the Hubble Space Telescope and selected it for New Horizon’s extended mission in 2015. “Anything’s possible out there in this very unknown region,” said John Spencer, deputy project scientist for New Horizons. Launched in January 2006, New Horizons embarked on a 4 billion mile journey towards the solar system’s frigid edge to study the dwarf planet Pluto and its five moons. The spacecraft, which is the size of a baby grand piano, flew past Pluto in 2015, providing the first close-up views of the planet. During the flyby, the probe found Pluto to be slightly larger than previously thought. In March, it revealed that methane-rich dunes were on the icy dwarf planet’s surface.After trekking 1 billion miles beyond Pluto into the Kuiper belt, New Horizons will now seek clues about the formation of the solar system and its planets.There is a great deal scientists can learn from Ultima and the hundreds of thousands of similar bodies scientists deem to be in the solar system. Hal Weaver, project scientist on the mission, told the BBC the rock is “probably the most primitive object ever encountered by a spacecraft, the best possible relic of the early solar system”. The object is officially known as 2014 MU69, but was nicknamed Ultima Thule, a Latin phrase which means “beyond the borders of the known world”.Additional reporting by ReutersOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Much more can and must be done to protect and assist children.”Children living in countries at war have come under direct attack, have been used as human shields, killed, maimed or recruited to fight. Rape, forced marriage and abduction have become standard tactics in conflicts from Syria to Yemen, and from the Democratic Republic of the Congo, to Nigeria, South Sudan and Myanmar.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialOver the course of 2018:- In Afghanistan, violence and bloodshed remain a daily occurrence, with some 5,000 children killed or maimed within the first three-quarters of 2018, equal to all of 2017, and children making up 89 per cent of civilian casualties from explosive remnants of war.Unicef photographer captures men bonding with their newborns- Cameroon has seen an escalation of the conflict in the northwest and southwest regions of the country, with schools, students and teachers often coming under attack. In November, more than 80 people, including many children, were abducted from a school in Nkwen, in the northwest of the country and released a few days later. To date, 93 villages have allegedly been partially or totally burned due to conflict in the areas, with many children experiencing extreme levels of violence.- In the Central African Republic, a dramatic resurgence in fighting has enveloped much of the country, with two out of three children in need of humanitarian assistance.- In the Democratic Republic of the Congo, interethnic violence and clashes between security forces and armed groupsmilitia in the Kasai region and in the eastern provinces of Tanganyika, South Kivu, Nord Kivu and Ituri have had a devastating impact on children. The response to the ongoing Ebola outbreak has been seriously hindered by violence and instability in eastern DRC. In addition, an estimated 4.2 million children are at risk of severe acute malnutrition. The situation is compounded by violations of children’s rights, including forced recruitment by armed groups and sexual abuse.Pierre’s mother died after he was born three years ago he now lives with his father in the Central African Republic- In Iraq, even as fighting has largely subsided, four children were killed in November in the north of the country when the truck they were travelling to school in came under attack. Children and families returning to their homes in areas previously impacted by heavy violence continue to be exposed to the danger of unexploded ordnance. Thousands of families remain displaced and now face the additional threats of freezing winter temperatures and flash floods.- In the Chad Basin, ongoing conflict, displacement and attacks on schools, teachers and other education facilities have put the education of 3.5 million children at risk. Today in northeast Nigeria, the lake region of Chad, extreme north of Cameroon and Diffa region of Niger, at least 1,041 schools are closed or non-functional due to violence, fear of attacks, or unrest, affecting nearly 445,000 children.- A recent surge in violence in the border region between Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger has left 1,478 schools closed.- In Myanmar, the UN continues to receive reports of ongoing violations of the rights of Rohingya remaining in northern Rakhine State, which include allegations of killings, disappearances and arbitrary arrests. There are also widespread restrictions on the rights to freedom of movement and barriers to access health and education including in central Rakhine State. Ensuring children have access to quality education and other essential services will avert a “lost generation”\u0026nbspof Rohingya children otherwise they will lack the skills they need to contribute to society.- In northeast Nigeria, armed groups, including Boko Haram factions, continue to target girls, who are raped, forced to become wives of fighters or used as “human bombs”. In February, the group abducted 110 girls and one boy from a technical college in Dapchi, Yobe State. While most of the children have since been released, five girls died and one is still being held captive as a slave.Nawai, 15, during a ceremony to release children from armed groups in Yambio, South Sudan- In Palestine, over 50 children were killed and hundreds more injured this year, many while\u0026nbspdemonstrating against deteriorating living conditions in Gaza. Children in Palestine and Israel have been exposed to fear, trauma and injuries.- In South Sudan, relentless conflict and insecurity throughout the annual lean season pushed 6.1 million people into extreme hunger. Even with the advent of the rainy season, more than 43 per cent of the population remain food insecure. While the promise of a revitalised peace agreement offers a glimmer of hope for children, reports of extreme violence against women and children continue, most recently in Bentiu, where more than 150 women and girls reported suffering horrific sexual assault.- In Somalia, more than 1,800 children were recruited by parties to the conflict in the first nine months of the year, with 1,278 children abducted.Unicef’s research on water predicts one in four children will not have access to clean water by 2040- In Syria, between January and September, the UN verified the killing of 870 children – the highest number ever in the first nine months of any year since the start of the conflict in 2011. Attacks continued throughout the year, including the killing of 30 children in the eastern village of Al Shafa in November.- In eastern Ukraine, more than four years of conflict have taken a devastating toll on the education system, destroying and damaging hundreds of schools and forcing 700,000 children to learn in fragile environments, amid\u0026nbspvolatile fighting and the dangers posed by unexploded weapons of war. The situation is particularly severe for 400,000 children who live within 20km of the “contact line”, which ides the government and non-government-controlled areas and where shelling and extreme levels of mine contamination pose a lethal threat.- and in Yemen, the UN has verified 1,427 children killed or maimed in attacks, including an “unconscionable”\u0026nbspattack on a school bus in Sa’ada. Schools and hospitals have come under frequent attack or been used for military purposes, denying children access to their right to education and healthcare. This is further fuelling a crisis in a country where every 10 minutes, a child dies due to preventable diseases, and 400,000 children suffer from severe acute malnutrition.A doctor measures the arm of Yemeni Ali Mohammed Ahmed Jamal, 12, who is suffering from malnutrition“2019 marks the 30th anniversary of the landmark Convention on the Rights of the Child and the 70th anniversary of the Geneva Conventions, yet today, more countries are embroiled in internal or international conflict than at any other time in the past three decades. Children living through conflict are among the least likely to be guaranteed their rights. Attacks on children must end,” Fontaine says.Unicef calls on all warring parties to abide by their obligations under international law to immediately end violations against children and the targeting of civilian infrastructure, including schools, hospitals and water infrastructure. Unicef also calls on states with influence over parties to conflict to use that influence to protect children.In photos: a toddlers recovery from malnutritionConflict in Congo has led to children being recruited as soldiers“Much more needs to be done to prevent wars, and to end the many disastrous armed conflicts devastating children’s lives. Yet even as wars continue, we must never accept attacks against children. We must hold warring parties to their obligation to protect children. Otherwise, it is children, their families and their communities who will continue to suffer the devastating consequences, for now, and for years to come,” Fontaine says.Across all these countries, Unicef works with partners to provide the most vulnerable children with health, nutrition, education and child protection services. For example, in October, Unicef helped to secure the release of 833 children recruited into armed forces in northeast Nigeria, and are working these children to reintegrate them into their communities. Since conflict broke out in South Sudan five years ago, Unicef has reunited almost 6,000 unaccompanied and separated children with their families. In Bangladesh, in 2018, Unicef reached thousands of Rohingya refugee children with mental health and psychosocial support. In Iraq, Unicef is working with partners to provide specialised services to women and children affected by gender-based violence.Democratic Republic of the CongoOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Create a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Sugar consumption is way down on  years ago. Children’s teeth are improving.One thing HAS increased: the percentage eating five fruit and veg a day.Yet deranged campaigners demand new taxes on chocolates, sweets and biscuits to curb our “escalating childhood ­obesity epidemic”. There isn’t one.Why do the meddling zealots of Public Health England or “Action On Sugar” even get a hearing  Why aren’t they just laughed at when they suggest calorie limits on occasional restaurant mealsBecause it’s January and everyone feels guilty about Christmas scoffing. Because campaigners were emboldened by the Tories’ shameful fizzy drinks tax, even pronouncing its “success” despite zero evidence it made anyone slimmer.They smell a weakness in Downing Street for nanny-state levies and other potty measures hitting the poor hardest.The Government insists it has no plans yet for new food taxes. But it has already caved in to this hysteria once.Why wouldn’t it again ARE us the leftie hand-wringing over the illegal migrants sailing across the Channel.Genuine asylum-seekers fleeing persecution would seek safe haven in the first EU country they reached. These were camped in France and just decided we looked a better bet — or a softer touch.As for their apparent destitution, they managed to pay small fortunes to criminals who facilitated their sea voyage.Britain welcomes migrants who arrive legitimately. We should take our share of real asylum-seekers who do the same. But we SHOULD be “hostile” to illegals.Yes, the numbers arriving in Kent are small — so what  If they are warmly welcomed, many more will risk it and drown.

Really I only ask because when the fly-by happened on New Year’s Day, the space craft was traveling at ,mph.This is known in technical circles as “very fast”.And think about it. If you try to take pictures of the underside of a motorway bridge as you pass by, you’re not going to learn much.And you’re only doing .So what nuggets of information came back from the edge of our solar system Ah well. Because the probe only has a -watt transmitter and because it’s four billion miles from earth and because the sun’s currently in the wrong place, we won’t have all the graphs and the algebra for  months.By which time, the boffins will have been given another gazillion dollars to go and look at another bit of frozen rock.I’m not one of those people who say the money should be spent on blankets for refugees.But can we stop pretending that space is a big encyclopaedia of facts we need to know Because it isn’t. The moon taught us nothing of any great consequence.Missions to Mars have given us nothing but a very good film starring Matt Damon and all we know about the bit between is that it’s cold and empty.Yes, further out, beyond the Thermal Shock Region, ten or five thousand galaxies from here, there could be all sorts of juicy titbits for the boffins to analyse.But we can’t get there.And we never will.Becauseyou were on a space ship that took off like the Enterprise, you’d fall over.So let’s concentrate our efforts on something which IS achievable.Turning space travel into the ultimate zero-g theme park ride for tourists.A CHINESE space craft landed on the Moon this week.I anticipate it will learn nothing of any great value but that, within a week, it will have built a factory that makes , pairs of training shoes every month.LIKE many other bores and cowards, I decided on New Year’s Eve to quit drinking for a little while.As I write, it’s lunch time on January  and already, a small rash has developed on my stomach.I looked it up on the internet and, of course, it’s cancer.I was going to have a drink to help me think about that but then I noticed that the pain in my hip is also cancer and so is my failing eyesight and so is my deafness and so is my wonky ankle and so is every symptom anyone has ever developed anywhere.As a research tool, the internet is brilliant. As a doctor, however, it’s scary . . . and almost always wrong.THERE are many noble and well-meaning attempts to make people stop filling the sea with bits of discarded plastic.Iceland, the supermarket chain, has started a “reverse vending machine” scheme which gives you a ten pence voucher for every empty plastic bottle you deposit.And there are many volunteers who comb the world’s coastlines, pulling plastic bags from the mouths of turtles and stranded dolphins.I wish all these people well.But I think a more targeted approach is necessary.Every time I go for a walk on Britain’s coastline, I notice that the high-tide mark is always littered with the plastic wrappers from milk chocolate Bounty bars and Flora margarine tubs.So how’s this for a plan You go to the people who make these things and you give them an ultimatum.Do something about it. Or we will do something to you, involving sharks.AS I watched the fireworks light up the night sky over London on New Year’s Eve, I wondered how long it would take someone to say the money should have been spent on the NHS.The answer, very depressingly, was about four seconds.Well, let me provide a retort.The amount of public money spent on the fireworks was £.million.Which isn’t even enough to buy one decent MRI scanner.Let me put it this way.You could save all your money for a rainy day and live on gruel.But it’s nice once in a while to spend a bit of it on beer and curry.MANY don’t enjoy the first few weeks of the year because it’s usually cold and dark and miserable.I love it though because all my friends are back from their Christmas holidays.Which means my Instagram feed is no longer full of their legs on a beach with nothing in the background but the blue sea and the bloody blue sky.I’M delighted to hear that Olivia Newton John isn’t as poorly as was reported earlier.I’ve always been a fan.Once, in fact, I wrote to Jim’ll Fix It askinghe could fix it for me to sleep with her.The filthy little pervert never even replied.THERE are so many exciting new things set to lt our spirits in .We have what will probably be the last Avengers movie and, a quarter of a century after the original, a new Toy Story.On the small screen, Game Of Thrones will be back and there will be world cups in rugby and cricket.The soundtrack will be provided by the Spice Girls reunion and . . .  none of you will be paying attention to any of it because this month, Theresa May’s useless Brexit deal will be dashed on the foreshore of democratic debate.This will cause Corbyn to propose a vote of no confidence which will trigger a general election.And the winner of that will stage a second referendum which will provide the same result as the first so there will be riots, petrol bombs, power cuts, death and the end of days.Despite this, though, I’d like to wish you all a happy New Year.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Instead he acted as their patsy, issuing childish threats and hyping up the hard-border myth . . . just as the EU wanted.Now his farmers face potential ruin, and he may need a “mega money” rescue.Hate to say it, Leo.

There is nothing cosier than the cocoon of Christmas. And leaving it is a wrench.So a lot of people will be full of dread at the prospect of going back to work.But I actually think that January can be one of the most productive, exciting and dynamic months.And just in case you don’t agree, I’m going to share my tips on how to make January into Fanuary.The first step is to focus on what you want out of this new year. Becauseyou don’t make a plan you will end up exactly where you started, but this time in .If you hate your job, don’t just keep saying that: Work out why you hate it and what steps you need to take to change it. Brush up on your skills. Look for learning opportunities wherever you can — and take them.Be active and invest time in yourself. Dare to dream a bit by applying for jobs you like the look of, evenyou think they are out of your league.Andyou need a helping hand, sign up to my masterclass which will help you to write a killer CV — and even get the pay rise you want.It’s also really important to be positive — evenyou don’t always feel it.If you are surrounded by miserable, negative people you will end up that way too, so go out of your way to mix with positive, enthusiastic types.It’s very easy to stay in your comfort zone but you’ll never know what you are capable of achieving unless you try. Be brave and start taking risks.Another scenario is that you might not hate your job, but wish you felt more challenged, appreciated or engaged.If that’s the case, write a list of things you would doyou were fearless. Then act asyou were. Take small steps: Speak up in a meeting or put yourself forward for something you’ve never done before.And evenyou fail, be proud that you’ve tried.It’s also important to trust yourself — that’s the first step to improving your self image.If you lack self-confidence you won’t achieve much.You might be thinking, “It’s easy for you to say that — you’re successful”.But after my A-levels I never went to uni, and had no other qualications.I had to work really hard and be super-resilient because I could only ever rely on myself.On the way to success you’ll inevitably experience setbacks — but it’s how you respond to them that determines what happens next. Trust that you can handle them.One of the core communication skills is to be assertive, so try to have faith in your opinions. Sure, respect other people’s views but respect your own too.If you’re hoping for a pay rise or promotion in , I firmly believe thatyou don’t ask you don’t get.If the answer is no the first time round, find out what needs to change and work on that so that next time the answer is a yes.Personally, I never hear the word “No”.I hear: “Find another way to get what you want.”Most importantly, never stop encouraging yourself — and find a network to plug into.To network, you have to be ­interested and interesting. First impressions are made in the first seven seconds so, when you meet someone, make eye contact, smile, be polite — and dress the part.Put your phone away and work out an articulate way to explain who you are in  seconds. Be enthusiastic and be your own best friend.Feeling better about January now  I hope so.If you really want to Get What You Want — sign up to my new Masterclass and make this year all about you.IT’S not really a newsflash that British children are addicted to sugar. But the problem is worse than we might have thought.New research shows that from the age of two, children are consuming an average of almost oz of sugar a day, which is more than twice the recommended maximum daily allowance.This is not just destroying our young people’s teeth. Britain now has the worst obesity rate in Western Europe.Being overweight increases the risk of major health problems including Type  diabetes.So this is an unprecedented health crisis waiting to happen.And the reality is it’s not the fault of the Government, the NHS or the schools – it’s down to parents.It’s our responsibility to read food labels and cook healthy meals from scratch rather than relying on ready meals and takeaways.We also need to teach our kids to make good choices themselves and to develop a taste for healthy food.Unfortunately, though, the hardest word in the English language is “No”.Saying: “No, you can’t have sweets, crisps, fizzy drinks or sugary cereal” can be hard.And, often, it’s so much easier to say yes. Sure, you certainly get an easier le, but you’ll also have an obese, unhealthy and unhappy child.Obesity is now a disease. And it’s almost always a self- inflicted one, which takes years off our lives.The good news is that it’s reversible.Perhaps eating less sugar is one new year’s resolution we should all aspire to keep ANYONE  joining me by doing a Dry January this year I’m becoming a bit of a pro since I seem to do it every year.And while I wish I had some uplting advice about how to get through it, the reality is that I am prepared for a depressing, miserable boring month.The only way to survive it is to not go out, not have friends over, do absolutely zilch and just keep on sipping water.I suppose that’s the whole point, in a way.So welcome to the wagon – but roll on February.HUGE congratulations to Abbey Clancy and Peter Crouch on the announcement that they are expecting their fourth child.And also . . . isn’t Abbey looking fabulous in her Instagram snap Most of us, me included, looked like a bag of spuds after two children. But she has three kids already and another on the way and still looks incredible.I guess that’s a combination of good genes, good diet and the right exercise. But whatever she is doing, it’s working. Good for her!SOMETHING tells me that Justin Bieber might regret his new tattoo.He’s had the word “Grace” inked above his eyebrow, which is a lovely sentiment, but at first glance I’m sorry to say it looks a bit like he’s had stitches.And that’s not going to be a great image when he is .I’ve never understood tattoos – let alone on the face – and especially when the result looks like you’ve had a am trip to AE.I’M so happy to hear that every child is going to learn basic first aid including CPR in school to help boost heart attack survival rates.Education Secretary Damian Hinds has announced that he wants all pupils to be able to give emergency care by the time they leave school so more lives can be saved.All I can say is: About time.I did an advanced first aid course and now offer them to all my employees at West Ham. In fact, I actively encourage them to do it.You never know when you might use it, andsomeone does need it you could save their le. Now all schools need to do is bring back home economics lessons so kids can cook for themselves.Then they’ll have some real le skills when they finally leave home.“COULD do better”. That’s the phrase that went through my mind watching Khloe Kardashian twerking on New Year’s Eve for her boyfriend, Tristan Thompson . . . who was completely oblivious.A video showed Khloe shaking her bits and bobs in a silver and black leopard-print bodysuit for Tristan’s benefit – only to look round for a kiss and see that his back was turned.She is a beautul girl and, frankly, she doesn’t have to try so hard.Khloe could be with someone who is genuinely interested in her as opposed to flogging this dead horse. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

No one deserves this more than them.“They’ve been flat out since they heard they won so we haven’t really had a chance to properly speak to them.”The lucky couple from County Down, Northern Ireland, scooped £,,. — making them the fourth biggest UK lottery winners in history.After sharing their news at a press conference in the Culloden Hotel in Belfast on Friday, the couple flew to Hartlepool – where they lived for  years - where they will be reunited with their daughters Katrina, Fiona and Natalie, who has been living in New Zealand, and their three grandchildren.Sharon added: “You couldn’t have planned it betteryou tried.“It is purely coincidental that Natalie was flying back from New Zealand this weekend, Frances and Paddy booked their flights over to England a few weeks ago.“She didn’t come home over Christmas so they all planned to meet in Hartlepool as Fiona, Katrina and their kids live over there.”Daughter Natalie has been living in New Zealand for the last year teaching paddle boarding after completing a Masters degree, and had planned this eight-week trip home long before finding out about the lottery win.Sharon is hoping to see her sister soon – and congratulate her in person.She added: “Since they heard the news they’ve been so busy but I told her to let me know when everything has settled down so we can meet. “The whole family is in shock – it’s not a normal amount of money.”Frances and Patrick currently rent their home in Northern Ireland and say they will use the money to move back to England and buy a house.Speaking at the press conference on Friday, Frances said: I always hoped we would win the lottery one day, but when we did, it would be just our luck that lots of others would win on the same day with the same numbers too - never in my wildest dreams did I think we would ever win almost £ million.hr  gtOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Will it be a General Election, a second referendum, the Government’s deal or a “no deal” exit My guess is that the last two are the most likely.Theresa May’s tactic is to run down the clock until MPs feel they have no option but to back the Government’s deal and avoid a no-deal departure.The Government has been blitzing constituencies to put pressure on MPs via their supporters.But a recent poll indicated that  per cent of Conservative constituency workers think a no-deal Brexit would be better than the PM’s deal.So that tactic hasn’t worked, and a nasty Commons confrontation looms.It is not surprising that David Davis, the former Brexit Secretary, has suggested the PM should postpone the vote for a second time.It is the Irish backstop, that tortuous measure which binds Northern Ireland closely to EU regulations, which has caused the most dficulty, particularly as the Government is dependent on DUP votes for its survival.To the DUP it is unacceptable that there should, in effect, be a border down the Irish Sea. To Conservative MPs there is also the danger of being locked into the backstop indefinitely and that, having already agreed to accept £billion, the EU would have no incentive to move on and negotiate a decent Free Trade agreement.If the PM could somehow get firm assurances from the EU that would guarantee the backstop was definitely a temporary measure then that might persuade MPs, including the DUP, to change their minds.After all,the backstop is only temporary, all the things that are objectionable in the backstop, such as the inability to sign new trade deals, are also only temporary.It is not impossible that there could be a concession on these lines. Butthe Government is defeated in the Commons, what then In some ways the PM’s hand might be strengthened and she could say to Brussels that it is absolutely clear the present deal cannot get through ­Parliament.The EU will maintain that its offer is final, but this would not be the first time the EU has said that, only for a new offer to then appear.Opponents of Brexit cling to the hope that defeat in the Commons will lead either to a second referendum or a General Election. But neither will happen automatically.Under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act, a General Election can only be heldParliament votes for one or the Government loses a vote of ­confidence.The DUP don’t want Jeremy Corbyn as PM and as long as Mrs May’s deal has not passed, the DUP will continue to support the Government.A second referendum could only happenthe Government introduced legislation for one. No Conservative PM would survive doing that.The remaining option is the so- called no-deal Brexit, which really means trading on World Trade ­Organisation terms with both the EU and the rest of the world.This is how much of world trade is conducted and how many countries outside the EU trade with the EU.Strictly speaking there is no such thing as a no-deal Brexit.There would be many side deals covering administrative areas that are not strictly trade, such as health regulations, safety, aviation, transportion of animals and so on.No one is claiming there would be no problems. Inevitably there will be some, but they would essentially be short term, and we would not face a bill of £billion.Leaving without a deal is feared by some large businesses anxious that integrated manufacturing supply chains might be interrupted. But Britain imports manufacturing components already from many non-EU areas of the world. These issues are solvable.Roberto Azevedo, Director General of the World Trade Organisation, has said there is no reason why trading on WTO terms should lead to disruption.He presumably knows what he is talking about.But the Government seems unable to make up its mind about a no-deal Brexit.Originally the PM boldly declared: “No deal is better than a bad deal”. Presumably she meant it.But recently the Government has launched Project Fear Mark , highlighting the alleged disaster of a no-deal Brexit in a lurid way.This campaign provoked a civil servant to write a remarkable anonymous article in a national ­newspaper declaring that “the civil ­service was ready for no-deal”, advanced preparations had been made and she accused the Government of deliberately concealing the work that had been done in order to pressurise MPs to swallow the ­Government’s “disastrous deal”.It seems probable that the Government will not be able to get the PM’s deal through Parliament and so will have to go back to Brussels, not just once, but maybe several times.If the EU refuses to budge, the automatic legal position is that the UK will leave on March , eventhere is no deal and stalemate in Parliament.There is very little that Parliament can do to stop that now. It is what Parliament has voted for in the past.My guess is that the EU may well come up with some concession, perhaps a legally binding clarication, and that there will be a lot of arguing, probably right up to midnight on March .But whatever happens, the next day we will leave.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Despite growing up in a happy, loving adoptive family, she still longed to meet her blood relatives. Michelle was born in New York in , and adopted just hours later by a Calornian couple called Joan, now , and Joel, now . ‘I’m forever grateful for the childhood my adoptive parents gave me,’ says Michelle. ‘I know how much they wanted a child, and I’m so glad Iwas put up for adoption so that we found each other.’ But Michelle always had a natural curiosity about the woman who gave birth to her, and when social media grew in popularity, Michelle saw the opportunity she needed. ‘I shared my story on everyfamily reunion site going, as well as social media,’ says Michelle. ‘But the years went on and I had no luck.’ Michelle had very little information about her birth mother, other than a name and an old picture.   She’d trawl through the internet for anyone with her mother’s name, but had no idea where she could be living or evenshe was alive. Then, one evening in , she came across a Facebook profile of a woman who shared her mother’s name, and who looked strikingly like the picture Michelle had treasured for so many years. She was sure it was her, and her instincts proved to be right. ‘I sent an emotional message, and waited to seeshe’d reply,’ says Michelle. ‘She did, and we talked on the phone the following day. The next week, I flew to meet her – it was magical finding out how much we had in common.’ Michelle understood when Diane, now , explained that, at , she hadn’t felt ready to be a mother and had wanted her baby to have the best le she could. But it was a blow when Diane explained she had no idea what Michelle’s father was called. ‘Ithought it would be impossible to find him since I had no name, no photograph, no location,’ says Michelle. ‘I knew thelittle hole in my heart thatwasachingwould just have to make peace withremainingvacant.’ But within a few years, at-home DNA tests became readily available. Suddenly, it was possible to be linked to thousands of blood relatives for as little as pound. Michelle realised that she could potentially find her father just by sending off a saliva sample.   The test results linked Michelle to a first cousin on her father’s side. After some online ‘stalking’ of her cousin, she came across the Facebook profile of a man called Greg Hicks – his uncle – who she knew must be her birth father. There was a definite family resemblance. ‘There was no feeling in the world like looking at this picture of the man I knew was my dad,’ she says. ‘For years, I had a recurring dream of meeting him – and here he was.’ Nervously, she sent Greg a message on Facebook, well aware he had no idea she existed. At first, Greg assumed he was the victim of a scam because he didn’t recognise Diane’s name and had never lived in New York. But when he looked up Diane online, he began to connect the dots: the pair had both worked in Philadelphia in , and had mutual friends. ‘We spoke on the phone for five hours the next day,’ says Michelle. ‘It was a rush of emotion like you wouldn’t believe. There were tears as we swapped stories, and Iwas overwhelmed when he told me I had a half-brother called Austin. Growing up asan only child, I’d longed for siblings.’   Michelle and Greg set a date to meet a month later at Orange County Airport, Calornia. ‘It unfolded like something from my wildest dreams,’ she recalls. ‘When we saw each other, we started running and just wrapped our arms round one another.’ It was an overwhelming yet joy-filled trip as Michelle was introduced to aunts, cousins, uncles and grandparents she never thought she’d have the chance to meet. For Greg too, meeting Michelle has been an enormously positive experience. ‘At first I was a little suspicious when I received Michelle’s message,’ he says, ‘but when we spoke, I realised the truth. I feel truly blessed – the joy and love my family has given Michelle has just ignited and multiplied back.’ Michelle now has two sets of loving parents, and feels incredibly fortunate. ‘I’m grateful because I know how many other adoptees are out there searching for parents and haven’t been as lucky,’ says Michelle. ‘It’s better than any movie I’ve ever watched and it’s my le.’ "},{"url":null,"title":"baby who holds breath up","story":"NewsBaby who holds breath up to  times a day has spasms triggered by a door knockEXCLUSIVE: Little Alayna, ten months old, left her parents fearing for her le when on top of her undiagnosed brain condition she battled sepsisShareCommentsByDanya BazaraaNews Reporter:,  JAN NewsLittle Alayna suffers with an undiagnosed brain condition \"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA mother has told how her baby holds her breath up to  times a day and has spasms that can be triggered by the slightest movement such as a knock on the door. Sophie Giblins ten-month-old daughter Alayna suffers from an undiagnosed brain condition which means she has regular spasms that can be brought on by almost anything - including teething and nappy changes. Her mum described how little Alaynas diaphragm spasms, causing her full body to stfen so she cant breathe - until finally she takes a big breath and is released. The spasms - which started when she was three months old but continue today - can last anything from  seconds to a minute, and happen five to  times a day, Sophie says. Alaynas condition means her brain doesnt tell her to breathe, so she has to have a non invasive oxygen mask overnight and during the day she uses nasal cannulas, her mum explained. The tot sadly deteriorated when in October she battled sepsis, leaving her terried mum and dad Jezz Bateson, , fearing for her le. But their one in a million girl pulled through and inspires her parents day by day with her strength.  At the beginning it was horrible to watch because she turns blue at the same time, -year-old Sophie from Withernsea, Yorkshire, told Mirror, speaking about Alaynas spasms. It frightens other people but now we stay calm because we know she will come back out of it. We call her holding her breath having a paddy. To get her out of it we put her dummy in and tap it because she loves her dummy - and that way she has to breathe out of her nose or we turn her oxygen up. All we want is for her to be comfortable and happy. Speaking of when Alayna contracted sepsis, Sophie told: I just cried and cried and didnt know what to do or what to say. It all happened so quickly, we didnt know how to process it. It was awful but we clung to each breath she took. When she went into septic shock we were told to expect the worst. We were terried we would lose her. We just kept being told she is a sick little girl and we dont know what the next  hours will hold. She was in such a critical condition. We have been through so much with her - and to have something that was nothing to do with her condition was horrible. We always thought it would be her le-threatening condition that would break her down. It was so hard to handle. We didnt know what we could tell our sons. I really didnt think she would pull through it because of her condition but Jezz said shes strong, she can do this and he helped pull me through.  Sophie added: She is honestly one in a million. Not only is she coping with all of her conditions she has just recently battled with sepsis and nearly lost her le but has come out the other side. She is our inspiration. Sophie said no problems were detected during her pregnancy. Shed noticed after Alayna was born that she would hold her breath temporarily when she was having nappy changes or when she was hungry, but Sophie says they were told it wasnt concerning at that stage. But a fortnight later, Alayna seemed to change colour. Two weeks after she was born she turned a grey-blue colour, Sophie said. We were just at home doing our day to day routine. She seemed fine, but just a dferent colour. People came round and commented on it. We took her to the GP who sent us to hospital as a precaution. There, she was given oxygen, but nobody knew anything.  Alayna was taken to AE at the Hull Royal Infirmary where she had an ECG, MRI and CT scan which her mum says came back clear. But Sophie was told that Alaynas carbon dioxide levels had increased dramatically over the two weeks from holding her breath and not letting enough out. So she was put on oxygen until her condition stabilised. Then aged  weeks, Alayna was transferred to the Leeds Childrens Hospital in May for further tests which showed she had too much white matter on her brain. Sophie was told her daughters brain was still like a newborns. When she was born, for two weeks she was a perfect baby, she said. It was hard to come to terms with the fact she is not going to be able to do certain things. Doctors said they didnt knowshe would progress orshe would stay like that- it was devastating.  At eight months old, Sophie said her baby had developed as much as a three month old. Medics had said at the  week scan that she had a le limiting brain condition - but Sophie says they still dont have an exact diagnosis. We still dont know what shes going to be able to do andshe is going to be able to do anything, she told. Alayna also has hypotonia, commonly known as floppy baby syndrome, which is a state of low muscle tone. She is on quite a lot of medication to try and soothe her and can only eat pureed food. Sophie says they dont know whats going to happen in the future and try to take each day as it comes, remaining as normal as possible for their sons Harry, five, and George, three.  Alayna spent the first six months of her le in hospital - between Hull and Leeds - before the family were finally able to take her home. But her shock battle with sepsis in October sadly made her condition worsen. Sophie had become concerned after Alayna was asleep for too long and so she took her to hospital to check everything was OK. But the mum says a water infection turned into septic shock and within a day her whole body was shutting down. Everything went dramatically downhill. Everyone thought that was it for her. Alayna was put on a lot of medication, sedated, incubated and put on a ventilator, Sophie said. We were told she was a very, very poorly child, she continued.  But each day she seemed to get better. She was trying her hardest and has been doing brilliantly. Everyone is shocked with how far she has come already - but it was frightening. Jezz is the strong one and we all followed him and tried to stay strong. She looked so small attached to everythingat every angle. All of us broke down. But within a few days she started waking up and slowly but surely coming back to her normal self. Alayna eventually came off the ventilator in place for a non-invasive one.

The -year-old, from Chelmsford in Essex, subjected his ex to a deluge of phone calls, messages and emails and even showed up at her home on several occasions. Dinig and Miss Lawrences relationship ended due to his jealousy over her relationship with her children’s father, Chelmsford Crown Court heard on Friday, reports EssexLive. While the two then had an on-and-off relationship, there came a point where the victim had enough of Dinigs behaviour and blocked him on social media.  Dinig, who has an eight-year-old daughter from a previous relationship, then took a course of action which descended into harassment. He would call Miss Lawrence between  to  times a day from a withheld number, would call from his own phone and he would also email her five times a day. Prosecuting, Alex Wright revealed how Dinig would beg his former girlfriend to rekindle their relationship and detailed how he started showing up at her home. One one occasion Dinig left shopping outside Miss Lawrences house and another time he left a note stating love you. “She contacted police after he sent an email to her ex, her ex’s parents and her, saying he and Miss Lawrence were in love and they should stop coming between them,” Mr Wright told the court. “On September  he phoned her while he was drunk and he kept ringing and turned up at her home address. “The police were called and he’d been trying to get in her car and through the back door.” Dinig also sent further messages on September  and additional calls to his victim were made between September  to October . Following the repeated incidents of harassment, matters became more serious for Dinig when he made contact with another woman. The woman, who had known the defendant for a long time, had been urging the victim not to get into a relationship with him. In a message sent to the second woman, Dinig told her to tell Miss Lawrence I have tried to kill myself or something”. Another message stated: “Make her retract it. I am so close to getting [my daughter] back.” She did not act on any of those requests but instead contacted Miss Lawrence to tell her about the messages.  This led to Dinig’s eventual arrest and he was charged with attempting to pervert the course of justice. During the proceedings at Dinig’s sentencing hearing today, his previous convictions were read out to the court. His most recent conviction was in May  and it was also mentioned that there had been two previous incidents where he had been accused of harassing a former partner, including the mother of his daughter. “He was under post-sentence supervision at the time of these activities,” noted Judge Turner. “He had finished the Building Better Relationships course in October, which doesn’t suggest it was particularly successful. The judge added: “This is the third relationship breakdown that has taken him into harassment - it makes it out ashe isn’t learning.” Defending Dinig, Alex Burrell admitted his client had dficulty accepting the relationship with Miss Lawrence had come to an end. However, he stated that his client had insisted that his focus was to repair his mistakes, rekindle his relationship with his daughter and at no stage was there ever a threat of violence. “He had a problem accepting it was over,” Mr Burrell added. “He has an eight-year-old daughter and his focus is to ensure he has as much contact with her and to do the electrical contract work he was doing before. Mr Burrell also explained that some of Dinig’s behaviour may be down to his father having an extramarital affair when he was younger. After hearing from both the prosecution and defence, Judge Turner passed sentence on Dinig. “For a third occasion in your le a relationship has gone badly wrong,” he said.  “To put it colloquially you haven’t been able to take no for an answer. “You must have known perfectly well the legal requirements you have to abide by and for some reason you haven’t managed to keep yourself under control. “That’s very concerning and very unpleasant for her. “You went entirely the wrong way about it and not for the first time. The judge continued: “You are now -years-old and you are a father of an eight-year-old - it’s time you started to take responsibility for your conduct. “This is the third relationship you have gone down this road and you have got seven convictions for  offences. “You appear to have learned almost nothing. “The irony here to this case is that you had finished the ‘Building Better Relationships’ programme. “None of that seems to have focused your mind.” Dinig, of Waveney Drive, was sentenced to six months in prison for perverting the course of justice and two months for harassment. Both sentences will be served consecutively. Dinig, who will serve half that time in custody, was also made subject to a restraining order for three years.

They increased from two reports of sexual assault in  to  in  then dropped. However the full data from  has not been released. Data from Dyfed-Powys Police, who cover mid-Wales showed there were six allegations of rape and  of sexual assault against people too young to be prosecuted, and in Gwent there were  of rape and  of sexual assault. In South Wales, no offences were recorded - but the force said the data is not routinely collated and while searches by its analysts found no results, it could not be sure this was accurate. A spokesman NSPCC Cymru said the charity was aware sexual crimes being committed by children were happening far too frequently.   There is something particularly shocking and disturbing about a child being sexually abused by another young person, he said. Unfortunately, we know that it is happening far too frequently with our Childline service providing thousands of counselling sessions a year to children to whom this has happened. Both victim and perpetrator are at risk of suffering lasting damage as a result of this abuse. Tackling it demands that all children are introduced to concepts such as boundaries and consent from primary school onwards so they understand what sexual abuse is and know how to keep themselves safe. Police said all reports of this nature were thoroughly investigated. Dyfed-Powys told the BBC that there was no standardised way of collecting the data so it is dficult to compare it with other forces.

Labour’s Shadow Transport Minister Andy McDonald said: “These idend payments to shareholders are a major kick in the teeth for passengers who have just been forced to suck up another unfair rise in rail fares.   “Profit has been privatised, whilst loss-making franchises are just handed back to the Government, no questions asked.” Last February, Transport Secretary Chris Grayling said Stagecoach, which operated the line in conjunction with Virgin Trains, was incurring “signicant losses” and would not be able to continue the franchise. It was taken into public control in May. A Stagecoach Group spokesperson said: The East Midlands Trains franchise has delivered industry leading levels of performance over the last ten years and customers have benefited from millions of pounds of investment to improve services. We have also continued to pay substantial premiums to government.As with any private company, and as per our contract with the Department for Transport, its normal practice that idends are paid out to shareholders where applicable.

Experts say happiness at home and work is likely to help give you the biggest long-term health benefits – so set some goals to make  your best year yet. In a study at Ohio University, psychologist David Niven found people who identied a goal were  per cent more likely to feel satisfied with their lives and per cent more likely to feel positive about themselves. Another study by Brandeis University in Massachusetts, New York’s University of Rochester andthe German Institute for Economic Research found feeling a sense of control over le reduced mortality risk by  per cent. Here, le coach Royston Guest echoes that positivity and shares tips for getting the most out of le.  Take a bird’s-eye view of your le Most of us fall into two categories and Royston describes them by using a scene from a nightclub. He says: “We’re either ‘on the dance floor’, amid all the energy and chaos of our modern lives, with fast-paced jobs, demanding home lives and never-ending digital culture. “But to realise our potential, we need to spend time ‘on the balcony’ – where we take a step back, observe and study our lives with a much broader perspective. “This self-awareness helps us make conscious choices on how we want to shape our lives without the noise and distraction of everything going on around us.” Identy the dferent parts of you Realise that when you’re a parent you’re not just making decisions for yourself – what you do affects your whole family. Royston says: “Le is hectic and it’s easy to be swept along. Sit down, away from distractions, turn off your phone and write a list of how you juggle the four parts that make up you. “There is the personal you, the professional you, the relationship you and the parent you. There are only  hours in a day. We spend eight in bed and eight working, so ensure each ‘me’ is in balance.”  Define what success means If you’ve ever written a bucket list, re-assess it and work out what tangible goals you can achieve. Finding a successful role model can help keep you motivated too. “Think about where you are and where you want to be, what success means to you,” says Royston. “It might be arriving home from work for pm so you can bath your kids, or having enough money to go on a fab holiday. Choose things that make you happy, make your heart sing. Getting down on paper what is important to you will help get your le in synch.” Analyse your progress every day To succeed, we need to be forming new habits and regularly monitoring how close we are to reaching our goals. Royston says: “Design your ‘high performance week’ where you mapout what you want to achieve. “Include family time or trips to the gym too – becauseyou don’t book them in, they won’t happen.  “Then each day have a ‘preview’ in the morning, where you look at the elements of your day, think about how productive you will be and what is a good use of your time and what may not be. At the end, have a ‘review’ and consider what went well, what didn’t and what you can learn, then each dayyou’re spending time ‘on thebalcony’ instead of being consumed by your le.” Be motivated by your own mortality Thinking about how long we have left of our lives should be uplting rather than depressing. Royston suggests imagining you’re listening to the eulogy at your own funeral. Rather than “could haves” you should focus on achieving the things you want to be known for and feel proud of. He says: “Use mortality as a motivator to stop living on autopilot and take ownership of your le. “It’s a powerful driver for creating context, meaning and focus in what you do, why you do it and how you can become the best version of yourself.”Rise: Start Living The Le You Were Meant To Lead is out on January , in book stores and at amazon, from pound.."},{"url":null,"title":"ive saved more 1000 people","story":"NewsIve saved more than , people since I tried to take my own leEXCLUSIVE: Former English teacher Joy Hibbins has just been awarded the British Empire Medal in the New Year’s Honours list for services to vulnerable peopleShareCommentsByMatthew Barbour:,  JAN Updated:,  JAN NewsJoy Hibbins turned her le around \"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA woman who twice tried to take her le has gone on to save more than , other people on the brink of suicide.

I was told I’d have to wait at least eight months for any therapy. “I basically felt deserted with no hope and that the only way to escape my shytorment was to end my le. “It was then that I knew I had to change the system for crisis care, which gave me a positive focus to stay alive and help others where I’d been let down. “I knew that kindness and care for patients with acute mental health shyproblems within a professional context was what was needed, so I spent the next few months planning my charity.” Joy, who lives in Cheltenham, shyattended a series of mental health shytraining courses as well as recruiting a team of psychiatric professionals. She recalled: “I came up against so many barriers and so much scepticism that I was equipped to set this up. “But the more I was knocked down the more determined I became to turn my vision into a reality.” "},{"url":null,"title":"kate middleton joins queen church","story":"NewsKate Middleton joins Queen for church service as Christmas break comes to an endThe Duchess of Cambridge, Kate Middleton, joined her husband Prince William and the Queen for a service at St Mary Magdalene ChurchShareCommentsByZoe ForseyActing Audience Editor:,  JAN Updated:,  JAN NewsKate and William were smiling as they arrived \"Get Royal Family updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThe Duke and Duchess of Cambridge joined the Queen for a church service in Sandringham as their Christmas break comes to an end.

The -year-old, whose youngest son is gay, vowed thata childs biological mother would not come to their LGBT wedding, she would instead. Sara, who is from Oklahoma, in the US, wrote: If your biological mom wont come to your same-sex wedding, then call me. Ill be there and Ill bring the bubbles. After Saras post went viral in July, she has since launched an organisation called Free Mom Hugs. The nonprofit organisation offers mother-like support to LGBT youth.   Speaking to CNN she said: When people ask us about Free Mom Hugs, they usually say, How can I join  What can I do  Thats what made the post go viral. It was people all over the world saying, I want to do that, I can do that, Ive been doing that.

It was there that she learned of everyones experiences which led her and other ally mothers to form the Free Mom Hugs organisation. Since her post, Sara has been invited to attend several weddings, and she said that her message has created something of a movement. She added: Im not the first mom to offer free mom hugs or attend weddings as a stand-in. But when we show up for any group thats marginalised, thats how we can make sure they really know they are loved and celebrated.

One student , , said he played with and touched the small, cute puppy, believed to have been a labrador. Mr Crosland is said to have initially tried to feed it to a snake, but the reptile did not attack it. According to testimony, the dog was in poor health - and emaciated to the point where its ribs were visible. Mr Croslands own son, Mario, argued this is why his father had fed the puppy to the turtle, asking: If you can lose a le to help another, then why not  After being exonerated, the teacher thanked the community of Preston, Idado, for staying behind me. He added: Its really what got me through all this, just their comments and talking to me and expressing their love.   Preston, in rural Idaho, is known around the world as the setting of the  teen cult classic film Napoleon Dynamite. Marc Gee, the local schools superintendent, had previously told the media that his administration became aware of a regrettable circumstance involving some of the biological specimens on March  . Mr Gee said: The event occurred well after students had been dismissed and was not a part of any school-directed program. We emphasize that at no time was the safety of students or staff compromised.   Following the incident, state officials seized the turtle and euthanised it, as a non-native species. After the incident attracted national and international media coverage, a petition to have Mr Crosland fired was signed by more than , members of the public. The petition read: Unfortunately, on March , [Crosland] decided to feed one of those creatures - a snapping turtle to be exact - a puppy. Please join in demanding that Robert Crosland be fired for this disturbing decision! But a counter-petition started by the local community, former students and Mr Croslands colleagues expressed support for the long-time science teacher, and had attracted almost , signatures by Saturday, the Idaho Statesman reported .

Her right eye experienced what in the brain would be similar to a stroke, obliterating her optic nerve and causing severe damage to the retina. The substantial pressure in both eyes stretched the optic nerve, completely separating it from her right eye and compromising it beyond repair in the left.

We controlled the game and had chances to score the second.“We didn’t and then we concede two goals and that is not good. If we want to be top of this league we cannot repeat this mistake.”Painful as the unexpected defeat was, he believes what’s vital now is United put the disappointment of what was only a second defeat since Neilson took charge in October, behind them as quickly as possible.And with home games against Partick Thistle and Dunfermline coming up over the next two Saturdays, he wants the focus to be on what lies ahead and not what’s just gone.“We now just have to think about the next game. We have two games coming now at home and we must think about that and make sure we win them.“Alloa was a very big disappointment but there is still half of the season for us to play and we must put things right. We must keep going and be strong for the rest of the season.“We have been good in most home games and we must make sure that continues.”Since his arrival near the end of the summer transfer window on a two-year contract at Tannadice, Bouhenna has impressed as a hard-tackling centre-half who can also play when he is moving forward with the ball at his feet.Saturday past, however, saw him moved into a midfield holding role and despite the result, put in an impressive performance.For him that change of role was about doing what was needed for the team.“I have played before some games in the midfield. Fraser Fyvie was injured and I will play there because you must always do what is needed for the team.“It was not a surprise because when I came here I played some games in midfield and when the manager asked me to play there I was happy to do it for the team.“I have played some games there during my career. Centre-back is my best position, of course, but I knew I could help the team there and I did it.”"},{"url":null,"title":"dundee council spends 1m to repair vandalised property","story":"Dundee City Council has had to spend more than £ million to repair vandalised property in the last six years.Since April , £. million has been spent repairing everything from play equipment to school property and graffiti-covered buildings.The £, average annual bill is equal to the cost of fixing , potholes, or providing school unorms for almost , pupils.Every year, a large chunk of the cost goes on fixing smashed bus shelters.Last year, more than £, was spent on repairing glass  on dozens of bus stops, with the stop on Forfar Road at Claverhouse Road fixed four times in just eight months.Some high-profile incidents in the last year include vandals spray-painting the outer wall of the ancient Howff graveyard in October.Vandals also sparked school traffic chaos at the new North East Campus in Whitfield in November after damaging a car park barrier.In the summer, youths deliberately set fire to grass and play equipment at Powrie Park in Fintry.North East Conservative MSP Bill Bowman said the “wasted” cash could be better spent where.He said: “Every time a thoughtless inidual defaces public property, it breaks the law and takes money away from where it’s needed.”A spokesman for Dundee City Council said: “The council works hard to apply risk management measures to reduce the impact and cost of vandalism.”"},{"url":null,"title":"dundee planning swoop for ross county captain marcus fraser","story":"Dundee are planning a swoop for Ross County skipper Marcus Fraser.Manager Jim McIntyre’s plans to reshape the Dark Blues squad this month are set to ramp up over the coming days and the -year-old defender is one on the Dens gaffer’s radar.Former Celtic kid Fraser was made captain at Victoria Park over the summer ahead of their bid for an immediateto the Premiership following last season’s relegation.He’s played  times for the Staggies this campaign as they’ve put themselves on track to do just that as they lead the second-tier title race.His current deal with the Highland club expires in the summer, however, which could pave the way for Dundee to do a deal this month to prevent the Staggies losing him for nothing.A swap deal for Dens stalwart Cammy Kerr has been mooted, though the full-back is himself free to speak to other clubs this month with his own contract ending in the summer.And the desire to stay in the top flight,a new offer from the Dark Blues isn’t forthcoming, is likely to see Kerr weigh up his options.With his side rock bottom of the Premiership during the winter break, Jim has repeated the need to bring in the “right types” to get the side out of relegation trouble – something he did in similar circumstances at County.And that could mean moving for players he’s worked with before knowing exactly what they will bring with October signing Martin Woods already an example of that.With Dundee already short of centre-backs, a move for former Scotland U  man Fraser could be made sooner rather than later."},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/01/5c2f39f1415fc.jpg ","title":"dundee united target two new faces ahead of partick thistle clash","story":"Dundee United have targeted two new faces ahead of today’s home clash with Partick Thistle.After labelling his squad not good enough to win promotion in the wake of the defeat at Alloa last week, boss Robbie Neilson has been hard at work this week to bring in some of the players he’d already targeted for the January transfer window.He will team up again with young striker Aidan Nesbitt, who played under Robbie during their spell at MK Dons.The -year-old signed yesterday on a deal until the end of the season.mdash Dundee United FCJanuary , Nesbitt told the United website: #It#s a big club, and I am delighted to be here.

In , experiments were carried out to discover the best material for paving roads, and three were in the running.One was Aberdeen “brown granite” and two ieties of “blue whyn” – a hard, dark coloured rock.The book goes on to detail that Aberdeen granite got the “thumbs-up” after London’s Commissioner for Roads at the time decided it was “much the harder and more durable material”.Finding something sturdy to pave London’s carriageways and footpaths was key to the boom in the granite industry of the north-east.Aberdeen Journals reported in  that “London Bridge, and all of the hills of the city, will be paved with the best assortment of Aberdeen Granites, as they are by experiment found to be the best adapted for the purpose”.Aberdeen and Peterhead granite would go on to form part of the foundation stone at London Bridge in .Mr Dey, who lives in Alford, said: “I first served five years as an engineer in Aberdeen with famous crane and cableway maker JM Henderson. It was this that gave me a lelong interest in the history of machinery and tools.“Eventually I moved from engineering to study history at Aberdeen University and after completion of a postgraduate degree I moved into the world of museum curating, responsible for aspects of social and industrial history at Aberdeen Art Gallery and Museums.“It was there that my particular interest in the granite trade blossomed under the guidance of the late John Maclaren, retired manager of Bower  Florence granite merchants.“I quickly found that the company I’d served my time with, Henderson, had played no small part in the history of the granite trade, supplying cranes, rock drills and blondinsto businesses across the north-east. A happy coincidence.”Mr Dey added: “I found it frustrating that Aberdonians tended to take this granite heritage for granted, not seeing or acknowledging how glorious and unique the granite heart of the city was. Yet it daily stared them in the face.“Retirement, some time ago, gave me the opportunity to take my researches further. When Amberley suggested that I write an illustrated history of the trade I seized the opportunity, seeing a real chance to pay historical homage to the men who quarried and cut the granite and the families who supported this once great industry. ”"},{"url":null,"title":"forces support charity now has space to spare at new aberdeen site","story":"An Aberdeen armed forces charity that was being hampered by problem parkers has moved to new premises.Forces Support Aberdeen was previously based in Hutcheon Street, where they faced an ongoing issue with car parking spaces.The military bereavement charity was frequently having to confront people who were parking in their customers’ spaces.That meant fewer people were coming through the doors of the store, which sells furniture and goods including clothing, electrical items and bric-a-brac.The charity moved after Lidl filed a planning application with Aberdeen City Council to turn the building into a supermarket.Now based in Gateway Business Park in Cove, where there is plenty of parking available, charity bosses are trying to spread the word about their new home.Viv Hutchinson, area manager for Forces Support, hopes the new location will mean more people visit the store.She said: “We’re now based in the Gateway Business Park in Cove, which is so far out of town.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as .

Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":null,"title":"man knocked down new years","story":"NewsMan knocked down in New Years Day hit and run as police appeal for witnessesA man was knocked down with the driver of a vehicle failing to stop following the incident in Tarbolton.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  JAN NewsPolice are appealing for witnesses following the incident\"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA man was knocked down after being the victim of a hit and run attack in Tarbolton.

Vanessa Good, who heads up her own independent firm based in the town’s Newmarket Street, admits travellers need “far more clarity” over Brexit. But she this week laughed off the notion that flights will be grounded – leaving sunseekers stranded – when Britain takes a step into the unknown. It comes as fears grow that a ‘no deal’ Brexit will spark chaos at Britain’s borders and lead to untold problems for travellers. Vanessa, , who bosses the Good Travel Company, said: “There’s no doubt people are on edge at the moment. “Our customers are still coming in to book holidays in the usual numbers, but there is understandable concern. “The problem is we’re seeing so much political scaremongering and it’s hugely unsettling at a time we need far more clarity.” Vanessa, whose firm employs seven across two sites and also specialises in currency exchange, insists her team is trying to issue a note of calm to holidaymakers. She said: “We have people flying out to EU destinations on March , which is the day after Brexit, and they’re perfectly relaxed about the situation. “Others are more concerned so we’ve seen some look to other destinations as a result. “After all, the world is a lot bigger than Europe, and there will definitely be a knock-on effect in that regard. “Market experts say a no-deal will have a negative impact on the pound, and that is obviously something that nobody wants to see. “But the idea that they start grounding flights and nobody can move anywhere seems a bit far fetched. “Uncertainty will always be the biggest crippler and that is the problem facing the industry just now. “But our message to people is to continue booking their holidays as before. “In reality, it is changes like the new EU visa coming into play in , which will cost around seven euros every three years, which will be the biggest dference.” An ABTA spokesperson said: “The European Commission has said that even in a no-deal scenario, flights will still operate between the UK and EU. “ABTA is providing holidaymakers and travellers with advice about Brexit and travel, including on pet passports and driving licences, which can be found at abta brexit.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnEuropean UnionAyrHolidaysAyr News"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"woman admits acting intimidating manner","story":"NewsWoman admits to acting in intimidating mannerThe -year-old shouted, swore and acted in an aggressive and intimidating way towards Shannon Kerr.ShareByAyrshire Post:,  DEC NewsAyr Sherf Court \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA woman has admitted to acting in an intimidating manner.

For Deborah Biggar has just got a whole chunk smaller. The -year-old has whittled herself down to  stone  pounds - after getting too close to the  stone barrier. Deborah, of Dalmellington, revealed a Multiple Sclerosis diagnosis meant she was put on steroids at age just . Even after the first round of steroids she put on two stone. And she said: “I realised I had to do something or my weight would soon be out of control.” She’d kept active as a community support officer and loved horse riding - but had to get out the saddle as her mobility reduced.   Deborah said: “Riding was something I absolutely loved, and also walking, and with this loss of regular activity, I was definitely going to be up against keeping the weight off.” She took the plunge and joined the Coylton branch of WW . She revealed: “I turned up alone and felt very apprehensive. “Due to my illness this wasn’t an easy thing for me to do, as I can be very self-conscious and don’t often go many places on my own, but I needn’t have worried.” Class wellness coach Kellie Brown and her team quickly put Deborah at ease, and she has now only missed one workshop since joining.   During her battle her weight has snowballed up and down as her medications changed. She said: “I am delighted with my weight loss so far as I am feeling much better, not just physically, but I think more importantly, mentally I am in a better place. Going out I do not feel as self-conscious and my confidence is now a lot better. “I went to my nephew’s wedding a happier and much more confident and content person, and looked forward to it, instead of dreading going. “This is all thanks to Kellie and the group I attend at Coylton and this time I will be continuing to attend workshops to help keep me on track.” She tracks calories with an online WW app as she trawls supermarket aisles.   Deborah said: “I love the fact there are so many zero smartpoint foods, and I eat out quite regularly. As long as I track everything and make sensible decisions, I can still lose weight no problem.

water treatment work in the Borders has proved its number one when it comes to number twos, as it celebrates a green efficiency milestone.Galafoot Waste Water Treatment Plant in Galashiels has become one of Scottish Waterrsquos most self-sufficient energy sites, generating more energy than it uses.Using a technique called Combined Heat and Power , the site generates electricity from sewage sludge, the semi-solid by-product of waste water treatment.On average the Galashiels site generates more than , kWh week of renewable energy - which is enough to power  homes for a year.The site does still have to import a small amount of power to the site when the CHP needs maintained, but the consumption of imported power to the site has dropped by a dramatic two thirds since the CHP was installed three years ago.Only two operators work at the Galashiels site which processes an average  m of sludge every day. The sludge is created as part of the water treatment process at the site ndash which serves a population equivalent of around ,. It also treats sludge from most other parts of the Borders, from Eyemouth in the east to Newcastleton in the west.Brian Reavely, better known as Fudge, has worked as a Site Operator at Galafoot for  years. He says one of his proudest achievements is seeing how the site has transformed the way it operates ndash and ensuring it becomes a green as it can.The -year-old, who lives in the town, said: ldquoTreating waste uses a lot of energy,you think about what we are dealing with and the dferent processes it has to go through you get an idea. Added to that this site operates round the clock every day, so it needs a lot of power.ldquoWe take our environmental responsibility very seriously here, even down to recycling items like cans and bottles and packaging in our kitchens.ldquoAnd one thing we have started doing is working with our neighbouring works to ensure that the sludge dry solids are as high as possible when they arrive at our site -ndash to save on energy use, reduce our carbon footprint and minimise vehicle movements.ldquoThings like this can make a real dference. The imported sludge is mixed with the on-site, indigenous sludge. This feeds the digestor which produces the gaswhich is the fuel for the  kW capacity CHP.ldquoWe are very green-aware here and proud of what has been achieved, so much so I have made signs reminding us of how self-sufficient the site is.ldquoI also thought it would be a good idea to let people in the town and the many people who visit here know about our achievements and it was decided a plaque highlighting how energy efficient we are would be a good way to let people know.Another addition to the site is a collection of items that have been put down toilets which enter the sewer network in the town these include a number of rubber ducks,  teeth, plastic toy figures, tennis balls, a dogrsquos chewy toy and ious sized toy cars.Fudge said: ldquoWhether these things have been put down accidentally or not they can block our drains and do real damage to the network. So we do urge folk to be careful what goes down their toilets and sinks.ldquoBut it is baby wipes which are our biggest headache these days, the number of items put into the sewer is unbelievable.ldquoThey do not break up ndash where do people think they go  They just clog up our machines and causes blockages that can lead to flooding and bursts.ldquoOne of my biggest hopes for the new year is for more people to get the message that they have to be more careful what they put down their loos and sinks, be that baby wipes or sanitary products or fats and oils and grease.More than  of Scottish Waterrsquos water and wastewater treatment works are either self-sufficient or partly sufficient in their power requirements, leading to lower operating costs and a more sustainable business.Galashiels is one of the top five that offset most of the sitersquos use as well as being able to export to the gridndash others include Glencorse Water Treatment Works, near Edinburgh and Loch Turret Water Treatment Works in Perth and Kinross.Simon Parsons, Scottish Waters director of strategic customer service planning, said: ldquoTo keep the cost of our services as low as possible it is essential we develop our approach to energy management and continue to reduce our carbon footprint.ldquoWhere appropriate, like at Galashiels, wersquore exploring opportunities to export energy to the National Grid, showing that itrsquos possible to maximise the economic advantages of Scotland water resources in the spirit of a Hydro Nation and contribute to national renewable energy targets.ldquoScottish Water is committed to continuing to reduce its energy bill and further increase renewable generation ndash and Galashiels is a wonderful example of what can be achieved.Three years ago Borders College in Galashiels became the first organisation in the UK to benefit from a waste water heat recovery system, installed in partnership between Scottish Water Horizons and Shark Energy.It extracts the natural warmth contained in waste water in the sewer and transfers the heat to the clean side of the heating system via a heat exchange mechanism. The recovered heat is then amplied via pumps to generate appropriate temperatures for use in buildings.The heat produced is being sold to Borders College producing savings in energy, costs and carbon emissions. The system now provides around  per cent of the heat needed by the Galashiels campus.Earlier this year Scottish Water achieved a major energy milestone when it was announced the amount of renewable energy the company generates and facilitates is now more than double its electricity consumption. It now generates and hosts  Gigawatt hourper annum of renewable energy - enough to power more than , homes for a year."},{"url":null,"title":"galashiels-woman-loses-six-stone-at-slimming-club","story":"A GALASHIELS woman who lost a staggering six dress sizes is encouraging people to join her in dropping the pounds.Jacqui Porteous decided  was her year to lose weight and has so far managed to sht a whopping six stone after signing up to her local Slimming Word class in Galashiels.Jacqui said: ldquoI joined Slimming World after I saw photo of myself that made me realise how overweight I was, as well as how much my health was deteriorating.

We now look forward to the merriment of Hogmanay! These days in between, traditionally known as the Daft Days, are my favourite of Yule time.Yet not so long ago the most popular focus of festivity was neither Christmas nor even Hogmanay, it was Handsel Monday.It fell upon the first Monday after New Year, although there was some dispute as to the exact Monday it should be celebrated, for some measured the date by the old calendar.This was the case for the country folk in East Lothian, or Haddingtonshire as it was then known. So Auld Handsel Monday fell for them on the first Monday after January .It was the country folkrsquos winter holiday because Christmas and Yule festivities had for so long been banned by the Kirk.The word Handsel apparently comes from an old Saxon word which means to give by hand.On Handsel Monday the family gathered together and shared gts and social time, which for much of the th century remained the main winter festival of the rural poor in East Lothian.The East Lothian writer and poet James Lumsden captured the atmosphere of this now forgotten holiday in one of his poems about the day.He tells us the children would wake up all excited, and the merriment would begin as the dawn of this winterrsquos day heralded a special time of conviviality and reunion:ldquoBy screich o morn the bairns are up,\"And loud the auld folk rousin\"What braws are donnd, what sangs are connd,\"What daffin an carousin!\"It was a time when family members made huge efforts tohome and celebrate together. Food had been specially kept for the occasion and those at home awaited the arrival of others who they had perhaps not seen since the previous Handsel Monday.Lumsden says streams of young folk left the towns for their homes in the countryside. Domestic servants, shop assistants, apprentices all set off in the early hours on Handsel Monday ason a pilgrimage, to share in the celebrations:ldquoSune ran we hame wi anxious haste\"For our grand Hansel denner,\"Pork chops and dumplins ndash lord a feast ndash\"A gorge for saunt or sinner!We can picture the scene as daughters and sons ed, greeted by parents and younger siblings, grandparents and old friends. It was a time of gt giving, with family and neighbours sharing treats.But the rich were expected to give too, as it was the tradition that masters and employers would give gts of drink, food and even a financial contribution to the communityrsquos festivities. In fact, the social norms were often overturned on this day, with the landowners serving and working for the poor on this one special day.While it had no religious content, Handsel Monday was in its own way sacred. It was a longed for day off for those who worked hard with little in the way of holidays. It was Christmas Day, Boxing Day and Hogmanay all wrapped into one.And as the day wore into evening, the merriment would build. People made the most of this precious social time together, with stories, dance and song:ldquoSyne sune wi reels, an strathspeys even,\"The wee cot housie dirled,\"As a the blasts o yearth an heaven\"Were gainst its boukie hurled\"Braw lads and lasses lap and skirled.As is always the case with such gatherings, time flew and too soon the day would draw to a close:ldquoBut daffin jigs, an sangs, an tales,\"Sped far too swith the hours on.Sad farewells would have to be made. Mothers and fathers hugged tightly their grown children as they prepared to set off back to their employment. Old and new friends from near and far, who had come to share the day, parted to their duties.They would have to wait another year for the next Handsel Monday gathering. Who knows what fortune and fate would have in store before that time:ldquoFor freends were met whom morrows gales\"Wad waft apart les course on\"Anither year, and maybe neer\"Again while times flood roars on,\"Might they eer meet, or even greet,\"This fickly warls shores on,\"Tho here this day!And yet it was to be Handsel Monday itself whose fate was sealed, as it faded in importance compared to Hogmanay and its traditions of gt giving and family time overtaken by Christmas.It has became part of our Auld Lang Syne, yet its spirit is perhaps now spread over a thankfully longer time of winter festivity.Happy New Year, when it comes.With thanks to Electric Scotland website for the copy of the poem."},{"url":null,"title":"man-caused-disturbance-at-tranent-opticians","story":"Paul Donaghue behaved in a threatening manner and repeatedly shouted and swore at MontgomeryOptometrists on the townrsquos Bridge Street.Donaghue, of Main Street, then began throwing papers around the shop and refused to leave the premises when asked to do so by staff.The -year-old also stole a toy from the Tranent Paper Shop and a quantity of foodfrom a nearby Greggs shop.All the offences took place on November .Donaghue then told police officers his name was James Davidson in an attempt to evade arrest and he was prosecuted for perverting the course of justice.He also pleaded guilty to being in possession of a screwdriver on the same day.Donaghue appeared at Edinburgh Sherf Court,where sentence was deferred for reports to next month."},{"url":null,"title":"new-council-houses-planned-for-ormiston","story":"Proposals submitted by East Lothian Council for  new homes in the village will be scrutinised by its planning department.The site, which would be made up of one, two and three-bedroom properties, is off Tynemount Road and forms part of a wider development of the area which includes  new homes by developer Walker Homes.The development would consist of four one-bedroom ground-floor cottages four one-bedroom upper-floor cottages six two-bedroom ground-floor cottages six two-bedroom upper-floor cottages  three-bedroom end-terraced houses five three-bedroom mid-terraced houses one two-bedroom bungalow and one three-bedroom bungalow.A council spokesman said the local authority was investing pound million in new council housing over the next five years.He added: ldquoThis development would provide a mix of dferent house styles, providing high-quality accommodation for families and iniduals, contributing to the outcomes set out in our local housing strategy by increasing the supply of affordable housing.ldquoWhile a small number of the new properties may be made available to a housing trust for rental opportunities, the majority of the new homes built will be offered as council housing.ldquoFollowing a number of applications for market housing on the site this detailed application is for the development of affordable housing on the site.Scott Gillies, chairman of the villagersquos community council, welcomed the potential of council houses being built.He said: ldquoWithout a doubt it is welcome."},{"url":null,"title":"unique-new-features-for-new-elphinstone-playpark","story":"Pupils at Elphinstone Primary School were given a choice of three potential options for a replacement playpark on the villagersquos Buxley Road.A vote was taken, with an option chosen to create a playpark with two features which will be unique to East Lothian.The first of those is made up of three D hexagon structures which have foot and hand-holds and are designed for climbing on.The second is a raised disc which youngsters can run on.The rest of the park is made up of familiar playpark favourites, including swings, a slide, seesaw, flying fox and climbing net.Elphinstone Community Association has been busy working with East Lothian Council on the project for nearly a year.Now they are hopeful the playpark, which it is estimated will cost about pound,, could be in place in the spring.Stuart MacKenzie, chairman of the villagersquos community association, said: ldquoI think it is fantastic.

We have strong institutions and professions. We have lots of natural strengths. But they will be eroded at a pace that will scare uswe are not awake to this threat.Mr Murray said there were no longer any ldquountouchables in Scotland but warned that there was a danger of a long-term ldquodrag on the nationrsquos economygangster infiltration was not stopped.The investigator said the profits of Scotlandrsquos multi-billion drugs industry were not increasingly being laundered at home, in the new corporate equivalent of traditional cash ldquosafe houses.The old safe houses were properties where bulk cash could be stored before being laundered abroad.Mr Murray explained: ldquoCompanies are now being acquired to take the place of safe houses.ldquoThere is always a reason for cash to be in companies. The companies themselves may have an entirely legitimate business but it provides an effective shelter for these funds which are then drawn in through a network of associated companies. This can then provide a story of value or a source of income for organised crime players.ldquoYou could always tell the sort of companies associated with organised crime. Taxi, security and logistics firms, tanning salon and nail bars.ldquoWe are beginning to move away from that now. What we are seeing is that for the serious players in organised crime and looking to acquire business with a good track record, training and good reputation in marketplace.ldquoThe typical scenario is they identity a company which has all of these characteristics but for whatever reason has run in to cash flow dficulties.ldquoIn general, the central belt of Scotland has always been resilient to outside influences. Increasingly the senior players in Scottish organised are engaging with international service providers.One of those foreign iniduals has himself acquired a business in exactly the way I have described.ldquoI think that could be as a result of wishing to de-risk from being directly involved in the physical carriage of drugs.Scotland has increasingly become known overseas as the new Switzerland - with its shell companies offering the same kind of opportunities to hide illicit cash as Swiss bank accounts once did.Mr Murray, however, is not talking about shell companies, such as Scottish limited partnerships, which tend to bank overseas. He is talking about the purchase by gangsters of real-world business which employ real people and do real business in Scotland.And he believes the consequences for failing to deal with this criminalisation could be grave. Mr Murray said: ldquoThe fundamental penalty for allowing an accumulation of criminal cash in the economy is that it is a drag on the economy. It undermines competitiveness, it discourages legitimate players from entering those markets. If it becomes a growing theme in Scotland, it is bound to affect inward investment.

Like the Ides of March, Britains fate must be sealed on Brexit day in only  weeks time.Will May finally win parliamentary support for her Withdrawal Deal  Will she be ousted in a cabinet coup  Will there be a repeat referendum  Will Britain end up revoking Article   These are the options, broadly speaking. About the only thing that seems pretty certain to me is that there will be no General Election and no ldquoNo Deal Brexit. I simply cannot see parliament or the country accepting the chaos, cost and potential suffering of crashing out of the European Union without any negotiated settlement.True, planes wouldnt fall out of the skies and trade would continue, somehow, but the disruption would create enormous stress. There is a strong possibility of food shortages, and people with medical conditions would suffer needless anxiety over medicine supplies. The fact that the Government is preparing to put the army on the streets and ports testies to the risk of civil disturbance. There would be a hard border in Northern Ireland overnight and a resumption of sectarian tensions. Small firms would go bust and big firms would leave.So, I am confident that MPs and ministers will prevent this happening,necessary by removing Theresa May and forming the equivalent of a wartime coalition. Working back from that the most probable outcomes look like: Revoking Article  or Mays Withdrawal Deal. And, it will be Labour, not Theresa May, the Tory Brexiters or the DUP, who decides which.Brexiters hate the Withdrawal Deal, which they think chains Britain to the EU, and Jeremy Corbyn does too ndash and for rather similar reasons. He thinks the state aid rules would prevent a Labour government nationalising the utility companies, and also believes that a permanent backstop would give Britain ldquono say on any future trade deals. Mays Withdrawal Deal should therefore be defeated by around - votes.Corbyn will then finally table that motion of no confidence in the government which he delayed in December. May will assuredly win that vote, because the last thing Tory MPs and the DUP want is general election, a Corbyn government and an even worse deal. May will now have won confidence votes from her own MPs and from the House of Commons. That will make her immovable ndash at least for the time being.Armed with this she willto Brussels and stage another televised spat with Jean-Claude Juncker. The  will probably have something  up their sleeves . Perhaps Michel Barnier will propose amending the Political Declaration to include a -month limit to the Irish backstop. This was dropped from the final draft of the December communique.The  could also extend the transition period making a commitment that negotiations must be concluded by March . This is already in the Political Declaration, but it could be built into a firm commitment and subject to independent arbitration. The Irish backstop would thus become a last resort and triggered only in the event of a total breakdown of time-limited trade negotiations.This will be the moment of truth for Labour, as Theresa May brings her amended deal back to the Commons in February. The hardline Brexiteers and the DUP will not be persuaded because the legally-binding Irish backstop will still be there in the Withdrawal Agreement. The future will be in Labourrsquos hands. Many pro-Europeans tell me that Corbyn will at this point ldquopivot to a referendum, voting down the Withdrawal Deal a second time, and backing a cross-party amendment for a Peoples Vote.But while he doesnt accept Mays Withdrawal Deal, still less Norway Plus, nor does Corbyn favour remaining in the European Union. Before Christmas, he caused widespread dismay among pro-Europeans by confirming that, evenhe were to win a general election, Labour would still be committed to Britainrsquos departure from the European Union.The Labour leaders instinct will surely be to secure concessions from Theresa May on the future trade negotiations. A closer alignment with the single market and a permanent customs deal, is what he wants. To get her business through, she would surely end up agreeing. Deal done. Britain leaves as planned. Pro-European Labour MPs would rebel, but that would be unlikely to scupper the governments pro-Withdrawal majority.Alternatively,Jeremy Corbyn stands firm and pivots to a referendum, there will be unprecedented turmoil in parliament, not least over what the question should be. Theresa May will stand down and there will be a political vacuum. As the clock ticks down to Brexit day, a new parliamentary party could emerge: the Europe Party, uniting all the pro-Remain MPs, and dedicated to a second referendum. The choice for voters would be Revoking Article  or No Deal. Mayrsquos deal, it seems to me, would be a dead duck by this stage.By Revoking Article  Britain would retain its opt-outs from the euro and its budget rebate and there would be no disruption of trade. It would be asBrexit never happened. Brussels would happily delay Article  for a referendum. However, this referendum would be like an offer voters canrsquot refuse, because MPs in the ldquoRemaniac Coalitionwould have to resign en massethe country opted for No Deal.It would be terrible campaign, exactly three years after the original referendum, with the far right raging about immigration. It would take years, decades for the bad will to subside. But faced with the prospect of a chaotic No DealI suspect voters would back Revoke. There is nothing undemocratic in having a final say. Parliament has failed to find a credible formula for leaving the EU. The only way end this agony and confusion is for Britain to accept that Brexit is just too costly, too dficult, too unpredictable and too all-consuming. The message would be: For Gods sake, lets just stop this madness and get our lives back."},{"url":null,"title":"Today   s feminist activists are wrong to exclude men","story":"Anne Widdicombe might have dismissed it as trivial and whingeing ndash and some #MeTooers undoubtedly deserve that label ndash but the culture of sexual harassment and abuse it calls out is far from unimportant. Equally crucial are other issues that have vexed women for decades,not centuries, among them equality of pay, professional respect and opportunity.So far, so reasonable. Yet, when I heard Mary Robinson, former President of Ireland, talking last week about Mothers of Invention, a podcast she has set up that focusses exclusively on womenrsquos efforts to address climate change, my heart did a double skip: one for delight, two for despair. Delight that women are getting involved directly in trying to help reduce our carbon footprint, without a doubt the most urgent of the worldrsquos ails, but despair at Robinsonrsquos smug assumption that ldquoitrsquos women who change behaviour, in the family and the community.Letrsquos put aside for a moment the fact that, as Robinson reveals in her recent book, Climate Justice, her own awareness of environmental calamity dawned on her like a Damascene conversion astonishingly late in the day. What sets my teeth on edge is the sanctimonious way in which women are increasingly frequently being portrayed ndash mostly by other women. Itrsquos asthere is a collective halo that needs constant polishing, lest it lose its lustre. Indeed, it seems you cannot these days be a female in a position of influence or authority without feeling the urge ndash or the pressure ndash to add a stone to the cairn of womenrsquos rights, entitlements and endeavours.Donrsquot misunderstand me. I am an old-style feminist, and decry utterly the unfair, oppressive and sometimes iniquitous treatment of women in our and other societies. Men have an awful lot to answer for, today and in the past. But I get decidedly uneasy at the perceptual ide that appears to be widening between the sexes. Climate change, said Robinson, is ldquoman-made, and she enjoys using the term, even though admitting it embraces men and women. But apart from this deliberate provocation, is she really correct in assuming that women change attitudes more widely than men Maybe it depends on what sort of country yoursquore living in. When I look around the UK, I donrsquot recognise that stark distinction. Plenty of men seem to be trying to bring about green change, ethical enlightenment, societal improvement, better childcare and education, and are working towards this alongside women. Sometimes, for heavenrsquos sake, they are even taking the lead.Meanwhile, children in two-parent families are open to influences from both parents. While women still tend to spend more time with their young, this does not necessarily equate to a more lasting influence on their behaviour or outlook. The other day my husbandrsquos granddaughter rushed to interrupt her mother who was on the phone to announce that Liverpool had just scored a fourth goal against Newcastle ndash whose influence was that We are going through a phase where almost every interview with a woman politician or banker, entrepreneur or artist, includes the obligatory question about #MeToo, in the same way that every American is asked their opinion of Trump. And while it obviously takes women at the top to help bring about change for those lower down the ladder ndash or in the community at large ndash it is surely not a sacred obligation placed upon each of them. To assume that is to be sexist and discriminatory. Itrsquos certainly not an expectation placed upon men.Yet to listen to some womenrsquos outrage, yoursquod think therersquos a contract, signed at birth, that insists women pay especial attention to female issues eventhere are things that interest them more. Florence Nightingale and Elsie Inglis personally helped save hundreds of lives, and their influence rippled down the decades to the benefit of all, women as much as men. Yet their initial impulse was not to improve things for their own kind, but to help wounded soldiers and the sick and dying. In other words, to improve the conditions of humanity as a whole, not one gender or the other.Of course splinter groups and special interest parties can make things change ndash just look at Dr Inglisrsquos formidable all-women hospitals. There is a galvanising power and collective spirit in female solidarity that nobody can deny. So letrsquos hear it for women tackling climate change. And for men too.In these unsettling and perilous times we surely need to remember that we are all just people.

Itrsquos printed on to a very small chip, about the size of your fingernail.ldquoIf you go back to the radar that was used during the war, the installations were massive.ldquoAndyou go back to the decades after that, the size of radar was for very large-scale, long-distance detection of very small objects very far away.Using miniaturised radar sensors built into the devices we use every day, Mr Quigley says that we could control devices without even touching them.He says that instead of using your hand to gesture and control something, people will actually use objects to control computers and revolutionise everyday living.For example, this could mean building a kettle activated by a normal coffee cup, or a casino table that can distinguish between the cards and monitor a game of poker for cheating.Mr Quigley said: ldquoDesigners and developers can imagine looking at a kettle and saying, lsquoOh, therersquos a physical button there. But therersquos a unit that I have to actually put into the kettle to have a physical button, and I could replace all of that with a radar chiprsquo.ldquoYou could gesture at it, but you could also use an object.ldquoIf you put your cup near your kettle, and itrsquos your coffee cup, the kettle knows to boil the water in a particular way. Oryou put a dferent cup there, it knows you will have tea, so it could it boil it in a dferent way.ldquoYou could put these sensors into a casino, and then the entire casino experience could become digitised, Mr Quigley said.ldquoThe cards, the chips, the dice, the dominoes: whatever elements you have.The group has already been approached by companies that think radar sensors could monitor what shoppers buy as they travel around the store, eliminating the need for a checkout.ldquoWhile the possibilities of the new technology seem endless, the project began with just a small andcompetitive developer programme run by Google.The team at St Andrews were the only developers in the UK to gain access to the programme, and used their paper to explore the way that radar sensors can recognise physical objects in the home or workplace.In a video published by the team, they demonstrate a radar sensor counting playing cards, measuring the angle of a mobile phone and simulating a card game.On Tuesday, Google received approval from US regulators to put their Project Soli sensors into mobile phones.The Federal Communications Commission ruling said the radar chips ldquowill serve the public interest by providing for innovative device control features using touchless hand gesture technology and could help disabled users.Alongside the object-activated system developed by the St Andrews team,Google says that radar chips would allow users to press imaginary buttons or turn virtual dials to operate its devices, or operate screens by waving your hand, similar to the technology featured in the film Minority Report.For Mr Quigley and his team, use of radar might change the way we use our devices forever.ldquoWersquoll look back on today in  or  yearsrsquo time, and it will look quaint, he said.ldquoWersquore stuck on a plateau right now. If there is no keyboard then people just freak out. If thatrsquos the way you understand how to talk to a computer then of course thatrsquos how yoursquore going to talk to it.ldquoButyour cup can be all you need to interact with a computer in the morning then you donrsquot need a keyboard."},{"url":null,"title":"racism-against-teachers-in-scottish-schools-not-being-reported","story":"Ken Muir, chief executive of the body, has now called on headteachers, teachers and council officials to urgently improve reporting procedures.Earlier this year, a major report on the lack of teachers from black and ethnic minoritybackgrounds - called Teaching in a Diverse Scotland - highlighted shocking incidents of casual racism in schools.In one example a white teacher who was mentoring a talented ethnic minority teaching student complained to her university that she smelled of curry.In another case a teacher at a secondary school with pupils from Pakistan, India and Syria was overheard saying: \"I think I am coming into a refugee camp\".Recent figures show just two per cent of teachers are from BME backgrounds despite making up four per cent of the Scottish population. The figures are even lower for headteachers and deputy heads with . per cent of the total from BME backgrounds.Mr Muir said: \"In the past five years there has been one referral relating to racism and that didnrsquot even occur in a school. It involved the removal of a teacher from the register for racially abusing a nightclub bouncer on a Saturday night.\"The mismatch between what black and minority ethnic probationers and teachers say and the reporting of racist incidents to local authorities and the GTCS is all too apparent.\"Mr Muir said signicant under-reporting of racist incidents was caused by a number of factors - including the fear of dealing with a potentially legal matter and the wider impact of a lack of action when incidents were reported.And he said the Teaching in a Diverse Scotland report had uncovered unacceptable examples where black and minority ethnic students, probationers and teachers were being treated dferently.\"There were BME students who were made to feel unwelcome on placements, probationers who received little or no support which contrasted with that received by other white probationers and BME teachers who had left or planned to leave teaching because they had been unsuccessful too many times in gaining promotion, citing the colour of their skin as the only plausible reason,\" he added.A spokeswoman for the Educational Institute of Scotland teaching union backed the GTCS concerns about under-reporting.She said: \"Our recent survey of BME members found that nearly three-quarters had experienced racism in their capacity as a teacher or lecturer.\"Reduced access to workplace opportunities was also a strong theme and nearly half of respondents had experienced being overlooked for promotion while a quarter had been bullied or harassed at work on the grounds of race or religion.\"Urgent efforts are needed to challenge workplace racism and to develop, in all establishments, comprehensive anti-racist policies which translate into real actions.\"A key recommendation from the report, written by a working group chaired by Professor Rowena Arshad, Head of Education at Edinburgh University,is that the number of BME teachers in Scotlandrsquos schools should be at least four per cent by .Ms Arshad, co-director of the Centre for Education for Racial Equality in Scotland, said schools could no longer shy away from addressing \"racism, racial discrimination or harassment\".She said: \"The lack of ersity in the teaching workforce has been a persistent and long-term issue. This lack of ersity is becoming increasingly pressing and visible, as the pupil population in Scottish schools is getting more erse.\"Her report said: \"Despite the issues ... workplace racism was rarely recognised or raised by local authorities. Some respondents indicated they have never managed a race-focused complaint as part of their role and therefore lack the knowledge or experience of recognising race related matters.\"Given that we know issues exist, it is surprising and disappointing to note that in some cases employer awareness of issues appears to be very low.\"In , the GTCS struck off a teacher who shouted racist abuse at a black nightclub bouncer.

The David Bowie Alumni Tour: A Bowie Celebration will arrive in Glasgow on January th at the cityrsquos  Academy.Among them Mike Garson, Bowiersquos veteran pianist, lead-guitarist Earl Slick who delivered ldquofat licks on the likes Golden Years, and Mark Plati another long-serving producer and multi-instrumentalist who began working with Bowie in the mid s.Garson, who was originally hired for only eight weeks in , brought his definitive avant-garde flourishes to Aladdin Sane the following year. ldquoI have great memories of people flying off the balcony at Greenrsquos Playhouse in January . Glasgow was always a wild place to play where the fans had a deep love of the music so wersquore looking forward to playing there.\"With Glastonbury  coming out wersquove been looking at that set. It was a triumphant evening and of the thousands of shows I did with David that would be in the top three along with the Hammersmith Odeon in  and Isle of Wight Festival . The band sounded amazing that night, we looked out at the audience of , and walking onstage David turns and asks me to warm them up with Greensleeves.\"I almost had a heart-attack when he started with Wild Is The Wind ndash it showed he was unafraid to try anything he wanted that night, he sang and played everything so well. When I heard it was coming out while I was touring with these musicians I was very excited.The new century saw Bowie shake-off the experimental zeal of the mid s while embracing hits from his back catalogue. Mark Plati points to the signicance of Earl Slick ing to the fold after a -year hiatus. ldquoSlick was perfect musically, personally and everything . He fitted in like he had just stopped playing the week before, we plugged him in and he was there.\"For the set we played a lot of the material that Slick was involved with, we brought in Station to Station, Stay, Golden Years and Wild Is The Wind and he was the perfect call for those songs. I would stand in the middle of this triangle between David Bowie, Earl Slick and Mike Garson ndash little old me who grew up listening to these guys and the three of them are looking at me to start the song. I would have to kick myself and say lsquoshut up and do your jobrsquo. That was incredible on every level because everyone involved was in such a good place, it was a wonderful period and one of the great performances of Davidrsquos later career.Face to face after a sweaty performance at Liverpoolrsquos Cavern Club, Earl Slick is every inch the rock guitar hero with raven-black spiky hair, tattoos and long scarves. Behind sunglasses while smoking a cigarette in a long black winterrsquos coat the New Yorker recalls his first encounter with Bowie. ldquoAn audition was arranged at RCA studios, they set up in the main room and asked me to play while they mixed Diamond Dogs. Then there was dead silence which made me think this might not be good.\"David then walked in and sat down, we had a drink, a snort [of cocaine] and started noodling a couple of guitars. They said theyrsquod let me know in a couple of weeks. I had a call the next day to meet David at his hotel and that was it.Slick would play a vital role on Bowiersquos  album Station to Station, where a ldquosnort and a drink were constant during the sessions while recording at Hollywoodrsquos lauded Cherokee Studios. The black soul of previous long-player Young Americanswas fused with experimental Krautrock and the repetitive, robotic rhythms developed by Germanyrsquos electronic music pioneers. Bowiersquos Thin White Duke personae, a cold, baleful European figure informed by the occult, Jewish mysticism and a fascination with the Third Reich was as potent a creation as Ziggy Stardust. Describing the album as ldquoa wayward spiritual search Bowie also drew on The Stations of the Cross and the lost, alcoholic alien he played in Nicolas Roegrsquos The Man Who Fell To Earth.ldquoDavid absorbed a lot of everything, he was interested in history and social issues and it all went in, says Slick. ldquoStation to Station came up out of nowhere, I had a call from him out the blue in LA and we began recording in a small rehearsal space for two days at the studio to touch on the vibe for the record which was not complete by any means.\"A lot of the lyrics were unfinished and the title trackwas three dferent parts of dferent songs that we glued together. The wail of feedback on the guitar was a spur of the moment thing at am in the morning, we were up all night recording as usual. Thatrsquos both of us with a wall of Marshall stacks itrsquos not just me.Bowie worked closely with the guitarist relying on him to conjure essential rfs, textures and licks for the likes of Golden Years. ldquoI have to say thank you to Eric [Clapton] for that one he admits. ldquoIt came from Creamrsquos Outside Woman Blues and there was a little of Funky Broadway by Wilson Pickett. David would say lsquowhatve you got rsquo Irsquod be like lsquogive me a minutersquo and come up with something on the spot that happened on Stay, it was built around the lick of John, Irsquom Only Dancing Again the chords and chorus are the same. On Diamond Dogs the majority of the guitar work is David, that wasnrsquot unusual because he could play a few instruments well enough to come up with what was required. He came up with the rf on Rebel Rebel,he couldnt play something well enough or to his liking Mick , myself or whoever would do it.Bowie toured Station To Station with replacement guitarist Stacy Heydon, who would later describe Slickrsquos work on the record as ldquoextraordinary.Slick finally took Station To Station on the road for an acclaimed th anniversary tour in  with Rolling Stones backing vocalist Bernard Fowler who will also join also him in Glasgow to perform cuts from the album.ldquoThat tour was put together with Davidrsquos blessing, he endorsed it adds Slick. ldquoOnce I got to the point of preparing for the tour I let him know Bernard was singing because the last thing I wanted was a Bowie clone, I knew I had the right guy.Garson suggests that he and Slick, who first performed together with Bowie in June , will also revisit the Diamond Dogs Tour that worked to cement Bowiersquos legend in America.ldquoWersquore looking at Sweet Thing Candidate which hasnrsquot been played live since that tour and other things from the period, wersquoll rehearse We Are The Dead from Diamond Dogs. Lady Grinning Soul was a song we never did live which we played on the Aladdin Sane tour last year, the reaction was thrilling, I was always waiting to do that one, I think it was one of Davidrsquos greatest.\"Of course wersquoll be doing more familiar songs like Le On Mars which I played maybe  times over the years and every time was dferent, I put my own stamp on it but stuck to the original vibe that Rick Wakeman brought to the track. The first time was on Davidrsquos first major American tour as Ziggyin September  and the last was in  at a benefit concert.

These additional benefits are at the core of why we regard it as important in the curriculum and why it has been so regarded for years.\"Under the Baby Strings project, pupils in the first year of primary prepare for using instruments in P through songs and games which help develop rhythm, pitch, rhyme and motor skills.In   all P pupils were given either violins, violas and cellos.

Not vote. Let the Tories squirm. Not our problem, mate.Its not Jeremys fault that the PM came back from Brussels with a broken-backed deal that is, in Corbyns words, ldquothe worst of all worlds. If hed been allowed to do the dealing: why, hersquod surely have come back with a joyous, jobs first Brexit. The Corbynator wouldve tough-talked Brussels into agreeing a bespoke customs union, plus privileged access to the European Single Market without any obligation to accept freedom of movement or state aid rules. Job done. If only the Tories would call that election so Jeremy could make it happen!Except of course therell be no General Election, and eventhere was, Jeremy Corbyn has about as much chance of finding a better deal in Brussels as the police have in finding drones over Gatwick, or Chris Grayling a channel ferry operator that actually has ferries. Of course, no-one is allowed to say this in the presence of the Dear Leader. So Labour ministers and MPs bite their ragged lips and perpetuate the most cynical political hood since Donald Trump promised to make Mexico pay for the border wall.And given their supine behaviour thus far, it is probable that many Labour MPs would allow themselves to be whipped into abstaining on the only meaningful vote on Brexit. After all, they abstained last year on the motion to allow parliament to consider the EEA ldquoNorway option, even though thats the one alternative to Mays deal that Brussels might accept. Their latest abstention may not be on the first outing of the ldquomeaningfulvote, scheduled for next week. May is expected to lose that , and to bring her final, final, amended deal back to the Commons, probably in February, hoping that MPs will fall into line as the Article  clock runs out. Thats when Labour will decide the fate of the nation.And lets be absolutely clear: abstaining on Brexit, the most important issue facing the UK since the Second World War, would not just be an abdication of opposition ndash it would be a betrayal, a craven capitulation, for which Labour would never be forgiven. Abstention would mean handing the future of the UK to the hardline Brexiteers who have been holding May and country to ransom for the last two years, despite representing a small minority in parliament. At the very least, Corbyn would be conniving in saving Theresa Mays discredited Withdrawal Deal, thus condemning the UK to a ldquobotched Brexit, which he described in November as ldquoan act of national self-harm.The press would have a field day with headlines about ldquoLabours Meaning-less Vote over pictures of a bewildered-looking Corbyn in Parliament as Theresa May berates him for having no policy on Brexit after two-and-a-half years of attacking the Governments. ldquoWhat is Labour for , commentators would ask, questioning Corbyns reason, leadership and his fitness to govern. But that would be nothing compared to the comments in Labour itself.Abstention would risk splitting the party. The vast majority of Labour members oppose Brexit and want a referendum. This is an issue, uniquely, which unites the young left activists of Momentum with the old right Blairites of what used to be called New Labour. There would be mass resignations, with young members burning their party cards. Rebel Labour MPs, like Chuka Umunna, would likely join with SNP, Liberal Democrats and Tory remainers, creating a new political coalition. The party could be split for years, decades even ndash like Ramsay MacDonaldrsquos Labour after .So, why is Corbyn even contemplating this ruinous route  The answer is partly his own ingrained euroscepticism. He says he voted Remain in , but ever since the s he has opposed the free market economics that underpin the  Treaty of Rome that founded the EEC. Corbyn thinks the rules of the single market could make British socialism impossible. ldquoI dont want to be told by someone , hes said, ldquothat we cant use state aid to develop industry in this country. This is disputed by Labour supporters of the EU, but it is not in doubt that Brussels generally regards Government subsidies as anti-competitive.The other reason is electoral. Most of Labourrsquos General Election target seats are pro-leave constituencies. So, while the opinion polls may indicate that a majority of voters would now vote Remain, Labour could still lose the next General Electionits seen to block Brexit. Again, this electoral calculation is disputed. But clearly Corbyn is trying to keep his pro-European party on side while not alienating anti-European voters. Riding two horses is notoriously dficult owing to the tendency to fall off both of them.But perhaps the main reason Corbyn might be tempted by abstention is the old political adage, attributed to Napoleon: ldquoNever interrupt your enemy while he is making a mistake. Brexit will be a disaster for the Tories from day one, and then get steadily worse. So, why get in her way  Let Theresa May or her successor, implement her useless Withdrawal Deal, leave the EU as planned, and then allow Labour to benefit from the public backlash. Corbyn will have his general election without ever having to have a coherent policy on Brexit, which by then will anyway be a done deal.This is a superficially attractive strategy but ultimately ruinous for Labour. First of all, this is not a battle, but a war. You DO interrupt your enemyheis about to run all over you. By abstaining, and effectively allowing Mayrsquos deal to go ahead, Labour will be fatally implicated in the subsequent disaster. The public wont forgive Corbyn for failing to seize the only opportunity to prevent Brexit. Its unlikely he would survive the backlash that will afflict our entire political class .Remain supporters in Labour hope that reason will prevail and that Corbyn will not succumb to abstentionism. That he will ldquopivot to a Peoples Vote after May loses the meaningful vote next week. But I dont think this is going to happen by itself ndash he is too wedded to keeping his head down. Anyway, Corbyns instincts are clear from his candid remarks over Christmas that, even after a General Election, he would still carry Brexit through.However, the Labour leader is supposed to believe in party democracy ndash hes been arguing for it from the backbenches for most of his career. It is now time for Labours unsilent majority to take control. Either through a special conference, demonstrations or petitions, they must show Corbyn that they will not accept Labour voting for Brexit by pretending to vote for nothing at all. The meaningful vote must mean something."},{"url":null,"title":"last-waltz-for-music-tuition-in-scottish-schools","story":"THE performance of the day came from Linlithgow Academy pupil Alice Ferguson, although it was her vocal chords rather than her trumpet that sounded the last post for equality of access to school music tuition.Appearing before the Scottish Parliaments education committee to talk about the impact of rising charges for tuition, Alice said some of her friends had given up playing because they could no longer afford the higher fees introduced by West Lothian Council.\"It is the privileged that are getting to do music now which is going back to Victorian times where only the elite get to do music,\" she said.\"A lot of my friends have now dropped out of music because they cannot afford it. Why should somebody be denied the opportunity to play an instrument because they cannot afford it \"Alice, a member of the Scottish Youth Parliament for Linlithgow, is in good company. Earlier this year, Scottish violinist Nicola Benedetti hit out over rises in tuition fees across the UK, signing a joint letter with other musicians calling for all primary pupils to be taught an instrument at no cost.Mick Cooke, a former member of the indie band Belle  Sebastian, also spoke out saying he and other musicians such as KT Tunstall, Ricky Ross and Eddi Reader had all benefitted from free lessons.The impact of the rising charges in West Lothian has been signicant. Since officials introduced fees of pound, more than , pupils have dropped out. David Dodds, executive councillor for education in West Lothian, admitted reductions are more pronounced in poorer areas.Other councils that have either raised charges or introduced them for the first time have also flagged the disproportionate impact on poorer families.Worryingly, Fe Council said more than  pupils from poorer families who were entitled to free tuition under a concessionary scheme had discontinued simply because of the climate of uncertainty the introduction of higher fees had created.The issue of access to music tuition is one that will resonate with families across Scotland, regardless of their financial background.More than a third of Scotlandrsquos  councils either increased charges or introduced them for the first time in the   school year. Currently  local authorities charge for instrumental music tuition, with fees for group lessons ranging from pound to pound.In order to offset hardship for poorer families, councils have introduced concessionary schemes, but the evidence suggests these do not always have the desired impact. Families who just miss the threshold can be particularly disadvantaged.Figures published before the impact of the latest increases showed the number of pupils accessing instrumental music tuition across Scotland fell from , in   to , in  .It is not just increasing charges which are causing concern, with a fall in the number of music instructors over the past few years, particularly those working full-time. The Educational Institute of Scotlandteaching union said there are currently just  dedicated tutors serving primary and secondary schools compared to , in .The perfect storm of declining music tutors and rising charges means providing instrumental music lessons to all interested pupils is proving impossible.The Improvement Service, a support organisation for local government, found only five councils currently able to provide provision for all interested pupils, with the rest operating unpopular selection processes and waiting lists.A recent survey by parent body Connect highlighted the trend with one family responding: \"The current system of testing for aptitude in P without warning favours young people whose parents have already invested in music lessons. Anecdotally, those in my sonrsquos year who have passed the test are all already receiving private music tuition.\"Experts believe the long term impact of the squeeze will create a situation where only the wealthy will be able to develop their talents to play at the highest level. Andrew Dickie from the Scottish Association for Music Education has warned membership of the National Youth Orchestra of Scotland is already \"almost exclusively\" from private schools.Tudor Morris, director of the Edinburgh Music School, said: ldquoTalent is not handed out by postcode. The cultural history of Scotland has been permanently enriched by the creative genius of iniduals from less advantaged backgrounds.\"Morris argues another consequence of charging is that certain instruments, such as the double bass, bassoon, oboe, French horn and viola, will become \"rare or even extinct as pupils choose cheaper instruments or ones more commonly taught in school such as acoustic guitar.Kenny Christie, chairman of the Heads of Instrumental Teaching Scotland, said the situation was the worst he had ever seen. \"As the network comes into its st year it would be fair to say that never before has the concern and fear for the future of instrumental music education been so profound.\"Campaigners estimate it would cost about pound million per year to ensure all children have a right to instrumental lessons, but say the benefits make the investment worthwhile economically and educationallyThe Such benefits are well-researched. Susan Hallam from the Institute of Education at University College London identied wider improvements benefits in language and literacy skills, numeracy, intellectual development, general attainment, creativity and personal and social development.In a letter to the education committee last year, the Music Education Partnership Group said: \"The practice of music develops transferable skills such as team working, resilience, discipline, performing, problem-solving, evaluating, abstract thinking, physical and fine motor coordination.\"So why is it happening  The root of the problem is the fact instrumental music is a discretionary service provided by local authorities that is separate to the core music curriculum taught within the classroom.With council budgets increasingly coming under pressure in the era of austerity, cuts to services which are not a statutory responsibility naturally come under scrutiny.The extent of the financial dficulties in West Lothian which led to the increase in fees were explained to Holyroods Education Committee by Dodds, who said an original budget of pound, had been almost halved to pound,. \"Instrumental music tuition, like many other areas, faces huge problems due to the underfunding of local government,\" he said.Willie Wilson, from Perth and Kinross, said the council had introduced charges many years ago, but after a six-year freeze introduced a % increase last year.\"We thought long and hard before we put the charges up. We were faced with the traditional rock and a hard place. Either to diminish the service in some way or to maintain the service and increase the charges,\" he said.So what are the alternatives  One of the recommendations of the Scottish Government-backed Instrumental Music Group from  was that, in a challenging financial climate, councils should consider economies of scale such as collaborating with community groups, other local authorities and national music bodies in the provision of tuition and the purchase, repair and sharing of instruments.There have also been calls for government funding to be ringfenced - or to have grant conditions attached to it - to ensure local authorities spend it on what was intended.Others have suggested a national service removed from council control. A spokesman for the independent St Marys Music School in Edinburgh, said: \"It is simply unacceptable for children to be excluded from the study of music on grounds of cost due to a postcode lottery. It never has been sensible, reasonable or pragmatic to entrust music education to local authorities who have other funding allocations to consider.\"Other attempts to preserve tuition include Highland Councilrsquos transferral of the service from its education department to a charitable armrsquosorganisation, High Le Highland, which has resulted in an increase in participation.The Western Isles has been able to provide instrumental music tuition for all interested pupils partly because of its innovative use of technology, with e-lessons provided through a school video conferencing system.In order to kickstart an interest in music, the Scottish Government currently funds the Youth Music Initiativewhich provides pound.m of funding to local authorities so every pupil in Scotland is offered a year of free music tuition by the time they leave primary school.The   YMI annual plan states it had reached an estimated , young people in  , but there are concerns the project will create an interest in music that cannot be fully explored, due to the cost of continuing tuition.Kirk Richardson, convener of the Instrumental Music Teachersrsquo Network, run by the EIS, said the initiative gave little more than a ldquobrief taster.\"This initiative is no substitute for properly resourced local authority music services. If a child shows interest and ability, there must be an appropriately resourced instrumental music service to enable the pupil to continue developing their talent,\" he said.Whatever solutions may help save the service, there is an underlying concern about a \"disparity of esteem\" between classroom music teaching and instrumental teaching.As part of its inquiry into rising costs, education committee MSPs held focus groups with students from the Royal Conservatoire which highlighted the worrying trend. Examples included a tutor being asked to hold group string sessions in a school bathroom.A report on the focus group said: \"Students generally felt instrumental tutors are being provided with less quality time to spend with pupils. It was suggested that a lack of pupils in inidual schools resulted in tutors being asked to travel between schools in a local authority in a single day on a very tight timetable, which led to both tutors and pupils feeling rushed.\"It was reported that this change to working patterns has also led to tutors feeling less embedded in particular schools, and therefore feeling less like part of the department.\"Students called for music tuition to be viewed in partnership with classroom teaching because it was \"unrealistic\" to expect teachers alone to get students to the level required to achieve qualications.\"Without tuition the classroom teacher would need to be able to play all of the instruments played by the class they were teaching,\" the report said.Alastair Orr, a brass instrumental teacher in the Stirling area, called for the work of instrumental and vocal teachers in Scotlands schools to be recognised as fundamental, not only to music education, but more widely to the cultural and creative character of the country.\"The time has long passed for instrumental and vocal tuition to be regarded as some form of casual add-on to the daily timetable. There is a clear argument, highlighted by pupils, parents and others, for instrumental tuition to enjoy parity of esteem with every other subject being taught in schools,\" he said."},{"url":null,"title":"scottish-tory-stephen-kerr-xenophobic-colleagues-have-more-in-common-with-the-snp-than-unionism","story":"Stephen Kerr, who will be voting for the Prime Ministerrsquos deal to leave the EU, said party hardliners displayed the same sort of ldquoromanticised and ldquosometimes xenophobic attitudes as some Scottish nationalists.He also said that Scottish and English nationalists suffered from ldquoarrogance and a ldquodetachment from reality.An SNP spokesperson said: ldquoThe two futures facing the people of Scotland could not be more dferent ndash a Tory Westminster government which is determined to cut the UK off from the world ndash or the positive, outward-looking Scotland which the SNP is proud to endorse, and which Scotlandrsquos economy badly needs.\"It is for Stephen Kerr to explain why he continues to endorse the former over the latter.Theresa Mayrsquos plan to take the UK out of the European Union is facing defeat this month after a backlash by Tory MPs showed no sign of abating.Her right-wing colleagues, who failed to topple her as Prime Minister last month, loathe the draft agreement she struck with EU negotiators and are relaxed about a no-deal departure.Although her plan is expected to be defeated heavily, May has received strong, but not unanimous, support from her contingent of Scottish Tory MPs.Kerr, who was elected to serve the Stirling constituency in , voted for Brexit but has said he backs Mayrsquos draft agreement.Speaking to The Herald on Sunday, he is also firmly against a no-deal exit and believes crashing out could ldquopour petrol on the embers of nationalism in Scotland.He also had strong words for MP colleagues who he believes are motivated by nationalism:ldquoMy concern about the attitude of some of my English Conservative colleagues is that they have more in common with the SNP, and their attitudes, than sometimes I think they have with conservatism and unionism.ldquoThey have a very similar, black and white, sometimes romanticised, sometimes xenophobic attitude towards other people.He continued: ldquoScottish nationalism, like all nationalism, is not positive in my eyes.

who lives in Thurso, has been awarded the British Empire Medal in the New Years Honours List in recognition of his services to the community in Caithness. He will be  next month but still visits schools and other groups to give slideshow presentations about his war experiences. Here we reproduce an interview with Don which was published in the Groat in June  to mark the th anniversary of the D-Day landings. Don flew to Normandy twice on D-Day, first dropping paratroops and then a glider with more troops and equipment.*WHEN the grey dawn broke over Normandy on June , , Don Mason had already made the first of his two contributions to the momentous events of D-Day. The young airman was part of the six-man crew of a modied Stirling bomber that had dropped  paratroops and their equipment at Ranville under cover of darkness. Heading for home, the Stirling came under fire from anti-aircraft guns on the French coast but ed unscathed to its base at Fairford in Gloucestershire. In the early evening the same crew were back over Normandy, this time towing a glider with more troops destined for the original dropping zone ndash and by this stage, almost  hours after the start of the Allies seaborne invasion, the full enormity of Operation Overlord was clear to see. \"It looked like a scene out of a nightmare,\" Don now recalls.Don had been fascinated with aeroplanes since his childhood in Worcestershire. As a young boy he once walked four miles with his family to see a travelling circus which featured a plane of Great War vintage Don could only gaze in wonderment as the flying machine entertained the crowds, and he resolved that one day he would fly an aircraft of his own. It was an ambition that would be fulfilled with the onset of World War Two.Although just  at the time of D-Day, Don had already clocked up numerous operations as a bomber pilot. He had been severely injured in a fighter attack over Germany in  and was declared medically unfit. After being reinstated on appeal, he was retrained as a radio observer.\"We had been in No.  Group Bomber Command,\" says Don, who moved to Thurso in the s but whose Caithness connection goes back to  when he flew Blenheims out of Wick. \"The whole squadron were suddenly lted out of Bomber Command and put into  Group, airborne support, which was a completely new role because wed never worked with paratroops or the like before.\"He was now in  Squadron, flying a modied version of the Stirling four-engined heavy bomber: the Mk IV troop-carrier and glider tug. \"We had to do a lot of exercises to get used to that aeroplane and to get used to dropping troops and towing gliders, which obviously was a dferent ball game altogether... it required a lot of dferent techniques.\"And it was necessary with any airborne group to drop them accurately in as tight a bunch as possible ndash therefore youd got to operate at a low height and also not get them scattered, so timing was important.\"There developed a formation flying technique which was called starboard echelon, so youve got two lines of aircraft flying parallel to one another. We had to practise these on group exercises, and a number of things happened: tow ropes broke, gliders went down in dferent places.\"On one group exercise we were flying along in this starboard echelon formation and there were literally hundreds of us ndash it wasnt just my squadron, it was a number of dferent squadrons ndash and suddenly an aircraft in the port line veered straight across into an aircraft in the starboard line and they both went down in flames. We lost two aircraft and two crews, just like that, on an exercise. Those are the things that stick in the mind.\"That tragic accident occurred on May , , in one of the last group exercises before D-Day. It was becoming clear that a big operation was imminent, one that would have major repercussions for the course of the war.\"Obviously we knew something was happening,\" Don says, \"because we were practising with troops and gliders and whatever. But we werent aware, of course, until the th of June when we were briefed originally.\"The invasion was scheduled initially for June  but was postponed for  hours because of the weather. \"Before that we had the indications of the airfield being closed off and we werent allowed to leave ndash we were shut in, the mail was censored.\"Paratroops of the th Airborne Division had been arriving at Fairford from the middle of May, and glider pilots were gathering there too as the security arrangements became ever tighter. The troops camped out on the airfield and Don remembers: \"One thing that struck me was that most of them were not very big men but the amount of equipment they carried was phenomenal, with kitbags full of gear strapped to their legs. The other thing that struck me as quite remarkable was they were all carrying water bottles full of white rum!\"Stirling LJ  took off from Fairford at . hours on June  in what was code-named Operation Tonga, with Don as wireless operator air gunner. On board were  fully equipped paratroops and the BBC correspondent Guy Byam.Dons chief recollection of that night flight over the English Channel is the sight of vast numbers of landing craft and other vessels in the assembly area ndash which was known as \"Piccadilly Circus\" ndash as they awaited the signal to head for the beaches.\"We were briefed to drop precisely at a time and place,\" he explains. \"It was important to get the troops on the ground in a bunch, not scattered. We were only over mid-Channel so we did an orbit ndash that was a bit dicey with so many aircraft about, all flying in one direction, and us crossing the stream. It all went to build up the tension.\"Finally, at . hours, the troops were released at Ranville, where they were to set up a homing beacon to aid following aircraft and also to assist in holding bridges over the nearby river Orne after the seaborne invasion had begun. Don remembers the red light in the fuselage turning to green on reaching the dropping zone. \"They all had to go together. Naturally some hesitated on the lip of the door ndash but they had all got to go.\"In the lead-up to the drop, there had been a close encounter between the Stirling and a group of paratroops released by a nearby Dakota. \"He released his troops and they came past us and we flew right through and didnt touch one,\" says Don.\"There was no flak at all over Normandy but then we had to fly in a northerly direction towards the Pas de Calais after dropping our troops, which was a feint because the Germans expected us to attack the Pas de Calais rather than anywhere . So we flew on a northerly track and we experienced flak around Le Havre and Dieppe, and then when we exited France towards Beachy Head we got some light flak on the coast, but there wasnt a great deal of resistance.\"It was a dferent matter altogether when Don and his crew-mates embarked on their second operation of D-Day, code-named Mallard.This time their Stirling had a Horsa glider in tow, containing more troops bound for the Ranville area along with an armoured jeep, four anti-tank guns and ammunition. Take-off time was . hours and the glider was to be released at ..Don remembers the scene vividly: \"The Channel was still littered with shipping but when we approached the Normandy coast it was a chaotic mass of ships and landing craft and smoke and explosions. It looked like a scene out of a nightmare, really. And, of course, as we went over land and approached the landing zone there was a lot more activity and a lot more flak.\"You couldnt tow a glider above  knots so it was fairly slow. You were low because you didnt want the glider to be shot down before it could get down to land. So obviously a big aircraft like the Stirling, with a ft wingspan or thereabouts, and a Horsa glider behind it, was a good target. In fact, all  of our aircraft were hit by anti-aircraft fire.\"Indeed one of those planes was shot down and crash-landed into the beachhead. The airmen were uninjured and got away for a while before being picked up by a German patrol.Subsequently the German position where they were held prisoner was captured and the crew ed to base.Reflecting on the chaos and confusion of D-Day, does Don recall feeling scared by what was happening around him  \"Well, everybodys scared ndash I dont care what anyone says,\" he replies. \"If youre not scared you dont perform, but its discipline and training that takes you through. You do reach a point of no .\"This is rude, I know, but its what I call s**t or bust. You go on and do it. Its a matter of accepting whats going on and just dealing with it, and doing the job youre supposed to do.\"Its not a question of bravery. Im very suspicious when people say, Oh, youre a brave man, or Youve got a lot of courage. You react to circumstances. Its a question of training and discipline and doing your job, without really recognising the probability of being killed.\"And I think to some extent the unorm protects you ndash you feel less vulnerable when youve got a unorm on and youre acting in that capacity. Everything happens very quickly.\"So Im very suspicious about bravery. I think we react more instinctively based on our training and our own iniduality. I dont think I could have coped with being an infantryman, for instance. I dont know how those chaps did it, because it must have been hell on earth for them.\"Don can look back on hundreds of hours of operational flying in a distinguished RAF career that included missions for the Special Operations Executive. And yet, despite the passage of years, he has never forgotten the thrill of his first tantalising taste of aviation.\"I fell in love with aeroplanes when I was a kid when Alan Cobhams Flying Circus came to visit our town with an old World War One aeroplane, and it was fascinating,\" Don says. \"He had a couple of old SEs [fighter aircraft] and you could have a flip round the field for  shillings ndash but of course  shillings was half a mans wage, so we just stood there with our mouths open.\"But the smell of hot engine oil, castor oil and fumes and what-not got into you. I was determined to try to get into it in some way, and of course thats what I did.\"He grew up in Kingswinford, Worcestershire, where his father ran a transport yard. Don trained as a motor mechanic after leaving school at the age of  and went on to qualy as a motor vehicle technician in the summer of . He was called up when war broke out in September of that year, having joined the volunteer reserve two years previously.After pilot training he enjoyed rapid promotion in Bomber Command and was an acting squadron leader when, ing from a mission near Hanover in May , his aircraft was attacked from below by an unseen German fighter plane. The bomb aimer, navigator, flight engineer and wireless operator were all killed but Don survived along with his mid-upper and rear gunner. Somehow he managed tohis crippled Stirling to an emergency landing field on the east coast of England despite suffering severe spinal injuries, damage to his left eye, lacerations around his head and a hole in his knee. He still bears the scars.Don spent eight months in hospital and was discharged as medically unfit. However, he refused to accept that his flying career was over and lodged an objection with the air ministry. Eventually his appeal was successful and he was reinstated, being retrained in the new discipline of radio observer.Operations in the aftermath of D-Day included Market Garden in September  ndash \"I went to Arnhem five times during that debacle,\" says Don ndash and he continued in Stirlings until .He and his first we Lillian were married in  and they had three children: daughter Elaine, now living in Ashby-de-la-Zouch, and sons Peter and Robert, who are both ex-Navy. Peter is in Denmark while Robert has a management post at Dounreay.Don ed to the motor trade after the war and became general service manager with a large garage group. He then spent more than  years working in further education, including a spell as head of the engineering department at a college of technology in Salisbury.Lillian died in  after many years of ill-health and in  Don moved to Thurso, coming out of retirement to work for eight years with local firm Ashley Ann. In  he was married for a second time, to Lybster-born Isabel, whose three daughters became part of the family. Isabel died in .Don still keeps in touch with three of his former crew-mates from those D-Day operations: Jim Wayman, the rear gunner, who lives in Dorset Eric Winter, flight engineer, in Coventry and Sid Harrison, the mid-upper gunner, who lives in Crewe. However, there was a particularly close and enduring bond between Don and his pilot, New Zealander Frank Cox.\"Although our families were half a world apart, they sort of grew up together ndash he came over [to this country] and I went to New Zealand,\" says Don. \"In  his daughter rang me from New Zealand and said Frank was dying of bowel cancer ndash he knew he was terminally ill and he hadnt got long to live. They had asked himthere was anything he really wanted, and hed said, Id love to see my old mate again. So I went to New Zealand and I was with him when he died.\"Now you cant explain relationships like that ndash they exist because of the worth of each one of you to the other in action. Its what they call camaraderie. Im still in touch with his family.\"As his thoughtsto the events of  on the Normandy beaches, Don agrees that D-Day was a turning point ndash \"theres no doubt about that\". But he adds: \"I regret to say I dont think weve learned any lessons. I dont think we should be doing what were doing now [in Iraq].\"As I look back I think first of all how lucky I was and I feel very sad about the people who gave their lives in that struggle. Its not really appreciated, the sacrices that were made both on the home front and in action. Its a sad reflection on society, I feel.\"We ought to be very thankful that were free, because thats what it was about. We should remember that this country wouldnt be freeit had been overrun by Nazi Germany.\"It was all for a cause. People may say, Oh, thats patriotic nonsense. But it isnt.\"* This is a slightly edited version of an interview first published in the John OGroat Journal of June , .Sunday  Jan  : PM"},{"url":null,"title":"More festive frustration for Wick Academy as Formartine snatch victory in stoppage time","story":"Wick Academy  Formartine United Formartine United took advantage of a late red card to Danny Mackay to hit an injury-time winner and consign Academy to a second defeat over the festive period.The Scorries struggled to create any clear chances but defended resolutely and the game appeared to be drting towards a goalless draw before Graeme Rodgerrsquos late strike.Manager Tom McKenna made two enforced changes to his side, with Ross Allan and Andrew Hardwick replaced by Gordon MacNab and Craig Gunn. Sixteen-year old Mark Macadie, brother of Richard, made his first appearance on the bench.Academy started positively and Marc Macgregor twice tested Formartine keeper Kevin Main within the opening  minutes ndash first when he scuffed a shot straight at Main after being set up by a driving run down the right from Davie Allan, and then seeing an edge-of-the-box effort comfortably held.With Wick sitting deep in clear defensive blocks of four and five, the visitors took control after that and passed up several decent opportunities to take the lead.Archie Macphee found himself with a clear look at goal a quarter of an hour in but he somehow poked wide of Sean McCarthyrsquos left-hand post, and Rodger followed that moments later by guiding a shot wide of the same spot.After coming through that tough -minute spell, it was Academy who threatened next when, after a great spin in midfield by Grant MacNab, the ball came through for Macgregor whose shot was blocked by Main.The biggest cheer of the half came when Formartine assistant manager Russell Anderson, unhappy with what he felt was a series of unfair decisions against his team, was given a strict talking to by lineswoman Molly Alexander.Academy made a tactical switch with Craig Gunn and Davie Allan swapping wings and Gordon MacNab moving upfield to partner Macgregor up top. The move failed to pay idends as Wick couldnrsquot trouble the away defence throughout the half, Davie Allan coming closest to goal when he skewed his shot wide after a one-two with Macgregor.Formartine similarly struggled to break down a well-drilled home defence, but they smelled blood when Mackay was given a second yellow card in the last minute after a collision with substitute Scott Ferries.It was another Formartine sub who played a key role in the winner when Liam Burnett skipped past Craig Gunn to the by-line and cut back for the unmarked Rodger, who had the simple task of tapping it home.Wick Academy: McCarthy, M Steven, Farquhar, D Mackay, Manson, Henry, Gunn, Macgregor , D Allan, Gordon MacNab , Grant MacNab .

More information is given on the Scottish Government#s website, here.Publishing the payment schedule, rural economy secretary Fergus Ewing said: “As we approach the commencement of the New Year, I want to provide farmers, crofters and other rural businesses with as much clarity and certainty as possible.“I am therefore confirming that we intend to keep to the proposed CAP payment timetable published in our stabilisation plan, which outlines when farmers and crofters can expect to receive their CAP entitlements.“By doing this, we are offering clarity and certainty over when payments will be made, demonstrating stability in our payment system, while enabling farmers and crofters the opportunity to plan ahead accordingly.”The president of the Scottish farmers union, NFU Scotland, Andrew McCornick said the timetable will be valued by farmers and crofters, particularly following a tough year for agriculture in Scotland.Mr McCornick: “Confirmation that balance payments for Pillar  schemes will start in March, and payments for coupled support and LFASS starting a month later, will allow many businesses to now plan their cash flows on that basis.#Many farmers are extremely reliant on these scheme payments and their timing so the payment calendar will allow farmers and crofters to carefully plan for the year ahead. Any delay in the timetable with an important scheme like LFASS, would merit Scottish Government considering another loan scheme as a contingency, as it has previously.“Successive loan schemes have been invaluable in addressing cash flow concerns but the continued need for loan schemes demonstrates that confidence in the SGRPID system to deliver prompt payments in the future is still an issue. The move from loan schemes to direct payments and other schemes meeting set payment deadlines will build trust within the sector in the post-Brexit era and aid the organisation and planning of farm businesses in uncertain times.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

They’re all numbers, my lot. I’m a complete anomaly. I’m a words person.”Shakespeare, poetry, Ted Talks, and over the phone too she’s a wizard wordsmith, but ask her about insider trading, stocks and shares and hedge funds and she’s stymied. No matter because what she CAN do is act, and it all adds up in her latest role in ITV’s Cleaning Up, in which she stars opposite Sheridan Smith as a pair of down-on-their-luck cleaners who find an ingenious,illegal, way of playing the system. The result is a darkly amusing tale of have-nots at the bottom of the social pile fighting back, using the same methods as the have-it-alls they clean up after in Canary Wharf, a tale about modern Britain with zero hours contracts and with strong female leads. Cleaning Up, written by newcomer Mark Marlow, and directed by Lewis Arnold Humans, Broadchurch, Misfits, Banana centres on the friendship between Anouka’s character Jess and Sam, played by Sheridan Smith. The actors hit it off at the audition, lending an ease and authenticity to their performances.“Sam and Jess have grown up together and Jess is the voice of reason, someone who thinks before she does, which Sam doesn’t, so they’re a good match. Jess tries to keep her out of trouble.”It’s not easy to stay out of trouble when you’re hard up and the pair are tempted to take a gamble, much like the financiers in the shiny offices the invisible army cleans overnight. “It’s about who deserves to get away with stuff,” says Anouka. “Being the underdog you feel you’ve got to look out for yourself andyou’re living hand to mouth, one mistake has massive repercussions. Seeing people get away with it, you’d feel like, ‘why shouldn’t I ’” “It puts the spotlight on the everyday people, the ones working hard to pay their bills, not living the high le, which is most of the country. It’s good to see people like that fighting back.”“I think a lot of people will just love Cleaning Up. When I watched it I was thinking about all the people I know and thinking ‘my dad will love this’ and that it really is one of those shows you will sit down and watch with your family, it’s brilliant.”Anouka is no stranger to cleaning up from when she worked in pubs and cafes to supplement her acting income, starting out. Last year was the first she’s made a living through acting alone.“When I was starting out there were times when I had three jobs. If I wasn’t auditioning or learning lines I was always working. I would wake up and go shoe shining, then in the afternoon work in a pub or cafe, then in the evening in a call centre, so it’s quite full on. There’s no chill time. That’s what you see in Cleaning Up, that these characters are always working and never get to relax.”Surprisingly, the bar work or call centre jobs are not the ones that come to mind when Anouka recalls her worst ever job.“Oh God, I was a children’s entertainer when I was at drama school,” she says, still scarred. “I did parties and face painting and that was fine, but it was before I had satnav on my phone and I’d get completely lost trying to find the houses so I’d be late. And I’d look ridiculous, in a yellow car carrying a red suitcase wearing green dungarees or a tutu and having to run into petrol stations to ask directions. Then turning up in tears because I was late and ruining their day.” The children’s “No, the parents, oh my god. The children don’t care, they don’t know you’re late. They were all fine. But the parents were so stressed, and I just wanted to burst into tears but you can’t come in dressed as a clown and cry. It was so stressful I had to stop.” Anouka has been making a name for herself on stage and screen, with the airing of last year’s psychological thriller Trauma, for ITV, with John Simm and Adrian Lester and The Donmar Warehouse’s All-Female Shakespeare Trilogy in , as well as cult hit Chewing Gum in .This last year has been busy for the  Screen International Star of Tomorrow, working on three productions, two theatre and one film. She took the lead as Queen Margaret at the Royal Exchange Theatre in Manchester, a composite of Shakespeare’s lines for Margaret of Anjou, a character he gave more words than any other, including Cleopatra and Rosalind, across four history plays. This production saw Anouka reassert Margaret as warrior queen, cutting a swathe through patriarchal power struggles in a re-telling of the Wars of the Roses, and at the same time waging a contemporary war on the historic gender imbalance in Shakespeare performance. Earlier last year she went forward in time to a dystopian world where blood quality can decide your credit rating in The Phlebotomist, and as well as Cleaning Up, she made the film, Fisherman’s Friends. Starring Tuppence Middleton and James Purefoy, it’s a feelgood tale of Cornish fisherman who land a record deal singing sea shanties, due out in March. She’s a familiar face north of the Border too, having won a Fringe First for her one-woman show Chef at the Traverse in  and the film of Donmar Warehouse’s Julius Caesar was up for best feature at the Edinburgh International Film Festival. “Incredible,” says Anouka, “considering it’s a live theatre recording. But Phyllida [Lloyd, the director], is also a film director so she knows what she’s doing. It’s quite special.”Born and raised in Greater London, Anouka is the middle of three children to a Jamaican father and Trinidadian mother. An athlete, she ran for Kent but got the acting bug at school and won a scholarship to the National Youth Theatre while at sixth form college in Lewisham.“Everyone there was going ‘yeah, I’m gonna be an actor, I’m going to drama school’ and I was ‘going to drama school  What’s going on ‘ere ’ Then after that I was like, “Oh, OK, I’m going to do this, it isn’t just a hobby, this is what I want to do.’” Guildford School of Acting followed and from there to the RSC, making her debut in  in Margaret Atwood’s Penelopiad. More theatre followed then TV with parts in Lucky Man and Doctor Who, before she landed the role in Trauma, ITV’S follow up to Doctor Foster, requiring her to learn how to rock climb. On stage, the Donmar Warehouse set her star rising too. Set in a women’s prison, the Trilogy of Julius Caesar, Henry IV and The Tempest, prompted Lloyd to hire an all-female ensemble cast of all ethnicities and ages to re-invigorate the Bard. Within a decade from first working in theatre Anouka was playing traditional male leads Hotspur, Ariel and Marc Anthony delivering the “Friends, Romans, countrymen…” speech.“It’s funny because I never liked Shakespeare when I was younger,” she says. ”But when I left drama school I got an interview with the RSC, ended up being there for two years and fell in love with it. And Shakespeare was where people started doing colour-blind casting. Everyone does Shakespeare at some point in this country and we need to look at why those plays should still be done, why they are relevant. So many seem quite modern in their themes – in a scary way I guess it’s history repeating itself.”She might be a words woman but Anouka likes a piece of the action too, and she played Hotspur as a kickboxer, preparing for the part by studying videos of Olympic boxing champion Nicola Adams, and training hard. “I grew up watching boxing with my dad, but they were big heavyweight guys, so I watched Nicola Adams, hours and hours of videos, how she trained. She even copied the Muhammad Ali shuffle. It was great fun, a great way to keep fit and I’d like to do it again. But I never sparred, not that, no-one’s coming near my face!” She laughs.Anouka writes and performs her own poetry, some of it published in her collection Eggs on Toast, and admits to sometimes finding it easier to express herself through poetry than through acting. She would love to combine theatre and poetry, her two loves, into a lyrical theatre piece, at the same time as popularising poetry by making it ‘less stuffy’. “With acting I find it often much harder to express what you want to say because you have less control over what’s going on. I started writing poetry a long time ago because I could use it to have my own voice, whereas in acting, obviously you try to take work that you think is good and represents you, but you don’t always have that luxury. So poetry is a way of being creative and having an outlet when you are not working in something that’s creatively interesting or fulfilling. And between jobs, I always have to do something that’s creative.”It was to her poetry she turned when she was invited to do a Ted Talk last year, reciting a poem she wrote that was inspired by Maya Angelou.“I’ve always thought of Ted Talks as being very intellectual, where you have to have a great invention or know about a particular topic so I wasn’t sure whether I deserved to be doing it or what I should do, but I thought what an honour! And I decided to speak from my experience, so it was ‘Being Black, being a Woman, being ‘Other’ and hopefully that strikes a chord with others, everyone who has felt Other.” And it felt natural to put poetry in there.” Anouka went on to talk about her crowdfunding a screening of Black Panther, the  black superhero film now tipped for an Oscar, for kids in her local area of Peckham because she thought it was an important film for them to see, a film that reflected the ‘other’ and underscored the belief that everyone was entitled to fulfilment and a voice no matter their creed, sexuality, culture or gender. “I couldn’t believe how much we raised. So much more than I expected that I’ve got a bit of money left over. We extended the screening so many more kids got to see it and I’ve given money to charities who work with young people, but I really want to do another film screening. That film was such a special thing, so it’s hard to know what the next film to do that for would be. But I’ll definitely do it again.” As for ersity, Anouka feels inspired by the changes she sees in the acting world, citing Sophie Okonedo, who recently won an Evening Standard Best Actress Award for her performance with Ralph Fiennes in Antony and Cleopatra. “She works in film, TV and theatre, which is a dream of mine. And she was in Undercover with Adrian Lester, who is a legend.”It was Lester who presented Anouka with the Ian Charleston Commendation Award for Shakespeare for Under s and having followed his career ever since, she was delighted to play his daughter in Trauma.“I think things are changing, definitely on stage particularly, it’s going in the right direction, but you can always do more. I think theatre is ahead of TV and film in this country, but I see it improving and more exciting stuff coming out.” “Queen Margaret was an example of that. Rather than just re-telling Shakespeare, it changed the lens we’re looking through, so it was all through Queen Margaret’s eyes.”Having played three of Shakespeare’s great male roles Anouka would love to take on more. “God there are so many. Loads of good ones!” she says and laughs. “I’d do LOADS of them! I’ve said before I’ve wanted to play Hamlet. Obviously it was written as a male role, but I see the character, not as a male character, but as a young adult, not quite knowing how to deal with grief and finding out about relationships, romance, all of these things coming in at once. It very much feels like showing somebody turning into an adult, and it’s something I would love to do before I get too old.”Anouka doesn’t talk about her age in a bid not to be tied down to age specic roles, witness her convincing teenager in Trauma. Similarly, she doesn’t talk about who she shares her south-east London flat or le with, apart from rescue dog Evie, who is possibly half Yorkie half Bichon Frise, “I’ve never seen another dog like her, so we’re waiting for a DNA test, just to see,” she laughs.As someone who has been in Doctor Who twice, Anouka has nothing but praise for Jodie Whittaker’s take on the Time Lord. “I wasn’t the right age for it when it came back – it was my little sister that watched it, but then I was in it and I thought gosh, it’s brilliant, are they all like this  And it’s not just brilliant entertainment, but important to watch, like the Rosa Parks episode. School children should all have to watch that episode, it was a great history lesson.”“And it’s important when you’re growing up to see things reflecting of your le, someone who maybe looks a bit like you, and more and more we need someone to do exactly this, be bold like Doctor Who and then the impact is going to be enormous. You realise how little it happens, because when it does, you see the impact. Cleaning Up’s like that, full of women leads, and you just don’t see that.” Next up, Anouka is in the new Idris Elba comedy, Turn Up Charlie, a series of eight half hour episodes for Netflix. She plays a DJ who is an arch rival to Elba’s character, a failing DJ working as a nanny to an out of control -year-old. “It’s nice to be doing comedy. Cleaning Up has humour in it but it’s lighthearted and heartwarming and sometimes dark, rather than actively trying to make you laugh. But this is more of a comedy and it’s out next year, so that’ll be good. Often people don’t think of me for comedy because I’ve done a lot of Shakespeare on stage and stuff, but I like it. I’d like to do more.” And since she’s as much about words as action, we’ll give the final one to Anouka and the call to action with which she ended her Ted Talk and summed up her attitude to inclusivity and embracing the Other in all of us: “When you get that chance, that opportunity, that seat at the table, get creative. And remember to pull up another seat for the next person.” @JanetChristieCleaning Up begins on Wednesday \u2028 January, ITV, pm©JPIMedia Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4852364.1546763674!/image/image.jpg","title":"edinburgh mp seeking change to law so asylum seekers can find work","story":"Legislation seeking to change the law so asylum seekers can work while waiting for their cases to be processed will be put forward by an Edinburgh MP this week.Liberal Democrat Christine Jardine will bring a private members’ bill on Thursday that would allow asylum seekers the right to work after three months in the UK.The move comes as the UK’s asylum system is in the spotlight over the UK government’s response to a rise in the number of people making the Channel crossing from France.Home Secretary Sajid Javid questioned whether the  people who have made the crossing since November, many of whom come from Iran, are genuine asylum seekers, and said the government “will do everything we can” to stop them settling in the UK.His comments were criticised by aid groups, who say the government’s response – which includes redeploying two Border Force vessels from the Mediterranean, backed up by a Royal Navy patrol boat – risks inflaming anti-refugee sentiments.“Right now, people who risk everything to come to the UK seeking sanctuary, with valuable skills and experience to offer, are being stripped of their dignity and condemned to an existence on the very periphery of our society,” Jardine said.“Instead, we need to recognise the contribution they could make and lt the ban which prevents most genuine asylum seekers from working, allowing them to seek employment after three months of claiming sanctuary.“It would help people learn English and contribute to society, while saving the taxpayer millions in support and housing payments.”Restrictions on asylum seekers working in the UK are among the toughest in the western world.In Greece, Canada and Sweden, asylum seekers can look for work immediately, while in the US and the rest of the EU, employment is only restricted for between one and nine months of an asylum claim being lodged.Until , asylum seekers could apply for the right to workthey had been waiting more than six months for their claims to be processed.Currently, asylum seekers may only apply for permission to workthey have been waiting more than  months for an initial response from the Home Office, and only in jobs on a list of specialised occupations where there is a labour shortage.Asylum seekers are assigned a place to live by authorities and are given £. each per week.Lt the Ban, a coalition of  organisations pushing for a change in the law, say the government could save £ million a yearrestrictions on working were eased.Nationwide polling carried out in  by ICM for the British Future think tank and campaign group Hope Not Hate found  per cent agreed that asylum seekers should be able to work to ease their integration into local communities.A survey of  people who had experience of claiming asylum in the UK by Lt the Ban found that  per cent wanted to work.Jardine added: “Scotland has always been dependent on waves of immigration and allowing these people to work can help to ensure that we have a strong workforce to keep our economy buoyant and maintain the socially cohesive society from which we all benefit.“I was extremely disappointed that the immigration white paper released by the government before Christmas didn’t commit to a review of the overly restrictive system in place for those seeking sanctuary in the UK. That’s why I’ve decided to take things into my own hands, and I urge sensible colleagues on all sides of the House to support my bill – surely this one’s a no-brainer ”©JPIMedia Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4848087.1545513411!/image/image.jpg","title":"ian blackford no deal planning a wake up call for mps","story":"Accelerating work to prepare for a no-deal Brexit should act as a #wake-up call# for MPs, the SNP#s Westminster leader has said, warning that a chaotic and damaging exit from the European Union was looming without swt action.Parliament s on Monday for what will be a decisive three months in the UK’s Brexit journey.And in the most visible demonstration of how close a no-deal Brexit could be,  ­lorries will take part in a dry-run for gridlock at the port of Dover during the Monday rush-hour. The lorries will descend on Manston airfield in Kent, which will act as a holding area in the event of a backlog at Channel ports.As the UK government dramatically steps up its preparation for a no-deal outcome, the SNP’s Westminster leader, Ian Blackford, said it would be “insanity” for the UK to crash out of the EU without a Brexit agreement.The Commons has until \u2028 January to approve the terms of Brexit put forward by the government, ahead of exit day on  March. However, there is little sign of consensus emerging for any alternative, with Prime Minister Theresa May’s allies in the DUP refusing to back her and Conservative Party members telling pollsters they prefer a no-deal exit.The lorry testing exercise comes amid concern over the awarding of a contract for emergency ferry services to a brand new company that owns no ships and which was found to have copied the terms and conditions published on its website from a fast food delivery service.Meanwhile, a dredging firm hired by the government has started work to prepare the port of Ramsgate,  miles north of Dover, as a relief route for essential supplies in the event of a no-deal Brexit.The SNP has committed to vote against the Prime Minister’s proposed Brexit deal, but has called on the government to rule out leaving without any agreement with the EU.The Nationalists say Brexit must be put off by extending Article  to allow more time for an alternative to emerge, and that the public must have the final say through a fresh referendum that includes the option of staying in the EU.Mr Blackford, who has been briefed on the government’s full confidential no-deal plans, said: “I fear we are running out of time to meet the deadlines that are looming, not just in March, but also in January.“MPs on all sides need to take what the government is doing as a wake-up call, that a no-deal Brexit is unthinkable and must be stopped.“Every party needs to take their responsibility and do everything in their power to find a way out of this mess. Actually going through with the plans being tested and rolled out would be insanity.”In a letter to hauliers from the Department for Transportand Kent County Council yesterday, officials said “Operation Brock” will see tests run during the morning rush hour at am and again at am to “establish the safest optimum release rate of HGVs” from Manston Airfield to Dover along local A-roads.A DfT spokeswoman said: “We do not want or expect a no-deal scenario and continue to work hard to deliver a deal with the EU.“However, it is the duty of a responsible government to continue to prepare for all eventualities and contingencies, including a possible no deal.“We will be testing part of Operation Brock to ensure that,it needs to be implemented, the system is fully al.”MPs are due to debate the Prime Minister’s Brexit deal on Wednesday ahead of a “meaningful vote” the following week, but the EU has yet to offer any changes to the controversial Irish border backstop, which would keep Northern Ireland under Brussels regulations to prevent a hard borderno trade deal is agreed by the end of .Mrs May spoke to European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker yesterday in an effort to secure more flexibility. A European Commission spokesman said: “President Juncker had a friendly phone call with PM May. They agreed to stay in touch next week.”The government’s hopes of convincing Conservative Brexiteers of backing the deal were dealt a new blow with the publication of a poll suggesting more than half of grassroots Tories support leaving the EU without an agreement.In a three-way choice,  per cent said they would support leaving the EU without an agreement, while  per cent would back the Prime Minister’s deal and  per cent would choose to remain. Some  per cent had no preference.The research, carried out by YouGov for the Party Members Project, also suggested a two-way referendum would see  per cent of Tory members endorse the PM’s stance, with  per cent voting for a no-deal Brexit.A leading figure in the DUP also closed the door on a compromise, saying there was “no way” the party would support Mrs May’s proposed Brexit deal. DUP MP Sammy Wilson said he was “more alarmed” than ever over the backstop. The comments follow a statement by the DUP’s leader at Westminster rebuffing Downing Street’s efforts to win the Unionists over.Deputy leader Nigel Dodds said on Thursday his party’s “principled objections” to the backstop remain, with no sign of any further concessions from the EU side.Mr Wilson said yesterday: “It’s not just because of the regulations which Northern Ireland would be subject to with the backstop, but also the fact we would have to treat the rest of the United Kingdom as a third country.”He also claimed the backstop was “a con trick all along”.©JPIMedia Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4852392.1546777596!/image/image.jpg","title":"theresa may uk in uncharted territory if tory mps don t back brexit plan","story":"Theresa May has warned the UK will be in #uncharted territory#MPs do not back her Brexit plan.The Prime Minister, who is still seeking further guarantees from Brussels in an effort to win over critics ahead of the vote expected on January , warned Brexiteers they risked derailing the UK’s departure from the European Unionthey did not back her deal.And she again rejected calls for a second referendum, saying it would be disrespectful to people who voted for Brexit in .As MPs prepare toto Westminster with the crunch Commons vote looming on the Withdrawal Agreement thrashed out with Brussels, the Prime Minister said no alternative plan was able to respect the  referendum result, protect jobs and provide certainty to citizens and businesses.Mrs May promised further measures specic to Northern Ireland and a greater role for Parliament, and said “we are still working on” getting extra assurances from Brussels as part of her drive to secure support for the deal.She repeatedly sidestepped questions about whether she would keep putting the deal back to MPsit gets rejected, instead saying: “If the deal is not voted on, this vote that is coming up, then actually we are going to be in uncharted territory.“I don’t think anybody can say exactly what will happen in terms of the reaction we will see in Parliament.”She said Labour was “playing politics” and opposing any deal to create “the greatest chaos” possible.“We have got people who are promoting a second referendum in order to stop Brexit, and we have got people who want to see their perfect Brexit. I would say don’t let the search for the perfect become the enemy of the good because the danger there is that we end up with no Brexit at all.”On her own future, Mrs May refused to put a timescale on her departure.“I was clear before Christmas with my colleagues on two things: one, I’m not going to call a snap election and secondly that I’m not going to be leading the party into the  general election.“What colleagues have said they want me to do is to deliver Brexit, which is what I am working on doing and also deliver on the agenda I set out when I first became Prime Minister.”Officially slated for the week of January , the Commons vote is expected to be held on Tuesday, January . Mrs May said it would be “that sort of time”.Earlier, speaking to the Press Association in Los Angeles, International Trade Secretary Liam Fox said: “Parliament needs to understand thatwe’re not able to come to Parliament and get a deal, then we may end up leaving the EU with no deal.“Most people seem to say that’s not what they want to see, well they better make up their minds before we get to a week on Tuesday because that’s going to be a very key decision-making point.”Shadow international trade secretary Barry Gardiner suggested Labour could offer a referendum on a renegotiated Brexit deal.He said Labour’s plan remained to push for a general electionMrs May’s deal was rejected, and “we would set out what we would seek to negotiate in Europe to try and deliver”.“The reason Theresa May has had such a botched set of negotiations is because of her red lines,” he told Sky News.“If we as a new, incoming Labour government were to go to Europe without those red lines we know that we could get a dferent, better deal and that’s what we want to try and achieve.“At that stage it makes sense to go to the country and to say ‘here we are, this is what we have managed to negotiate, this is the deal that we have managed to conclude because we don’t have the same red lines as Theresa May, we think it’s a better way forward’.”Meanwhile, Health and Social Care Secretary Matt Hancock said he was “confident” that medicine supplies would be “unhindered” in a no-deal scenario - as long as the pharmaceutical industry took action.Askedhe could guarantee that no one would die as a result of a no-deal Brexit, Mr Hancock told Sky News’ Sophy Ridge On Sunday: “I’m confident that we will have the unhindered supply of medicines so long as the plans that we have in place are properly enacted.”©JPIMedia Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4852289.1546783732!/image/image.jpg","title":"priority for buses over other vehicles in scotland s cities urges traffic commissioner","story":"Bus passengers must be given greater priority over other vehicles in Scotland#s traffic-clogged cities, the country#s traffic commissioner has urged.Joan Aitken, who is stepping down next month after regulating buses and lorries for  years, said roadworks should also be better planned to minimise disruption.She said despite firms operating far more safely since she was appointed in , passengers being held up in tailbacks had become a signicant problem.The call comes a year after bus operator Lothian said Edinburgh was being strangled by a “huge circle of congestion”.Aitken, who received an OBE in the New Year’s Honours List, is the latest senior figure to raise alarm at the problem, which has been blamed for a major fall in the number of bus passengers.Edinburgh City Council is considering extending bus lanes to all-day operation seven days a week, but this has still to be put out for consultation.Aitken said: “The lack of bus priority measures means running times are much slower than ten years ago.“The quality of buses is astonishing – their engineering, comfort and facilities are first rate.“But all that is thwarted by the fact they cannot get along the road, even in Edinburgh, which boasts one of the best bus services in Britain.“Every single day, buses are not able to get through the traffic.“Local councillors want to own or run bus services, but unless they prioritise bus movement then ownership won’t matter. They need to throw their weight behind bus priority measures.”Aitken said delayed buses had a signicant knock-on effect on the economy because of the disruption to passengers, who could include shopkeepers and key health service staff.She said: “Councillors should not think about it as a bus, but as - or more people whose lives could be made better.“Councillors have it in their power to prioritise the bus and say to their officials they have to make the connection about the importance of bus travel.“People on the bus are really important to the economy and our wellbeing. If people cannot get to their work or college, it is not a marginal matter.”By contrast, Aitken said many bad practices by bus operators had been curbed or eradicated since she took on her role.They include buses running early, services cancelled for routine vehicle checks and drivers not stopping for passengers at bus stops.Aitken also said fewer wheels came off buses and fewer of them failed annual tests.Edinburgh council said extending bus lane hours was among measures being considered as part of its public transport priority action plan.The number of bus stops could also be cut to further speed up journeys.Transport vice-convener Karen Doran said: “Enhancing and developing public transport provision is a priority for us.“With a rapidly expanding population, it’s essential we continue to provide reliable, sustainable modes.”A Glasgow City Council spokesman said: “We absolutely accept the principle that bus priority measures are the best way to improve bus reliability.“Improving the reliability of bus services is also of critical importancewe are to encourage car users to make a switch to using buses as a regular mode of transport.”The spokesman said recent improvements included measures on Renfield St and Union Street – among the city centre’s busiest for buses – that had sped up journeys.©JPIMedia Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"vandalism incident takes place in sumburgh airport car park ","story":"Police are appealing for information after three cars had their windows smashed at Sumburgh Airport.Each of the vehicles, which were parked in the main car park, had their door windows smashed.The incident is believed to have happened between pm on Monday and am on Wednesday.Police are asking anyone with information to contact , or attend Lerwick Police Station..."},{"url":null,"title":"creative project manager at shetland arts ","story":"Shetland Arts are seeking a Creative Project Manager to help drive forward our vision of a creative, connected Shetland that values art, culture and creativity, and the positive impact it can have on everyone’s le.The Creative Project Manager will be responsible for delivering a strategy that supports and inspires creative practice, formal and informal learning, outreach, performance, exhibition and programming opportunities throughout Shetland.

Seismic political events, including the Home Rule crisis, the World War, the  Rising and the Conscription threat had shaken the country since the last General Election in . Women had the vote for the first time, other restrictions on the universal right to vote had been removed and the widening of democracy helped to ensure a stunning victory for Sinn Féin on a Republican . Ireland elected  members to the House of Commons in the Westminster Parliament. They were elected in single-seat constituencies on the first-past-the-post voting system, as Westminster MPs are elected to this day. Since its foundation in  Sinn Féin had advocated the withdrawal of Irish MPs from Westminster and the establishment of an Irish constituent assembly. It was only in , in successive by-election victories, that Sinn Fein won Westminster seats and put its abstentionist policy into operation. The swing to Sinn Féin was not only because of the executions and mass imprisonments after the  Rising there was also growing opposition to Irelands involvement in the war and its cost in lives, the inclusion in the British Cabinet of Tory Unionists who vehemently opposed any form of Home Rule, the threat of Partition and the ineffectiveness of the Irish Party at Westminster, led by John Redmond, increasingly seen as collaborators with British imperialism, as well as ongoing repression and press censorship. Redmond died in March  and in April the British government introduced legislation to impose Conscription in Ireland. The Irish Party MPs withdrew from Westminster in protest, thus ending forever any signicant Irish nationalist presence in that Parliament. Sinn Féin, the Irish Volunteers and the trade union movement took the lead in the anti-Conscription campaign. The Irish Party was also involved and it had three by-election successes in  but the writing was on the wall. In East Cavan in June Sinn Féins Arthur Grfith won a decisive victory on the abstentionist  which Irish Party leader John Dillon had called a policy of lunatics. It was widely predicted that Dillons party faced heavy defeat whenever the General Election came. Well before the war ended, Sinn Féins election preparations were under way. The jailing of many of its leaders in the British governments concocted German Plot did not deter the movement. In August  General Secretaries Harry Boland and Tom Kelly reported to the Ard Chomhairle that there were over , cumainn throughout the country. The same meeting endorsed a motion to contest every seat in the General Election “in order to give every Irish voter the opportunity of voting for or against the establishment of an independent Irish Republic”. By the time of the Sinn Féin Ard Fheis in October , many candidates had already been selected, a process overseen by Harry Boland, based at the movement’s Head Office in  Harcourt Street, Dublin. That same month the electoral register was revised to take account of the widened franchise. Women over  could vote for the first time and remaining property qualications for men over  were removed. This meant that the number of people in Ireland entitled to vote in the General Election grew enormously from , in  to ,, in . On  October the Irish Labour Party and Trade Union Congress announced its intention to stand in a number of constituencies. But there was opposition both internally and externally. Sinn Féin requested that Labour candidates take a pledge to abstain totally from Westminster, in which case Sinn Féin would stand aside in selected seats. But the Labour position was to abstain conditionally, retaining the option to attend in certain circumstances. A great many trade unionists were members or supporters of Sinn Féin and opposed Labour standing unless the full pledge was taken. A special conference of the Irish Labour Party and Trade Union Congress was held in the Mansion House on  and  November, at which the decision was taken not to stand in the General Election. Debate has continued ever since about the reasons for this decision and its consequences. There was a wide iety of views within the Irish trade union movement ranging from socialist republicans to Home Rulers to Unionists, so the reasons for non-participation were ied. Historian Dorothy Macardle put it this way: \"The majority of the working men and women of Ireland were members of Sinn Féin or the Volunteers or Cumann na mBan, and, as the disciples of James Connolly, held that the freedom of the nation and the freedom of the working classes must be pursued as one unided aim.\" . The war ended on  November and the British Parliament was dissolved on  November. Polling days was set for  December. The Sinn Féin manesto reflected the republican position adopted by the Ard Fheis a year previously and stated that the party \"gives Ireland the opportunity of vindicating her honour and pursuing with renewed confidence the path of national salvation by rallying to the flag of the Irish Republic\". It was committed to establishing the Irish Republic by withdrawing Irish representation from Westminster, using “any and every means available” to make British rule impossible, establishing a constituent assembly and appealing to the post-war Peace Conference to recognise Ireland as an independent nation. It roundly condemned the role of the Irish Party in collaborating with the British government and attempting to “harness the Irish people to England’s war chariot”. The Manesto endorsed the  Proclamation “guaranteeing within the independent Nation equal rights and equal opportunities to all its citizens”. The manesto was censored by the British authorities when it appeared in the newspapers but the full version was widely circulated. Press censorship was only one of the many forms of repression that the British used during the election. Hundreds of republicans were in jails  – including  of Sinn Féin.s candidates. Raids and arrests were frequent, as were bans on public meetings and among those arrested during the campaign was Sinn Féin Director of Elections Robert Brennan. His two predecessors, Seán Milroy and Dan McCarthy, were already in prison. British soldiers and loyalists had attacked  Harcourt Street on  November and subsequent nights, leading to the death from a stroke of ‘Nationality’ editor Seumas O’Kelly.  On  November the office was raided by a large force of armed Dublin politan Police who arrested Brennan and seized manestos and other election material. Acting Director of Elections James O’Mara wrote to the press: “Each arrest has naturally caused some disorganisation, but the cause of Irish independence will not be stayed or broken by such tyranny. Men have been, and will be, found who will fill the vacant places.” Nominations were due to close on  December. In North-East Ulster the Catholic bishops suggested that Sinn Féin and the Irish Party should not split the nationalist vote in seats where this would allow a Unionist to win. Sinn Féin proposed that a plebiscite be held among nationalist voters in these constituencies. Dillon rejected this in talks with Sinn Féin representative Eoin Mac Néill. The latter acceded to a call for the Catholic Cardinal Logue to propose a four-four ision of eight seats between the two parties. Others in Sinn Féin criticised Mac Néill for not adhering to his instructions. Sinn Féin candidates remained in the race in three of the four Irish Party-allocated constituencies but did not campaign and their voters were urged to support the Irish Party to keep the Unionists out. In taking this position the need to oppose the British threat of Partition was very much to the fore. When nominations closed it was realised that  outgoing Irish Party MPs were not contesting the election and in  constituencies,  of them in Munster, the Sinn Féin candidates were unopposed. Sinn Féin contested  of the  constituencies . Harassment continued right up to polling day with raids and arrests, seizure of Sinn Féin election material and removal of posters by British crown forces. After the death in Usk Prison, Wales, on  December of republican prisoner Richard Coleman, Sinn Féin campaigners wore black crepe on candidate badges. In The Four Glorious Years Frank Gallagher says a final election rally filled Dublins OConnell Street with speakers on several s, each flying a Tricolour with a black cross for Richard Coleman. He describes how on polling day Dublin dockers marched to the polling station behind an advance guard of Citizen Army veterans and hundreds of workers at the new British aerodrome at Collinstown – now Dublin Airport – went to the polls in a fleet of lorries flying Tricolours. The only two women candidates were both suffragists and  Rising veterans - Countess Markeivicz in the St Patrick’s Ward in Dublin’s South Inner City and Winred Carney in the strongly Unionist Victoria ward in Belfast. Markievicz was in Holloway Prison in England and her election address to her constituents she said:“I have many friends in the constituency who will work all the harder for me. They know that I stand for the Irish Republic, to establish which our heroes died, and that my colleagues are firm in the belief that the freeing of Ireland is in the hands of the Irish people today.”There was a two-week gap between polling day and the announcement of the final results on  December. Sinn Féin had won an overwhelming victory, taking  of the  seats in Ireland. Unionists won  and the Irish Parliamentary Party six . The majority vote for Sinn Féin was  per cent:  of the  Counties ed only Sinn Féin TDs. Of Dublins  TDs, all but one were Sinn Féin. The myth of nine-county Ulster being Unionist was exposed. Unionists polled a majority in Antrim, Armagh, Derry and Down but there were nationalist majorities in Cavan, Donegal, Fermanagh, Monaghan and Tyrone. Constance Markievicz was the only woman elected in Ireland and Britain and would go on to be one of the first women government ministers in the world in the First Dáil Éireann. Preparations for that Dáil, the democratic assembly of the Irish Republic so strongly mandated by the electorate, began soon after the General Election that transformed Ireland  years ago. GENERAL ELECTION - MANIFESTO TO THE IRISH PEOPLETHE coming General Election is fraught with vital possibilities for the future of our nation. Ireland is faced with the question whether this generation wills it that she is to march out into the full sunlight of freedom, or is to remain in the shadow of a base imperialism that has brought and ever will bring in its train naught but evil for our race.Sinn Féin gives Ireland the opportunity of vindicating her honour and pursuing with renewed confidence the path of national salvation by rallying to the flag of the Irish Republic.Sinn Féin aims at securing the establishment of that Republic.. By withdrawing the Irish Representation from the British Parliament and by denying the right and opposing the will of the British Government or any other foreign Government to legislate for Ireland.. By making use of any and every means available to render impotent the power of England to hold Ireland in subjection by military force or otherwise.. By the establishment of a constituent assembly comprising persons chosen by Irish constituencies as the supreme national authority to speak and act in the name of the Irish people, and to develop Irelands social, political and industrial le, for the welfare of the whole people of Ireland.. Irelands claim to the application of that principle in her favour is not based on any accidental situation arising from the war. It is older than manynot all of the present belligerents. It is based on our unbroken tradition of nationhood, on a unity in a national name which has never been challenged, on our possession of a distinctive national culture and social order, on the moral courage and dignity of our people in the face of alien aggression, on the fact that in nearly every generation, and five times within the past  years our people have challenged in arms the right of England to rule this country. On these incontrovertible facts is based the claim that our people have beyond question established the right to be accorded all the power of a free nation.Sinn Féin stands less for a political party than for the Nation it represents the old tradition of nationhood handed on from dead generations it stands by the Proclamation of the Provisional Government of Easter, , reasserting the inalienable right of the Irish Nation to sovereign independence, reaffirming the determination of the Irish people to achieve it, and guaranteeing within the independent Nation equal rights and equal opportunities to all its citizens.Believing that the time has arrived when Irelands voice for the principle of untrammelled National self-determination should be heard above every interest of party or class, Sinn Féin will oppose at the Polls every inidual candidate who does not accept this principle.The policy of our opponents stands condemned on any test, whether of principle or expediency. The right of a nation to sovereign independence rests upon immutable natural law and cannot be made the subject of a compromise. Any attempt to barter away the sacred and inviolate rights of nationhood begins in dishonour and is bound to end in disaster. The enforced exodus of millions of our people, the decay of our industrial le, the ever-increasing financial plunder of our country, the whittling down of the demand for the Repeal of the Union, voiced by the first Irish Leader to plead in the Hall of the Conqueror to that of Home Rule on the Statute Book, and finally the contemplated mutilation of our country by partition, are some of the ghastly results of a policy that leads to national ruin.Those who have endeavoured to harness the people of Ireland to Englands war-chariot, ignoring the fact that only a freely-elected Government in a free Ireland has power to decide for Ireland the question of peace and war, have forfeited the right to speak for the Irish people. The green flag turned red in the hands of the Leaders, but that shame is not to be laid at the doors of the Irish people unless they continue a policy of sending their representatives to an alien and hostile assembly, whose powerful influence has been sufficient to destroy the integrity and sap the independence of their representatives. Ireland must repudiate the men who, in a supreme crisis for the nation, attempted to sell her birthright for the vague promises of English Ministers, and who showed their incompetence by failing to have even these promises fulfilled.The present Irish members of the English Parliament constitute an obstacle to be removed from the path that leads to the Peace Conference. By declaring their will to accept the status of a province instead of boldly taking their stand upon the right of the nation they supply England with the only subterfuge at her disposal for obscuring the issue in the eyes of the world. By their persistent endeavours to induce the young manhood of Ireland to don the unorm of our seven-century old oppressor, and place their lives at the disposal of the military machine that holds our Nation in bondage, they endeavour to barter away and even to use against itself the one great asset still left to our Nation after the havoc of the centuries.Sinn Féin goes to the polls handicapped by all the arts and contrivances that a powerful and unscrupulous enemy can use against us. Conscious of the power of Sinn Féin to secure the freedom of Ireland the British Government would destroy it. Sinn Féin, however, goes to the polls confident that the people of this ancient nation will be true to the old cause and will vote for the men who stand by the principles of Tone, Emmet, Mitchel, Pearse and Connolly, the men who disdain to whine to the enemy for favours, the men who hold that Ireland must be as free as England or Holland, Switzerland or France, and whose demand is that the only status befitting this ancient realm is the status of a free nation.ISSUED BY THE STANDING COMMITTEE OF SINN FÉINtest"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27506  ","story":" Aengus Ó SnodaighThe flu epidemic that swept across Britain and Ireland in  struck at the weak and elderly in society. Hundreds died and many more spent many weeks crippled in agony in their beds during the winter months.Richard Coleman was born in Dublin in , one of eleven Coleman children, most of whom were active in the Gaelic League. Brought up in Swords, County Dublin, Richard was a religious and a patriotic young man. He trained to be a Christian Brother, but left to begin a career with the Prudential Insurance Company.When Thomas MacDonagh came to Swords in April  to recruit members for the recently formed Irish Volunteers, Richard was among the first to join. When John Redmond forced a split in the Volunteers later that year, the remaining Volunteers elected Richard as their captain.On Easter Sunday , Richard mobilised his men, the Fingal Battalion, at Saucers Town, ensured that they were ready for what lay ahead and dismissed them till the following day. On Easter Monday they, along with other Volunteers from surrounding areas, came under the direction of Thomas Ashe, whose instructions were to prevent British reinforcements from reaching Dublin. They fulfilled that task heroically that week.On the Tuesday,  Volunteers were sent into the GPO in response to a request from the Commander-in-chief, James Connolly. On reaching the GPO, the group was split up. Six men became the tunnelling unit around the GPO - `the engineering corps - while the others under Richard were instructed to reinforce the garrison under Sean Heuston in the Mendicity Institute. Connollys parting words to them did not augur well for their mission: ``I dont think you will all get there, but get as far as you can.They got as far as the Mendicity Institute unscathed. A Volunteer at one of the barricades they passed through said of them: ``In the midst of the firing, men approached up Church Street towards our barricade. When they reached it, they passed briskly towards their objective - whatever it might have been. They were dressed and, I thought looked, like countrymen... I could not but admire very much they way they went into action.At the Mendicity Institute, the garrison was under severe pressure, with the British attack coming virtually from all directions. By Thursday, things were hopeless and Sean Heuston was forced to surrender to a much larger British force.They, similar to the other captured Volunteers, were corralled at the Rotunda Hospital for identication purposes. They were then court-martialled and sentenced. Richard was sentenced to death, though this was commuted to three years penal servitude.The sentenced prisoners were transported to Dartmoor Jail in England first and then ided up. Richard was sent to Lewis Jail in Kent. When they were released after a very successful campaign in Ireland and abroad for their freedom, each Volunteer was granted £ from the National Aid Fund in America to help them rebuild their lives. They all pooled their money and began the New Ireland Friendly Society, with Richard as a director and a trustee with a superintendents wage.Like many of the other released prisoners in June , Volunteer Richard Coleman of Swords travelled to Clare to help Sinn Féin and the Irish Volunteers in their efforts to get Eamonn de Valera elected in the by-election.While there he addressed the first unormed parade of Irish Volunteers to be held since . For this, he was arrested and jailed for six months. While in Mountjoy Jail, he and the other prisoners went on hunger-strike, led by Thomas Ashe. Ashes death led to such a public outcry that the remaining prisoners were first moved to Cork Jail and then Dundalk Jail before being finally released.Richard was not to remain `at large for long and he was again arrested, along with many of the other republican leaders whod been active in rebuilding the Movement, as part of the British authorities `German Plot conspiracy.The prisoners were assembled first in Dublin Castle on  May  and were then ided up and sent to Usk and Gloucester Jails in Britain. Conditions were harsh in the jail and attempts were made to criminalise them with the order to wear prison unorms. They resisted and at the direction of the Home Office the prison governor, Mr Young, capitulated. On their first night in Usk, the internees won the right to free association, the right to receive and send letters, to smoke and to wear their own clothes.Despite their victory, the prison regime and their confinement weakened the men and with the onset of a severe winter, many succumbed to the influenza virus which had reached epidemic proportions, killing hundreds outside the prison walls. Richard was among a group of POWs struck down by the virus - they were left in their damp and cold cells for three days after the flu struck them down. On  December, a new prison doctor, Dr. Morton took up his new duties in the prison and immediately he diagnosed that Richard had now suffering from pneumonia and he had him transferred to hospital. He died a few days later on  December .Remembering the result of Thomas Ashes inquest - that the prison authorities were culpable - no formal inquest was allowed and when Richards brother arrived he was prevented from getting an adjournment of the local inquest so as to instruct a solicitor. The local inquest heard Richards brother state that Richard was a strong healthy man at the time of his arrest, while three fellow POWs attested to the insanitary conditions in the jail and that improper nursing contributed to his death. These statements got good publicity in the Irish press and added to the campaign to get the POWs released.Richard Colemans remains were released to his brother and were taken to Dublin where they lay in state for a week in St Andrews Church, Westland Row. Over , people filed past the coffin to pay their last respects. Volunteers in unorm formed a guard of honour during that time. A public funeral procession in driving rain from Westland Row to Glasnevin was followed by over , people. Three volleys were fired over the grave in Glasnevin Cemetery by six Volunteers despite a huge police presence. The size of the crowd prevented the police from moving against the Volunteers.Volunteer Richard Colemans death in an English jail, aided Sinn Féin campaign against Britains occupation and their general election campaign which was in full swing at this stage, and two weeks later Sinn Féin won a landslide victory of parliamentary seats. A month later in January  Sinn Féin MPs met as Dáil Éireann for the first time. The escape from Usk Jailby four of Richards comrades on the same day saw that republican POWs were unbroken and unbowed by their comrades death.Volunteer Richard Coleman died of pneumonia in Usk Jail on  December ,  years ago this week.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27507  ","story":" Michael McMonagle“This proposal from Priti Patel really exposes the Brexiteer attitude to Ireland as nothing more than a colonial irritant whose rights really shouldn’t be taken into account. - Chris Hazzard MPThe proposal from a senior Tory MP that the threat of food shortages in Ireland should be used to put pressure on the Dublin government and the EU in the Brexit negotiation exposes the colonial attitude of Brexiteers, a Sinn Féin MP has said. South Down MP Chris Hazzard was speaking after senior Tory MP and former minister Priti Patel urged the British government to use the threat of food shortages which could arise from a no-deal Brexit as leverage in the Brexit negotiations. The Tory MP, who previously stepped down from her ministerial role after revelations of secret meetings with the Israeli government, asked why the threat of food shortages wasnt being \"pressed home\" during the Brexit negotiations. Her remarks have sparked outrage on social media, with comparisons to Charles Trevelyan, the notorious British civil servant known for his role during The Great Hunger. Chris Hazzard said the proposal from the Tory MP were \"crass and offensive.\" “This proposal from Priti Patel really exposes the Brexiteer attitude to Ireland as nothing more than a colonial irritant whose rights really shouldn’t be taken into account.“They know the history of the Irish famine and Britain’s role in it and the very fact that they would seek to inject that into the Brexit debate is crass and offensive.“The Tories couldn’t care less about the impact of their reckless Brexit agenda on the people and economy of Ireland. We are simply collateral damage,\" he said. The South Down MP also said these and other public statements from Tory MPs highlight the importance of the backstop. \"It is our only insurance policy against a hard border in Ireland and comments such as Priti Patel’s will only serve to reinforce the determination of those of us who are saying that the backstop is the bottom line.

We were republicans in the mould of Markievicz. We were what we were. We are what we are. Unashamed, unrepentant republicans to this day and forever on.I was asked to speak at this event because I am a woman ex-PoW. To my mind there is nothing extraordinary in that, because I am only one of many.  There are hundreds of women throughout this country who have endured imprisonment because of their republicanism – and who carry that past with pride. There are women around us today who have shown bravery that would be considered well above the call of duty in any other walk of le. And, there are thousands who have quietly lived their lives and never told anybody of the things they did to further republicanism.And today we’re here to honour the memory of Constance Markievicz, one of the most famous republican women in recent Irish history a woman revered equally by historians and revisionists, and a woman who believed in, and participated in physical force republicanism.Constance Markievicz didn’t give a second thought to taking up arms and declaring war on the British Empire. Neither had she any misgivings about teaching young Fianna members to fight and bear arms. And she is rightly hailed a hero for taking that stand but the same people who revere her would, in a heartbeat, condemn me and others like me, and would pour scorn on those women on our republican role of honour, and claim that there is a dference.But I wonder could they tell me the dference between Constance Markievicz, who stated in  that:And the words of Volunteer Mairéad Farrell when she stated in :And I would love those revisionists, who laud Constance Markievicz and condemn Mairéad Farrell, to explain to me the dference between the circumstances that drove republicans in  to strike a blow against the British empire, and of republicans in  and  who took up arms to defend small communities like mine – trapped on the fringes of loyalist east Belfast, subjected to sectarian pogroms, ignored by a British government and forced into a state that neither wanted or accepted us.Marie Moore, a native of Clonard, a veteran of republican struggle and Belfast’s first Sinn Féin Deputy Mayor speaking of her le of republicanism rememberedWhere were the revisionists when thousands were being burned out of their homes when frightened mothers were dragging terried children onto buses and trains and being forced as refugees across the border, hoping for help and safety in another state that had abandoned us, and that also neither wanted nor accepted us When those who revere Constance Markievicz’s philanthropy and work among the poor of Dublin are celebrating her le, do you wonderthey ever give a thought to what she would have done had she been there when the hundreds of refugees from ‘the black north’ poured off buses with their meagre belongings in battered suitcases Do they think she would have stood idly by and did nothing I know none of us can speak for the dead none of us know what the other would have done, but we know enough about her to come to our own conclusions and I would like to think that she would have been as much a leader now as she was then.Her commitment and her legacy was an example to young women like me when I was growing up in a war-torn Belfast. She inspired us. She gave us aspirations to live up. She set an example. And part of that example was to never back down.We knew her history. We knew she took up arms. We knew she was a commander in the IRA. And we aspired to be just like her.She was also a POW, and when young women were imprisoned throughout the conflict, in this State, in Britain and in the six counties, they knew they were walking in the footsteps of the women of . We were republicans in the mould of Markievicz. We were what we were. We are what we are. Unashamed, unrepentant republicans to this day and forever on.And no political opponent or revisionist will tell me, and all those thousands like me, that I should be ashamed of that.But the irony is, that the people who are so quick to condemn today’s republicans for taking the decisions we did, have never once considered what drove so many Irish men and women, young and old, to walk the hard roads we walked during these last  troubled years. We didn’t do for fame or fortune. We did it because it was the right thing to do.There are always reasons and circumstances behind people’s decisions and, we need as much today to consider those journeys, as we do the journeys of the men and women of . Circumstances and history shaped all of us. That’s undeniable.Throughout the decades republican women have been to the forefront of struggles in Ireland in the Suffragette movement, the Labour movements, the Gaelic League, and many other organisations – much as republican women today are deeply involved in every aspect of daily le and organisations working to better peoples’ lives.In every phase of the struggle, women have taken risks. From their involvement in the ’s border campaign, to those who broke the Falls Curfew and carried guns and ammunition out under their coats, in prams and in shopping bags. And, we know many too who lost their loved ones, and their own lives, to plastic, rubber and live bullets on active service for the IRA, and to loyalist and British State murder squads.We all know women who walked the streets wrapped in blankets, in bare feet, in rain and snow, to highlight the plight of the prisoners in the H-Blocks and Armagh who smuggled comms, love letters, and much more into and out of the prisons who marched in their hundreds to the steps of Stormont when Sinn Féin were locked out of talks, demanding their rights and representation.There are women who travelled every week, for years, to visit loved ones imprisoned in this state, in the six counties and in Britain, most times with young children in tow. The hardship of prisoners’ families is often forgotten, and imprisonment impacted on thousands upon thousands of people throughout this island, not just the prisoners themselves.Brave republican women stood as Sinn Féin candidates in the early ‘’s and ’s, when in councils throughout the six counties they were vilied and subjected to the vilest of sectarian abuse and threats of death.And I’m proud to say that the temerity of those who led the way has paid off in idends. Republican women were elected in their hundreds – councillors, MLAs, TDs, MEPs, Senators and including – dare I say it – three very proud and very capable women MPs are walking in the footsteps of the first female MP elected to sit in the British House of Commons the first abstentionist Sinn Féin MP, Countess Constance Markievicz.And still, there are people telling us today that our Sinn Féin MPs, elected by thousands of Irish citizens full in the knowledge that, like Markievicz they would not be taking seats or swearing an oath to a foreign government, should take seats in a British parliament, or better still, resign those seats and gt them to others who are more than willing to doff their caps and swear an oath to defend an English monarch. Do these people even listen to themselves These same people, who are lecturing us, will no doubt be lauding Constance Markievicz for her part in the birth of the nation, with all her history of abstentionism and of physical force republicanism.Do they genuinely not understand irony And do they think that our supporters, those who flock to the ballot boxes in their thousands toSinn Féin elected representatives, don’t aspire to the goal of Markievicz, of a democratic republic that cherishes all of the children of the nation equally Where is the equality for nationalists in the six counties  Where is the respect for the democratic mandate of thousands upon thousands of people who have yet to have their rights and entitlements respected in the British constructed and maintained sectarian six-county state  Where is the support for our democratic mandate  Where is the aspiration to cherish all of the children of the nation equally  Or do they not consider us part of that nation  They need to bear in mind that when the Proclamation was being written there was no border in Ireland – hard or soft.They also need to bear in mind that there is no single narrative to this conflict. Yes, people have been hurt, on both sides, and those who are trying to revise the history of the IRA of , are also trying to revise the history of the IRA of this phase of the struggle to present one side and one side only. As a republican woman I am proud of the rich history of Irish women that we can lay claim to, and many here today were part of that history. And I am proud and in awe of those women who lost their lives as part of that struggle.Unfortunately, throughout the decades of our troubled past people who know nothing about what we went through are writing and rewriting our history.We cannot allow the memories of our dead, the stories of nationalist and republican victims, and the history of repression and oppression that led to young people again taking up arms, in the same way Constance Markievicz and Tom Clarke and Pádraig Pearse and all those others in  took up arms, being airbrushed out of our history. And maybe one day we’ll be in a place where the circumstances that led to those decisions are acknowledged and accepted.Because, rest assured, not one of us woke up one morning and decided on a whim to take up arms, to put our lives on the line, to face imprisonment and death. There are always reasons why people make the decisions they do but some people just refuse to see or accept that.We know those reasons and we need no lectures from people who have not walked in our shoes. is something we should all aspire to.We have a duty to future generations to ensure that our revolution isn’t rewritten. We need to make sure that our young people know why and where our history of struggle comes from to remind, educate and to see that it never happens again to ensure that young women continue to be inspired by Constance Markievicz, by her bravery, her philanthropy and her work for those less well off. But we also need to ensure that the circumstances that led to her and future republican women seeing the need to take up arms, never happens again.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27509  ","story":" Mary Lou McDonaldPresident of Sinn FéinI remain optimistic because Ireland is changing.

It was given voice in the Repeal referendum. In Belfast the largest political demonstration was Pride. For this generation the border is an anachronism. When the Repeal result was read out a sign was held aloft, ‘The North is next’. Rights transcend borders and so does this generation. will mark the centenary of the First Dáil. A people’s parliament for a revolutionary generation. The coming year is an opportunity to rebuild that culture of change and a parliament that serves the people and not vested interests. Sinn Féin will stand with the people on the streets and stand up for them in the Dáil because the housing and health crises can and must be ended.The policies of Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael created and sustained the health and housing crises. As waiting lists grow and the number of patients on trollies hit record highs, the Taoiseach points the finger of blame at doctors and nurses who take Christmas leave. His response to rising evictions and homelessness is to defend the Vulture Funds and give tax breaks to landlords.The Taoiseach and Fine Gael are supported in all of this by Mícheál Martin and the supply and confidence trick.Regardless of what choice the British government makes on Brexit, it cannot be allowed to damage Irish interests, our economy, our agreements or the rights of citizens. This is one issue that unites the majority of parties North and South. We will continue to stand up in the interest of all Ireland. Early in January I will travel to Brussels to continue our engagements with European leaders.An Executive in the North should be in place delivering for all in the community, growing the economy, standing up to destructive Tory policies, and representing the majority view on Brexit. Instead we have witnessed daily at an inquiry the corruption of governance that led to the RHI scandal.No government could sustain the abuse of power and intolerance displayed by the DUP. All the while the Irish and British governments looked on and refused to act. It is a disgrace that the institutions of the north are not up and running.We had a deal with the DUP leadership that would have reinstated the Institutions. The DUP walked away. The two governments promised a new talks process. Ten months on there has been no talks and no process. There has been nothing constructive from the two governments. That is not good enough.Every day that the Executive is suspended undermines the political institutions. Every refusal to recognise rights undermines the political process. The threat to impose Brexit undermines the democratic process.The DUP know that their deal with the Tories will end. They also know that the refusal of rights is not compatible with equality and power-sharing government. They should also know that there is no good or positive Brexit for the north.Sinn Féin is ready for talks, to establish a new Executive working in genuine power-sharing, and operating to the highest standards of governance. A new Executive must include new ways of working, be inclusive of all parties and respect the rights of all the people.The DUP knows what needs to be done. Theresa May knows what needs to be done. It will require leadership that has been absent to date.The two governments have indulged the DUP at the cost of the political process. The two governments know what must be done to form a new Executive in the north. The current do-nothing approach is running out of road.The majority of parties share a common approach to Brexit and to the rights of citizens, and are committed to working together to build a new Executive.The two governments must convene talks and make clear the agreements and rights of citizens will be at the core of a new Executive.The Irish Government cannot look on as spectators. They cannot stand idly by while the DUP and British government shred the agreements. The agreements are the people’s agreements. The people voted for them. The Taoiseach said that the people of the north will not be left behind again. The government must plan for a successful talks process and also have a backup plan.They must also begin preparations for Irish Unity. There is no contradiction in seeking the establishment of the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement and fulfilling its promise of a unity referendum. The time is right to hold an informed and respectful conversation and referendum on our shared long term future as a united people and a united Ireland. No government should try and stle that debate or call for it to be suspended.I remain optimistic because Ireland is changing. I believe that we have the policies and plans to tackle the housing and health care crises. The debate on Irish unity is under way, and we will have elections and the opportunity for people to have their say. The choice is simple, continue with the failing policies of Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil or plot a new course for a new and united Ireland.I look forward to the new year and the continued challenges and opportunities of a changing Ireland.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27510  ","story":"Civil Rights marchers attacked at Burntollet Bridge.

I had received other such callsfrom Jer over the years but I was never available to join him, untilthis year, so I called my friend and comrade Larry OToole and we metJer in Gaffneys in Fairview in the aptly named snug The OfficersMess. It was an unforgettable afternoon with Jer. He had been very ill in hospitalnot long before and while he was in great form, both Larry and I feltthat this was almost like a goodbye. Little did we think that lessthan a month later Jer would be gone from us. He died on StStephen’s Day. November. And as always his conversation ranged widely - from thefamous ambush in West Cork to Dalymount stadium and his beloved Bohs,from the streets of the North Inner City with the Dublin Brigade inthe s - and indeed the s - to the Dubs winning four in a rowin , from the docks of our city to the plains of the AmericanWest, from a Dublin stage to a Hollywood set. Jer did entrances and exits well,befitting a man of the stage, and even the shortest of time in hiscompany was entertaining. He knew the power of words and versestripped easily from his tongue. His accent was deep and Dublin, aswas everything about him, the historic Dublin of the working class,locked out in , rising up in , resilient and proud of itsheritage of struggle. In his day Jer was an IrishRepublican Army Volunteer and a political prisoner. He was asocialist republican through and through in the tradition of JamesConnolly and in the style of his idol Jim Larkin. He embodied Larkinon many occasions and at many events. He was always available to do aturn for The Cause - be it trade union, republican or internationalsolidarity.  We asked him to read theProclamation at the Dublin Sinn Féin Easter commemoration inGlasnevin in  and he proudly obliged. Previously at many of ourEaster commemorations over the years he had read James ConnollysFinal Statement to his Court Martial to great and stirring effectoutside the GPO. In  he performed Larkin with us at thestatue in O’Connell Street to begin the Centenary of the Lockout,and again at the Liberty Hall conference organised by Sinn Féinearly that year. A more poignant memory is of Jeras Wolfe Tone at the Sinn Féin Ard Fheis in , bicentenary of theUnited Irish Rising. He was accompanied by a group of pike men andwomen, among them his son Diarmuid who died so tragically later thatyear in a fire in Glasgow, after a Celtic game which father and sonhad attended. Leaving the stadium that day, Jer saw his son for thelast time. The loss of Diarmuid was a terrible tragedy for Jer andhis partner Eithne, who died in December , a further loss fromwhich Jer never recovered. Among Jers talents was as adesigner of banners, which he produced with Eithne, and many of whichcan still be seen at trade union rallies. He championed the use ofthe original green, silver and gold Starry Plough as designed for theIrish Citizen Army and flown in Dublin at Easter , and, thanks inlarge part to Jer, it is now widely seen and recognised. It wasplaced on permanent display in the Oak Room of the Mansion House forthe first time, when as Ardmhéara I accepted it as a presentationfrom the Dublin Council of Trade Unions. And it was in the Oak Room,under the Starry Plough, that we gathered on  January to pay tributeto Jer with a night of eulogies, music and song. In October  Jer joined us forSpraoi ar an Sráid, the Moore Street Party that I organised asArdmhéara, in support of the campaign to save the  battlefieldsite. As always, he was proud and glad to answer the call. Once againthat day he passionately declaimed the words of the Frenchrevolutionary Camile Desmoulins, as quoted by Connolly and Larkin: \"The great are not great. Thegreat only appear great because we are on our knees. Let us arise!\" Many hundreds of people attendedJer’s funeral on  January. His coffin was draped in the StarryPlough and passed his North Strand home on the way to the church in aprocession which included some of his finest banners. The attendancewas a cross-section of the republican left, in all its ersity, aswell as people from the theatre, the trade union movement and hismany friends and neighbours. Sinn Féin President Mary Lou McDonaldattended, as did Gerry Adams.

People don’t think twice about wearing a seatbelt or cycling helmet, butyou had a serious accident you’d like your next of kin to know as soon as possible and you’d want the best care possible in a medical emergency.

Ideal for use whether you are a student studying away from home, an older person or someone with a medical condition.”The ICE Card ensures all the essential information is accessible in one place meaning it could help save lives, provide the best help and care, as well as make sure your next of kin can be contacted promptly.Information about medications and allergies helps ambulance personnel make better decisions about treatments they can give you and crucially in the case of heavy blood loss, it is important for emergency staff to know your blood type. In the case of people with conditions such asAlzheimer’s it can help a person who may be confused contact their family and avoid any unnecessary distress.The cards are initially being rolled out at PCSP and PSNI engagement events and through groups. For more information on how to get an ICE Card please contact PCSP Project Officer, Billy Stewart on    or by emailing william.stewart@armaghbanbridgecraigavon.gov.uk.\"  \"  Police warn Northern Ireland residents to look out for vulnerable relatives after two people robbed of thousands Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\""},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8756119.1546445050!/image/image.jpg","title":"st colman s have a super tour","story":"Local families attending the Family Health Initiative at St Colman#s Primary School recently visited Moundview Eurospar in Dromore for a supermarket tour.The Family Health Initiative is a healthy lestyle programme delivered by Early Years- the organisation for young children in the Southern Trust and is funded by the Public Health Agency.During the supermarket tour both parents and children took part in a fantastic scavenger hunt to find all the healthy food items on their sheet.

Or, more accurately, David Stitt BSc Hons is on Twitter. Arlene Foster’s erstwhile photo companion has been busying himself of late on the Kilcooley bonfire in Bangor, which he’s determined to ensure is the biggest and the best in Are Wee Country.First up, Squinter’s not sure what Science Dee is a Bachelor of Honours in – the UDA man doesn’t say. But from the tweets about the appliance of structural engineering science to the massive edice, it might appear that it is in that field of endeavour that he excelled at university. We might be tempted to speculate on what university handed the qualication over to him, given the quality of the spelling on his Twitter account, but let’s stick to the matter in hand.On Thursday, as the bonfire crept out of the North Down troposphere and into the stratosphere, Dee gave vent to the vaunting pride that’s filling his barrel chest as the race for the title of Biggest Boney came down to the final furlong: “Kilcooley Bonfire, Well on its way to be Ulster Biggest . A Military Operation, being constructed by Structural Engineers for safety.” Across the Pravince, men of substance nodded slowly and gravely and gave thanks that the health and safety of the children of the large estate is in such professional hands. Next day the Kilcooley boney fell down.AUGUSTAN open letter from Emma Little Pengelly, DUP South Belfast MP, on the Glidergate scandal#Thank you for giving me space in your paper to lay out my position on the Woodstock Road Glider stop, erroneously referred to by some as the ‘Short Strand’ Glider stop, among them the people who designed and built the Glider system and the people closest to it.It has been alleged that I have never before shown an interest in bus stops.. Nothing could be further from the truth. At university I was a founder member of the ‘Campaign to Save Ulster Bus Stops’ and I wrote a very well-received pamphlet which I distributed to membersentitled ‘Classic Bus Stops of Markethill and Richhill – Ulster’s Hidden History’. Furthermore, I have on occasion been on a bus, although admittedly not for a while. That the Glider stop I referred to is near the Short Strand is not in question, but since when did geographical proximity have anything to do with naming things  The Donegal Celtic football club on the Suffolk Road is not in Donegal. The Dublin Road is not in Dublin. Even the Woodstock Road is not in Woodstock, which most people are unaware of . So calling the stop Short Strand because it is near the Short Strand makes zero sense and is in fact potentially confusing. What is this place coming to when routes can’t be changed or amended just because they are traditional  SEPTEMBERSCOTLAND’S Shame, it’s called – the ,lb gorilla in the Holyrood Parliament that nobody wants to speak about. Many and frequent are the manestations of anti-Catholic sentiment at the very core of Scottish society, but the antics this week of a senior Labour Party official at the party conference in Liverpool has seen the issue reach a wider audience and that may make it rather more dficult for it to remain a dirty secret. Speaking from the , Scotsman Andy Kerr, Chairman of the Labour Party’s ruling National Executive Committee, invited a woman to speak and then added: “Did you cross yourself there  In that case I might not.” Not surprisingly, the ‘joke’ went down like a fart in a space suit as Andy obviously forgot that he wasn’t speaking before a select audience in Glasgow. The apology wasn’t long coming “unreservedly” with Andy adding: “I was trying to be lighthearted but what I said was ill-judged and wrong.” Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson said: “People from all parties and none will be appalled by this and by the casual dismissal of concerns.” Much as Squinter cheered Ruth’s decisive intervention, he must reluctantly point out that her party has blotted its copybook in the recent past when it comes to the matter of Catholics in Scotland. Last year a Conservative member of Stirling Council was readmitted to the party after being suspended for posting anti-Catholic comments online. Alastair Majury tweeted: “Why is the Catholic Church against birth control  Because they#ll run out of children to molest.”Of course, had Andy Kerr made a religiously loaded remark like the one he did about Catholics about, say, Muslims, or Jews, he wouldn’t have seen the end of the day. But in situ he remains, at the very heart of a party currently struggling with allegations of anti-Semitism which so far have not been solid enough to see any heads roll. The Zionist lobby which is after Jeremy Corbyn’s head would surely have claimed their first victory had this remark been aimed in the direction of Judaism. Perhaps you’ll remember that in July the Orange Order called off a parade in Glasgow. They called it off rather than obey a direction not to walk past a Catholic church where at a previous Orange Order march a priest had been spat at and struck with a baton by parade followers. Now the socialists have joined the KKK. Jings, crivvens, help m’boab!OCTOBERWHAT IS THE BACKSTOP The factsAn insurance policydesigned to avoid a hard border in the event that a customs agreement cannot be agreed by the end of the transition period . If no agreement is reached, the EU wants to see the north remaining in the Single Market and Customs Union until London comes up with a solution. Under pressure from hardliners, British Prime Minister Theresa May wants the backstop done away with or, at the very least, subject to a time limit.The loyal Ulster factsKeeping the Pravince in the Single Market and Customs Union while the rest of the UK leaves is an existential threat to the future of Are Wee Country and the DUP is battling to “save the union”. The party is clear that there can be no ergence within the UK, except on things that it wants to erge on, gyeh morrage and abortion, for instance. A DUP source has promised to up the pressure on the Tory government: “We are going to squeeze their balls until their ears bleed.”Promises, promises# NOVEMBERWhich brings us to James McClean. Again. Since last year’s Remembrance Day festival the Derry native and Republic of Ireland international has switched clubs from West Brom to Stoke. In order to keep their fans informed ahead of the annual wearing of the poppy football shirts across the English leagues, the club issued a brief statement outlining the player’s historical stance and confirming that he wouldn’t be sporting a poppy on his shirt this year either.Despite the fact that nothing had changed – other than the name of the club at the top of the press release – the statement sent the Pravince’s media to DefCon , just as it has since the day and hour James spoke his first words on the topic, occasioning the familiar angry social media blast from Ulster’s stout yeomanry. There’s a delicious and very fitting circularity in this local saga:just as nothing has changed in relation to James McClean and the poppy, nothing has changed in Ulster’s attitude to it.DECEMBERA BURNING question finally gets its answer. No, it’s not about Brexit, or world hunger, or famine or plague. It’s simply this: what do you call this item pictured below left  You may never have given the matter any thought, but Squinter has, because, well# because that’s the kind of guy he is. Fact of the matter is that you’re very unlikely ever to ask for one because  out of every thousand of these things sold are simply lted by the customer and brought to the counter or check-out without a word. If you have a shopping list it will simply say ‘milk’ and everyone knows exactly how large or how small their milk requirements are.But every time Squinter buys one he asks himself why he doesn’t have a clue what it’s called and, further,a tourist asked him what it was he wouldn’t be able to answer. So, enough being enough, Squinter put the question to Twitter – and back came around  replies, some of them fairly sensible, some#. Quart.. Barrackbuster.. Big milk.. Flagon Jar.. Green milk..

That gap in our knowledge has now been put right with the the timely publication of the powerful ‘War Against All Puerto Ricans: Revolution and Terror in America’s Colony’ by accomplished journalist Nelson A. Denis. His book sweeps through the many humiliations heaped on Puerto Ricans after the US invasion of , such as a ban on Spanish in schools and a prohibition against the flying of the nation’s flag. Where the American government led, business followed. Suffocating poverty on the island and slave-like conditions on the sugar plantations worsened. The first civilian governor Charles Allen ed to the US and leveraged his contacts and influence to become the King of Sugar. “By ,” writes Denis, “Allen and US banking interests had converted  per cent of all arable land in Puerto Rico into sugar plantations. These bank syndicates also owned the insular postal system, the entire coastal railroad, and the international seaport of San Juan.”Patriots responded with their own Nationalist Party but its ranks were riddled with FBI informers and when that didn’t stymie its growth, supporters were massacred in the town of Ponce. On Sunday March  , a parade of unarmed nationalist cadets was effectively ambushed by police in scenes similar to our own Bloody Sunday. “The police kept shooting and clubbing for thirteen minutes,” says Denis. “By the time they finished,  men, one woman and a seven-year-old girl lay dead over  more were gravely wounded — moaning, crawling, bleeding, and begging for mercy in the street.# marked the high-point of this revolutionary rising when, following  years of military occupation, the Nationalist Party of Puerto Rico staged an unsuccessful armed insurrection.They paid a heavy price for tweaking the tale of the tiger. Ill-trained and poorly-equipped cadres of nationalists – branded communists by the powers-that-be – were cut down by US National Guard troops. In the town of Jayuya where revolutionaries had seized control, the residents were subjected to a merciless bombardment by ten Thunderbolt fighter planes armed with -lb bombs. It was the only time in history that the United States bombed its own citizens.Within a fortnight, the rebellion had been quashed but not before a failed assassination attempt on President Truman had ensured the tiny island nation’s freedom struggle made headlines around the world. The nationalists paid a heavy price: vengeful prison sentences were meted out to the leaders and activists. One woman, Blanca Canales, served  years of a le sentence for burning the post office in Jayuya — the same town levelled by US planes. Their incarcerated leader Pedro Albizu Campos was subject to brutal conditions right out of the Gulag Archipelago — and then some. In , he was exposed to radiation poisoning which led to visible burns on his extremities, swelling of his face and led to a stroke which left him paralysed. Thus ended the long struggle of the revolutionary who had parlayed with De Valera and raised money for the Irish liberation movement in Boston in  — at one point he spoke in front of , people in Sanders Theatre in Boston and delivered what was described, by an English lord no less who was present, as “the most complete, the most brilliant speech” on Irish freedom ever heard. The  years which followed his death in  were, says Denis, “a downward spiral of chaos and corruption that turned the island into a punch-drunk fighter, unsure of its whereabouts, wobbling on its feet, pawing at empty air”.It’s hard to argue that things have improved of late. Emigration is the only route to meaningful work for an entire generation: In  alone, it lost a net , residents or nearly . per cent of its population. In , the island went bankrupt with the US Government refusing to come to its aid. In , Puerto Rico was hammered by a Hurricane Maria — the worst natural disaster to ever hit the island. “Is there a solution to all this ” asks Denis. “Of course, but the complicated ones rarely work. Those that have been tried include corporate tax subsidies to giant pharmaceutical companies, a fraudulent war on drugs, government subsidies, austerity programmes, and real estate speculation. These ‘solutions’ breed government fraud, police corruption, absentee ownership, junk bonds, media spin, and rampant hotels, shopping malls and parking lots. The answer may be much simpler. It starts with an honest self-appraisal. It acknowledges the eviction of an entire people — literally and systematically — from their own land.”Nelson Denis has done a service to the people of Puerto Rico — his people — and to the wider world watching on with this authoritative history of a brave island people. He has, at last, put Puerto Rico on the map."},{"url":null,"title":"meet the brexitbashing twitter account followed by leo varadkar","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

the only sensible course of action is to withdraw Article  immediately.People from every corner of our country continue to call for the British people get the final say - with the option to stay in the EU. 🇪🇺 pic BHkOyg— Sadiq KhanJanuary , London Mayor Sadiq Khan said the Brexit process should be immediately haltedMrs May’s deal is rejected by Parliament – with the decision put back to the people.“If Parliament rejects the Prime Minister’s bad deal the only sensible course of action is to withdraw Article  immediately,” he said.“People from every corner of our country continue to call for the British peopleget the final say – with the option to stay in the EU.”Shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry accused the People’s Vote campaign of seeking to “slap the Labour Party around”.She told BBC Radio  Live’s Pienaar’s Politics: “What I would like them to be particularly focusing on is taking the arguments as to why we should remain in the European Union to people who voted to leave and to try to change some hearts and minds.“Rather than using it – as some people I think do – as an opportunity to attack the Labour Party and the leadership of the Labour Party. ”She added: “If there was to be another referendum along the same lines as we had before, I would vote remain.“But what I would like,we are going to have another referendum, is to win that referendum and for us to remain in the European Union.“What concerns me about the People’s Vote movement is that instead of spending their time trying to change people’s minds, they spend their time smacking the Labour Party around the head, some of them.”A People’s Vote spokesman said Ms Thornberry “is badly mistaken” in her views about the campaign and added: “What we are doing is highlighting the biggest poll on Brexit yet which shows that Labour will suffer its worst electoral defeat since the sit continues promising to enable some sort of Brexit to go ahead.“In that situation, it won’t be us slapping the leadership but millions of Labour voters who want the party to fight for the public services, rights and living standards that will otherwise be hammered by any kind of Brexit deal.”\"Lets not forget that a huge number of younger generations voted for the Labour party hoping it would take the country on a dferent trajectory -

Editors Viewpoint: State papers show leaders saw a bigger picture The diplomat said many MPs who did not take an active interest in Irish affairs became \"puffed with outrage and conviction\" about doing something in response to the killings.He said suggestions ranged from demands for a tougher and revised policy of policing funerals to a demand for internment throughout Ireland and, in \"more cases than previously\", to a demand to setting a date for withdrawal from Ireland \"in order to let the Irish get on with butchering each other\". State papers: Clintons invite to Adams provoked furious response from PM Majors private secretary Mr Ryan also said people across Britain wrote to their MPs demanding greater action against terrorists.The two plain-clothed British soldiers inadvertently drove into the path of the funeral before mourners pulled them from the car and were beaten before being shot dead by members of the IRA.The murders happened days after the funerals of the three IRA members who were shot dead by the SAS in Gibraltar. State papers: Taoiseach backs Garda in face of Iron Lady Margaret Thatchers disdain Mr Ryan said after meeting backbenchers at Westminster, he was struck by their exasperation and anger \"without any proper sense of how to ventilate it\" while there was a resurgence of \"frustrated patience\" with Ireland.\"The complexity of the issues elude their instinctual approach to policy questions, that of self-interested pragmatism and this further fuels their primary response to events such as last Saturdays,\" he added. State papers: Thatcher warned Haughey of worst civil war everUK allowed Irish unity \"It has to be said that no amount of violence toward the UDR, the RUC and Northern Irish or Irish civilians of any religious persuasion could come anywhere near provoking the same reaction in Britain to Saturdays killings - and the sort of killings they were - of their own English soldiers.\"He later said there was a risk the Anglo-Irish relationship and the Agreement may be \"caught in the net\" when MPs look for the reasons behind the murders.Days after the killings, the Secretary of State Tom King, made a speech to the House of Commons in which he described the \"horric events\" that shocked the world. State papers: Thatcher asked to make gesture of clemency in Guildford Four case  In a separate memo from Mr Ryan following a meeting with Conservative MP Edward Leigh, he said the Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher was left \"very distressed and very angry\" by the soldiers murders.Mr Leigh indicated that MPs held special meetings to call for support for \"much tougher and direct action\" by the SAS and other special units against terrorists.\"He stressed several times that he was not exaggerating the mood generally\", Mr Ryan wrote.Mr King told Mr Leigh during a meeting they had reason to believe the IRA was \"planning a serious offensive\", however he did not elaborate further than this."},{"url":null,"title":"museums are battling it out to find out who has the best duck","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

His move has raised fears over clearing the way for a Turkish assault on Kurdish fighters in Syria who fought alongside American troops against IS extremists. Turkey considers the Syrian Kurdish People’s Protection Units, or YPG, a terrorist group linked to an insurgency within its own borders.Mr Bolton, who is to travel on to Turkey on Monday, said the US is insisting that its Kurdish allies in the fight against the Islamic State group are protected from any planned Turkish offensive. He is to deliver a warning to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan this week.“We don’t think the Turks ought to undertake military action that’s not fully coordinated with and agreed to by the United States,” Mr Bolton said.President Trump has stated that he would “not allow Turkey to kill the Kurds”, Mr Bolton said. “That’s what the president said, the ones that fought with us.”Mr Bolton said the US has asked its Kurdish allies to “stand fast now” and refrain from seeking protection from Russia or Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s government. He said Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen Joseph Dunford would continue negotiations with his Turkish counterparts this week to seek protection for America’s Kurdish allies in Syria.He added that Ambassador Jim Jeffrey, who has been serving since August as the special representative for Syrian engagement and was named last week as the American special envoy for the anti-Islamic State coalition, would travel to Syria this week in an effort to reassure the US’s Kurdish allies that they are not being abandoned.Mr Bolton said US troops would remain at the critical are of al-Tanf, in southern Syria, to counter growing Iranian activity in the region. He defended the legal basis for the deployment, saying it is justied by the president’s Constitutional authority, adding “I’m a strong believer in Article II”."},{"url":null,"title":"alley theatre launch new saturday morning guitar club","story":"The Alley Theatre are offering the public the opportunity to develop their guitar playing skills at a new club every Saturday morning from this week .The tuition will be delivered by local musician Ciaran Gallen and is an excellent opportunity for people to develop your skills whether you’re an absolute beginner, an experienced musician or at any point in between.Ciaran has been playing the guitar for the past  years teaching in schools all around the North West and facilitating workshops.A regular at the Alley Theatre Ciaran also hosts the very popular Original Sinners nights giving local musicians an opportunity to play their ‘original’ music in front of a live audience.“I am thrilled to be starting these classes in the Alley Theatre.

Receiving the MBE is just totally surreal.ldquoIrsquom overwhelmed the work I do in safeguarding children and women has been recognised by the Queen.Sheila started to work as a front line practitioner in the field of social work  years ago. Today, she is Social Work Manager for the South Eastern Health and Social Care Trust.She is also the chairperson of the South Eastern Area Domestic and Sexual Violence Abuse Partnership, a multi-disciplinary and inter-agency made up of voluntary and statutory community groups like Sure Start, Womenrsquos Aid and PSNI.Sheila said social workers were used to being on the receiving end of unwarranted bad publicity, but were expected by society to protect vulnerable children.She said: ldquoI first began to understand domestic violence when I became a social worker. I quickly realised it was prevalent in a lot of families.ldquoThankfully, society is beginning to talk about it more. ldquoWe need to continue to talk about it because it is so dficult for anyone living with domestic violence to tell their story and it is extremely dficult for children.ldquoThey are scared to speak out because they remain afraid of what might happen to themthey told an outside organisation. Sometimes, their silence is due to them feeling ashamed or even responsible for the abuse they are dealing with.Sheila understood quite early in le about the effects of trauma. Her elder brother, Eugene, disappeared on New Yearrsquos Day  when Sheila was in her early teens.His three children came to live with her family and she saw how her own mother and father were able to make their lives as normal as possible which led to some healing for all of them.The tragedy was the inspiration behind a play called, The Ferryman which debuted in London recently.ldquoMy role is tough, she explains, ldquobut social workers are our own support network. We meet with a lot of anger and abuse. It can be challenging but it can also be rewarding. Many people do come back to us to say thank you or, they will say to us that wersquove helped to turn their le around. That is said to us more frequently than anything . Thatrsquos what keeps us doing the job. We are the source from which change is possible. Everyone has the potential to change and I see it played out time and time again.It is evident that Sheila is dedicated to the families she protects. She said: ldquoDomestic violence is quite prevalent in Northern Ireland. One in six women and one in nine men will live with it including their children some time in their le.ldquoPolice are called to an incident every  minutes. Curiously, it is this time of year that sees a spike in those figures. Christmas Day and New Yearrsquos Day will see the highest numbers of women and children call the police for help.ldquoAnd, I do think the timing of this MBE from the Queen will only serve to raise awareness of this issue. And might even help someone who is suffering abuse to pick up the phone and ask for help.Sheila advises that anyone who wishes to make a call should contact   , which is completely confidential.

They include the Voisinage Agreement with the Irish Government to allow Co Down fishermen to resume fishing in Irish Sea waters. There is also the need for improvements to harbour infrastructure at Ardglass and Kilkeel to allow larger boats to land fish.Miss Ritchie said the prawn quota reduction was more to do with the species being exempted from so-called discard ban.She added: ldquoIt is vitally important that our local fishing industry in the catching and processing sectors is allowed to continue to grow and develop.ldquoThe Government needs to continue with a positive working relationship with the industry to allow the economic sectors in Ardglass and Kilkeel to be nurtured to ensure existing jobs are sustained and new employment opportunities are realised.Mr Alan McCulla, chief executive of the Anglo-North Irish Fish Producers Organisation Sea Source, believes the outcome of the annual negotiation on catch quotas ldquoputs Northern Irelandrsquos fishermen in a good starting position for the next phase in our relationship with the EU.He said the agreements reached at the Fisheries Council meeting offered ldquosome positives and some negatives for the Irish Sea, with the December negotiations described by the Department of Agriculture Environment and Rural Affairsas ldquoone of the most dficult councils in recent years.A spokesperson for the government department said it was vitally important to ensure that sufficient quota was obtained for all Irish Sea fish species to enable them to land all the fish they catch from the start of the New Year, particularly whiting which is a by-catch in the prawn fishery.ldquoThe EU Commission initially proposed an Irish Sea whiting quota of  tonnes but this was successfully negotiated up by % to  tonnes, with agreement to carry out a further review of the quota in the new year.The government department spokesperson said the deal ldquoensures that there are now workable solutions to alleviate the pressure for fishermen while preventing fish from being wastefully discarded unnecessarily..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Castlewellan tree voted top in NI  ","story":"CASTLEWELLAN Forest Parkrsquos giant redwood is celebrating being voted Northern Irelandrsquos Tree of the Year in the Woodland Trustrsquos search for the countryrsquos best-loved tree.The stunning redwood mdash or multi-stemmed giant sequoia to be precise mdash finished second in the  UK final.Everyone associated with the Forest Service, the people of Castlewellan and ious groups helping with ambitious regeneration proposals at the stunning forest park, are delighted with the majestic treersquos success in the regional heat.The giant redwood stands within the walled garden at the forest park and at over  years old has seen centuries come and go.

The Hoops raced into a - first half lead with goals from Stephen Galbraithand Sean McMahon before Jordan McCoubrey delivered the coup de grace in the th minute to finally kill off a game Olympic outfit.Celtic looked the more composed and inventive side from the off and an understrength Olympic struggled to create anything of note. The Hoops seized the lead with only six and a half minutes gone and never looked back.Chris Mullan, who was like a fleet-footed gazelle down the left flank and just missed out on the man of the match award, sped past his marker on the edge of the box.His stinging shot that looked destined for the bottom corner of the net was parried out by an alert Ryan Connollly, but Galbraith was hovering around the six-yard box and was perfectly placed to steer the ball home.Less than two minutes later Mullan dipped his shoulder again and cut inside Jack Roddy before striking the base of the post with a fierce shot.Olympic steadfastly refused to buckle and with  minutes gone were unlucky not to equalise when Aaron McCaffrey, their most potent player in attack, was unable to take advantage in a rare moment of panic in the Celtic box.Celtic went back on the attack and with  minutes gone taskmaster Jordan Curran teamed up with Mullan to create an opening for Sean McMahon, but he fired wide.Back at the other end, the dangerous McCaffrey got in behind Conor Doherty, but his delightfully flighted cross missed by everyone in the box.With  minutes gone Rottweiler Curran blocked an Olympic attempt to send Rhys Patterson clear. The ball flew off his shin and into the path of the willing Sean McMahon who raced away from Michael Rice and Darryl Russell, but with only Connolly to beat, his cheeky, dinked effort grazed the crossbar on the way to safety.A minute later another mazy Mullan run ended with the wing wizard crossing for McMahon, but this seasonrsquos top scorer had his audacious effort blocked on the six yard box with Celtic claiming a penalty.The second goal wasnrsquot long in coming and with  minutes gone a Mullan cross was deftly headed home by Doherty, who had been given the freedom of the box. Three minutes later Galbraith made it - when his low corner evaded Connolly at his near post and ended up in the net.Celtic continued their dominance after the break with Mullan and McMahon dovetailing perfectly for Curran, but his shot went well over the top. With  minutes gone McMahon decided to go it alone, but he was well off target as Olympic backed off him.Olympic tried desperately to get things moving, but it just wasnrsquot their day and with  minutes played Russell did exceptionally well to prevent Galbraith from making it - with a last-gasp tackle.The fourth goal was just around the corner and with  minutes gone Andy Baggley headed the ball into the path of prodigy Jordan McCoubrey, who looked suspiciously offside. The teenage terrier didnrsquot hang around as Olympic had pushed up and he raced cleat to beat Connolly all ends up.If anything, Celtic could have won by an even bigger margin and Connolly saved brilliantly in the th minute to deny Baggley a fth Celtic goal.Celtic Bhoys: Nathan Curran, Shaun Megahey, Conor Doherty, Matthew Carson, Mikey Rice, Jordan Curran, Terence Bell, Ricky Kerr, Stephen Galbraith, Sean McMahon, Chris Mullan.

Scotland had the lowest level of overpayments, with % saying they had done so in the year up to June.Poor interest rates from money sitting in savings accounts could be one factor driving the high levels of home owners using their cash to make mortgage overpayments, those behind the research suggested.Continued low interest rates on mortgages, making debts relatively affordable, could also mean some borrowers have a bit of spare cash left over which they can put towards paying their loan off more quickly.David Blake, principal mortgage adviser, Which  Mortgage Advisers, said: “While it might be surprising to hear that so many people have paid off extra chunks of their mortgage recently, the benefits can be massive, cutting months off the totalof your loan – and, in turn, saving you hundreds or even thousands in interest.”More than , home owners with a mortgage were surveyed.Which  Mortgage Advisers said that some mortgage lenders limit the amount you can overpay to % per year and thatyou could consider either making regular overpayments or doing it in lump sums.Thieves try to smash through wall to steal ATM Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"try catch            ..

It is available for hire as a wedding venue, as well as for other events.The Vale of Glamorgan Council own the site, with Penarth Town Council handling its operation.The Vale council is currently undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets in the Vale, which includes the Kymin. The town council has stated that staff are waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its grounds.But Mrs Gardner, Mrs Herniman and Mrs Huxtable say they heard rumours it could be sold and say they want to ensure it is kept for the community use.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoIt is a fantastic venue with lots to offer.ldquoThe Kymin has childrenrsquos parties here, bowling outside, craft fairs and everything you can think of here. There are many rooms and there are wonderful grounds here as well.ldquoWe have had my sonrsquos wedding here and barbecues here. As members of PODS we have our annual barbecue here every year.But the women say they believe the number of people and groups who use The Kymin has dropped over the years.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoI think its underused, I donrsquot know why that is particularly.ldquoWhen I have come down here, I would just see one group in the building. It is a big building and itrsquos a shame to just see one room being used instead of it being lively and filled with a iety of groups.ldquoIt would be a crying shame for it to be taken away from the public because it is underused.Mrs Gardner, , added: ldquoWe want to be proactive about this rather than just sit back and not know whatrsquos going on.Neither the Vale of Glamorgan Council or Penarth Town Council confirmed or denied that the building and grounds could be sold.But Penarth Town Council did say they had enquired about the transfer of the site as a community asset.A spokesman for Penarth Town Council added: ldquoThe Kymin is a Vale of Glamorgan Council asset which has been operated for a number of years by Penarth Town Council.ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council are undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets which will take several months to complete. Penarth Town Council is waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its groundsldquoThe Vale council advised Penarth Town Council that it would not enter into a transfer of the Kymin as a community asset. The town council had requested to do so in order to improve the facilities for the people of Penarth and future generations.Cllr John Thomas, the leader of the Vale of Glamorgan Council, said: ldquoThe council recognises The Kymin is a strategically signicant asset for the Vale of Glamorgan as a whole, due to its prominent location in Penarth.

He said: ldquoWe were blown away by such a generous offer. Our playgroups and workshops make a real dference for people who arenrsquot always able to access creative activities, and we have been lucky to secure funding this last year to run our playgroups free of charge for families and help the community.He added: ldquoBeing not-for-profit it is always a stretch to buy resources and sadly the instruments get worn out quickly and are expensive to replace. The children and adults we work with benefit hugely from music and creative expression and always enjoy having a go with the instruments. A donation like this means so much and the new instruments have been very happily received.\"Music is a universal language that transcends ability, age and every other demographic. We are so grateful to Phil and Adrian, the patrons of Penarth Acoustic Club, Grfin Books and of course Pencerdd who were really helpful and accommodating too.KeyCreate welcomes new families to the playgroups and invites anyone to get in touch.

When I woke up whenever and potted and mooched and just saw what the day would bring.Like most people, the demands of work, family, friends, errands and the general stuff of le, mean that at any given moment we can be doing one thing, planning something  and thinking about many more.I get in to grasshopper phases where it feels like there is so much on my lsquoto dorsquo list that I flit and fly between myriad things and sometimes few of them get completed how Irsquod like or indeed completed at all and for those that that do get sorted and sewn up with aplomb, there is no time to take any satisfaction or pride because it is time to crack on with the next thing folks.I read a while ago about a concept that affects your brain around scarcity.The idea that when we feel that something is scarce, be that time, money or something  that we feel is in short supply, it can make us act with less focus and rationality thanwe had an abundance of such.So, in my case, when I feel time is pressured, I am more likely to try to do more with the result that I feel I have less time and my scarcity suffering brain is more likely to forget, to misplace to mess up.And so, knowing this, I am going to set aside the lsquoto dosrsquo and the lsquoshouldsrsquo and curl up on the settee with my utterly wonderful friend and eat and chill and know that with every mouthful of delicious cake, I am doing myself some good. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentOrder byOldest firstNewest firstHighest scoredLowest scoredLoading comments...

It aims to maximise independence, which research has shown is the outcome that matters most to people.The project is informed by a similar initiative developed in Canterbury, New Zealand and has a number of key elements which will improve how health and social services work together.Some these elements include a well-being website which will link services across the community and allow health and social care professionals to share information about patients and multi-disciplinary teams.During a visit to Redlands Surgery in Penarth last week, Mr Gething met members of the Cardf and Vale team and some of the team visiting from New Zealand to see the development of the project.Mr Gething said: ldquoWith an increase in le expectancy and our continued public health challenges, our health and social care services will continue to face increasing pressures. This is why, in our long term plan for health and social care, we have set out the need to truly transform the way we deliver care to ensure it is sustainable in the future.\"This will require better integration of health and social services to reduce reliance on hospitals and deliver care closer to home. The Transformation Fund will be used to fund a small number of projects which have the most impact in developing and delivering new models of care, and which have potential to scale up so they can be used across Wales.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He decided to put together a calendar of his work together to help raise money for the Alzheimers Society, as his father died from the disease in .The -year-old was encouraged to put together the calendar after posting some of his pictures in a local Facebook group.He said: \"I was surprised by the positive response and all the encouraging comments my first set of photos received, said Phil, ldquoWhen I posted another set of photos people started suggesting putting them together in a book or a calendar.\"Mr Lewis said the idea stuck and he asked the group to vote for their favourite photos which would be included in the calendar, before working with local graphic designer Ceri Legg who designed the layout and Beacon Printers, who printed the calendars.Around  calendars were printed altogether which were on sale in shops throughout the town, but have now fully sold out.ldquoI was really worried at first as the number  was suggested to me by the printers, and as soon as I picked them up I start feeling anxious about how exactly I was going to sell  calendars,\" said Mr Lewis.\"I thought that  would have been a more realistic number. I was completely taken aback by the huge response.\"I had people contacting me from all over the world ndash Australia, Spain, Texas, askingI would post calendars to them. This is on top of the response from local people.\"I spent most of my evenings in that first week doing deliveries all over Penarth,\" Mr Lewis added.Through the sales, Mr Lewis has raised more than pound, for the Alzheimers Society.He said: \"It seemed like the right thing to do really, as Penarth is a very community-oriented town so doing a calendar for charity fits with the outlook of the people of Penarth.\"Now, Mr Lewis is looking at printing more calendars this year to help raise further funds for the charity.\"If the idea of this calendar had never been suggested then my photos would have ended up just sitting on my computer,\" he said.\"Irsquom just glad that this hobby that I really like has ended up being put to good use by raising this money for charity.To get in touch with Mr Lewis about purchasing a calendar, email philip.lewis@live article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We can now offer our customers a streamlined product supply chain package by integrating their co-packing requirements with the grouprsquos warehouse and transport subsidiary companies.ldquoLogistically, this works out to be more cost effective overall, but also lowers the carbon footprint on the transportation of food products, which is something we are passionate about.Wild Water Group has a current annual turnover of poundm and Mr Rattenbury believes the company can increase that figure by a further poundm within  months and then reach poundm within two to three years.The project is backed by a pound. million investment from Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking and the Development Bank of Wales and has secured Welsh Government funding under the new economic contract.Using a similar business model to the grouprsquos other three sites in Merthyr Tydfil, Llanishen and Cardf Bay, the first phase of development will be the conversion of available space into a large ambient open plan co-packing facility, which will be operational early November  to meet festive season demand.During the first quarter of , Wild Water Group will move the entire Cardf Bay co-packing facility to Aberbargoed, once freezer facilities, production lines and machinery are in place.The company will then continue services such as frozen to frozen storage, bagging, over wrapping, sleeving and tray sealing, as well as the full spectrum of print labelling applications required under the Food Safety Technicalspecications.Economy Secretary Ken Skates said: ldquoThis project will not only see a successful, growing Welsh business create an additional  jobs, it will also create a new strategic hub and facility for both large and small food and drink businesses across the region to pack or store products themselves. This could, in turn, open up new markets for those businesses ndash so Irsquom excited about what this means not only for Wild Water Group and Aberbargoed, but for the region more widely.ldquoIt shows that both our Economic and Food and Drink Action plans are delivering what we had hoped ndash jobs, prosperity and sustainable growth. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is these very services that are now under threat as a direct consequence of year on year under funding.As the proposed cut to the Valersquos budget is below the  per cent threshold, the authority will not receive any further support during the settlement process, Councillor Thomas says.Councillor Thomas says the reduction of pound.million ldquoignores the impact of inflation on council budgets. He said the impact of pay inflation on the council next year will be pound.million..The Vale council is also facing unfunded cost pressures in   of pound.million due to changes in the pension scheme for teachers.Providing for growing numbers of pupils with additional learning needs, and also complying with new Welsh Government legislation, would also cost the council an extra poundmillion which is also unfunded, Councillor Thomas says.Vale councillor Bob Penrose also added that school cutbacks ldquoare inevitable.Cllr Penrose said: ldquoIn July UK Government announced a . per cent rise in teachersrsquo pay which would cover England and Wales.ldquoThis was followed by the announcement of a  per cent increase in employersrsquo contribution to teachersrsquo pensions.ldquoWhat was lacking was an explanation of how this would be paid for.The council has set out its initial budget for  , which says the authority would need to find an additional pound,, in savings next year.That would be on top of pound,, cuts which have already been planned ndash which include a one per cent funding reduction for schools across the Vale.A council tax rise of . per cent for each of the next three years had been assumed in a provisional financial plan published by the council in September. The final level of council tax is not expected to be set until early in .But the council says raising council tax would only cover a small amount of the money it needs to balance the books. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work.

Some of the major deals completing last year included PwC’s move to Merchant Square, the Northern Ireland Civil Service at  Lanyon Place and Allstate at Mays Meadow. “During an unsettling period of political uncertainty, the local office market is an indicator of the health of the Northern Ireland economy, with the professional services and technology sectors in particular leading the way,” Brian Lavery, managing director at CBRE said. “Currently we only have around , sq ft of grade A office space available fragmented across a number of buildings underpinning the need for more investment in this space. “Alongside this office space growth, we are also seeing the green shoots of demand for residential living in the city centre. We believe this is the trend to track in  and beyond as investors across the UK and globally continue to look for opportunities in this area. “However, on a more positive note, we are seeing strong interest from a wide spectrum of investors for office investments in Belfast which is being driven by growing rents and demand, combined with limited supply of high-quality accommodation.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/34453454454.jpg","title":"supporting belfast start ups on the rise","story":"Posted on Thursday January  by Ulster Business The UK’s digital tech sector has attracted more capital than any other European country and Belfast has established itself as a key hub, writes Roisin Byrne, business director, Hays Northern Ireland The  Tech Nation report makes it clear that digital tech makes an essential contribution to our local economy with clusters and start-ups forming primarily around AI , machine learning, cyber security and big data industries. The Belfast start-up community ecosystem is alive and well and has carved out a reputation in the wider tech community for having good access to talent, funding and transport links. It also benefits from great workspaces such as Ormeau Baths, Farset Labs and the Innovation Centre at Catalyst Inc. Indeed, the city is bubbling with entrepreneurial talent as demonstrated by the large number of start-ups which have launched in the last two years. Belfast boasts a disproportionate number of the UK’s high growth firms and it is estimated that the local ecosystem now supports around , jobs. Hays has worked with a number of these start-ups as they have scaled up operations – firms such as Analytics Engines, Uleska and Vox to name a few. As part of our commitment to the sector we’ve also taken space in Ormeau Baths which has become an epicentre for tech meet-ups, hackathons and pitch events. It’s also a campus for early stage and growth stage start-ups to network, share experience and build scalable, globally focussed businesses. In its first year, % of companies based in Ormeau Baths grew their teams and revenues, and raised over £m in venture funding. We’ve also launched a new national initiative called Super Connect delivered by Empact Ventures which aims to help tech start-ups and scale-ups to explore collaboration with large organisations and funding providers through a series of venture labs and pitch days. The initiative brings together corporates, SMEs, angel investors, venture capitalists, grant providers, loan funds and crowdfunding s to explore supporting these start-ups and scale-ups. Details can be found at www.superconnectseries. In an increasingly competitive marketplace Hays sees real value in the innovative ideas start-ups are using to network and build traction and as they scale up to the next stage we are providing material support and employer value branding to help them attract the talent they need.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
