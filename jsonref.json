Debbie Zurick (above, with her husband John) was found with gunshot wounds at her marital home          It certainly wasn\u0027t unusual to see either of the Zuricks with an uncocked rifle slung across an armA friend told MailOnline: \u0027Debbie and John split up a few months ago and she went to live in Ireland to get away from it all.\u0027Jamie was an old friend of both Debbie and John and she enjoyed spending time in Ireland. She was exasperated with their relationship. She needed some time away to clear her head and decide her next move.\u0027Debbie returned to the cottage because of the dogs and John had just found out about the new man in her life.\u0027 One neighbour said: \u0027Debbie wanted a separation. Things came to a head over the last couple of weeks. I\u0027ve been told that she\u0027s dead and that is such awful news - particularly as she seemed to be recovering well from cancer treatment.\u0027         Pictured: Debbie and John Zurick with their dogs. Police have opened a murder probeMr Zurick had hoped for a reconciliation and was deeply upset when he discovered his wife had a new boyfriend.Mrs Zurick, who is said to have been treated for cancer, is believed to have been shot when she returned to the cottage on Saturday with a female friend to collect some possessions and take care of the dog breeding business.Mr Ryan, a keen fisherman in his mid-sixties, is the great grandson of baronet Sir James Power, who was an Irish Liberal politician and governor of the Bank of Ireland and who died in 1877.He saw his own marriage to local head teacher Mary Stratton Ryan collapse several years ago.He and Mrs Ryan were close friends with the Zuricks and they had stayed at the Ryan home in 2011.         The Zuricks bought the property, where the Prime Minister spent some of his childhood, from Stanley for £440,000 in 2013A family friend said of Mr Ryan, who was unavailable for comment: \u0027Jamie is very well liked around here.\u0027I know that after his marriage broke down, Jamie went to live in Galway for a period before coming back. Jamie\u0027s ex-wife Mary is a picture restorer and a head teacher.\u0027But they are very private people, so nobody really knows what happened between him and his wife.\u0027Mr and Mrs Zurick bred and trained clumber iels and lived in their cottage where they were neighbours of Stanley Johnson, father of PM Boris.The Zuricks bought the property, where the Prime Minister spent some of his childhood, from Stanley for £440,000 in 2013.Stanley owns the neighbouring 14th century farmhouse on the Nethercote estate with his wife Jennifer. A third house on the estate is owned by the Prime Minister\u0027s sister Rachel.There are also a number of barns, which have been converted into properties, whose owners include Boris and his brother Leo.         Princess Anne, 69, expressed her sadness after learning that Debbie Zurick, who worked for her, had been shot dead. (Pictured second right with the Queen\u0027s daugthter is John Zurick, who allegedly shot his wife)A photograph on Mr Zurick\u0027s Facebook page from March 2016 appears to show Mr Johnson outside the cottage in Winsford, near Minehead, with one of the couple\u0027s dogs, also called Boris.Stanley this week told the Daily Mail: \u0027Both I and my whole family are shocked, stunned and saddened by this tragic incident.\u0027We very much regret the passing of Mrs Zurick. She was a neighbour and she was much loved.\u0027She was honorary secretary of the Working Clumber Spaniel Society and was much loved for the work she did, in the society and in Exmoor and beyond.\u0027The Zuricks were regulars at game shoots and were key figures in the Working Clumber Spaniel Society, of which Princess Anne is president.On the society\u0027s website, Mr Zurick describes how he trained Anne\u0027s dog Sparkle but received a rebuke from the princess when the hound failed to bring back a pheasant.Mr and Mrs Zurick had no children. Mr Zurick\u0027s son from his first marriage died in 1995, aged 17.Police have begun a murder investigation and are continuing to search the property but are not looking for anyone else in connection with the incident.Detective Superintendent Julie Mackay said: \u0027This is a very serious incident in which a woman has lost her life.

All of his SuperTuesday votes will go to Sleepy Joe Biden. Great timing. This is the REAL beginning of the Dems taking Bernie out of play - NO NOMINATION, AGAIN!\u0027 Axios quoted a Biden campaign official as saying that the former vice president and Buttigieg \u0027have exchanged voicemails\u0027 since news of the former mayor\u0027s departure broke, but have failed to reach each other by phone.          Insiders say Biden (pictured on Sunday) and Buttigieg have been trying to reach each other by phone since news of the latter candidate\u0027s departure broke         CNN obtained video of Buttigieg explaining his unexpected trip back to South Bend on SundayDespite robust organizations in Iowa and New Hampshire and supporters who included an influx of former independents and Republicans, Buttigieg failed to overcome daunting questions about his ability to draw African American support key to the Democratic base.He earned just three percent of the nonwhite vote in South Carolina\u0027s Saturday primary, according to AP VoteCast, a a wide-ranging survey of the electorate. As mayor of a city that is 25 percent black, Buttigieg faced criticism for firing the first African American police chief in the history of South Bend and for his handling of the case of a white police officer who fatally shot an armed black man in June.After his unexpected rise to contention in Iowa and New Hampshire last fall, Buttigieg became the target of Massachusetts Sen Elizabeth Warren for the high-dollar fundraisers he was hosting, notably one in a wine cave in California.Minnesota Sen Amy Klobuchar also went at Buttigieg in the months before the caucuses for lacking national experience. She noted that he had lost his only statewide race as a candidate for Indiana treasurer in 2010, while she had won three statewide terms in Minnesota in part by carrying Republican-heavy regions.Buttigieg presented a starkly different figure on the debate stage than the other leading candidates — all septuagenarians — and drew admirers for his calm, reasoned demeanor and rhetorical skills that reflected his Harvard-trained, Rhodes scholar background but that some voters and operatives described as \u0027robotic\u0027.He had modeled his campaign somewhat on that of former President Barack Obama, who won the 2008 Iowa caucuses largely based on a message of unity and by drawing in a healthy bloc of first-time caucus participants, often the key in a crowded, high-turnout contest.         Buttigieg planned to withdraw hours after Democratic candidates commemorated the 55th anniversary of the \u0027Bloody Sunday\u0027 civil rights march in Selma, Alabama. He is seen crossing the Edmund Pettus Bridge          Buttigieg also met former President Jimmy Carter for coffee on Sunday in GeorgiaButtigieg planned to withdraw hours after Democratic candidates commemorated a landmark civil rights march in Alabama on Sunday.Some worshippers at the African-American church where the event was held turned their backs on his presidential rival Michael Bloomberg, a billionaire who will first appear on ballots on Tuesday after skipping the first four contests.Bloomberg, a former New York mayor, received a chilly reception at the historic Brown Chapel AME Church in Selma after the pastor, the Rev Leodis Strong, told the gathering the billionaire businessman initially had turned down the invitation to speak.\u0027I was hurt, I was disappointed,\u0027 Strong said as Bloomberg looked on stonily. \u0027I think it\u0027s important that he came, and it shows a willingness on his part to change.\u0027About 10 people in the small church with a couple hundred in attendance stood up and turned their backs on Bloomberg as he spoke about racial inequality.Biden and Bloomberg are trying to present themselves as the party\u0027s best choice to take on Trump, saying Sanders, a self-described democratic socialist, is too far to the left to win the general election.Black voters are a key Democratic constituency, and Bloomberg has been criticized for supporting the use of a policing practice called stop and frisk in New York City that encouraged police to stop and search pedestrians and disproportionately affected blacks and Latinos. \u0027It\u0027s just an insult for him to come here. It\u0027s the disrespect for the legacy of this place,\u0027 Lisa Brown, who traveled to Selma from Los Angeles, told Reuters after turning her back to Bloomberg. She said the idea to protest Bloomberg\u0027s remarks had circulated but that she stood as an inidual, not an organized group.The quiet protest suggests Bloomberg faces an uphill climb with some African-American voters, who carried Biden to a resounding victory in South Carolina.Biden, who was vice president to the first black US president, Barack Obama, was clearly the favorite at the Selma church. He was seated by the pastor, facing the pews where Bloomberg sat, and got a glowing introduction from US Representative Terri Sewell, a black Alabama lawmaker.\u0027He has earned the right to be in this pulpit and to address you now,\u0027 Sewell told the crowd.The candidates were in Selma to mark the 55th anniversary of \u0027Bloody Sunday\u0027, when civil rights marchers were beaten by state troopers and local police while crossing a bridge.         Biden praised his South Carolina success in an interview with Fox News on Sunday (pictured)Some Democratic Party officials expressed concerns last week about Sanders\u0027 early surge, worrying that his aggressive policy priorities including establishing a mandatory government-run healthcare system could turn off moderate voters badly needed to defend competitive seats in Congress.\u0027I think the Democratic Party is looking for a Democrat - not a socialist, not a former Republican, a Democrat - to be their nominee,\u0027 Biden told Fox News Sunday.Biden\u0027s reference to a former Republican appears to have been aimed at Bloomberg, who switched parties multiple times in his career.Sanders attacked Biden for taking contributions from political organizations called Super PACs and billionaires, at what he said was the expense of working-class, middle-class and low-income people.\u0027I don\u0027t go to rich people\u0027s homes like Joe Biden,\u0027 Sanders said on CBS\u0027 Face the Nation.Biden lags Sanders in fundraising and organization in Super Tuesday states and beyond.Sanders planned to campaign on Sunday in heavily Democratic California, where he leads opinion polls.The Sanders campaign said overnight it raised $46.5million from more than 2.2 million donations in February, a huge sum dwarfing what any other Democratic candidate raised last year in any three-month period.Bloomberg continues to spend. He purchased three minutes of commercial air time during on broadcast networks CBS and NBC on Sunday evening to address the coronavirus outbreak.This is a developing story.  "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1e0c3c86fb53d27d84eaeb19f41d5cc833904a06/30_38_2924_1754/master/2924.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=63b63f7516948920fde11f76aeeba36c","title":"big picture dogs in cars martin usborne","story":"Martin Usborne’s expressive images capture the emotions of dogs left in carsThe photographer Martin Usborne believes the urgent idea to photograph dogs in cars came from a buried childhood memory. Aged three or four, he was left in a car in a supermarket car park not for long, maybe a few minutes, but long enough to wonder if his parents might not come back. The feeling never left him: “In a child’s mind, it is possible to be alone for ever.”Somehow, in his subconscious, that feeling of potential abandonment attached itself to animals. He was disturbed by the way humans might silence or confine animals, in zoos or on farms, even at home. Years later, he wanted to find a harmless way of photographing that feeling.How to do it? First, he wandered around his neighbourhood in east London looking for cars with a bit of cinematic glamour, then he left a note on the windscreen saying: “Can I photograph your car and put a dog in it?” To get the dogs, he sidled up to their owners in parks and asked them if he could put their dog in a car at night and photograph it in the name of art. He was astonished that most said yes.His new book contains nearly 50 of these set-ups.

Usborne had imagined the pictures would share a kind of noir-ish dread to match his infant fears. Some did, but in others the dogs relaxed or just settled down to nap.

Now, at 93, she is publishing what may be her last bookTrefan Morys is a low 18th-century barn, stone-built, slate-roofed, topped with a weather vane and surrounded by a dense tangle of garden beneath a towering elm tree. Jan Morris has lived here, halfway up a hill in the top-left corner of Wales, with Elizabeth, once her wife, now her civil partner, for the past 30 years. Before that they had raised their four children in the big manor house a little further down the lane toward Criccieth and the coast. Like everything about Jan Morris’s long and unique life there is a kind of storytellers’ magic to Trefan Morys. Last week, I drove up through Snowdonia and down toward the Irish Sea, to listen to some of Morris’s myths and legends, while the last of storm Dennis rattled outside.Hearing about most lives you have a sense of beginnings and middles and ends, but Morris’s 93 years resist very much in the way of this-led-to-that. It is a life that forms instead around improbable adventures a million miles from here – Morris, at 26, was the only journalist to accompany Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay on their 1953 ascent of Everest at other times she wrote about living on Field Marshal Montgomery’s family houseboat on the Nile, and in a palazzo on the Grand Canal she met Che Guevara in Cuba she visited Hiroshima after the bomb, and reported on the trial of Adolf Eichmann in 1961. In her dreamy books about cities – most memorably Venice and Trieste – the world can seem a permanent Xanadu.These unlikely journeys are nothing, though, in some ways, beside the defining romantic quest of her life. Jan Morris was born James Humphrey Morris on 2 October 1926, in Somerset. As she recalled in her memoir, Conundrum, “I was three or perhaps four when I realised that I had been born into the wrong body, and should really be a girl.” She was under a piano at the time, listening to her mother play Sibelius. Conundrum detailed a pioneering journey across a perilous internal border. A journey that involved years of hormone therapy and culminated in reassignment surgery in Casablanca in 1972, before a return here, to Llanystumdwy, to Elizabeth and to their children.From the vantage of 93, some of this life has started to seem like a foreign country to Morris. She still lives with Elizabeth, who suffers from dementia. Their youngest son, Twm, a poet, writing in Welsh, lives in a cottage across the road and “is a miracle”, Morris says, in the help he gives them. Jan does not travel very far these days, though her trusty Honda Sport R still sits ready for action on the gravel outside. Her books have shrunk in scope, too. The last two, the bestselling In My Mind’s Eye and her new book, Thinking Again, are composed of daily diary entries that unlock Morris’s storehouse of memory as they describe children in coffee shops or dogs on the beach at Pwllheli. The pace of those books is set by the 1,000 daily steps up and down the lane outside that she commits to as an exercise regime, and the marching tunes that she whistles as she goes. The tone is of someone who has seen the whole world and decided on this place as an ending.In the long, beamed sitting room of Trefan Morys, we talk first about the house itself. When they all lived down the road, the kids used to come and play here in the stables, overgrown with bramble. Later Jan and Elizabeth felt the big house was unmanageable, so they found a buyer, cleared out the horse stalls here, brought the books and bookcases from the other place, along with the weather vane, renovated and moved in.In the final diary entry of Thinking Again, Morris dwells on “hiraeth” that Welsh word that is often translated as nostalgia, but which she – half-Welsh, half-English, another hybrid – feels more like a national addiction to longing. “It is a different thing for Twm, for example,” she says. “I don’t have his instinct for Welshness, with him it is more basic, it comes out of the soil, for me it is more an idea.”While we talk, from time to time a small fluttering bird taps its beak on the window as if to gain entry. “Do you hear the bird tapping?” Morris asks. “It used to portend death didn’t it? We have it every day at different windows.”The tapping of the bird leads Morris into the first of a few apologies that she no longer has the eloquence she once did as an interviewee. “Sometimes I fear I am not exactly compos mentis,” she says. “It comes and goes. Like with Elizabeth. The other morning I was taking her breakfast on a tray and I fell, and there were cornflakes everywhere, and marmalade. I thought, well no good asking Elizabeth to help with this. But she came out, and miraculously was transformed into the real Elizabeth, and briskly helped me clear it all up beautifully. I said to her a few minutes later how encouraging she can still do that, but she could not remember what had happened.”Morris looks around her bookshelves, the thousands of books that line this long room floor to ceiling. “People always say: ‘Have you read them all?’” she says. “No. but I have an emotional attachment to them all. I pick an old book out and if it is interesting I read a few pages. I put letters and photographs and cards in them to find later.”Does she still get a lot of correspondence?“Mostly from people who go to Trieste or Venice and read my books, and say ‘What did you mean by that’? To be honest I’m not always sure.”As a wandering writer – she is widely acclaimed for inventing a way of writing about cities that blends history and imaginative description and a sort of psychology of place – Morris made much of herself being an outsider. In Conundrum she wondered whether her “incessant wandering” as a journalist for the Times and the  and freelance “had been an outward expression of my inner journey”. She has resisted the idea of biography, though she allowed Derek Johns, her former agent, to write her literary life, Ariel. In it he notes at one point how “it is interesting to consider that the move from male to female and the move from Englishness to Welshness were roughly concurrent”. She herself has suggested that she always favoured the “soft side” of her character more than “the hard side”, and that Wales was closer to that softness. She is reluctant to talk much about her adventure in gender, since she has said so much before. But I wonder simply if she has a sense of a before and after in the voice of her writing?“I don’t think my writing changed that much,” she says. “Except that perhaps I became a little more relaxed about it.”She gets up from her chair, remembering something.“I found a book the other day, which I thought might interest you. It was about the trilogy of books which was the centrepiece of my life really, I hesitate to say intellectually, but certainly emotionally.”This was the trilogy about the rise and fall of the British empire, which Morris wrote over a period of 10 years, beginning in 1968. The recently discovered notebook she shows me, is full of all her – or James Morris’s – original plans and schemes for the books: a carefully handwritten catalogue of dates and events, with sections on ideologies, politics, wars, cross-referenced to every nation under British rule. “I look at something like this and I think ‘Can that really have been me?’” she says.It feels like somebody else’s work?“It certainly does! I can’t fathom it. My tendency has been to jump in and tell stories. I had forgotten all of this.”The Pax Britannica trilogy demands the adjective “magisterial” more readily than just about any other series of books I can think of. It begins with the birth of Victorian ambition and ends with the death of Churchill. Written with all Morris’s characteristic brio it is a compulsive exploration of patriotism, of manly endeavour, which ends in elegiac retreat and submission. Morris began the books as James and ended them as Jan I wonder if that trajectory of tone in her history reflected that great change in her own life?Perhaps, Morris suggests, and shrugs. “But I should say I would never use the word change, as in “sex-change” for what happened to me. I did not change sex, I really absorbed one into the other. I’m a bit of each now. I freely admit it. There is obviously all of this debate about it all at the moment, but for me it was never a black and white thing. Never could be. It was a sort of instinct. A question of spirit almost. But that’s all in that book I wrote, isn’t it?”At one point in Conundrum, written in 1974, Morris wonders whether she might be simply ahead of her time, a premonition of gender fluidity to come. Whatever the case, she had a certainty about her “slow motion Jekyll and Hyde” that was all her own. When the transformation was complete in Casablanca, she writes “I had reached Identity” with a capital I. (Elsewhere she described it as “At-one-ment”). She pictures herself as Ariel, “a figure of fable and allegory” in pursuit of the “higher ideal that there is neither man nor woman”. Had the possibility of safe surgery not existed, she had no doubt she would “bribe barbers or abortionists, I would take a knife and do it myself, without fear, without qualms, without a second thought”.There is a wonderful moment in that book when she returned to Wales and went to the local shop for the first time as Jan. No one who knew her batted an eyelid, and very few have done since. Has she been surprised?Morris’s recent diaries are too wise to get bogged down in identity politics, and the disruptions of Brexit and Trump only rarely invade her thoughts. Once again, she offers a simple solution.“If you are not sure what you think about something, the most useful questions are these,” she says. “Are you being kind? Are they being kind? That usually gives you the answer.”She gets up from the sofa, inviting me to come and see the rest of the house. On bookcases and on desks and tables there are wooden scale models of ships from all over the world – those on the bookshelves relate to the books behind them – a sampan for books about south-east Asia and so on. On either side of the doorway are two bardic chairs awarded to Twm at Eisteddfods. On the ceiling there is the painted “eye of a poet” looking down.Propped against one wall is a photograph of the summit of Everest taken by the Indian air force who flew over the expedition as it made its last assault on the summit. Morris points out the place she climbed to at 22,000 feet. “That wasn’t a bad story was it?”I get her to remind me of the bones of it just to hear her tell it. When she was assigned by the Times, which sponsored the ascent, she had never climbed any mountain before. They had to work out a way of protecting their scoop and get it into the paper in time for the Queen’s coronation. Having hugged Hillary in congratulation, Morris scrambled down an ice field and sent a wire overnight with a pre-coded message. It read: “Snow conditions bad stop advanced base abandoned yesterday stop awaiting improvement.” This meant: “Summit of Everest reached on 29 May by Hillary and Tenzing.” Morris made a lot of friendships on the mountain and they all stayed in touch for the rest of their lives. She is now the last survivor from that last camp.Upstairs, we are joined once again by the tap-tapping bird at the window. Morris points out the huge pen-and-ink drawing she did of the islands of Venice, on which if you look very closely you can see their eldest son, Henry, heading back from school over the Accademia bridge, in the days when they lived in the city.In one corner of the loft room is Morris’s desk – “where the magic happens” – and behind it on the wall a portrait of a man in naval uniform. “Jack Fisher,” Morris says. “I am going to have an affair with him in the afterlife. I love him dearly.”Over the years, ever since Sir Robin Day bluntly asked Morris about her sex life in an interview on the BBC (about which she formally complained), she has batted away questions of lust, which she suggests has never been her thing. Part of that deflection has centred on her lifelong crush on the most unattainable of pin-ups: Admiral Jack Fisher, charismatic First Sea Lord of the British fleet in the Great War, a man who died six years before Morris was born.Morris wrote a book about Fisher in 2007, in which she noted that “I first set eyes on him in a photograph some time in the late 1940s, and knew at once that he was the man for me.” That image went with her up Everest in 1953 and on every adventure that followed. She ushers me into her bedroom where there is a poster-sized photograph of Fisher on the back of the wardrobe door and points outside to a small balcony where there are twin sculpted busts – one of her head, one of the admiral’s.“He is devilishly handsome,” I suggest.“No it’s not that,” she says. “But we will have our affair.”As she describes her writing life Morris admits to the selfishness that made it possible to undertake her great voyages of self-discovery. In a less than kind review of Conundrum when it came out in 1974, Germaine Greer, essaying misgivings about gender change that persist, wrote that “as Jan Morris plucks at your sleeve for a girlish heart to heart, you wonder about Elizabeth. Her unbroken silence is the truest measure of Jan Morris’s enduring masculinity.”Elizabeth was moved to respond to Greer, writing: “I am not very silent and certainly not anguished. The children and I not only love Jan very dearly but are very proud of her.”Jan and Elizabeth reaffirmed that love in a civil union ceremony in Pwllheli in 2008, witnessed by a local couple who invited them to tea at their house afterwards. “I made my marriage vows 59 years ago and still have them,” Elizabeth said at the time. “After Jan had a sex change we had to orce. It did not make any difference to me. We still had our family. We just carried on.”When they sold the big house the couple retained a small island in the neighbouring Dwyfor river where, in the manner of Welsh princes and poets, their ashes will be scattered together. The place will be marked with a slate headstone that is currently stored in a cupboard under the stairs, reading: “Here lie two friends, at the end of one life.”We walk around the house in order to see the statues of Admiral Jack and Jan staring into eternity on their pedestals, and Morris apologises for a fleeting lapse in memory as I question her a bit more about her fantasy man.“I am sorry to be so indistinct,” she says. “The truth is, you are talking to someone at the very end of things. I felt that first about two years ago. I felt it creeping up, and now I know I am approaching the end.” She has written elsewhere about how her spirit will haunt two places in particular – the banks of the river Dwyfor and the seafront in Trieste. I wonder whether she still thinks that. “Death?” she says. “I think of it as a blank.”Apart from Jack Fisher?“Apart from Jack Fisher!”We sit inside for a while at the long table that dominates the kitchen, eating some sandwiches for lunch that Twm has left under tinfoil. There is an Aga, and a Welsh dresser and a low shelf on which are arranged seven pots of homemade marmalade, a different one for each day of the week, which now represent Morris’s principal vice (up until two years ago she claimed to have drunk at least a glass of wine every day since the second world war, but has lapsed a little now).I suggest that there must be a part of her restless soul that misses the travel. Can she revisit those worlds by reading her own books?“I ashamed to say I do read my own books quite a bit,” she says, and laughs. “There are one or two good things. But then you also feel, oh do please stop going on…”Does she ever feel hemmed in here?“Never, no. The sea is just over there. I wouldn’t want to be entirely in the mountains. I go down to the sea most days. I suppose the day will come when I cannot drive the Honda. Then I suppose I will have to walk it.”Is she still managing to do her thousand daily steps?“I try. Quite often now it is a bit too much for me. But I try to do some exercise every day, the gods insist on it.”There is a lovely diary entry in the current book in which, with the weather raging outside, she determines to do her thousand steps indoors: “round and about the sofas I whistled my way, never pausing, left, right, left right… counting the paces on my fingers and sometimes bursting into song, until at last, breathless but triumphant, I reached the millennium on my thumb.”She is whistling an old show tune now while she is making coffee. I am reminded of the fact that for her Desert Island Discs with Sue Lawley all of Morris’s choices were songs by Irving Berlin. This went back to Morris’s first job as a trainee reporter on the Western Daily Press aged 16. She was sent to Bristol docks to meet a big band sent to entertain the US troops stationed there during the war. Berlin was with them. “He was terribly kind to me. So I have always thought of him ever since as the ideal American. I’ve always loved his songs anyway.”To prove the point, standing at the kitchen sink, Morris breaks into one of them. The voice that won her a choral scholarship to Oxford as a boy is cracked a bit now, but she can still carry a tune. The song is from the film This Is the Army, and she cuts to the rousing chorus, in marching time:Someday I’m going to murder the bugler!Someday they’re going to find him dead!And then I’ll get that other pupThe guy who wakes the bugler upAnd then spend the rest of my life in bed!“I find myself whistling that many mornings these days,” Morris says, “but then I always get up, of course.” She pauses for a bit, and concentrates on sorting out the kettle and the coffee and the mugs and the milk and takes care in bringing all of it over to the table. “Life has its problems,” she says, with a half-smile. “But it also has its delights.”• Thinking Again by Jan Morris is published by Faber, £16.99.

However, Encoded’s status as a supplier to the Bank was only revoked following media inquiries in December.The Bank immediately disabled the company’s access to a backup audio feed after the Times revealed the breach and said the company would have no part in future press conferences, calling the sale of access “wholly unacceptable” and saying the feed was “misused”.While no non-public information was revealed, the audio feed potentially allowed unidentified paying customers to hear the Bank governor Mark Carney’s market-moving words at press conferences as much as eight seconds ahead of rivals listening via other means – giving a potentially lucrative advantage.The revelation has dealt a blow to the Bank’s credibility in securing crucial national infrastructure and it faces scrutiny from MPs and an investigation by the Financial Conduct Authority. Mel Stride, the chair-elect of parliament’s Treasury select committee, said he expected the MPs to ask “searching questions” of the outgoing governor, Carney, and his replacement, Andrew Bailey, at hearings planned for this week after the ’s reports about the departure of multiple staff.The breach has prompted criticisms of a perceived lack of accountability at the Bank. It has also raised questions about why the potential for press conferences to be targeted in this way was not discussed in regular, confidential discussions between security bosses at the Bank and the European Central Bank, its eurozone counterpart.A person with knowledge of the ECB’s processes said the central bank detected similar targeting of press conferences by companies hoping to give traders an edge as early as two or three years ago, after spotting advertisements published on social media by unnamed companies. The ECB installed its own high-speed audio line in September 2019 in order to give equal access to anyone who wanted it at no cost.However, the Bank said it could find no record of a briefing on any such detections made by the ECB. The ECB declined to comment on its security procedures.Encoded Media is thought to be the supplier to the Bank whose access to the backup audio feed was revoked. Encoded Media’s two directors, Philip Wand and Tom Sillence, are directors of Statisma Group Holdings while also serving as directors of Microlatency. Encoded and Statisma are based in the same office, which was also listed on Microlatency’s website.Microlatency, which was put into liquidation in January 2019, specialised in “ultra-low latency delivery of key live events”, according to an archived version of the website www.microlatency. On the publicly available site, it said: “We use private networks. Not the internet.”The public website said: “We speed up the delivery process. You get to hear the news before others do.”The Times reported that Microlatency was selling access to the audio feed to hedge funds and other investors.Meanwhile, Statisma’s website states that it “started out in 2010 covering public events in the UK, such as Bank of England press conferences and UK parliament sessions”.Statisma’s ads said it allowed users “to hear him first”, according to a post before Mark Carney’s press conference on 7 November.In an emailed statement, Wand said Encoded or Statisma did not hijack audio feeds in any way. He said the companies paid to receive the feed directly from Bloomberg and that it was licensed to use it. He added that previous reports had “already caused economic loss to Encoded Media and Statisma, as well as considerable distress to its directors who run an entirely reputable small technology business with limited resources”.He said: “If we are quicker at delivering content to our clients, it’s only because we have the knowledge and technology to send that content, taken from the Bloomberg feed, to our clients faster than others.“Although we are not the subject of any investigation our preference is not to comment any further until the FCA have completed their inquiries and publish their findings. We are absolutely confident those findings will be that no breach of any law has occurred.”Wand did not comment on Microlatency, yet has consistently denied any sort of wrongdoing committed by Encoded Media linked companies. Sillence did not respond to requests for comment.A Bank spokesman declined to respond to detailed questions about the due diligence process used.

Cold temperatures can trigger the internal combustion engine in Volvo’s XC90 SUV, the Mercedes-Benz E Class executive car, and Kia’s Niro crossover.The Mitsubishi Outlander SUV, the UK’s bestselling plug-in last year, has an “EV” button that switches on “EV priority” mode. However, the internal combustion engine will kick in if the driver switches on the adaptive cruise control, to automatically maintain a safe distance from the car in front, or if the battery gets too hot or too cold in more extreme conditions.Jaguar Land Rover’s Range Rover and Range Rover Sport plug-ins will start their internal combustion engines if more power is required than the electric engine can provide alone, as will Porsche’s Cayenne. There are also speed limits on all-electric driving for BMW’s 2, 3 and 5 Series cars as well its Mini Countryman plug-in.The carmakers all carefully avoid making any incorrect claims on their products’ green credentials in their marketing materials. However, campaigners have criticised the emphasis in many brochures and advertisements on zero-emissions driving capabilities, when these may be difficult to achieve in normal use.Greg Archer, UK director at campaign group Transport \u0026amp Environment, said one leading carmaker “is conning its customers”, after it was approached by an unhappy owner of a plug-in hybrid. The group, which passed the correspondence to the , has been highly critical of plug-in hybrids, some of which it labels “fake EVs” because of their continued use of internal combustion engines.Separate data from the Miles Consultancy, which tracks fuel use by companies, found that in real life almost all plug-in hybrid cars failed to achieve the mileage found in lab tests, suggesting that many users do not charge them sufficiently. Updated analysis for the  of 1,388 plug-ins used over eight months found they achieved an average of more than 40 miles per gallon when using a mixture of petrol and electric power, only a third of the 127 miles per gallon advertised by their manufacturers.Last month the government said it plans to ban all hybrids from sale in the UK from 2035 or earlier, signalling that promoting battery electric cars with zero exhaust emissions was its priority. Buyers of plug-in hybrids could also risk being caught by tightening emissions limits in British cities.The prospect of a hybrid ban infuriated carmakers, who say the technology is the only way to cut emissions quickly. The carbon dioxide emissions of cars sold in the UK rose for the third consecutive year in 2019.Mike Hawes, chief executive of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, said: “Plug-in hybrids are an important and attractive stepping stone for people not yet suited or able to invest in a fully electric vehicle, giving the flexibility of zero-emission miles on urban commutes and extended range for longer, out-of-town journeys.“Drivers also have the peace of mind that the engine will kick in to provide the necessary boost if the battery level falls too low to deliver sufficient power for energy-intensive operations such as high-speed overtaking or windscreen de-icing, thus guaranteeing safety and the most efficient use of energy at all times.”Selling thousands of plug-in hybrids is also a key part of carmakers’ plans to meet tightening emissions limits and avoid heavy fines, and industry analysts expect a hybrid “price war” over the coming year as companies try to shift the cars in large volumes. Companies including Toyota, BMW and Daimler have bet heavily on hybrid technologies."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fff0b92754af5faf94d2be2c2bcd5ee238594d02/0_0_4402_2640/master/4402.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=986a6363eff62f4b173f2173dfa739d4","title":"labour leadership contest new factions","story":"Differences are becoming increasingly visible between the soft left, radical left and the orthodox leftThe Labour party has always been a broad church made up of many political traditions: from trade unionists, to free marketeers, to radical socialists. With each leader the makeup of the party has changed composition, bringing in new members and shifting old alliances. The Corbyn years saw a significant sea change in Labour’s internal politics, and the current leadership election is revealing new contours to Labour’s internal topology. Most important, we’re seeing the emergence of a distinctive, radical-left current that is democratic, green and internationalist in its socialist aspirations.Until 2015, there were four main factional tendencies in the Labour party: the “old right”, the “hard left”, the “soft left” and the Blairites. The old right – rooted in local government and union bureaucracies – has campaigned against radical socialism since the 1940s. The political crises of the 1980s saw the Labour left ide between the hard left of Tony Benn and the soft left led by Neil Kinnock (and, later, Ed Miliband). The soft left wanted to update socialism for a post-industrial age, to expel Trotskyist factions from the party, and to make whatever accommodations it took to win elections. The hard left remained committed to the radical policy agenda developed in the 1970s, despite waning support for traditional socialism among the electorate. The Blairites, advocating free markets and globalisation, emerged as a distinctive section of the party elite in the 1990s, but never had an enthusiastic base among members they always relied on support from the old right and the soft left to carry out their agenda.Under Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership, the lines separating these factions blurred and shifted. Several of his senior staff and union supporters came from, or maintained close links with, the hardest sections of the hard left, such as the tiny Communist party of Britain. But much of Corbyn’s activist base – and allied projects such as The World Transformed, Novara and Red Pepper – have occupied a different political space: green, libertarian, pluralistic and democratic. This “radical left” has always been ideologically closer to the most progressive strands of the soft left (such as Compass), which in turn backed Corbyn throughout his leadership, even while more conservative sections of the soft left peeled away to back Owen Smith in 2016. The organisation set up in 2015 to defend Corbyn’s leadership – Momentum – has always contained elements from all of these tendencies.In fact, it’s clear now that the old ision between the soft and hard left has been giving way for some time to a new distribution of positions. While all three tendencies pulled together under Corbyn, the differences are becoming increasingly visible between the soft left, radical left and a new “orthodox left” as the Labour leadership election progresses.Keir Starmer’s success in the leadership race so far has been in winning the support of the traditional soft left, which still constitutes a large proportion of party members. Despite the failures of both Kinnock and Miliband, their default assumption remains that progressive government can be achieved by selling moderate social democracy to the electorate, led by a guy in a smart suit. At the same time, the old right and the Blairites have all accepted that, for now, they can only gain influence by backing a soft-left contender such as Starmer. Nandy has pitched herself at times to the soft left, at times to the old right and so has won significant support from neither.Linked to the leadership of unions such as Unite and the RMT, the orthodox left back Long-Bailey as Corbyn’s anointed successor. Under any other leader, their influence will drastically decline. The orthodox left still basically wants to implement the Communist party’s 1951 plan, The British Road to Socialism, with its vision of socialism being implemented in one country by a strong, centralised national government. They lean heavily towards a pro-Brexit position, while tending to interpret support for Brexit among working-class voters as incipient class consciousness rather than tabloid-inspired xenophobia.The radical left is still a very new, fragile and inexperienced tendency that has a long way to go before emerging as a mature political formation. It brings together the more libertarian strands of the hard left, the more radical strands of the soft left, and a new generation of activists from outside the traditions of the Labour party. Clive Lewis’s short-lived leadership campaign was the most obvious expression to date of the desire of some Labour members to express a distinctive left position that is more green, more internationalist, more democratic and less tied to traditional Labourism than that of the orthodox left. Long-Bailey shares much common ground with this tradition, having championed Labour’s plans for a green industrial revolution she has since got further by backing open selections. But it is mainly out of sheer loyalty to her mentor, John McDonnell, that most of the radical left have supported her.This is an uneasy alliance. Privately, many on the radical left agree with former MP Alan Simpson that the dogmatic and authoritarian tendencies of the orthodox left smothered the creative and democratic potential of Corbynism, contributing to its eventual downfall. For example, the leadership of Unite and other unions have opposed open selections of parliamentary candidates, preferring to bolster their own direct influence over candidate selections, despite democratisation of the party being Corbyn’s first promise to his followers, and Momentum’s major demand. On the other hand, there seems little chance of the radical left becoming anything more than a fringe movement unless it maintains its effective coalition with the orthodox left: the latter being far more established and empowered at the level of effective institutions, from Unite to the Morning Star.But for that coalition to be maintained, the radical left may need to find its own distinctive organisational voice. Whether that will take the form of some new formal network or actual membership organisation, or whether the radical left will remain a loose affiliation of activists and alternative media, remains to be seen. But even in the very likely event of a Starmer victory, it is hard to see a future in which Labour confronts the real challenges of our time – the climate emergency and the breakdown of representative democracy – without the energy of the radical left driving it forward.This radical left is not a brand new phenomenon. In many ways it inherits the legacy of the New Left of the 1960s, and traditions of radical democratic socialism going back to the 19th century. But arguably its egalitarian, libertarian worldview is now shared by more people – especially younger people – than at any previous time, both in the UK and the US. One of the most distinctive features of the movement to elect Bernie Sanders has been its embrace of just this participatory, horizontal, green and libertarian politics (just compare his position on drugs policy to those of the Labour leadership contenders). This is the shape of 21st-century socialism.Labour suffered a terrible electoral defeat in 2019, but it still won more votes than at any election since 2001, and the recovery of its activist culture and support among young people has been remarkable. These gains were all won by the energy and imagination of the radical left, and they will have to be maintained and built on if Labour is ever to form a government again. Any future leadership will have to include elements and ideas that can represent this tendency and give it room to grow.• Jeremy Gilbert is professor of cultural and political theory at the University of East London and the author of Twenty-First Century Socialism"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c904479c2d99561fd907e86872e93cfdc40fba22/0_135_5176_3107/master/5176.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2b87c4c67e97a5cc7ddc697d8af5895a","title":"older women going blind giant cell arteritis","story":"Fifty years ago I witnessed how the NHS discriminates against older women. More recently, I have experienced it myself as part of what should be a national scandal – but it isn’t because it happens mainly to old women, so it’s tucked away on the health pages of newspapers or on specialist programmes.When I was a teenager, I volunteered with friends to visit patients at my local hospital, the Victoria in Blackpool. We were sent to the female orthopaedic ward. It was a miserable place. The women just lay there I never witnessed anyone receiving physiotherapy or any other form of therapy. It was the sort of place you would never wish to end up.But quite soon after, I was put in that ward myself after breaking my leg in my early 20s. If I had thought it was depressing by day, by night it was the stuff of nightmares. The youngest woman after me was in her late 60s. The women were so unhappy they used to wail at night. You had to shout if you wanted a nurse the nurses came intermittently and, when they did, regularly complained that the women were disturbing them.For all the faults in the system I have helped to expose as a journalist, I honestly thought it would have been better to be an older woman in the NHS today than it was 50 years ago. Yet my own experience shows that there is still massive prejudice against older people, including women.I have an auto-immune disease that older people get: giant cell arteritis (GCA). It’s at least three times more common in women than men. It’s the most common form of adult vasculitis – inflammation of blood vessels – and affects thousands of people. It often starts with terrible headaches and scalp tenderness, and sometimes with disturbance in the eyes. The cause is abnormally large cells that develop in the arteries, most commonly in the temporal arteries on the side of the head. As the inflammation moves up the head, the jaw can become severely stiff. If the inflammation goes higher, it can press on the optic nerve at the back of the eye, causing permanent sight loss or even complete blindness.I have met elderly women who lost their sight through this illness, which is treatable, because the NHS failed them. In the past year, I have learned of two older people who took their own lives after they learned their total blindness could have been prevented with the right treatment. Going blind is terrible. Going blind when it didn’t need to happen is unbearable.The correct treatment is to give a patient with the recognised symptoms an immediate high dose of steroids to bring down the inflammation and protect their eyesight. Blood tests should be taken and the patient referred very quickly on a fast-track system to a rheumatology hospital department, ideally on the same day, but definitely within three days so that diagnosis can be confirmed and treatment started. If a patient has suffered any sight loss, they should be referred the same day to hospital. But this is often not what happens.Regularly GPs fail to diagnose or, if they do, they fail to give a high dose of steroids. That’s what happened to me. When I developed severe symptoms, my GP told me, after looking the condition up on Google, to take a lower dose of steroids and gave me her phone number on a piece of paper to ring her if I started losing my sight. Of course, if I had started going blind, you might wonder how I would have been able to read that piece of paper.Luckily, my sister is a doctor and, as I had a steroid prescription for a related condition, she told me to take a large dose at once. Within less than an hour the inflammation went down. My sight was saved but I was so appalled that I became a trustee of the charity for the disease. What I have discovered as a result is nothing less than a national scandal but, because it is mainly older women who are affected, it is just accepted.If hundreds of children were losing their sight for no good medical reason, it would be on the front page of every paper. Somehow, old women losing their sight doesn’t seem to be a scandal. Hey, we’re getting on we should expect horrible things to happen to us medically. It’s not like most of us are economically active, so who cares? Of course, the extra scandal about all of this is that elderly people who lose sight become a burden on health and care services. A study showed that saving the sight of people with GCA actually saves the health service money.This makes me so angry. We patients are given constant excuses as to why it isn’t happening. But we know we would get the right treatment if we were younger. Fifty years on from when I lay in that ghastly ward watching old women lie untreated until they died, I see the same prejudice and ageism in the health system today.• Dorothy Byrne is head of news and current affairs at Channel 4 and vice-chair of PMRGCAuk"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7d3ab934a1763f60ed09f584daf917dba15b1daf/0_248_4256_2554/master/4256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3f7eaa470d35143af40ca40c56bf320a","title":"sir philip rutnam priti patel","story":"The way in which the Home Office’s permanent secretary quit was unprecedented, and will have far-reaching consequencesSenior officials in the civil service tend to avoid the limelight. Sometimes they emerge in front of select committees, and occasionally they give speeches or make set-piece appearances in their department. It was therefore an astonishing move for the permanent secretary of the Home Office, Sir Philip Rutnam, to hold a press conference on Saturday to announce his resignation.But the fact of Rutnam’s appearance in front of the cameras paled in comparison to what he had to say. “I regret I do not believe her,” he declared, in reference to Priti Patel’s denials that she had been involved in a briefing campaign against him. These are extraordinary words for a permanent secretary to be using about his political boss. To announce that he intended to bring a case of constructive dismissal made it all the more incredible.The Home Office has seen plenty of internal dramas, of course. In the 1990s the departure of the head of the Prison Service, Derek Lewis, led to an infamous Newsnight interview of the home secretary, Michael Howard, by Jeremy Paxman. Another Home Office permanent secretary, Sir John Gieve, lost the trust of his boss, Charles Clarke, after a series of institutional failings in the early 2000s, with both Gieve and later Clarke moving on from the department. Then there was the departure of Brodie Clark, who resigned as head of the Border Agency after falling out with the then-home secretary, Theresa May. Both Lewis and Clark also looked to resolve their cases through employment tribunals.But it was the manner of Rutnam’s resignation that has so shocked Whitehall and the watching media, not the fact that he is leaving the department. It is not unknown for a permanent secretary and secretary of state to fall out, even when it’s as badly as Patel and Rutnam seem to have done. But it really is unknown for it to end up in quite such an explosive resignation statement, let alone for an outgoing permanent secretary to bring a case of constructive dismissal.The war of words will doubtless continue. Rutnam has said he does not believe the home secretary was innocent of briefing against him and has set out allegations about her treatment of Home Office staff. In turn, Rutnam has been accused of failures in managing the department, and his leadership is expected to come under heavy criticism in the forthcoming review of the Windrush scandal. The government’s view seems to be that the home secretary’s tough approach is the right one, and that the departure of Rutnam will help Patel to institute changes in how the department operates and make progress on policy.The case also raises the question of what constitutes acceptable behaviour by ministers. The Ministerial Code is unambiguous: “There must be no bullying and no harassment.” Any court case, while probably unlikely, would draw out what that looks like in practice: what is robust debate and strong leadership, and what crosses the line? The media are often quick to jump on any signs of ministers falling out with their officials. These stories are frequently overblown, and it is worth remembering that elsewhere ministers and officials are working very hard and very closely to tackle the impact of coronavirus.But Rutnam has been quite specific in his complaints and made a point of saying that he hoped his resignation would send a message and protect other staff. This suggests wider concerns, and there have indeed been other stories about unacceptable behaviour, some of which has been directed at political advisers.Civil service accountability will also come under scrutiny. Ministers have long complained that they have little control over staffing and that poor performance can go unaddressed. There is likely to be renewed debate about whether those officials who lead departments should be political appointees, as they are in many countries.Then there are questions for both the cabinet secretary and the prime minister. How well did Sir Mark Sedwill handle the situation and should he have done more at an earlier stage? Did the prime minister sufficiently encourage the home secretary to resolve any tension and avoid this outcome? Even if Rutnam’s critics are happy that he has gone, No 10 is likely to want to avoid any repeats of his explosive exit.The government may accept some collateral damage is necessary to make progress with its agenda, but in the end it needs the civil service to concentrate on delivery, not drama.• Catherine Haddon is senior fellow at the Institute for Government"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0711a33bf291a886f5b054b79b80220207191264/1083_1288_4341_2605/master/4341.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7ca4131324b64a74f8af7a000fb03f48","title":"stop a worry becoming catastrophic how to talk to your kids about the coronavirus","story":"They hear our fears and share them. And they need our help to work it all outI was a the park with my kids a few weekends ago when I heard a group of boys, maybe eight or so years old, talking on the play equipment.“Have you heard about the coronavirus?” asked one as they swung in lazy circles around the spinning wheel.“Do you know how many people have died? Like, 50!”There was murmured agreement that this was indeed a lot of people and then, in the whimsical way of kids, they moved on to another topic.I, on the other hand, was stunned. How did a group of Australian schoolchildren living in a country town half a world away know anything about an outbreak of disease that was, at that time, largely confined to China? And why did they care?The answer is simple of course: they inhabit the same world we do. They hear and see the news, they use social media. They overhear our conversations. And they talk.They care because they hear our fears and they share them. And they need our help to work it all out.There will soon be no avoiding having to talk to your kids about the novel coronavirus, with the Covid-19 outbreak now spreading to every continent of the globe and entering a new, potentially pandemic phase. There are wall-to-wall media coverage, daily updates from our chief medical officer and government, and conversation about the virus is everywhere. It’s inescapable.For many kids, face masks are becoming a familiar sight if you’re in eastern Australia and lived through the summer of hazardous bushfire-related smoke this is even more likely to be the case. Quarantines and lockdowns, transport stoppages, school closures and other major disruptions to routine are already being seen in other countries and may soon become a fact of life here. Family, friends, teachers, even children themselves, may become sick.Parents too often assume that their children are oblivious to world events or are too young to understand what it all means. We don’t want to frighten them by talking to them about it, and that is especially true when we ourselves have a sense of trepidation about what the future holds or aren’t sure what to say.But children, particularly younger ones, think about and process the world in a way that can make them more vulnerable. Concepts of time, place and distance are nebulous. A child can see the same footage of an event over and over, and believe that every instance represents a cumulative threat, with no timeframe for resolution.Unless you explain that the images they are seeing or stories they have heard are, for the moment, from places far away from here, it can seem immediate and frightening. Context, proportion and reassurance are so important.If you seem worried or preoccupied, they will pick up on that and may be afraid to bring it up with you. Dread brings with it shame and embarrassment, and a simple worry can become catastrophic, leading to avoidance, withholding of information and withdrawal, particularly if their questions are dismissed or minimised. Speak the unspeakable.I asked a child psychiatrist, Dr Karen Gaunson, and a children’s media literacy expert, Saffron Howden, for their thoughts on how to talk to kids about the coronavirus outbreak.

Having joined Chelsea from Doncaster Rovers Belles she was deemed “not ready” by Emma Hayes and sent on loan to Liverpool.When asked about her path to the top, England joked: “How long have you got? Honestly, everyone’s journey is different, I can’t say mine has been easy. It’s just been a long old roll. I have always been a grafter, my parents brought me up to never give up and be a worker, and thankfully I am getting results.”Her fighting spirit seems reflective of a wider mood within the Chelsea squad. In the Women’s Super League they have come from behind nine times to grab a result – six of them wins – and they remain unbeaten. It was that never-say-die attitude that ensured heads did not bow on Saturday when Leah Williamson struck an equaliser for Arsenal in the 85th minute.“Erin Cuthbert literally pulled me and said: ‘Just bring it, I know you have got something else in you,’” said England, who struck again at the death to secure her first major trophy with Chelsea.But there was no time to celebrate. Straight after the match the striker and the other members of Phil Neville’s England squad travelled to Gatwick for a flight to Orlando, where the Lionesses face the USA in their SheBelieves Cup opener on Thursday.“Without doubt her and Ellen White are the best two centre-forwards in England on form and she rightly deserves her place in the squad,” Neville said last month. She has surely played her way into his starting XI.“I really think England have got a player that can add something to them going to the next stage,” Hayes said of a forward who missed out on the World Cup squad last year despite finishing the season as Chelsea’s top scorer.“I’d be buzzing if we could bring the trophy back,” England added. “The performances at the back-end of last season weren’t a credit to how well I know this England team can play, so fingers crossed we go out there as a team and absolutely smash it.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c43e9649bf38249930189b8e8763a44810a99a0c/246_174_2439_1463/master/2439.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=103624f1c0aba9fa244b2f3d9ca612af","title":"everton manchester united premier league match report","story":"There was no need for Ole Gunnar Solskjær to issue a public apology after this visit to Goodison Park but the preservation of Manchester United’s unbeaten run, and with it their hopes of Champions League qualification, was thanks to VAR as well as another injection of quality from Bruno Fernandes.“You’re just hoping, fingers crossed, they make a decision that benefits you,” Solskjær said after the highly eventful draw. Given Carlo Ancelotti’s anger after the final whistle, and the red card that greeted the Everton manager’s red mist, they certainly did that.Everton believed they had soured Solskjær’s visit to Goodison yet again when their improved second‑half display led to David de Gea being beaten for a second time in the dying moments. Dominic Calvert-Lewin’s shot had deflected in off Harry Maguire with De Gea wrong-footed and the offside Gylfi Sigurdsson lifting his legs out of the way of the ball as it trickled in.The assistant referee spotted Sigurdsson’s quick thinking and awarded what would have been a 93rd‑minute winner only for VAR to rule the Everton midfielder was in De Gea’s line of sight and interfering with play. Sigurdsson was sat on the ground, having been fouled after shooting at the United goalkeeper, with De Gea standing above him. The incident was replayed on the giant television screens inside the stadium and Goodison erupted in fury at the latest subjective call and controversy involving VAR. It was left to the referee, Chris Kavanagh, to face the wrath of Ancelotti and the Goodison faithful on the pitch while the VAR referees in Stockley Park, Jon Moss and Edward Smart, turned off their monitors for the day.There could be little argument over the merits of the draw, however. United recovered impressively from a dreadful early error from De Gea, who gifted Calvert-Lewin his 15th goal of the season, and levelled when new signing Fernandes swept a shot from long range past Jordan Pickford too easily. Everton had the upper hand in the second half but both sides could have won in stoppage time only for the two goalkeepers to redeem themselves with vital saves. Last season United capitulated 4-0 in the heaviest defeat of Solskjær’s reign.Here they delivered the response he demanded, although De Gea’s form remains a cause for concern. The United keeper’s latest mistake arrived with only 160 seconds gone when he received a pass from Maguire and, seemingly unaware of the closing presence of Calvert-Lewin, delayed his clearance for too long.The Everton striker stuck out his foot when the clearance was finally taken and was repaid by De Gea’s kick striking the underside of his boot and flying in. It was the seventh goalkeeping mistake that has led directly to a goal from De Gea since the start of last season, the joint worst record in the Premier League. For the slapstick nature of the opener, and it was greeted with laughter as much as delight by the home fans, it was rather fitting that an Everton No 9 should be on the scoresheet on the 40th anniversary of the death of William Ralph “Dixie” Dean.The bona fide legend died at Goodison after a Merseyside derby. Calvert-Lewin almost scored a second in the fourth minute when a simple long ball from the recalled Michael Keane managed to pierce a static United defence. The striker left Victor Lindelof in his wake and steered a first-time shot towards the far corner only for de Gea to deliver a timely reminder of his quality with a fingertip save.Everton threatened to bypass Lindelof and Maguire at will in the opening exchanges. The danger soon evaporated, however, as United began to dominate possession and cut the supply line to Calvert-Lewin and Richarlison. Fernandes, floating between Everton’s rigid defensive and midfield lines, was central to the recovery. Nemanja Matic swept the visitors’ first chance against the crossbar after being picked out on the edge of the area by Fred, stationed on the left of Solskjær’s midfield diamond.Ancelotti was growing visibly irritated at his team’s inability to retain possession and his problems increased when Seamus Coleman hobbled off with a muscle injury. Coleman’s replacement, Djibril Sidibé, managed to remember to wear both socks this time – unlike when coming on against Crystal Palace – but he still made a clumsy introduction. Sidibé conceded possession with a wayward pass inside Theo Walcott, who was caught flat-footed, and United pounced ruthlessly.Matic released Fernandes in space and, with no Everton defender near, the attacking midfielder drilled an emphatic finish inside Pickford’s near post from 25 yards. Fernandes’s shot swerved and dipped just in front of the England international but, with Gareth Southgate looking on from the directors’ box, Pickford should not have been beaten so easily. Another goalkeeping error to balance things up. A procession of bookings diminished the game as a spectacle although Everton played with greater energy and control after the break. Sigurdsson struck a post with a free-kick while United threatened on the counter-attack.The excellent Leighton Baines prevented Fernandes finding Odion Ighalo in front of goal and the United substitute was thwarted in injury time when Pickford, having tipped away a Fernandes chip, threw himself in the way of the striker’s rebound. There was still time for Richarlison to set up Sigurdsson for a low shot that De Gea saved with his legs. Then VAR made its presencefelt yet again."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/92794ae26ad7ba709a13b8fdc2d4e607b0859ab8/0_40_3400_2040/master/3400.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d97fdeb4faed0b064aaaa03e33d49b7f","title":"real madrid barcelona la liga match report","story":"After a wait of 1,954 days, the Santiago Bernabéu saw Barcelona defeated. Through the rain they watched as Vinícius Júnior scored the goal that changed everything: a night, that had begun nervously, and perhaps the destination of the title race too. For almost an hour they had suffered, as if awaiting the inevitable against a side seemingly sure of its superiority, but now they celebrated. At the end Marcelo slipped to his knees and the arena leapt to its feet, symbolic of what this meant.The reaction after that first hour began with a shot from Isco, flying just over via Marc-André ter Stegen’s glove, before Vinícius gave Madrid a lead that Mariano Díaz doubled on the final whistle, as if to underline how fast things can change and Zinedine Zidane’s seemingly superhuman ability to revive footballers. Mariano had not played a single minute this season and had been on the pitch only 30 seconds but now he scored.Madrid had been on edge, Barça presented with the chance to tip them over and into the abyss, virtually ending their hopes of winning the league days after Manchester City had seemed to do the same in Europe. Perhaps that, too, will feel different now. Madrid are back on top and suddenly infused with life, electricity running through them.Barcelona had flatlined, their plan failing. They had appeared in control, rarely troubled, but when Madrid rebelled and this place burst into life they could not live with it. Unexpectedly they were overrun, the way the game and their world had been turned upside down expressed in the moment, with five minutes to go, that Lionel Messi took down Casemiro. It spoke of frustration: Messi had been stopped brilliantly by the Brazilian. He had also passed up two great chances and by then knew defeat was coming. What no one imagined then was that it would be by two goals. It hurt enough already.Quique Setién had said Barcelona would seek to dominate possession and that this game was more important for Madrid, two points behind at the top and in what Zidane had described as a “delicate position”. His team appeared to be playing with that – as if Barcelona had time, content for Madrid to feel the pressure build, the need to win drawing them into decisions that could cost them. Ultimately though, the clock worked against Barcelona, not Madrid – a team you should never leave alive.Isco had won a corner after 53 seconds but that immediately gave way to a two-minute long period of Barcelona possession which was an early indication of the way things would be. Slowly Barcelona took control – and slowly was often the word, playing up and playing back again, hold and wait, pass and then pass some more. The control was theirs and opportunities would eventually be, until it suddenly slipped away from them in the second half.Up until the opening goal Vinícius had dashed often but decided poorly, Madrid able to create little, quick but lacking clarity. Barcelona dominated but the chances which eventually arrived were wasted. Antoine Griezmann shot over, set up by Jordi Alba and Messi. Arturo Vidal was sent through but he gave the ball up for Griezmann who did the same for Messi, and his snapshot was saved easily. Then suddenly Arthur went clean through, outrunning Toni Kroos – not the fastest of foot races – only to be denied by Thibaut Courtois. And soon afterwards Sergio Busquets’ wonderful clipped ball left Messi alone. He brought it down and, as it bounced back up, sidefooted goalwards. Again Courtois saved.When the game changed, it came from, of all things, a short corner from which Isco drew a fabulous save from Ter Stegen. This place and this team, which had mostly watched the game go by, appeared awakened. Piqué had to scramble Isco’s header off the line and Karim Benzema volleyed just over as Barcelona lost their grip and the ball, the momentum Madrid’s and the noise rising.Soon it was off the scale. Kroos slipped the ball through for Vinícius, running into the area. Piqué stood off, not advancing until it was too late. Perhaps he was waiting for Vinícius to make the mistake for him. Instead he did, the Brazilian’s shot going in at the near post off his leg.The roar then was matched by the one that greeted Marcelo and Raphaël Varane cutting off Messi when he ran through. Marcelo punched the air and roared. They all did."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/338fc86a3707db058fb7592bca332bc0959c7a4a/0_122_3693_2217/master/3693.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=630c9bbf33d3c6efad4cc7538b293577","title":"david beckhams inter miami lose first ever mls match to los angeles fc","story":"David Beckham’s Inter Miami slipped to defeat in their first ever MLS match with a 1-0 loss at Los Angeles FC.Miami, competing in the Eastern Conference, signed Scotland international forward Lewis Morgan from Celtic in January but the majority of their squad is made up of players who have plied their trade in America.Beckham’s side, managed by two-time CONCACAF Champions League winner Diego Alonso, showed flashes of promise on their first outing against a strong LAFC unit.LAFC only played their first MLS game in March 2018 but have reached the play-offs in each of their first two seasons in the league. And the hosts, managed by former long-serving USA head coach Bob Bradley, looked to assert their dominance in the opening stages at the Banc of California Stadium.Former Arsenal and Real Sociedad forward Carlos Vela crossed to Diego Rossi after five minutes, but his header across goal was acrobatically saved by goalkeeper Luis Robles - who joined Inter after making 238 appearances for New York Red Bulls.LAFC had the ball in the net four minutes later only for Mark-Anthony Kaye’s goal to be ruled out for offside against Rossi. Miami began to grow into the contest and forced former Holland international Kenneth Vermeer into a smart save after 37 minutes, ing to his left to deny Matias Pellegrini.But Vela, on his 31st birthday, produced a piece of inidual brilliance to give LAFC the lead on the stroke of half-time, dancing his way to the edge of the area before executing a sublime chip over Robles.The hosts thought they had doubled the lead 30 seconds into the second half but Rossi was denied by the offside flag once again.

Ask yourself: is everybody’s screen time under control? Also ask if it is interfering with other social interactions perhaps activities you may want to do as a family? If it is, then think about reducing it.Have a plan and stick to it, so that everybody understands when they’re allowed screen time and when they should stop. Think about your own media use, as it is important that everyone, including the adults in the home, adhere to these agreed boundaries. For instance, if you’ve decided as a family that you won’t have any screens at the dinner table, you all have to abide by that.Prioritising face-to-face interaction, especially before children go to sleep, can make bedtime easier, as they tend to feel more relaxed.If the child is displaying defiant behaviour around screens by, for example, refusing to stop watching and come to dinner, that points to a wider parenting issue of applying boundaries.Dr Max Davie is an officer for health improvement at the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/75e3c457d44747ba44583579a6bc02cb34b6761e/0_1317_3678_2206/master/3678.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4ffda517a82167431f1995714da43140","title":"cornershop tjinder singh brexit morrissey music england garden","story":"Three decades since the band formed, Cornershop’s genre-defying political music is still making a stand. Ahead of a new album, we join them on a visit back home to the Black CountryTjinder Singh, the frontman of Cornershop, hasn’t been home for nearly a decade. To get to Wednesfield in the West Midlands, you drive east out of Wolverhampton past the Slade Rooms, named after the town’s beloved glam-rock band along the dual carriageways that were never fully completed in the 1980s then to a dilapidated high street, kept quiet by austerity and out-of-town retail barns.“My mother worked there,” Singh says from the passenger seat, pointing out a rusty factory gate behind a scrappy field. “Me and the other Asian kids used to play cricket there too – that’s how everybody knew us.”Then we’re on the street where Singh lived with his late parents and three siblings in a simple, 1960s semi. Today a blue van is parked outside the garage where Singh and his bandmate Ben Ayres used to rehearse when visiting Singh’s family (Ayres, driving our hire car, is also on the trip today).The house next door to Singh’s, however, is a more arresting sight. An enormous George Cross flag hangs from the upstairs window, huge capitals in the middle of it, spelling out “England”. Singh gets out of the car, and takes a photo of it. “Bloody hell. Well, there we are then,” he says, as we head down the road.With eight albums of genre-skipping, pop history-foraging beauty behind them, Cornershop are one of Britain’s most inventive bands of the past 30 years. Their best-known song remains the glorious, once-ubiquitous Brimful of Asha, which entered the charts at No 1 in February 1998, knocking off Celine Dion’s Titanic theme song, My Heart Will Go On. Propelled by Norman Cook’s sped-up remix, its success felt like a victory for the little guys in Cool Britannia, especially as it eventually went double platinum.Cornershop’s ninth LP, England Is a Garden, comes out next week. It’s a glorious affair, 10 years in the making, some songs inspired by Singh’s Black Country upbringing, others driven, as always, by his and Ayres’s love of glam rock, psychedelia and Punjabi folk and pop music. It’s deeply political too, as all Cornershop’s music has been. Take St Marie Under Canon, their new single and the album’s opener. To a bouncy Hammond organ riff and four-to-the-floor Motown beat, the lyrics reference armies approaching (“the march of black boots”), the effects of Indian colonialism, and how the modern world further amplifies the echo chambers of opinion.The Observer’s photographer takes pictures of Singh and Ayres outside an atmospheric old garage at the end of Singh’s road – a tree grows through its middle old signs rust on the walls. It’s near the cornershop where Singh used to buy bubblegum with his siblings. “Anglo Bubblies, they were called. The shop’s got a new front, but that’s about it. I feel properly weirded out. It hasn’t changed much at all around here since my childhood.”We decamp to the Dog and Partridge, where Singh used to drink in his late teens. (Elder Asians never did: “We were stepping out.”) This Tuesday afternoon, it’s full of silent white men cradling pints a mid-80s pop compilation plays Sinitta’s Toy Boy and Samantha Fox’s Touch Me.We sit by the dartboard, and Singh orders a tuna jacket potato with chips. He’s still reeling from seeing the flag. “Everything goes back to Enoch Powell – that’s Brexit stage one,” he says. Powell was MP for Wolverhampton South West in 1968, the year of his “rivers of blood” speech, and the year that Singh was born. (Singh’s father, a headmaster back in India, had moved to Britain in 1965, working on the buses in London while retraining to become a teacher Singh’s mother followed with his older brother, before having him.)“My uncle was in Wolverhampton before us, and he’d said to my dad, come here, it’s all right. But my father said to me once: they’ll not always want you here in this country. That’s always stuck with me. And that’s why our songs have always reflected that right from the start.”Cornershop’s story as a band begins at Lancashire Polytechnic in 1987, when Singh and Ayres were put in a house-share together. They formed a band called General Havoc (“as a distraction to our very cold and damp living conditions,” Singh says) before forming Cornershop with Singh’s brother Avtar and drummer David Chambers in 1991 (they scaled down to a two-piece in 1997). Singh had grown up listening to Punjabi folk music (the Bhujhangy Group, a popular bhangra band from nearby Handsworth, were a favourite) before being exposed to bands like the Smiths and the Stooges. Ayres’s family had emigrated to the UK from Canada when he was nine. He fondly remembers a British uncle introducing him to Beatles’ songs, as well as Otis Redding, Pink Floyd and Bob Dylan.By his teens, Singh was becoming aware of the Black Country’s particular contributions to rock music too. England Is a Garden’s first single, No Rock: Save in Roll (released in November), was a tribute to it, its bluesy stomp recalling West Bromwich’s favourite son, Robert Plant. “People forget he married an Indian woman from Birmingham,” says Singh, “which says a lot about where his music was going, and continues to go.” Then there was the heavy rock that biker gangs from the Black Country adored: Singh remembers a neighbour being friends with biker types including Led Zeppelin’s John Bonham. “Black Country music was stripped down it was harder. All of these notes per second in music today doesn’t make it any better. I mean, listen to Black Sabbath. They were so laid-back it was unbelievable!”On No Rock: Save in Roll you’ll also hear a discreet sitar this musical synthesis is everywhere in Cornershop’s back catalogue, a musical response, perhaps, to how difficult assimilation has been for them in other ways. In 1993 their first EP’s lead track, England’s Dreaming, injected indie with the spirit of protest, fusing lyrics from the Smiths’ Heaven Knows I’m Miserable Now and Public Enemy (“I was happy in the haze of a drunken hourFight the Power!”).This protest was about Morrissey, who had draped himself in a union jack at a Madness gig in summer 1992, when the flag was very much a symbol of the far right. He had also released controversial songs such as The National Front Disco and Bengali in Platforms, the latter addressing an immigrant to Britain wanting to assimilate (“shelve your western plansand understandThat life is hard enough when you belong here”). Cornershop had also set fire to pictures of Morrissey outside his record company offices around their EP’s release. This was dismissed as a press stunt by some at the time, but given Morrissey’s ramping up of anti-immigrant statements over the years – including wearing a badge celebrating the far-right For Britain party on America’s Jimmy Fallon show last May – it now seems on the money.“What’s changed now is people have this phrase, and I think it’s a lovely phrase, called ‘white privilege’,” Singh says, looking back. “That’s what Morrissey had, that ability to just continue regardless – Clapton had it too.” He’s referring to Clapton’s drunken on-stage rant in 1976, saying that Britain was “overcrowded”, and that his fans should vote for Enoch Powell. That action prompted the creation of Rock Against Racism (Clapton has since said he feels “shame” about those remarks).“Clapton then surrounded himself with black people, and now Morrissey’s doing the same,” says Singh, meaning Motown singer Thelma Houston, with whom Morrissey duetted on his recent single, Bobby, Don’t You Think They Know? “It was hard for Cornershop to make our stand then, because we were pulling a lot of disparate things together. We couldn’t just say, look at his badge. Look at his support of Tommy Robinson.”By the mid-90s, however, the idea of British music was changing. Birmingham’s Apache Indian was blending bhangra and ragga and getting hits. London’s Asian Dub Foundation were music-paper regulars. The Asian underground scene was building (Talvin Singh’s debut album OK would go on to win the 1999 Mercury prize) and the BBC’s Asian Network became a full-time station in 1996.Brimful of Asha’s success still felt like a pivotal moment. Blending big beat, guitar-pop and tambouras, it propelled the names of Hindi film singers into the non-Asian British mainstream (Lata Mangeshkar and Mohammed Rafi are mentioned on the A-side, as well as Asha Bhosle). It spoke of pop culture’s potential to lift people away from the false promises of politics, and about national projects in India that displaced people (“we don’t care about no government warningsAbout their promotion of a simple lifeAnd the dams they’re building”). It did not pass Cornershop by that the name Asha also meant hope.Today, Singh and Ayres hate how the rewriting of the 90s has become so rockist and white. The albums that most influenced them at the time included the Beastie Boys’ Ill Communication and Daft Punk’s Homework, they say. “And Britpop wasn’t half as big as what they make it out to be now,” Singh says. “I mean, what group would say that they were Britpop? Not many. Like Pulp, who were seen as a great Britpop band – they would run away from it. In fact, they did run away from it.”They don’t think Britpop was partly responsible for Brexit, as critics including Jon Savage and John Harris have suggested they agree that the 90s were a fertile time. “But it’s very strange that that era has been redefined and rejigged as it has been,” Singh sighs.The time immediately after Brimful of Asha harbours different memories for them. Ayres had two young children back then he considers the band’s 1998 Blue Peter performance as a career highlight (both him and his daughter, Molly, then five, got Blue Peter badges). Singh had a tougher time. His mother had died suddenly in 1996, which he wrote about obliquely on Cornershop’s top 30 single, Sleep on the Left Side he was still grappling with that loss. In 1998 he told Select magazine that the song was about “trying to be optimistic when you’re facing that… nothingness”. His father then died in 2001, a month before Singh’s partner gave birth to their son (they now also have a daughter).Singh has lived largely in north London ever since, apart from a few years in his wife’s native France. He thinks often about how different his children’s early lives have been to his. He also worries about how politics will affect their futures. His main worry when we meet is Donald Trump’s impeachment trial which has yet to conclude. “It looks like he’s going to get away with it. If that happens, that means he can’t be accountable to anything. Blatantly twisting his own ambitions for re-election, coercing foreign nations… if we can’t get him for that, then we’re fucked. And if that happens in America, then I can only see England going the same way.”Singh and Ayres were big Labour party supporters in the 90s, Jeremy Corbyn was Singh’s local MP. “As a constituency MP he seemed very good. Then he wooed people after Ed Miliband… but he didn’t really say anything, and he did nothing.” Singh has fewer hopes for Labour today. “They do fuck all. Forget Brexit: they couldn’t even fight against austerity. It’s a dead party, I’m afraid. Really dead. And also the leadership campaign – my God!” Ayres is shaking his head, in agreement. “It’s turning into a joke that will see them out of power for ever.”The 21st century has seen Cornershop make albums in their own time. Singh suffered periods of stress and anxiety in its early years, he says. Setting up a label, Ample Play, in 2009, has been helpful (it releases Cornershop’s albums, as well other artists they love). Their last non-collaborative, original album was 2009’s Judy Sucks a Lemon for Breakfast England Is a Garden has been in genesis for over a decade. They named it that, Singh says, obliquely, “because to look at things from a garden point of view is quite nice”.We discuss the brilliant cover art – a neon-coloured, androgynous crusader staring out at us – and how the title suggests the growth and rebirth of disparate cultures. It’s a fascinatingly multi-layered mix, designed to provoke thought and curiosity while the feet tap along, and the earworms wriggle in your head. All Cornershop’s albums are designed to provide gateways into the rest of their catalogue too, Singh enthuses. Songs like gorgeous Highly Amplified (which blends Punjabi and dancing flutes) and the T Rex rush of I’m a Wooden Soldier underline common musical themes. The rhythm of the opening riff of Cash Money, with delicious irony, recalls Brimful of Asha.Another song’s title might make some listeners baulk. Every Time That Wog Army Roam, a radio-friendly romp about British-Asian people being followed by the police, follows five previous songs in Cornershop’s back catalogue featuring the three-letter-word. “What’s so interesting about that word is when it’s broken down, it’s much more genteel: western oriental gentleman,” Singh says. “But it’s an anachronism. And it’s loaded. By repeating it, we’re reminding people about it. It’s something that should be remembered.” He’s smiling, defiantly. “It shouldn’t just go away.”Cornershop, brilliantly, also aren’t going away. They did think about it a few years ago, then they realised something important. “It’s not about being proficient, it’s about what you can do with it, and it’s the attitude.”“And the ideas,” Ayres adds. “The ideas,” Singh repeats. “You know, there’s no real cupboard we can be put in. We’re constantly misfiled. That makes it harder for us. But isn’t there something brilliant in that too?”Cornershop’s England Is a Garden is out on Friday on Ample Play"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/214fea0779b4daecfce207fbd29bb82e9611afd5/0_400_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8faa20e2a73866249769d7fa35e55789","title":"india modi and the rise of hindu nationalism","story":"With Delhi rocked by deadly protests as Muslim and Hindu groups clash violently,  writer Samanth Subramanian looks at the rise of Hindu nationalism within India.

But my strong memory is that my editor at the time had absolutely no interest in the 2000 London mayoral elections, the ostensible subject of the interview, and only in how Blair, three years into his first term and racked by Northern Ireland, had inadvertently become a father for the fourth time, and what it would mean for his prime ministership.The impact of the patter of tiny feet on the inner workings of No 10 and the decisionmaking of a stressed prime minister has since become a matter of growing curiosity as Britain’s prime ministers, or their wives, have become younger.The Blairs’ surprise fourth child, Leo, delivered by the royal surgeon, Marcus Setchell, managed to survive seven years in No 10 despite a querulous neighbour lobbying for his father to leave the house, and by all accounts is now a well-adjusted boy. He attended his father’s speech last week on 120 years of the Labour party and is, in his dad’s judgment, already an excellent political strategist.So whatever progeny emerges from the union between Boris Johnson and his fiancée, Leo is proof that children need not be scarred by being raised in a minor stately home in central London in which abnormality is the rule, and privacy largely dependent on the judgment of newspaper editors.Leo was an exception only in that he, and subsequently Florence, the youngest child of David and Samantha Cameron, were born to serving prime ministers. Many besides Johnson, Blair and Cameron have been prime ministers with relatively young children. Even those who came into No 10 with children in their 20s such as Harold Macmillan liked to fill the house with children’s parties, just to lighten the sombre mood the place can exude, especially at weekends.Not that these celebrations with the progeny of politicians always go smoothly. In her new memoir, Kate Fall, David Cameron’s deputy chief of staff, recalls a weekend at Chequers where one of Michael Gove’s children marched into the room followed by a flustered Cameron child saying: “It’s true, isn’t it, this will be our house when Daddy become prime minister?”Sajid Javid’s 10-year-old daughter, Maya, has also left some pointed advice hidden in a book in Dorneywood, the government grace and favour mansion in Buckinghamshire, on how prime ministers should treat their chancellors.However, some children such as Carol Thatcher did suffer but whether that was the mother or the home can be disputed. Lord Butler, once Margaret Thatcher’s principal private secretary, recently recalled vividly “going up to the flat and into the sitting room to discuss some point with Margaret Thatcher and in the course of our discussions I heard a rustling in a cupboard in the corner of the room.“And I said: ‘What is that? Are there mice up here?’ And she said: ‘No, that’s Carol.’ I said, ‘Why is Carol in that cupboard?’ And she said, ‘Well, you know, she was wearing jeans so I told her to hide herself while you were coming in.’”Thatcher’s whole approach to motherhood was flawed, according to her admirer Lord Powell, who served as her foreign policy adviser and private secretary. He recently recalled: “The challenges of being a mother and prime minister were considerable and, to be perfectly frank, she rather failed. She didn’t have time enough for her children. She rather overindulged Mark when she perhaps underindulged Carol.”Some prime ministers never tried to blend No 10 as an office and a family home. Mary Wilson, for instance, installed a doorbell in her second-floor rooms to make sure no civil servant intruded. The only informality came from a dog called Paddy and a cat named Nemo. Norma Major took it to a further extreme and lived separately with the young children in Huntingdon for some of the time that John Major was prime minister.The twin risks that prime ministers with young families say they face are balancing work and life, and ensuring a form of privacy or normality. Cameron and Blair had a legendary ability to compartmentalise, probably born of intellectual self-confidence, so when they left the study and went upstairs, the work mentally stayed downstairs. In the case of Cameron, this transition was helped by a short whisky and Game of Thrones episode.Cameron also prided himself on his normality, which his wife, Samantha, attributed to their both having large families.“We have a lot of focus on being on our own, keeping up with old friends, we’ve got big families. I am one of eight siblings, he’s one of four and I think that keeps you grounded. You’ve got to try and not let your life change in any way,” she said. Guests in the Cameron Downing Street living room were expected to balance kids on their knees.For Gordon Brown, normality, and family time, came temperamentally harder. A natural workaholic and worrier, his family holidays were cut short by the foot and mouth crisis or a seminar on the financial crash. Sarah Brown tried hard to compensate, once writing: “I believe that part of my role as wife of the prime minister is to make an often extraordinary life as ordinary as possible for myself, my husband and my children.”In the case of Boris Johnson he has been around the fatherhood course almost innumerable times but the idea that any aspect of his life will be normal, even doting fatherhood, is implausible."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/003128bc972dfe8ca695b4e65bd1602f55cf665e/0_70_5725_3435/master/5725.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=81b52cdb9de8c2bb78adf43aee58cf93","title":"tell us have you been affected by the coronavirus","story":"If you have been affected or have any information or news tips for our journalists, we would like to hear from youIf you’ve been affected by the coronavirus, we’d like to hear from you.A British man who was quarantined on Diamond Princess cruise ship has died, Japanese media reports.

Keira was a very loving, caring girl who loved life, and if she could ever help someone she would.”Keira’s organs went on to save four lives: her kidneys were given to two adults, her liver to a baby and her heart to another nine-year-old – Max Johnson, who had been on the urgent organ waiting list for eight months after being diagnosed with a life-threatening form of dilated cardiomyopathy, where the heart does not pump blood properly.While still in hospital waiting for his new heart, Max and his family campaigned for a change in the organ donation law to an opt-out system in England, following the example of Wales, where adults are deemed to consent to organ donation after they die unless they explicitly decline to do so. Last week, the government announced the new law – known as Max and Keira’s law – will come into effect on 20 May, subject to parliamentary approval.Campaigners – including Max himself, now a healthy 12-year-old – have welcomed the news, arguing that it will improve the survival chances of around 6,000 people currently waiting for organs. Last year, 400 patients died while waiting for a transplant, and a further 777 were removed from the list, most of them because their condition had deteriorated to the point where they had become too ill to undergo transplants. The government has said that the new law could see up to 700 extra transplants a year by 2023. Experts, however, while welcoming the change, caution that the law in itself is not going to automatically solve England’s organ shortage.“It’s not a silver bullet,” says Professor Gurch Randhawa, a public health expert at Bedfordshire University. “As a society, we still need to do much more to normalise organ donation to improve consent rates.”Professor Ronan O’Carroll, a psychologist at Stirling University, agrees that the law change is not “the simple solution it appears to be. Poland, for example, has an opt-out system and it has quite low organ donation rates.” Besides, he says, there is concern that a small minority “may react against the new system and opt out even if they’re signed up to the register, because if their consent is presumed, they don’t see organ donation as a gift any more – they see it as government ownership.”Both experts point to the example of Spain, which has the highest rate of deceased organ donation in the world – a feat often attributed to the “presumed consent” system for organ donors it has had since 1979. Randhawa says: “When Spain introduced the opt-out system, they didn’t see any changes in donation rates for at least 10 years, because it took them 10 years to get the public education right, the hospital capacity right, the family requesting right.”Nevertheless, he is hopeful that the law will be a catalyst for change. Or, as Anthony Clarkson, Director of Organ and Tissue Donation and Transplantation at NHSBT, puts it: “By changing the legislation, we’re encouraging people to make a decision about whether to be a donor and have a conversation about their wishes with their family.”That’s why it’s so important, Randhawa says, that the new law – which was originally known only as “Max’s law” – now carries the name of Max’s lifesaving donor, thanks to lobbying by Max, his family and Keira’s family. Max hopes that the name change will encourage other children to ask their parents about Keira, and grow up to think of organ donation as normal. Every year, on the anniversary of his organ transplant – his “heartaversary” – both families meet to celebrate on what is also a day of great sadness, as it marks Keira’s death. “It’s really sad to think this little girl with an amazing family died in a car crash,” Max says. “But she saved my life, and that’s incredible.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/59cb2a24a32eaf3906fec68c643b3cd7a8cdffc3/0_19_1790_1074/master/1790.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c3bf1af13c1a7f4e33cbcf6878a0527e","title":"top authors take to instagram to defend teenage book lover","story":"Callum Manning, 13, whose reviews were mocked by pupils, backed by Matt Haig and othersA 13-year-old boy who was taunted for his online book reviews has received messages of support from bestselling authors.Callum Manning, from South Shields, Tyne and Wear, created an Instagram account last week to write posts about some of the books he had read.

Sharapova had been drawn to face Ashley Harkleroad, another blonde youngster thrust into the spotlight on the perceived strength of her looks, in the first round of Wimbledon in 2003. The tabloids exploded.Last Wednesday Sharapova announced her retirement from professional tennis after a tough struggle with age and a crumbling shoulder. With five grand slam titles, a career grand slam and 36 titles overall, her career has been a 16-year response to the latter question. The platform chosen for her announcement, a first-person article published in both Vogue and Vanity Fair, seemed to be a reflection of how she wants to be remembered – a rare athlete whose celebrity transcended the sport she played.It has been that way for a long time. Even when she was still winning grand slam titles her career seemed to be better defined by the annual announcement of her topping the Forbes rich list. No tennis player in history has been likened to a brand as much as Sharapova, phrasing that has even permeated the minds of her fellow players. “Her impact on the sport, not just women’s tennis but men’s tennis, tennis in general, was great,” said Novak Djokovic, the men’s No 1. “It still is great. It’s going to keep on being present because her brand, I think, exceeds her tennis achievements.”The fascination with Sharapova’s money has always been curious because, as her first Wimbledon experiences showed, so much of it is a simple reflection of a society that values and promotes a certain look. As she has grown into herself the Russian has assumed agency for her brand and harnessed it into new ventures that will keep her busy for long after her career but she also had opportunities that many other players didn’t.The duality of Sharapova’s image is that while she presents her manicured image away from the courts, what she has brought to the sport is so specific. She burst on to the tour playing vicious, precise tennis and winning the 2004 Wimbledon, 2006 US Open and 2008 Australian Open titles by the time she was 21. Although her shock win against Serena Williams in the Wimbledon final was always hoisted up as her signature victory, even more impressive was the consistency she quickly established as a teenager and how she twice dismantled Justine Henin en route to subsequent titles.Sharapova hit the ball hard and flat and instinctively knew how to construct an aggressive point, but her game was already limited before she returned to the tour in 2009 after shoulder surgery and with her serve diminished. It is difficult to think of many players who would have continued to thrive after a weapon as essential as her serve was affected.No longer able to consistently strike the ball as cleanly, Sharapova simply leaned heavily on her love of a brawl and her street-fighting instincts, battling back to the No 1 ranking after winning the French Open in 2012.Glimpses of the real Sharapova are visible in the long looks down the court, the clenched fist tapping against her thigh, in the way her refusal to make friends enraged. In the midst of an epic three-set match against Agnieszka Radwanska she buried a forehand and bellowed “run, run” across the court. After the French Open crowd booed her in 2008 for no reason she crunched a forehand winner, pivoted on one foot and bellowed “Allez up your fucking ass”. What she brought to the table inspired devotion and loathing, but she made most people feel something.Even as her head-to-head with Serena Williams descended to 2-20 the Russian was a rare player whose presence heightened a moment, who made the most important matches feel even more essential and tense.Sharapova was always a isive figure but her doping ban cast a shadow over her career. The case itself falls into the grey moral areas of sport – she was legally taking meldonium for 10 years when it was added to the banned list in 2016 and she immediately committed a doping violation with her first test at the 2016 Australian Open.At the tribunal her agent’s explanation of how they failed to note meldonium’s status change deserved a laugh track. Max Eisenbud explained he usually checked the list while on his annual holiday during the off-season but, because of his orce, he had forgone that holiday and so he forgot to check. After she attempted to control the damage by announcing the ban herself and demonstrating contrition, she never conceded she had used it legally to help her performance. In the end, although more than 170 athletes were banned for meldonium, Sharapova was one of the few to receive significant punishment for it.The slapstick errors that led to her ban seemed to be a significant revelation. After a decade of narratives about the weight of her brand and the machine behind it, it revealed her as just someone who can be sloppy and make bad judgments. Rather than for the money she made and the brand she built, perhaps it is better to remember her as a flawed person, like everyone else, who achieved enough."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5c1078cd9ad8b172e18f79ae2ddcd0c0f26985ce/677_259_1738_1043/master/1738.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=73bce0d94084f053dc8abffe75d64260","title":"seeds review leeds playhouse","story":"Leeds PlayhouseWith echoes of the murder of Stephen Lawrence, Mel Pennant’s new play focuses on the mothers who are left behindRacism, as Mel Pennant’s new play explores, does not come from nowhere. It is planted by society, its roots extending through soil nurtured by bigoted jokes and casual slurs. A xenophobic gag and a racist murder might not be comparable, but Pennant suggests that they lie on the same continuum.Jackie (Penny Layden) angrily insists that the R-word, as she calls it, does not apply to her and her family. Turning up on the doorstep of Evelyn (Judith Jacob), whose teenage son Michael was brutally murdered 15 years ago to the day, Jackie begs her to let the past lie. Perhaps the attack wasn’t racially motivated, she suggests. Perhaps it was just an accident.There are distinct echoes of the murder of Stephen Lawrence in Pennant’s plot: a black boy killed by a group of white lads, a bungled police investigation, perpetrators still not brought to justice. The focus here, though, is on the mothers who are left behind to deal with the aftershock – on both sides. In its stronger moments, Seeds pushes at the limits of maternal love, asking how far a mother would go to protect her son.But both script and production are awkwardly geared towards ratcheting up dramatic tension, sometimes at the expense of the real issues at hand.Truth is revealed in slow dribs and drabs, in ways that occasionally stretch plausibility. Pennant sows hints and clues that are later harvested as full-blown revelations. Anastasia Osei-Kuffour’s direction lays the suspense on thick, while a huge, portentously lit portrait of Michael at the centre of Helen Coyston’s set is an unnecessary, on-the-nose reminder of why these two women have been brought together.It all feels clunkily contrived, draining urgency from the important questions that Pennant is posing. The two actors radiate convincing emotional anguish, but the material pushes their characters to the edge of credibility. Towards the end, the notes of melodrama that have been present throughout build into a crescendo, drowning out the play’s complex considerations of racism in its various forms. Overblown tragedy eclipses the more prosaic but insidious prejudice that can slowly sprout into violence."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ba2ab793b879fb0bc959b054c7d683263ce3622b/0_223_3032_1818/master/3032.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fd5d48dcd6c2a318bfad58cdda0d6aab","title":"kojo anim review fairfield halls london","story":"Fairfield Halls, LondonIn his show Taxi Tour, the comic from last year’s Britain’s Got Talent offers only standard-issue middle-aged standup Kojo Anim was a star of the black standup circuit for years, but “Britain’s Got Talent changed my life,” he tells his Croydon crowd. The Londoner has booked his Taxi Tour off the back of an appearance in last year’s final, and recounts how that brush with fame – and his Christian faith, and new fatherhood – picked him back up after a grim period in his life. The emotional honesty is refreshing, but plays only a cameo role in an otherwise unadventurous show. Anim certainly does have talent, but – on this evidence – it’s for performing, not for writing distinctive material.The show opens with a justification for appearing on BGT, and an account of his experience of overnight celebrity. But it soon devolves into standard issue middle-aged standup comparing his unglamorous childhood with that of today’s pampered youth. His parents play their expected role, giving their son broad accents to mimic when not walloping him for the slightest impertinence. “Only an African parent,” reports our host ruefully, “will beat their own child when they see another child doing something.” This is all brought to cartoonish life by Anim, infectiously excited by childhood memories of McDonald’s, agog at the slow singing in his Pentecostal church. He’s a fine physical comic too, whether popping with anger at being called home from football, or experiencing acute cramp while having sex. There’s more first-base sex comedy – he chooses to end the gig on a lame ejaculation mime – and some unreflective male perspectives (“Guys, we’ve all done the same thing, innit?”) on relationships and childbirth.

From tailoring to tea making, the success of these enterprises is inspiring other young women to follow suitby  Thaslima Begum in BarishalIn the sprawling urban slums of Barishal, where monsoons and flooding are inescapable, life for women is hard. They are more likely to miss out on getting an education, and without the proper knowledge and skill set, many struggle to make a living. As they are more likely to live in poverty, they are more affected by disasters. But despite these challenges, with the help of livelihood grants from the Red Cross, many women in Barishal are finding innovative ways to eke out a living.Rina, 37, from Palashpur, wakes up early every day to start preparing for work. From a side road of a small slum with heavy foot traffic, she has been running a successful tea stall for the last two years. Brightly coloured crisp packets hang like a banner across her shopfront, where Rina sells roughly 160 cups of tea a day at 5 taka (under 5p) a cup.She uses the money to pay for her children’s education and managed to save enough to buy a small TV, which kept her busy during the World Cup. “Everyone here loves football, so I thought it would be a good investment,” she says proudly. “Not everyone in the slums owns a TV, so when they stop to watch, they also buy tea.”Married at 12, Rina now has five children and is the sole breadwinner of her family. Her husband suffered a stroke seven years ago and is no longer able to work. “I had no money to feed my children. I’d already taken out loans and was worried about our financial situation.” But in 2018, she received a small grant, which enabled her to kickstart her own business.Rina’s customers are mostly men labourers who come to drink chai during their breaks and catch up with their friends. Though they don’t speak to Rina much, she has learned a lot from listening in on their conversations. “They discuss everything – sports, politics, economics and the weather – information I never had access to while sitting at home.”Knowledge about the weather is particularly important for Rina as flooding hampers her business. “When the water comes in, people aren’t interested in sitting around drinking tea.”As she buys her tea wholesale, grown in north-eastern districts such as Sylhet, it’s important for Rina to know of incoming natural disasters that might affect her supply, so that she can plan ahead.Mahmuda, 36, has just had a baby and is making plans on how to balance her tailoring business with motherhood. After receiving a small business loan, Mahmuda was able to establish her tailoring business, which has been going from strength to strength. Dressed in a traditional shalwar kameez she made herself, Mahmuda gently rocks baby Diya back and forth.After going into labour early and losing a lot of blood, the doctors thought both mother and baby wouldn’t make it. Mahmuda was able to use the money she generated from her business to pay for hospital fees and basic necessities for her premature baby.“My business is slowly expanding, and I am able to feed my children,” she says. Mahmuda buys materials and sews clothes for the women in her community. She recently bought a wardrobe to safely store her clothing and protect it from flooding and the smell of the draining system outside her home.Mahmuda lives with her baby and two young sons, sick husband and elderly mother – all of whom she supports financially. Her father left when she was small, so Mahmuda’s mother raised her on her own. She is happy to now be able to take care of her in return. “I am also able to maintain my sons’ educational expenses, which I couldn’t do before – it was a real struggle to pay their tuition fees every month.”Every morning, before the sun rises, Mukhal, 28, sets off on a small dinghy to the local fish market. Dressed in a black burka and face veil so as not to draw attention, Mukhal is one of the few women who can be found in a market mostly dominated by men. Over time she has been able to develop her negotiation skills, so she gets a better price for the catch. She then fills her basket and carries it back to her village, where she sells the fish to her neighbours.Mukhal has led a difficult life. Forced into marriage at the age of 12 when her father died, she became pregnant at 15, and was beaten then abandoned by her husband who took another wife. Her home is on the banks of the river and prone to flooding. “Everything I do is for my son. My only hope is to be the best mother that I can be. I don’t want my son to live this kind of life – I want him to be educated and to have a good job. He wants to be an engineer! I work hard to pay for his education, so he doesn’t have to struggle like me.”Also driven by a strong desire to help her family, Chompa, 15, currently works in an electronics factory. Her father was a rickshaw puller, but because of his old age and the flooding from heavy rain, such arduous work has become difficult. So Chompa is now the main breadwinner in her family, spending all day at a factory where she uses her small hands to put together electronic goods destined for faraway places worlds she catches brief glimpses of through the TV screens that she helps assemble.Chompa earns approximately 4,000 taka (£36.30) a month, which she puts towards rent, food and her parents’ medicines. But a few months ago, while building a fan, it suddenly switched on and the blades sliced off three of her fingers. “There was blood everywhere,” she says. “After a few seconds, I passed out.” Though the factory covered her hospital bill, and at this time she is still receiving her monthly salary, a future without able hands feels uncertain – she says she is likely to be downgraded or dismissed from her role.“What can I expect from this life?” she asks. “I have many dreams, but there are no opportunities.” She wishes she could attend school, but like many young girls from Barishal, this isn’t always an option. One day, when she is old enough, Chompa wants to own a business. She has seen the examples of other women in her community achieving success providing her with glimmers of hope that another reality is not only possible, it is within reach."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cfb68a40cfa2786aadafbf7b2409b7af106324d0/0_15_5377_3226/master/5377.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5b2f1cdd874ba93dabae34b5224fdbb4","title":"mcdonald and dodds review mismatched cops are the perfect partners in","story":"One’s young and plucky, the other hasn’t been to a crime scene for over a decade. Yet ITV’s new detectives are the perfect pairing, as they investigate a very middle class murder‘I’m here for two years, tops, so don’t get attached to me,” says DCI Lauren McDonald (Tala Gouveia) at the start of McDonald and Dodds (ITV). Which is no way to launch a TV cop franchise, but still. “But, while I’m here, I’m gonna solve cases in half the time with half the manpower.” Talking about it won’t make it happen.Imagine Simon Pegg from Hot Fuzz as a crime-solving woman of colour with sarcastic eyebrows and you’ll get the picture. McDonald has been transferred from south London’s mean streets to Bath, a city where the worst crimes are usually the prices for cream teas.Well, not quite. There’s a corpse at a millionaire’s mansion, plugged with two slugs from a military-issue sidearm. Despite the panama hat and expensive shirt, the vic had prison tats and a rap sheet as long as the elegant Regency staircase down which he fell to his death.The mansion is owned by Robert Lindsay’s oleaginous entrepreneur, Max Crockett. He made a £30m fortune from making steam irons which, as one cop puts it, are “the best things to come out of Bath since Plasticine”. Plasticine was indeed invented in Bath by William Harbutt. No, not William Hardbutt. He invented chair cushions.Crockett is planning to retire. But to which of his three daughters will he leave his fortune? If the premise sounds like King Lear or Succession, let me say this: Brian Cox didn’t give anything away in Succession. And is Crockett’s artisanal-baker daughter, Ellie, who does such a good Cordelia impression all she seems? Not if I know my crime dramas she isn’t.Whodunnit? “Most murder victims are killed by a member of their own family,” McDonald tells the Crocketts. “Maybe where you come from. But not here,” scoffs Crockett’s Goneril-like daughter, Megan, who is not only vice-chair of Bath’s police oversight committee, but the answer to the question: “Who ate all the lemons?” “We’re nice, middle-class people who go glamping,” says her no-less-citrus-filled barrister husband. “We play boules at the weekend. Where are we going to get a firearm?”McDonald rightly figures she has a family of suspects, all with motives, but no alibis. But how is she going to prove some or all of them are guilty before the sixth and final ad break? Step forward her new partner, DS Dodds. Like Morse, if he has a first name no one has used it for decades. Dodds hasn’t been deployed in a non-desk-related crime scenario for 11 years. The brass so want him to take early retirement that they have put his desk under the air-conditioning, which means he has to wear a scarf. Monsters.I don’t want to endorse the stereotype that Dodds is pale, male and stale, but he wears a tie under a tank top, which is so wrong I don’t know where to start. He may have eyebrows, but they are sneaky ones, so blond that they pass unnoticed on his pasty face. As a result, Jason Watkins, who plays Dodds, has to use not his eyebrows but minimal eye movement to suggest his character’s default mode of existential bewilderment.Watkins was so adorable as W1A’s floral-shirted BBC drone who was literally good for nothing but folding Hugh Bonneville’s Brompton (not a euphemism) that he surprises here as someone with unexpected professional gifts. Dodds breaks the case by spotting a peregrine falcon near the Crockett mansion. Its nest in a nearby church tower, he realises, will be ringed with RSPB-installed cameras, which will show who broke in to the Crocketts’ mansion and offed the stiff.“Good work with the penguin falcon,” says McDonald, still not convinced her new partner isn’t a chump. “Peregrine,” he corrects, saddened by her ignorance of local fauna. The writer, Robert Murphy, has created a lovely double act. Not since Felix Unger tried to vacuum Oscar Madison’s drapes (again, not a euphemism) have I enjoyed the venerable trope of the odd couple so much. Don’t get attached? Too late, ma’am. I already am."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7c6dbf362604f0e5f80f3b64166403aa0b237c2e/0_0_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b38c0a73b7f29271596e607213ac6f5c","title":"pete buttigieg drops out of 20202 race to be democratic presidential nominee","story":"Former mayor of South Bend, Indiana, leaves the race to take on Donald Trump after a poor showing in the South Carolina primaryPete Buttigieg has ended his campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination. Two campaign sources confirmed the news to the  and said the former candidate was on his way back to South Bend, his home town in Indiana, where he would speak later on Sunday night.The 38-year-old former mayor of South Bend has never held statewide or national office but made a strong run in the Democratic primary, winning the Iowa caucuses narrowly from Bernie Sanders, now the national frontrunner, to whom he placed second in New Hampshire.But Buttigieg could not make progress in Nevada and South Carolina, the first two states with influential minority voting blocs.Joe Biden, the former vice-president, won the South Carolina primary on Saturday by a landslide margin. The next date on the calendar is Super Tuesday, 3 March, when 14 states, American Samoa and Democrats who live overseas will vote.Biden will look to harvest support from Buttigieg as he seeks to establish himself as the moderate choice to deny Sanders. The progressive from Vermont, a self-proclaimed democratic socialist, sits in the Senate as an independent. Party figures fear he will not be able to beat Donald Trump in November.Speaking to CNN on Sunday morning, Biden said he had not had any conversations with other candidates about whether they should drop out and back him but added: “I think everyone knows it’s going to be much more difficult to win back the Senate and keep control of the House if Bernie’s at the top of the ticket.”The Minnesota senator Amy Klobuchar is still in the race and is unlikely to quit before her state votes on Tuesday. The billionaire former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg is also a centrist candidate for the nomination but he is self-funding his campaign and has not yet entered a primary.Another billionaire moderate, Tom Steyer, dropped out on Saturday night.At first on Sunday, which Buttigieg began with breakfast with former president Jimmy Carter in Plains, Georgia, it did not seem he would take the final step.“Every day we are in this campaign,” he told NBC News, “is a day that we have reached the conclusion that pushing forward is the best thing we can do for the country and for the party.”But later in the day he was out.Rick Wilson, a former Republican consultant turned anti-Trump organiser who advocates a moderate choice of Democratic nominee, wrote on Twitter: “It’s hard to pick the right time to go in a campaign, but Pete Buttigieg did.”It seems likely Buttigieg will remain a figure on the national stage. A charismatic campaigner in the centre lane of the primary, having prepared his ground with a run for party chair in 2016, he built an impressive fundraising operation.He was also the first openly gay candidate for American president.Recently, when the rightwing shock jock and Trump ally Rush Limbaugh questioned whether Americans were ready to vote for a gay president, even the controversialist in the Oval Office was quick to disown the suggestion. On the campaign trail, where he regularly appeared with his husband Chasten, Buttigieg hit back hard.In comments distributed to the media on Sunday, a Buttigieg campaign official said: “Pete was willing to go where no other candidates were – and when he held a Fox News town hall and got a standing ovation, people realised that Pete’s message of moving past our ided politics was truly possible.”One of Buttigieg’s last tweets as a candidate linked to a Michigan ballot initiative on anti-discrimination law and promised supporters that as president he would “help pass the Equality Act, and with your courage and activism … create a community where we all belong”.In a statement, Sarah Kate Ellis, president and chief executive of the Glaad advocacy group, said Buttigieg “showed the world that Americans are ready to accept and embrace qualified LGBTQ public leaders.”Charles Kaiser, a  contributor and the author of The Gay polis: the Landmark History of Gay Life in America, said: “Even though he is leaving the race, his success in Iowa and New Hampshire was transformative.“Before Pete Buttigieg no one knew if an openly gay or lesbian American could be a credible candidate for president. Now, no one from the LGBTQ community will ever grow up thinking their sexuality is an unsurmountable obstacle on the road to the White House.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/57e6eecd1b9a4022ed39cc48dcbc0cd165114ad5/0_0_2644_1587/master/2644.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d337208a870aa6c59f75d5510bbbb362","title":"china transferred detained uighurs to factories used by global brands report","story":"At least 80,000 Uighurs working under ‘conditions that strongly suggest forced labour’At least 80,000 Uighurs have been transferred from Xinjiang province, some of them directly from detention centres, to factories across China that make goods for dozens of global brands, according to a report from the Canberra-based Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI).Using open-source public documents, satellite imagery, and media reports, the institute identified 27 factories in nine Chinese provinces that have used labourers transferred from re-education centres in Xinjiang since 2017 as part of a programme known as “Xinjiang aid”.In conditions that “strongly suggest forced labour”, the report says, workers live in segregated dormitories, are required to study Mandarin and undergo ideological training. They are frequently subjected to surveillance and barred from observing religious practices. According to government documents analysed by the ASPI, workers are often assigned minders and have limited freedom of movement.The factories were part of supply chains providing goods for 83 global brands, the report found, including Apple, Nike and Volkswagen among others.China has come under mounting international scrutiny for its policies toward Uighurs and other Muslim minorities in Xinjiang, where as many as 1.5 million people have been sent to re-education and internment camps. Beijing, which says these facilities are voluntary vocational training centres, has said in recent months that most “students” of such centres have “graduated” and returned to society.The report from the ASPI adds to growing evidence that even after being released from the camps, former detainees are still subject to severe controls and in some cases forced labour. The report’s authors said the actual number of those sent to other parts of China as part of the work programme was “likely to be far higher” than 80,000.“This report exposes a new phase in China’s social re-engineering campaign targeting minority citizens, revealing new evidence that some factories across China are using forced Uighur labour under a state-sponsored labour transfer scheme that is tainting the global supply chain,” the researchers concluded.Case studies highlighted in the report, titled Uyghurs for Sale, include Qingdao Taekwang Shoes, a factory in eastern China that produces shoes for Nike. The workers were mostly Uighur women from the prefectures of Hotan and Kashgar in southern Xinjiang, and attended night classes whose curriculum was similar to that of the re-education camps.According to government notices, workers were required to attend the “Pomegranate Seed” night school, named after a policy that aims to make ethnic minorities and the majority Han Chinese ethnic group as close as the seeds of a pomegranate. At the school, workers study Mandarin, sing the Chinese national anthem and receive “patriotic education”. Public security and other government workers were to give daily reports on the “thoughts” of the Uighur workers.Advertisements for “government-sponsored Uighur labour” have begun to appear more frequently online, according to the researchers. One ad read: “The advantages of Xinjiang workers are: semi-military style management, can withstand hardship, no loss of personnel … minimum order 100 workers!”The report called on China to allow multinational companies unfettered access to investigate any potential instances of abusive or forced labour in factories in China, and for companies to conduct audits and human rights due-diligence inspections.“It is vital that, as these problems are addressed, Uighur labourers are not placed in positions of greater harm or, for example, involuntarily transferred back to Xinjiang, where their safety cannot necessarily be guaranteed,” it said.An Apple spokesman, Josh Rosenstock, told the Washington Post: “Apple is dedicated to ensuring that everyone in our supply chain is treated with the dignity and respect they deserve. We have not seen this report but we work closely with all our suppliers to ensure our high standards are upheld.” A Volkswagen spokesman told the paper: “None of the mentioned supplier companies are currently a direct supplier of Volkswagen.” He said: “We are committed to our responsibility in all areas of our business where we hold direct authority.”A Nike spokeswoman told the Post: “We are committed to upholding international labour standards globally,” adding that its suppliers are “strictly prohibited from using any type of prison, forced, bonded or indentured labour”. Kim Jae-min, the chief executive of Taekwang, the QingdaoTaekwang factory’s South Korean parent company, said about 600 Uighurs were among 7,100 workers at the plant, adding that the migrant workers had been brought in to offset local labour shortages."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eb3a5b79c40facf95784c3daf1119218c24ca7e9/0_270_5294_3176/master/5294.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c7bb0695d745e59d32c6f5f3a3427ebd","title":"french government to force through pension changes bypassing parliament","story":"Prime minister deploys decree after opposition parties filed more than 41,000 amendmentsThe French government will force through contested pension changes by decree, avoiding a parliamentary vote.In a surprise announcement, the French prime minister, Édouard Philippe, said the controversial measure would be used to bypass parliament after opposition parties filed more than 41,000 amendments to the law in an attempt to stall its introduction.The proposed reforms have sparked widespread protests and strikes since they were announced in December last year.“I have decided to engage the government’s responsibility on the bill to create a universal retirement system, not to put an end to debate, but to end this period of non-debate,” Philippe told the assembly on Saturday evening.He said the special cross-party committee set up to examine the amendments had shown “perseverance” but it was time to call a halt to the “deliberate strategy of obstruction … carried out by a minority”.“After more than 115 hours of debate in public, during days, and nights, weekends included, the Assemblée Nationale has got to article eight of an ordinary bill that has 65 articles. There are more than 29,000 amendments – 29,273 if I’ve counted correctly – that remain,” he added.He said he regretted that the deliberate attempt to obstruct the bill had also prevented it being debated.“As a result, it has not been possible to have a proper discussion … I profoundly regret this, as I’m sure you on the benches and millions of French people do,” Philippe said.His announcement was met with shouts of protests from opponents. The hard-left La France Insoumise (Unbowed France) party was reported to have filed more than 19,000 of the amendments. The FI leader, Jean-Luc Mélenchon, told French television his party would file a motion of censure against the government.“Though he puts on the airs of an elegant, nonchalant dandy, the prime minister uses extraordinarily violent methods,” Mélenchon said.Immediately after Philippe’s statement, Philippe Martinez, head of the powerful CGT union, called for further strikes this week, and described the government’s use of the decree as “profoundly scandalous”.Several hundred people launched spontaneous protests on Saturday evening. In Le Havre, where the prime minister is standing for local elections, his campaign office was tagged by protesters who wrote “democracy denied” and reportedly threw stones at the windows.The rarely used decree procedure, known as a 49-3 after the relevant article and clause in the French constitution, allows the government to push through a legislative bill without a vote unless the house initiates a no-confidence motion.Left and right opposition parties said they would file no-confidence motions, which would entail parliament being dissolved for new legislative elections, but these are likely to fail in the current assembly.President Emmanuel Macron’s centrist La République en Marche party holds a comfortable majority in the Assemblée Nationale, the lower house of parliament, and is likely to see off any no-confidence motion.The 49-3 decree was last used by the Socialist president François Hollande in 2016 to push through changes to labour law, many of which were proposed by Macron, then the economy minister.The changes to France’s complex pension system, which is made up of 42 different programmes, involve the introduction of what the government says is a fairer and more unified “universal” scheme based on points, and were a key part of Macron’s presidential campaign.The proposals have infuriated public-sector staff – including transport employees, who will lose some of their acquired rights, as well as private and independent workers who claim they will have to work longer for less.The government argues it is ensuring the long-term health of the pension system, which works by “repartition”, meaning those in work directly fund the pensions of those who have retired. The government has said it will maintain the legal retirement age at 62, but those who wish to claim a full pension will have to work until 64.Public transport workers went on strike for six weeks in December and January over the measures, bringing Paris to a standstill and hitting rail services outside the capital. Protesters have also clashed with police over the reforms."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b4c1e2034f6f303fd27964bef2ba607b3a7c4227/0_0_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=712e35a4ce362ad13db6b4dd5ea48ab0","title":"malaysian pm sworn in amid questions over legitimacy","story":"Muhyiddin Yassin dependent on support from party mired in corruption scandalsA former interior minister was sworn in as Malaysia’s prime minister on Sunday amid questions over his legitimacy and protests from the country’s former leader Mahathir Mohamad, 94, who lost a battle for power.The appointment of Muhyiddin Yassin, who once described himself as “a Malay first” and who is backed by parties dominated by the country’s ethnic Malay Muslim majority, is likely to cause anxiety among minority communities.Muhyiddin was named as prime minister after a week of political chaos in which the ruling coalition collapsed, alliances were reversed and rival camps rushed to forge backroom deals. Muhyiddin was named prime minister by the king, who the palace had earlier said would meet inidually with all 222 MPs to find a way out of the crisis.Mahathir, once the world’s oldest leader, described Muhyiddin’s appointment as illegal and said the palace has refused to hear him out. “We are going to see a man who does not have majority support become prime minister,” he said, calling for an urgent sitting of parliament.Muhyiddin relies on support from Umno, a party mired in corruption scandals, as well as a fundamentalist Islamic party that backs strict Islamic laws. His appointment follows growing dissatisfaction among many in the Malay majority, who accused the previous ruling alliance of caving in to Chinese interests.Power struggles are likely to continue, however. Mahathir is seeking to move a motion of no confidence against Muhyiddin in parliament.“For Mahathir, it’s not over. Mahathir as a politician has never left politics, even when he retired. The opposition is mobilising,” said Bridget Welsh, an honorary research fellow at the University of Nottingham Malaysia’s Asia research institute.As prime minister, Muhyiddin has the power to dish out cabinet positions and so has an advantage in winning support from MPs. But his government remains fragile and he will face an uphill battle to prove his legitimacy as a leader, added Welsh. “He comes in with clouds over the process, and questions over whether he really had the numbers,” she said.The political turmoil began on Monday when Mahathir unexpectedly resigned as prime minister, causing the government to implode.His resignation followed moves by some in his party to break from the ruling alliance and form a new government. The coalition had long been fraught with tensions and involved an unlikely partnership between Mahathir and Anwar. Anwar was once jailed for sodomy charges under Mahathir but the two united before the 2018 election to oust the government of Najib Razak, which was entangled in the 1MDB graft saga – often referred to as the world’s biggest case of financial fraud.Anwar was due to succeed Mahathir as prime minister, but Mahathir had refused to set a date for doing so and his supporters had sought to block a handover.Just hours after stepping down on Monday, Mahathir was appointed by the king as interim prime minister, and appeared well placed to launch his own bid for power. But rival factions raced to prove to the king that they commanded enough support from MPs, and on Saturday Muhyiddin was named prime minister.In a statement, the palace said the process of appointing a leader “cannot be delayed because the country needs a government for the wellbeing of the people and the nation”.Some would welcome the appointment and hope simply for an end to the political upheaval, said Welsh, but she added that it would cause deep concern in other quarters.Muhyiddin, 72, was a member of Umno for decades and was deputy prime minister in Najib’s government. Najib sacked him after he questioned the then prime minister’s handling of allegations surrounding the 1MDB scandal. With Muhyiddin reliant on support from the former regime, there are questions over whether those implicated in the saga will be held to account."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/68c9870cfb903dbfa866004305185295f447df3e/67_0_4984_2990/master/4984.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9b936fe67f1ce1ea7f8d664075163daf","title":"no evidence of in morales poll victory say us researchers bolivia","story":"Researchers enter row over legitimacy of ex-Bolivian president, who quit after violent protestsA row over the legitimacy of Bolivia’s longest-serving leader, Evo Morales, has been reignited after researchers in the US questioned allegations that fraud was used to help the country’s leader of 14 years win the last election.Writing in the Washington Post, the researchers from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s election data and science lab have entered what has become a fraught debate about Morales’s legacy and whether he was forced to step down due to an attempt to manipulate the vote or, rather, pushed out as part of a military coup.“There is not any statistical evidence of fraud that we can find,” wrote John Curiel and Jack R Williams, both from MIT, adding that the conclusions of an audit by the Organization of American States “would appear deeply flawed”.Morales, the country’s first indigenous president, resigned in November under pressure from the police and army, following weeks of violent protests over alleged voter fraud and an OAS report that said it had found “serious irregularities” in the vote and “clear manipulations” of the voting system.In a series of quick-fire developments, Morales fled into exile in Mexico where he was granted asylum and a senator, Jeanine Áñez, controversially assumed the interim presidency, pledging to bring the Bible back to the presidential palace and installing a military-backed government that vowed to jail Morales for life, accusing him of sedition and terrorism.In a furious reaction to the Washington Post’s article, the OAS witheringly described it as “neither honest, nor fact-based nor comprehensive”. In a letter signed by Gonzalo Koncke, the chief of staff to the body’s secretary general, Luis Almagro, the OAS said it stood by its findings and said the article contained “countless falsehoods, inexactitudes and omissions”.The letter also accused the authors of ignoring the main allegations of “foul play” set out in the OAS’s 96-page final report which, it said, included the accusation that Bolivian officials maintained two secret servers that could have altered the vote results.While the OAS said such a change was “statistically unlikely”, the researchers said it was “highly likely that Morales surpassed the 10-percentage-point margin in the first round”.Morales tweeted from Argentina that the OAS “owed many explanations to the Bolivian people and the whole world”. He has previously described the organisation as a tool of the US.Carlos Cordero, a political scientist at La Paz’s San Andrés university, said the Post’s report was seeking to make Morales seem like a “victim so the electorate sympathise with him and (his) Movement Toward Socialism” or MAS party, ahead of elections in May.Morales is barred from running but the MAS candidate, Luis Arce, the former finance minister, is leading the polls. The interim president, Áñez, has also decided to run, in a move which some critics have called unethical and unconstitutional.Jim Shultz, the founder of the Bolivia-focused Democracy Centre, said the “shadow of illegitimacy” hung over the 2019 election “from the start because of the unconstitutional manipulations by Evo Morales to try to serve in office for 20 years”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/611eb541c2f5aead569f9cee9d84d2fe1baf75c9/0_61_5600_3359/master/5600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4496828152689b699fd715f1f971f2c7","title":"susan fowler uber whistleblower interview travis kalanick","story":"Before Susan Fowler was a whistleblower she was a violinist, and before she was a violinist she fed fruit flies to spiders that were milked for their venom at a small Arizona business known as Spider Pharm. In February 2017, Fowler was thrown into the public eye after she published a damning blogpost exposing the toxic sexism she experienced working as a software engineer at Uber. And in her new memoir, Whistleblower, she explains how she came to shake up one of the world’s most valuable startups. But, despite the title of her book, Fowler defies one-word labels. She is a musician, a writer, a physicist, a philosopher: a person who demands to be seen, she has written, as more than “that woman who was sexually harassed”.Six million people read Fowler’s blogpost in which she chronicled her time at what was then the No 1 disrupter in Silicon Valley. In the post – titled “Reflecting On One Very, Very Strange Year At Uber” – Fowler recounted how she was pestered by her new boss on her first official day at the company. “He was in an open relationship, he said, and his girlfriend was having an easy time finding new partners but he wasn’t,” Fowler recalled. “It was clear that he was trying to get me to have sex with him.” Fowler immediately reported the conversation to HR.The manager was let off the hook because he was a “high performer”. That was just the beginning of the sexism Fowler would face there. Over the course of her year at Uber, she was given negative performance reviews by another boss, who wanted to prevent her being promoted and thus keep her and other women on his team, and was told she was “the common theme” in all the reports she made to HR about sexist comments. In one bizarre incident, 120 male engineers were rewarded with official leather jackets, while the six women engineers were told that jackets for them were unaffordable.Fowler’s blogpost was instantly explosive. It was shared about 22,000 times on Twitter alone, and Fowler recalls going to a book shop a few hours after posting and overhearing two people “arguing about whether I was telling the truth”. A day after the post, former US attorney general Eric Holder was hired to conduct an independent review on Uber’s working environment the investigation was to be overseen by Arianna Huffington and Uber’s chief HR officer. Fowler’s post inspired the tech industry’s MeToo half a year before the #MeToo hashtag even existed, as other women came forward with stories of sexism in Silicon Valley. In the summer, venture capitalist Dave McClure resigned and wrote a blogpost called “I’m a Creep. I’m Sorry” after the New York Times reported he had sent sexually inappropriate messages to a potential employee. In December 2017, Fowler and four other women (among them Taylor Swift) were chosen as Time magazine’s people of the year, “the silence breakers”.“I have no idea,” Fowler says over the phone from New York, when I ask why her post gained such traction. “At the time no information I had told me that my story would be treated differently from anyone else’s.” Fowler had spent a year at Uber trying to get the company to care about sexism and bullying – her complaints had always fallen on deaf ears. “I was speaking the truth in a system that doesn’t value the truth, but as soon as you go out of it, then speaking the truth actually has an impact. It turns out a lot of people care… not everybody is interested in ignoring bad behaviour. I learned I had to go outside the system.”In truth, it is likely that the response to Fowler’s post was connected to a wider backlash against Uber that was occurring at the time (the “Criticism” section on Uber’s Wikipedia page now includes 21 separate items). A month before Fowler’s exposé, Uber agreed to pay $20m to the US government after the Federal Trade Commission accused the company of misleading drivers about potential earnings, while six months before that, the press had begun to uncover sexual harassment by Uber drivers. After a BuzzFeed News investigation, Uber revealed there had been 170 customer reports (by English-speaking users) with a “legitimate claim of sexual assault” between December 2012 and August 2015, while a freedom of information request by the Sun found 32 London drivers had been accused of assault between 2015 and 2016.Holder’s investigation into Uber concluded that the company’s culture was broken and advised improved HR training and better complaint tracking procedures. Holder also recommended that Uber “review and reallocate the responsibilities of Travis Kalanick”, Uber’s CEO at the time. Kalanick reportedly had knowledge of sexual harassment allegations within the company and failed to act, and had a reputation himself for inappropriate behaviour (in 2014, he boasted about his status in the company attracting women – “We call that Boob-er”). On 21 June 2017, he resigned as CEO.On her first day at Uberversity – Uber’s three-day-long training programme for new recruits – Fowler and her class were told that they weren’t allowed to date “TK”. Confusion abounded as the instructor told them “that she knew all of us wanted to date TK, but it was, she said with a sigh, against the rules”. It wasn’t until later that Fowler realised TK was Kalanick – in Whistleblower she recounts a brief interaction where she encouraged him to dance to improve the mood at a Christmas party. How much does Fowler believe Kalanick’s resignation solved the problems at Uber? While she believes a culture of workplace bullying originated from the top, she also describes the company’s problems as “systemic”.When asked how she feels about the fact that Pham is still employed by Uber, Fowler is diplomatic. “What I do hope is things have changed, and that what happened to me won’t happen to anyone else again,” she says.Most of Fowler’s friends have now left Uber, and she says she has no insight into how it is run today. “I hope that things are getting better – it’s been three years!” she laughs. When she wrote her blogpost, she was working at another startup, Stripe, but just over year and a half later, she joined the New York Times as a technology editor. She sounds very happy when she speaks of her career in journalism, and seems pleased to declare herself “outside” the tech industry now. In Whistleblower’s epilogue she describes her new priorities: writing, learning languages, reading Go, Dog. Go! to her infant daughter.“It was hard to revisit,” she says of writing Whistleblower, “These were some of the most extreme and painful experiences of my life.” It’s no wonder that Fowler is so happy to have moved on – after her blogpost exploded, private investigators began prying into her personal life, attempting to discredit her. Strangers would ring her family and friends and ask questions about her past, rumours spread that Uber competitor Lyft had paid her to write her post, men followed her on foot and in cars. “It was terrifying because I didn’t know what they were looking for or what their goal was, or what they wanted to do with the information,” she says. “It was very, very scary.”Yet despite these experiences, Fowler wants readers to go away thinking not that she is “the woman who was harassed at Uber” but rather “the woman who stood up and spoke out about harassment at Uber”. Less the story of how Fowler became a victim, Whistleblower is more of a guide to how she became a hero. She is most animated during our conversation when talking about the philosophers she read as a teen who informed her moral code – Plato, Epictetus, Isaiah Berlin.“I did not have control over my circumstances but I did have control over my character, the decisions I made, the actions I took, and the things that I said. And that was so important for me.”Fowler’s determination to blow the whistle on Uber had its roots in an incident in her past when she felt she had “very much been morally obligated to speak out and didn’t”. While studying physics at the University of Pennsylvania, Fowler befriended a student named Tim, who became suicidal. When she sought help from the administration, she was told that Tim was her problem. Tim grew increasingly erratic, and threatened to kill himself if Fowler did not return his romantic affections. When Fowler sought help again, the university blamed her for upsetting Tim and tried to remove her from classes she shared with him before rescinding her master’s degree. When she pursued her complaints, the university claimed to have “evidence” that she lied about her relationship with Tim (they wouldn’t show her this evidence). Though she contacted lawyers and considered suing, she ultimately “decided to move on with my life”.“It’s amazing to me how everything that happened in my life then was preparing me for this moment,” Fowler says today. “I learned all these big lessons so when the time came to blow the whistle on Uber, I was ready.” By the time she worked at Uber, Fowler says, it was “second nature” to screenshot, report, and forward any “weird” interactions, as well as save this evidence to the cloud and print off hard copies. She says her book is a way to share those lessons with others. “The most powerful thing you can do is tell the truth, and the most powerful way you can tell the truth is with all this documentation. Then nobody can say it’s a ‘he says, she says’ situation because look, I have the evidence.”Though these lessons are universal, Fowler’s account is intensely personal. She doesn’t reference #MeToo or write at any length about accusations of sexual assault by Uber drivers. Her story is very much her own – she documents living in poverty, falling in love with the violin, getting her first job at Spider Pharm aged 11, and home-schooling herself. She paints a picture of a ferociously independent and determined person: as a student at Penn, she would fall asleep immersed in her textbooks, eager to teach herself the science and maths she needed to keep up. She also admits to things that private investigators would no doubt have loved to dig up – after her father died of brain cancer when she was a student, she checked herself into a mental health facility.“I almost didn’t include that… but I realised I didn’t want people who’d been through something similar to think they couldn’t speak up too,” she says. Her book is a way to provide a “fuller picture” than a magazine cover, she adds, to show that you don’t have to be the perfect victim to blow the whistle.“I want to encourage people to speak up no matter what, and the best way for me to do that is to be open about my life.”Can we really expect inidual women to find solutions to the problem of systemic harassment? It’s one thing to inspire women to speak out quite another to persuade them try to change the conditions in which harassment occurs. “I know, that’s the paradox, right?” she says. “That’s the painful part… because we know it’s very scary and we know what happens to women who speak out.” In the end, though, she says: “You have to do what’s right for you – in myself I felt a deep moral obligation.”The jury is still out on whether meaningful changes have occurred in Silicon Valley in the three years since Fowler’s blogpost (another memoir released in January, Uncanny Valley by Anna Wiener, also describes an industry rife with sexual harassment). Uber isn’t even the first startup where Fowler faced discrimination. After university, she was hired by the financial services company Plaid, where she learned her male peers were being paid $50,000 more than she was. After that, she worked at software company PubNub, where her boss made gasp-inducing statements that led Fowler to believe he “truly, deeply, passionately hated women”.All in all, it paints a depressing picture of life as a female engineer. Fowler says she “realised I really wasn’t welcome in those environments”, but also says she doesn’t want to dissuade other women from entering the field. “I don’t want to discourage any young women from pursuing their dreams. I think the best thing they can do is understand what their rights are and stand up for themselves and advocate for themselves, and then when things start to go wrong just speak out. The more of us who speak out, the louder our voices will be, until they just can’t be ignored.”Fowler’s memoir ends with her riding in a Lyft – Uber’s rival in the US. Is it a final “fuck you” to Uber? Evidence for conspiracy theorists to pounce upon?“They’re the only ones who will drive me around!” she laughs. “Uber banned me, so I can’t sign up. I tried signing up and it said they can’t complete my registration, and I’m like, ‘Yeaa–aah, I wonder why!”• Whistleblower: My Journey to Silicon Valley and Fight for Justice at Uber by Susan Fowler is published by Viking (£21)"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b81d645c6ca3739f6d6b96d61d6aa096cecb8d78/0_256_3072_1843/master/3072.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f291b6111f8c799e3f86cc023944a0b0","title":"the worst case scenario for coronavirus dr jonathan quick q and a laura spinney","story":"The former chair of the Global Health Council talks about the mentality that left the world vulnerable to the Covid-19 epidemic and what can be done to minimise its effectsIn 2018 global health expert Jonathan D Quick, of Duke University in North Carolina, published a book titled The End of Epidemics: The Looming Threat to Humanity and How to Stop It. In it he prescribed measures by which the world could protect itself against devastating disease outbreaks of the likes of the 1918 flu, which killed millions and set humanity back decades. He is the former chair of the Global Health Council and a long-term collaborator of the World Health Organization (WHO).The Covid-19 epidemic looks like it’s edging towards becoming a pandemic – that is, as the WHO defines it, “the worldwide spread of a new disease” – but the WHO hasn’t declared a pandemic yet. What are the best-case and worst-case scenarios?The best case is that the Chinese conflagration is brought under control, the smaller “flames” we’ve seen flare up in other countries are extinguished, there’s little or no spread to new countries or continents, and the epidemic dies out. The worst case is that the outbreak goes global and the disease eventually becomes endemic, meaning it circulates permanently in the human population.If the worst-case scenario comes true, are there still things we can do to minimise the pandemic’s impact?Absolutely. We can mobilise more health officials and keep engaging the public, implementing sensible travel controls and ensuring that frontline health workers have ready access to diagnostic tests and are vigilant – that they don’t send anyone who may have been exposed home without testing them, for example. Judging by past experience, however, it’s likely that health officials and the public in much of the world remain unaware or unconvinced of the danger this virus poses.You have said that time and trust are critical to good epidemic management. What do you mean?The delay between the frontline health workers noticing something unusual, in the form of an emerging disease, and that information travelling up the line to central decision-makers is critical. To illustrate that, a 2018 simulation that the Gates Foundation conducted of a flu pandemic estimated that there would be 28,000 after one month, 10 million after three months, and 33 million after six months. The virus used in that simulation was more contagious and deadly than Covid-19 – though they are both respiratory viruses – but the example shows how all epidemics grow exponentially. So if you can catch an epidemic in the first few weeks, it makes all the difference. As for trust, it’s critical to disseminate dispassionate, evidence-based information, and not to try to mislead the population. If you do, they will stop cooperating. Let’s hope that doesn’t happen in China.Is it plausible that the Chinese have already created a Covid-19 vaccine?The US drug company Moderna is the only one I’m aware of that has a Covid-19 vaccine ready for human trials. Those are due to start in April. Chinese firms are new to the global vaccine market, but at least one, Clover Biopharmaceuticals, is working to develop a Covid-19 vaccine.It appears that the Covid-19 virus originated in a “wet” or live animal market. Should such markets be banned?No. The Chinese government tried that after Sars. The markets just went underground. They need to be better regulated, and there needs to be active surveillance. Active monitoring and culling of poultry populations in Asia has stamped out outbreaks of avian flu in those populations.Was an epidemic like that of Covid-19 inevitable?From a biological standpoint an outbreak of a novel pathogen was inevitable, but this one happened in the worst place at the worst time. Wuhan is a big city and a crossroads, and the first cases were recorded there just before the lunar new year, when large numbers of people were about to travel to visit their families.In terms of containing it, was it a good or a bad thing that it happened in China?As of five months ago, we have a measure of epidemic preparedness – the Global Health Security (GHS) Index – that scores countries on six dimensions: prevention, detection, response, health system, risk environment and compliance with international standards. No country scores perfectly on all six. China has detected and responded to this epidemic pretty well, though its health system is now stretched beyond capacity, but it is weak on prevention – particularly when it comes to food safety.How well is the US prepared?The US ranks high on the GHS index, but is still unprepared for a severe pandemic, should one happen. Malfunctioning coronavirus tests have frustrated public health labs and delayed outbreak monitoring. Supplies of masks, suits and other protective material for health workers are running low in the midst of a moderately severe flu season. Since the creation of a much-needed public health emergency preparedness fund in the aftermath of 911, its budget and the public health functions it supports have been steadily reduced. This is the mentality that left the world vulnerable to the devastating 2014 outbreak of Ebola in west Africa – that is, close the fire department and cancel the fire insurance as nobody’s house or factory has burned down lately. It’s time we learned that the bugs never stop mutating and crossing over to humans.Has the world been an ostrich over pandemic risk?Generally speaking, no. After each major recent outbreak – Sars, swine flu, Ebola – we’ve moved ahead. The GHS Index is itself a big advance, because we can now see where inidual countries are weak in terms of preparedness. We should be moving faster, though.What exactly should we be doing faster?Fewer than one in three countries are close to being prepared to confront an epidemic, which leaves the vast majority of the world’s population vulnerable. That in turn leaves us all vulnerable because we’re only as safe as the least safe place. We need to invest more in preparedness, and we need our leaders to take a greater interest in it – that’s all leaders, in both the public and private sectors – from the grass roots to the grass tops.Is a global health agency essential to managing a pandemic, and is the WHO up to the task?A global health agency is essential, yes. None of the advances I’ve mentioned could have happened without the WHO’s involvement, but the WHO can only perform as well as its members allow it to – and they have pulled back on funding since the 2008 financial crisis.Your book is optimistically entitled The End of Epidemics. Could we ever really wave goodbye to epidemics?The world will continue to have disease outbreaks, but there is plenty we can do to protect ourselves against global catastrophes like the 1918 flu."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dc9ae4430e3becfe01bd82db6cf4153bbd20dbc3/0_371_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7beef93fa8761fa623ee2f5ab3073888","title":"twelve more people test positive coronavirus in uk","story":"Second person in Britain tests positive without having recently travelled abroad as Scotland reports first caseA patient in Essex has become the second person in the UK to test positive for coronavirus without having recently travelled abroad, fuelling concerns that the virus is circulating in Britain undetected.Prof Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer for England, said the patient “had no relevant travel” and an investigation was under way to determine whether the patient contracted the virus directly or indirectly from someone who had recently returned from overseas.The case suggests the country is edging closer to the point where containment becomes impossible because the virus is being spread by people who are either unaware they are infected, or are diagnosed too late to prevent onward transmission.The Essex patient was among 13 new cases reported on Sunday, bringing the total UK infections to 36. It is the largest single-day increase of new cases in the UK so far. One of the new cases is the first to be reported in Scotland, while two cases in total had previously been reported in Northern Ireland and Wales.The patient in Scotland, who is a resident of the Tayside area and had recently travelled from Italy, has been admitted to hospital and is receiving treatment in isolation.Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland’s first minister, chaired a meeting of the Scottish government resilience committee on Sunday evening and will be taking part in a similar meeting chaired by Boris Johnson on Monday morning. Peter Openshaw, a professor of experimental medicine at Imperial College London, said: “This really adds to the supposition that many are now making that this one is going to be very hard to put back in the box. It makes it particularly difficult to control any outbreak if there are people who don’t know they’re spreading it.”Johnson will chair a Cobra meeting on Monday to review the next steps aimed at containing the virus, and he will tell those signing off the strategy that the government will “stop at nothing” to fight the disease.The meeting will be attended by senior ministers as well as Whitty and chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance in order to ratify the government’s proposed countermeasures.The prime minister is set to tell those at the meeting: “The number of coronavirus cases around the world is rising every day – and the UK is no exception. There now seems little doubt that it will present a significant challenge for our country.“But we are well prepared, and the government and the NHS will stop at nothing to fight this virus. This battle plan lays out in detail the measures we could use – if and when they are needed.”Johnson had been dubbed a “part-time” prime minister by critics for failing to take charge of a Cobra meeting before this week. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, confirmed on Sunday that the government would publish its approach to coronavirus this week but conceded it was inevitable that the virus would continue to spread across the UK. The NHS is planning to bring doctors out of retirement to cope if the outbreak escalates and Hancock did not rule out following China’s lead and isolating cities to contain the virus.“There is clearly a huge economic and social downside to that,” Hancock told the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show. “But we don’t take anything off the table at this stage because you have to make sure you have all the tools available if that is what is necessary.”Emergency powers to slow the spread of the virus, if it becomes endemic, would only be temporary, Hancock added. He said “population distancing measures” such as banning public gatherings and cancelling football matches might be considered and closing schools could become necessary.On Friday, a man from Haslemere in Surrey became the first person known to have caught the infection in the UK. Three of the men’s relatives, one also from Surrey and two from West Sussex, are among the new cases, forming an “adult family cluster”, said James Mapstone at Public Health England. At the weekend, the Prince of Wales pub in the town closed for deep cleaning after landlords said one of its customers had tested positive. Paul Hunter, a professor of medicine at the University of East Anglia, said: “Although it may still be possible to prevent a community-wide epidemic, this is looking increasingly unlikely and we should be prepared to cope with a more widespread epidemic on our shores.” The World Health Organization is recommending that people take simple precautions to reduce exposure to and transmission of the Wuhan coronavirus, for which there is no specific cure or vaccine.Despite a surge in sales of face masks in the aftermath of the outbreak of the coronavirus outbreak, experts are ided over whether they can prevent transmission and infection. There is some evidence to suggest that masks can help prevent hand-to-mouth transmissions, given the large number of times people touch their faces. The consensus appears to be that wearing a mask can limit – but not eliminate – the risks, provided they are used correctly.Of the remaining eight new cases, six had recently returned from Italy and two from Iran. All of the new patients, from London, West Yorkshire, Greater Manchester, Hertfordshire and Gloucestershire, are being investigated and their close contacts traced.The sudden rise in cases came as health authorities scrambled to track down people who had come into contact with a 35-year man from Shenzhen in China, who had been working in Bristol and tested positive for coronavirus after taking a Cathay Pacific flight from Heathrow to Hong Kong on Thursday.A statement from the Guangdong health commission late on Sunday said authorities in Shenzhen had declared an “imported case” of the coronavirus after the man tested positive. It is unclear whether or not he became infected in the UK, but Chinese authorities said two of the patient’s colleagues in the UK had reported coughs and fever.The man travelled from London to Hong Kong on 27 February on Cathay Pacific flight CX250. After landing in Hong Kong he took a ferry to Shekou port and from there entered mainland China.While the man’s temperature was normal on arrival, he developed a cough and fever on 29 February and was driven to a hospital where he tested positive for coronavirus. He is now having treatment in Shenzhen, where his condition was described as stable.Chuang Shuk-kwan, the director of the infectious disease ision of the Centre for Health Protection in Hong Kong, advised all passengers on Thursday’s Cathay CX250 flight from Heathrow to Hong Kong, or on ferry number 3A109, to call the centre’s hotline and to be “aware of the health situation”, and seek medical help or quarantine if necessary. A spokesperson for Cathay Pacific said the plane was being disinfected and the airline was helping authorities trace passengers who came into close contact with the man.Among measures announced by the Department of Health and Social Care on Sunday were a ministerial lead on the virus in every department and a cross-Whitehall “war room” to coordinate a beefed-up public information campaign.One of the newly confirmed cases is a patient from Bury in Greater Manchester, who is being treated at a specialist NHS infection centre, according to Bury council. Will Welfare, the interim deputy director of health protection for Public Health England North West, said the agency was tracing people who had close contact with the patient, who became infected while in Italy.Another case, identified on Saturday, is a member of staff at St Mary’s school in Tetbury, Gloucestershire. The school has been closed until at least Wednesday because of “operational difficulties” with staff rather than any ongoing health risk, according to a letter sent to parents from Jo Woolley, the headteacher. She said a deep clean was carried out on Saturday and that all people who had contact with the infected staff member had been spoken to.“The thing I would urge every organisation and every business to do is to really start planning, as of now, for how people are going to manage to work remotely and cover each other’s jobs in the event that people have to take time off from work,” said Openshaw. “It’s planning for resilience in the eventuality that the spread is going to continue.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b39b54f8ff7944185b593d48f18c09788d4b8ee1/1434_421_3318_1991/master/3318.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=511cd8374c28299ac9dfd738a0216e2e","title":"what is coronavirus and what should i do symptoms","story":"What are the symptoms caused by the virus from Wuhan in China, how does it spread, and should you call a doctor?It is caused by a member of the coronavirus family that has never been encountered before. Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. Many of those initially infected either worked or frequently shopped in the Huanan seafood wholesale market in the centre of the Chinese city.The virus can cause pneumonia. Those who have fallen ill are reported to suffer coughs, fever and breathing difficulties. In severe cases there can be organ failure. As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system. Many of those who have died were already in poor health.In the UK, the medical advice is that if you have recently travelled from areas affected by coronavirus, you should:More NHS advice on what to do if you think you have been exposed to the virus can be found here, and the full travel advice to UK nationals is available here.China’s national health commission has confirmed human-to-human transmission, and there have been such transmissions elsewhere.As of 1 March, the outbreak has affected an estimated 87,000 people globally. In mainland China there have been 2,870 deaths among over 79,000 cases, mostly in the central province of Hubei. More than 41,000 people affected in China have already recovered.The coronavirus has spread to at least other 30 other countries. The most badly affected include Japan, with 850 cases, including 691 from a cruise ship docked in Yokohama, and four deaths. Italy has recorded at least 1,100 cases and 29 deaths, while South Korea has recorded more than 3,500 cases and eight deaths. There have also been deaths in Hong Kong, Taiwan, France, the US and the Philippines.There have been 15 recorded cases and no fatalities to date in the UK.Another key unknown is how contagious the coronavirus is. A crucial difference is that unlike flu, there is no vaccine for the new coronavirus, which means it is more difficult for vulnerable members of the population – elderly people or those with existing respiratory or immune problems – to protect themselves. Hand-washing and avoiding other people if you feel unwell are important. One sensible step is to get the flu vaccine, which will reduce the burden on health services if the outbreak turns into a wider epidemic.No. A pandemic, in WHO terms, is “the worldwide spread of a disease”. The spread of the virus outside China is worrying but not an unexpected development. The WHO has declared the outbreak to be a public health emergency of international concern. The key issues are how transmissible this new coronavirus is between people, and what proportion become severely ill and end up in hospital. Often viruses that spread easily tend to have a milder impact. Generally, the coronavirus appears to be hitting older people hardest, with few cases in children."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/67f85e60385f1faba31e93d8957b5a6c7a41d0ac/0_161_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d5c13b08e433fd404b5d1606f54ec82c","title":"yes it is worse than the flu busting the coronavirus myths","story":"The truth about the protective value of face masks and how easy it is to catch Covid-19Most people who are not elderly and do not have underlying health conditions will not become critically ill from Covid-19. But the illness still has a higher chance of leading to serious respiratory symptoms than seasonal flu and there are other at-risk groups – health workers, for instance, are more vulnerable because they are likely to have higher exposure to the virus. The actions that young, healthy people take, including reporting symptoms and following quarantine instructions, will have an important role in protecting the most vulnerable in society and in shaping the overall trajectory of the outbreak.Wearing a face mask is not an iron clad guarantee that you won’t get sick – viruses can also transmit through the eyes and tiny viral particles, known as aerosols, can still penetrate masks. However, masks are effective at capturing droplets, which is the main transmission route of coronavirus, and some studies have estimated a roughly five-fold protection versus no barrier. If you are likely to be in close contact with someone infected, a mask cuts the chance of the disease being passed on. If you’re just walking around town and not in close contact with others, wearing a mask is unlikely to make any difference.For flu, some hospital guidelines define exposure as being within six feet of an infected person who sneezes or coughs for 10 minutes or longer. However, it is possible to be infected with shorter interactions or even by picking the virus up from contaminated surfaces, although this is thought to be a less common route of transmission.Scientists were quick out of the gates in beginning development of a vaccine for the new coronavirus, helped by the early release of the genetic sequence by Chinese researchers. The development of a viable vaccine continues apace, with several teams now testing candidates in animal experiments. However, the incremental trials required before a commercial vaccine could be rolled out are still a lengthy undertaking – and an essential one to ensure that even rare side-effects are spotted. A commercially available vaccine within a year would be quick.A pandemic is defined as worldwide spread of a new disease – but the exact threshold for declaring one is quite vague. In practice, the actions being taken would not change whether or not a pandemic is declared. Containment measures are not simply about eliminating the disease altogether. Delaying the onset of an outbreak or decreasing the peak is crucial in allowing health systems to cope with a sudden influx of patients."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/13966ab5d228ec5c50b34981e021938380008985/0_121_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2789eb6cd2816fea20e3ea5a1702f4b1","title":"coronavirus latest updates coronavirus live updates latest news china wuhan stock markets update china iran us australia south korea japan","story":"US, Australia and Thailand also report first deaths while bans are put in place around the world on large gatherings. This blog is closedWe are about to close this live blog on the coronavirus. Here’s the latest summary of the key events:You can follow our latest liveblog here:Christopher Betts, 73, is a British holidaymaker who is still in lockdown in the hotel in Tenerife. He arrived at the hotel with his wife on the 18th, and was due to be leaving on the morning the hotel went into quarantine.Christopher told the  he has been tested for coronavirus but hasn’t received his results, and has no idea when he’ll be able to fly home. One of his friends in the hotel is in regular contact with the Foreign Office, and says he’s being told different things depending on which member of staff he speaks to there. “One branch of Foreign Office says that when you’re negative you can go, another branch says you have to stay for the full isolation period, until March 10,” he said. “We’re operating on a Chinese whispers system. If we have to stop til next Tuesday, fine, we’ll accept it. all we need is clarification.” “We’re getting conflicting stories from our government. Finish and Dutch people in the hotel have said their government have been clear about them staying until the 10th, but we don’t know,” he added.Those who test negative will have to retest when the time comes to fly home, and must leave 24 hours after their negative result. Christopher is concerned that if the remaining Brits are allowed to leave the hotel, they won’t be able to get transport to the airport. He praised the staff at the H10 Costa Adeje Palace for their hospitality during the quarantine period. “You couldn’t wish for a better hotel,” he said. “Staff and guests were dancing in the restaurant last night, they brought us entertainment. I know people whinge, but you couldn’t wish for anything more under the circumstances. They’re even giving us free drinks.”Israel has confirmed three more cases of coronavirus, bringing its total number to 10. Two of the new cases had recently returned from a trip to Italy, and the third is thought to have been infected within Israel.The three patients have “light” symptoms, Israel’s health ministry said.PA have produced a helpful overview of the UK coronavirus cases, which might help to map out what’s happened so far:31 January The first cases are reported in the UK when two members of the same family test positive for the virus. They had recently travelled to the UK from China. They were staying at a hotel in York when they fell ill and were taken to Newcastle Royal Victoria Infirmary for treatment.6 February A third person in the UK is diagnosed in Brighton and transferred to Guy’s and St Thomas’ in London. It later emerges that the patient, businessman Steve Walsh, contracted the virus at a conference in Singapore. On his way back to the UK, he stopped off for several days at a French ski chalet, where five Britons were subsequently infected with the virus.9 February Prof Chris Whitty, chief medical officer for England, says a fourth person has been diagnosed in the UK, believed to be a contact of Walsh. It is later confirmed that the virus was passed on in France.10 February Four more patients in England test positive for coronavirus, bringing the total number of cases in the UK to eight. Those infected are all contacts of Walsh and Public Health England (PHE) confirms two are healthcare workers. The four newly diagnosed people had contracted the virus in France.13 February A woman in London becomes the ninth person to test positive for the illness in the UK - the first confirmed case in the capital. The patient, also moved to Guy’s and St Thomas’, contracted the virus in China, Whitty says. As with previously confirmed cases, officials work to identify people who had been in recent contact with the woman.23 February Four Britons rescued from the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan test positive for the illness in the UK, bringing the total number of confirmed cases to 13. They were among a group of 30 Britons and two Irish citizens who arrived at a quarantine block at Arrowe Park hospital in Merseyside a day earlier. Whitty said the virus was passed on when all four were on board the vessel.27 February The first case of Covid-19 is diagnosed in Northern Ireland, while two more people tested positive across the rest of the UK. The patient in Belfast had recently returned from northern Italy and had previously been in Dublin. Another of the new cases, a parent at a Buxton primary school in Derbyshire, contracted the virus in Tenerife. The third patient also contracted the virus in Italy.28 February The number of confirmed UK cases jumps to 20 after Wales reports its first patient and three more are identified in England. Dr Frank Atherton, the chief medical officer for Wales confirmed a man had been diagnosed with the virus after travelling back to Wales from Italy.Two of the new cases identified in England had recently travelled back from Iran. Meanwhile, a patient identified in Surrey becomes the first to catch the illness within the UK. Prof Whitty says it is not clear if the patient had contracted the virus “directly or indirectly” from somebody who had recently travelled abroad.29 February Three more patients are identified in England. Two of the patients had recently travelled back from Italy while the other had returned from Asia.1 March The UK total climbs to 36 after 13 new patients are identified, with Scotland reporting its first case. Three of the latest cases in England are family members of a man from Surrey who was the first to catch the illness within the UK. All four are adults, including one more from Surrey and two from West Sussex, and are not GPs or health workers, acting regional director for the south of England for PHE says.Another new patient, from Essex, had no relevant travel to an affected area, according to Whitty, and it was unclear whether the patient had contracted it “directly or indirectly” from somebody who had recently travelled abroad.The eight remaining cases include one from Bury, Greater Manchester, who was infected in Italy, two new patients from Hertfordshire and one in London. Three cases were confirmed in West Yorkshire, including two Leeds residents – who became infected in Iran – while one is from Bradford who had been in Italy.Another is from Gloucestershire and is linked to a member of staff at a school in the Cotswolds, identified the day before. Meanwhile, the first person in Scotland to be diagnosed is a Tayside resident who recently travelled from Italy.Nicola Sturgeon: ‘Scottish coronavirus case not unexpected’Scottish first minister Nicola Sturgeon said the first confirmed case in Scotland was “not unexpected”. In an interview with Sky News a few minutes ago, said they had been preparing for this occasion “for some time” and that she was expecting more cases in the coming days and weeks.Sturgeon reiterated much of her earlier statement, and said the Scottish coronavirus patient is clinically well. Confident in the NHS responseThe first minister also assured the public that the UK was well-equipped to deal with a rise in cases. “All the things that should be done are being done”, she said. “We have to be prepared for a significant outbreak fo coronavirus.”She said that Scotland remained in the containment phase, and was focusing on trying to limit and contain spread of infection - which was “particularly important given the lack of coronavirus vaccine”. The first minister said that wider planning for a significant outbreak in coming weeks was underway, including escalation plans for the NHS. “I have a lot of confidence in the plans and procedures that are in place,” she said. She said that steps that will be taken will be informed and guided by best possible advice, and that she wouldn’t rule anything out at this stage.However, she also said that the public “have a big part to play” in stopping the spread of the virus by following public health guidelines. Sturgeon said that Scotland was working with other UK nations, and described it as “vital” to have a co-ordinated, UK wide response. “This is a virus that will not respect boundaries,” she said.You can read more about the new cases in the US from my colleague Amanda Holpuch in New York.Brazil has so far confirmed only two cases of coronavirus - both Brazillian citizens who had been in Italy.But a report in one of the country’s leading newspapers this Sunday says there are now 252 suspected cases - 136 of them in the state of São Paulo and 19 in Rio de Janeiro.According to the Estado de São Paulo newspaper, the suspected cases are people who have not just symptoms but have also had contact with a suspected case or a travel history connected to coronavirus.Angola has announced that it will ban citizens from China, South Korea, Italy, Iran, Nigeria, Egypt and Algeria from entering the country.The ban will only apply to those who have travelled directly from those countries, and has been implemented to prevent the spread of coronavirus.Mexico have confirmed a fifth case of the virus - an 18-year-old woman who had been studying in Milan and had recently returned to Chiapas state.The woman tested positive for the virus on Saturday but is asymptomatic, state health authorities said.Authorities said she had returned to Mexico after her school in Italy closed because of the crisis.Two of Mexico’s confirmed cases are in the capital, Mexico City, where schools and nurseries are already starting to adopt special measures to guard against a potential outbreak.Speaking at a press conference on Sunday, Mexico City mayor Claudia Sheinbaum said there were currently no plans to cancel major public events or gatherings because of coronavirus.A nursing home near Seattle is on lockdown after a 70 year old resident and a worker in her 40s tested positive for coronavirus, officials at the home have said. State officials said that an additional 27 residents of the nursing home and 25 staff members are reporting symptoms of the virus, which can be similar to that of the common flu.The Life Care Center of Kirkland is not accepting new patients or allowing visitors, family or vendors into the facility.“Concerned family members or responsible parties may call our facility,” the release posted on its website said. “The facility is currently placing a hold on admissions as well to fully focus on our current residents and associates.”The two cases were confirmed on Saturday by Washington state officials. The resident is in a serious condition, whilst the worker is in a ‘satisfactory’ condition.There are around 70 cases in the US."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4185597.1582825186!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"i don t think i can call eir one more time without losing my temper","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tOur reader says the experience has been eye opening ‘as this is the first time I have dealt with a national company’. Photograph: Alan Betson  The A reader called Ciara got in touch because she was having an issue with our friends at Eir.“I ordered a phone on November 29th, 2019, but due to a number of failed deliveries I decided to cancel the order within the 14 days I had to change my mind. I needed a new phone urgently as my own was on its last legs,” she writes.She contacted Eir and was told to refuse the package upon delivery. “However, I was not at home when they delivered the package. It was left outside the door on the ground even though I was told I would need to show ID and proof of purchase upon delivery. I contacted the delivery company several times about getting someone to collect the package but that again was useless.”So she set up a Parcel Motel account and on December 13th dropped the phone into such a facility. “There are only two updates of the package, one being that is was stored, and two that it was collected. I contacted the delivery company for further confirmation and was told that it was most likely delivered to Eir returns but hadn’t been processed yet. I have contacted Eir countless times and have been told each time that they are waiting on confirmation that the phone has been returned.”She is now receiving emails about “unpaid” bills from Eir but has been told that all bills have been cleared on heraccount. “I paid a total of €279 for the phone. This included a deposit and the stated price of the phone which was included in a bill pay plan.”She said the experience has definitely been eye opening “as this is the first time I have dealt with a national company seeing as I am only 18. I am working at the moment and trying to save up for a car and €279 would go a long way towards funding that. I understand that I was returning the phone at a relatively busy time of the year but to see that there has been no update at this stage is ridiculous.“Many of the representatives I have been talking to have been helpful and understand my frustration, but they can do nothing in relation to the return of the phone and, therefore, cannot cancel the account to give a refund. Can you please help me with this issue? I don’t think I can call back one more time without losing my temper. I have been very polite and understanding so far but the continued failure on their behalf to provide me with my entitled refund is very frustrating.”We got in touch with eir and were told that it had “been in contact with the customer to apologise for the inconvenience and have followed up with the courier company. The issue is now resolved and the customer is satisfied. If a customer wishes to return a new, unopened mobile device they can call 1901 and eir will send out a prepaid envelope with everything the customer needs to return that order, subject to standard terms and conditions. There is no need to use a parcel drop service for return of mobile devices.”"},{"url":null,"title":"new iphone stopped working 14 months into two year contract","story":"A reader called Susan contacted us with a query about a mobile phone that has a broad aspect with which many readers might identify.“I am tied into a 24-month contract with Vodafone, ” her mail starts. “I got an iPhone 7 Plus on the contract which was taken out in November 2018. In January 2020, 14 months into the contract, the phone stopped working, the Apple icon appeared on the screen and the phone just locked up, couldn’t be turned on or off.”So Susan brought it back to the Vodafone shop in Kilkenny where she had bought it and was told the Apple warranty was for only a year so she had to pay for it to be fixed.Reasonable “After leaving the shop I decided to look up some consumer legislation,” her mail continues. “On reading up on European and Irish consumer law, I assumed I would be covered at least for two years which is stated under Irish law and would seem reasonable for the product seeing as the contract is for 24 months and you would assume the phone would last for the duration of the contract.”So she went back to the shop and said this. “They said they would send the phone back to see. Then I received a call stating it would be approximately €370 to have it repaired, take it or leave it basically as I am not covered by Apple. I asked if Apple had to operate under Irish law and was just told the same again and to take it up with Apple but I stated that my contract is with Vodafone and they should represent my case but this didn’t work. I then rang Vodafone customer care to be told the same.”Susan wonders if she is deluded in thinking she is covered under the umbrella of Irish-European consumer legislation.It is worth pointing out that a warranty is not the be-all and end-all. It is offered by a manufacturer but does not trump statutory consumer rights. Under the Sale of Goods Act, consumers have up to six years to seek redress for faulty or defective items. There are limits to this law, however. And the limits are typically governed by how much you pay for something, what it is supposed to do and what you do with it. A watch that costs €10 is probably not going to last long so if it breaks after a year, you have no real comeback. A phone that costs close to €1,000 should last more than a year and more than 14 months and, if it doesn’t, then the retailer or service provider has a case to answer, warranty or no warranty.Secondly, as this reader points out, her contract is with Vodafone and not with Apple and while she can deal with Apple if she so chooses, she can not be told to by Vodafone.Exclusions According to the Competition and Consumer Protection website, a “guarantee or warranty gives you additional protection if something goes wrong. However, you are still protected by your consumer rights regardless of any warranty or guarantee. Often warranties can be more generous, for example, they may also cover accidental damage, but they do sometimes have exclusions and many run out after one year whereas your consumer rights don’t.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4181069.1582312165!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"waste materials to be airlifted from mv alta wreck","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe MV Alta, a 77m Tanzanian registered cargo ship which had been abandoned and drifting in the Atlantic Ocean for 17 months, washed up on rocks near Ballycotton in east Cork last weekend.

Particularly, she said, to what extent cost and environmental concerns were informing decisions.She said of particular concern was the need for an ecologist to examine local sea life for signs of pollutants.“It’s a simple thing. Maybe they have done all of this but there isn’t enough information available, and if they haven’t done it, why not?”Keep awayMs Dubsky said despite local restrictions, efforts would be made by environmentalists to examine limpets, a marine mollusc, on rocks in the area to see if they are falling off.Members of the public have again been urged to stay away from the wreck which is on a dangerous and inaccessible stretch of coastline and in an unstable condition.As part of the operation, access to a local cul-de-sac road has been restricted to residents. The council has also said that lands along the shoreline are private.Under law, it is an offence for anyone to interfere with a wreck or to attempt to board it.A Revenue official has been appointed Receiver of Wrecks by the Department of Transport, a function necessary to manage the possession and disposal of vessels which wash ashore."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4189536.1583085258!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus dublin school to close for two weeks as student has covid 19","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA scientist works at a laboratory in Israel trying  to produce a vaccine against  Covid-19.

The decision was announced by the National Public Health Emergency Team on Sunday evening.The team announced the first confirmed case of the virus in the Republic of Ireland on Saturday night. Another case was confirmed in a patient in Northern Ireland earlier this week. That woman had also travelled from Italy and passed through Dublin airport. The Dublin-Belfast train was later sanitised as a precautionary measure as it was believed the woman travelled home on it. Low risk It is understood the risk to other pupils in the north Dublin school is considered low but the closure has been ordered on a precautionary basis. Students are being told to self-isolate at home and to indicate if they start showing any symptoms.Public health officials plan to maintain daily contact with the students by phone, and will ask them to indicate by text whether they are showing symptoms.Parents were being informed of the closure on Sunday evening and a helpline for affected people is being set up.There is no justification for any other schools closing due to concerns over Covit-19, public health officials have advised. No new cases have been confirmed in Ireland today.The Department of Health released the following statement on Sunday evening: “Contact Tracing of the confirmed Covid-19 case, in the East of Ireland, has identified and made contact with a secondary school. The principal, staff and parents of pupils of this school have been notified. Following risk assessment, all pupils and teachers are being treated as close contacts of the confirmed case.The school will close for the duration of the incubation period, which is 14 days.All pupils and teachers are being asked to restrict their movements until the end of the incubation period and will receive guidance on the meaning of ‘restricted movements’.Public health doctors will actively follow-up with all students and teachers on a daily basis over the coming 14 days.Dr Tony Holohan, Chief Medical Officer with the Department of Health, said: “Contact tracing has assessed that close contacts of this patient includes pupils and teachers of a secondary school. Public health doctors are in direct contact with pupils, their parents and the staff involved.“Patient confidentiality in this case, and in all cases, should be respected. The Department of Health will provide updated information as necessary.”The Department of Education said: “The Department of Education is available to assist the school in any way necessary. The Departments of Education and Health are in regular contact. The closing of this school was a decision made on public health grounds after risk assessment deemed it appropriate. All other schools will remain open. The Departments will continue to communicate with all schools on this issue.”Covid-19 is spread through close contact with an infected person’s body fluids (e.g. droplets from coughing or sneezing), or by touching surfaces that an infected person has coughed or sneezed on.The general public is advised to follow advice from the HSE and the Health Protection Surveillance Centre to protect their health."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4189767.1583108909!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus irish health officials to decide on restrictions on mass gatherings","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tPublic health officials are expected to decide on Monday on restrictions that will apply to mass gatherings in light of the worldwide coronavirus outbreak. Photograph: Jallaa MareyAFPThe Republic’s first case of coronavirus has forced the closure of a Dublin secondary school on infection control grounds.More than 400 students of the school are today beginning two weeks off after public health officials ordered it to shut to prevent the spread of the disease.Meanwhile, public health officials are expected to decide on Monday on restrictions that will apply to mass gatherings in light of the worldwide coronavirus outbreak. The restrictions to be decided by the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) may affect the St Patrick’s Day Festival and other big events over the coming months.NPHET made the decision to close the Dublin school after learning that the first person in the Republic to test positive for the virus had became ill after returning from Italy and going back to school. He is currently in isolation in a hospital in the capital.Public health officials have ordered the closure of the school in order to minimise the risk of person-to-person transmission of the disease. The decision was announced by NPHET at a briefing on Sunday evening.“Contact tracing has assessed that close contacts of this patient includes pupils and teachers of a secondary school,” said Dr Tony Holohan, chief medical officer with the Department of Health. “Public health doctors are in direct contact with pupils, their parents and the staff involved.”Dr Holohan called for patient confidentiality in this case, and all others, to be respected. The department would provide updated information as necessary, he said.However, the school was quickly identified on social media following the NPHET briefing.Dr Holohan said no other schools were affected and there was “no reason” for any other school to close. Travel to ItalyHe also expressed opposition to any further travel restrictions on Italy, over and above those already in place.With more than 1,100 cases, Italy has the highest concentration of coronavirus cases of any state in Europe. Parents of children attending the school last night received a letter from the HSE saying a case of novel coronavirus (Covid-19) had been identified and “to prevent the possible spread of infection” the school had been closed until Monday, March 16th. “As a precaution, all students and staff at the school are being treated as possible contacts of the case,” the letter states. “Because your child may have had contact with someone who has Covid-19, it is possible that they might have picked up the virus and could become unwell or pass the virus on to other people.”Public health staff will monitor children over the next 14 days “as a disease control measure”, according to the letter. Parents are asked to isolate children from others “without delay” if they develop symptoms of the disease over this time and to contact their GP.No visitorsThe letter asks students to limit their social interactions “in so far as possible” during this period, adding: “This includes not having visitors to the house.”Students have been told to avoid social gatherings and crowded settings, not to attend school, work or sporting events and to avoid contact with the elderly, those with chronic health problems and pregnant women.They should not travel outside Ireland and have been told to discuss travel plans within Ireland with public health officials. Other household members do not need to restrict their activities.Scotland last night reported its first case of the virus, while in France the Louvre museum remained shut over the weekend after the government banned large gatherings in confined spaces."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4185565.1582725192!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"what is coronavirus and what should i do if i have symptoms","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tCoronavirus: Those who have fallen ill are reported to suffer coughs, fever and breathing difficultie.  Photograph:iStockWhat is Covid-19 - the illness that started in Wuhan?It is caused by a member of the coronavirus family that has never been encountered before. Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. Many of those initially infected either worked or frequently shopped in the Huanan seafood wholesale market in the centre of the Chinese city.What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes?The virus can cause pneumonia. Those who have fallen ill are reported to suffer coughs, fever and breathing difficulties. In severe cases there can be organ failure. As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system. Many of those who have died were already in poor health.Should I go to the doctor if I have a cough?In Ireland, the medical advice is that if you have recently travelled from areas affected by coronavirus, you should call the HSE to inform them. If you are well and have not been in contact with coronavirus, you will be told to watch out for symptoms over the next 14 days. You can continue with your daily life and go to work as usual.If you have had close contact with a person who has coronavirus, you will be monitored for 14 days. A doctor will phone you daily to make sure you remain well. You will be asked to stay separate from other people as much as you can for 14 days. This includes not going to work.If you’ve been to an affected area in the last 14 days and have a cough, fever (high temperature), feel short of breath or have difficulty breathing people are advised to phone their GP or emergency department, stay indoors, avoid contact with other people, follow this advice even if your symptoms are mildMore HSE advice on what to do if you think you have been exposed to the virus can be found here.Should I avoid overseas travel?The Department of Foreign Affairs has advised against all non-essential travel to China, and against all travel to the Chinese province of Hubei.\u0026nbspThe full travel advice to Irish nationals is availablehere.Is the virus being transmitted from one person to another?China’s national health commission has confirmed human-to-human transmission, and there have been such transmissions elsewhere.How many people have been affected?As of February 25th, the outbreak has affected 80,000 people globally. In mainland China there have been 2,663 deaths among 77,658 cases, mostly in the central province of Hubei. More than 12,000 people affected in China have already recovered.The coronavirus has spread to at least other 30 other countries including Japan which also had hundreds of cases from a cruise ship, Italy, South Koream Hong Kong, Taiwan, France, Iran, the UK and the Philippines.Why is this worse than normal influenza, and how worried are the experts?We don’t yet know how dangerous the new coronavirus is, and we won’t know until more data comes in. The mortality rate is around 2 per cent in the epicentre of the outbreak, Hubei province, and less than that elsewhere.For comparison, seasonal flu typically has a mortality rate below 1 per cent and is thought to cause about 400,000 deaths each year globally. Sars had a death rate of more than 10 per cent.Another key unknown is how contagious the coronavirus is. A crucial difference is that unlike flu, there is no vaccine for the new coronavirus, which means it is more difficult for vulnerable members of the population – elderly people or those with existing respiratory or immune problems – to protect themselves. Hand-washing and avoiding other people if you feel unwell are important. One sensible step is to get the flu vaccine, which will reduce the burden on health services if the outbreak turns into a wider epidemic.Have there been other coronaviruses?Severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (Mers) are both caused by coronaviruses that came from animals. In 2002, Sars spread virtually unchecked to 37 countries, causing global panic, infecting more than 8,000 people and killing more than 750. Mers appears to be less easily passed from human to human, but has greater lethality, killing 35 per cent of about 2,500 people who have been infected.Is the outbreak a pandemic and should we panic?No. A pandemic, in WHO terms, is “the worldwide spread of a disease”. The spread of the virus outside China is worrying but not an unexpected development. The WHO has declared the outbreak to be a public health emergency of international concern. The key issues are how transmissible this new coronavirus is between people, and what proportion become severely ill and end up in hospital. Often viruses that spread easily tend to have a milder impact. Generally, the coronavirus appears to be hitting older people hardest, with few cases in children. – "},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Over 400 students at Dublin school begin two weeks off to prevent spread of infectionPricewatch: Glitch between AIB and French toll operators set to cause more traffic jamsPricewatch: Reader is \u0026lsquodisgusted\u0026rsquo after being told she cannot use vouchers for flight home to IrelandPricewatch: Many warranties run out after a year whereas your consumer rights don\u0026rsquotPricewatch: Reader describes failure to provide entitled refund as `very frustrating\u0026rsquoTrio was arrested following discovery of heroin and cocaine in Dublin operationGarda\u0026iacute investigate following an incident at a licensed premises on Paul StreetSome 130 Brazilian engineers to gather in Dublin for Engineers Week networking eventGreens select Saoirse McHugh, Pippa Hackett and Pauline O\u0026rsquoReilly\u0026lsquoRevolving door\u0026rsquo means many offenders choose prison over alternatives, says Chief JusticeClosure ordered after student identified as first case in RepublicIrish Rail criticises \u0026lsquoreckless and bizarre\u0026rsquo behaviour as train approachedStatus yellow snowice warning in place until Monday morningDirector of charity says political parties need to focus on humanitarian crisisHealthcare workers wearing hazmat type clothes met manMan in his 20s arrested over fatal crash near BorderRachel Browne, from Terenure, Dublin was filming in Veneto when outbreak beganRescue provokes angry social media comments from members of publicFatal road incidents occurred in Galway, Louth, Monaghan, Cavan since FridayPassenger fatally injured crash Sunday morning in Porridgetown, OughterardStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4187838.1582894224!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus advice wash your hands and avoid hugging kissing and hand shaking","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t A spectator wears a face mask at the Dubai Duty Free Tennis ATP Championships  in Dubai. Photograph: Ali HaiderEPAWith the coronavirus spreading rapidly across the world and one case now confirmed on the island of Ireland, much of the focus is on how to deal with the illness and care for the sick.But equally important, if not more important, in what is still a containment phase is how to minimise the odds of contracting the virus and stay safe as the illness spreads.The first and best advice is not to panic. Hysteria is a real enemy in a situation like this.“We are actually in a very delicate situation in which the outbreak can go in any direction based on how we handle it,” World Health Organisation head Dr Tedros Ghebreyesus said on Thursday night. “This is not a time for fear. This is a time for taking action to prevent infection and save lives now,” he added.There has been a huge amount of speculation about the illness, much of which is ill-informed or speculative but what we know for certain now is that the Covid-19 coronavirus is new and scientists are assessing how it spreads.We also know that similar viruses tend to spread via cough and sneeze droplets.’Social distancing’That is why so-called “social distancing” will be important in the days ahead. That means you should move at least a metre away from anyone who appears ill if you can. Avoid shaking hands or hugging or kissing people as part of a greeting.There has also been a lot of talk in recent days about face masks and alcohol based hand sanitisers but - by far - the most effective way to protect yourself is by regularly washing your hands.At the risk of stating the obvious, a quick rinse under the tap doesn’t get rid of dangerous germs. Hands need to be vigourously washed with soap and hot water for at least 20 seconds or the length of time it takes to sing the Happy Birthday song twice.Many people don’t dry their hands either which is why it is important to remember that damp actually can help germs to breed and allows them to spread more easily onto whatever you touch next.According to advice from the HSE, in addition to hand-washing people should also use alcohol based hand sanatisers if necessary.It is also important to cover your mouth and nose with a tissue or your sleeve when you cough and sneeze and to put used tissues into a bin and then wash your hands again. People should not touch their eyes, nose or mouth if their hands are not cleanThe HSE advice also reminds people to clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces.With regard to face masks the HSE advice is simple. People who are well or have no symptoms of illness should not use them. “There’s no evidence that using masks is of any benefit if you are not sick,” it says.People who should use face masks if they have or may have coronavirus or if they are in close contact with someone who has or may have coronavirus or if they are are a healthcare worker in close contact with people who have or may have coronavirus.Healthcare workersAccording to the HSE people who work in a healthcare setting can best protect themselves by regularly washing their hands and covering their mouths and noses when coughing and sneezing.Health care professionals dealing with cases or suspected cases of the coronavirus are being advised to wear personal protective equipment which includes a surgical face mask, a face shield or goggles, gloves and a clean, non-sterile, disposable long-sleeved gown. “If this is not available, wear a plastic apron and roll up sleevesIrish people displayed a propensity to stockpile during the two or three days that the beast from the east made its presence felt two years ago.Bread supplies dried up and fresh meat and dairy disappeared from supermarkets as supply chains displayed a worrying fragility.Will something similar happen if panic about the coronavirus mounts? Possibly.Certainly in other locations concerns over shortages have led some people to stockpile and there has been evidence of panic buying.Already in this country all the face masks have disappeared from pharmacies and even hardware shops.“I don’t think it is necessary, and I certainly don’t advise it,” Mark Woolhouse at the University of Edinburgh to New Scientist this week.Food suplyJennifer Nuzzo at Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security in Baltimore, Maryland told the same magazine that people should ensure they have at least three days’ food supply to hand as they are advised to do during hurricanes. “I’m not saying it’s specifically necessary in this case,” she said.Meanwhile virology blogger Ian Mackay recommended slowly building up a “pandemic stash”.Certainly do not stock up on prescription medicines - not only will you almost certainly not need them but you may make it harder for those that do need them to access them.

Photograph: Paula BronsteinGetty ImagesAs I sat waiting for my flight at Los Angeles International Airport, it was hard not to notice the number of prospective passengers wearing surgical masks. A mother and her adult son sat across from me and I watched as the son pulled his mask up above his mouth in order to slurp a pre-flight meal underneath it. By the time I had returned home to Dublin, the internet was plastered with images of people in airports wearing not only surgical masks but also plastic water jugs over their heads. The new strain of coronavirus has spread rapidly and people seek to protect themselves any way they can. The masks that many are now wearing have their origins in the development of antiseptic surgery in the 19th century and the 1918 influenza pandemic. There is debate over the efficacy of the masks to prevent the transmission of minute viruses, with some medical professionals arguing that regular hand-washing is much more effective. But there is a sense of comfort in a mask: it feels as though it is filtering the air you breathe in. It was, however, originally designed to filter the air you breath out. The mask was intended to protect the patient from the surgeon rather than the other way around.Joseph Lister is usually credited with the introduction of antiseptic practices in surgery during the 1860s and 1870s, at least in Britain and Ireland. The discovery of living germs as the causative agents of disease by Louis Pasteur and Robert Koch suggested to Lister and others that these germs might also cause sepsis in wounds. Carbolic acidLister introduced the washing of hands, instruments and wounds in carbolic acid. By the turn of the century, even further measures to maintain a clean surgical environment were introduced. Among these was the surgical mask (which had in fact been invented many decades before).If we think of a surgery today, we imagine the staff in scrubs, masks and gloves in a bare, clean room. Yet the scrubs and masks were actually introduced much later than other antiseptic methods. In 1898, an Edinburgh surgeon was only imagining a time in the future when “everyone concerned in an operation . . . shall cover each natural orifice of the body with an antiseptic mask, and clothing themselves in raiment scientifically pure, shall pass into an atmosphere freed from germs”. Instead, the surgeon often pounded across permeable wooden floors, his clothes covered with a non-sterilised linen “overall” and was often joined by a number of spectators. In 1905, the Irish doctor J Rupert Collins performed a series of experiments to prove that exhalations from the mouth (especially when singing or talking) contained bacteria to demonstrate that masks should be worn in the surgery. In 1914, another doctor felt that further demonstrations of the mask’s effectiveness were required.By the time the influenza pandemic began in 1918, however, surgical masks seem to have been in more regular use. And so the idea of using the mask to protect doctors (and nurses and family and friends) from patients grew in popularity. A great successDoctors wrote in to the British Medical Journal declaring that the surgical mask was a great success in preventing the spread of the disease. One claimed that a crowded ship of thousands of soldiers kept down the cases of influenza through isolation and the use of masks. Others cited the experience of using masks in outbreaks of pneumonic plague and other diseases spread by coughing. State public health services promoted the use of masks by those nursing the sick, but soon the wider public also began wearing masks.Photographs taken during the “Spanish flu” of 1918 to 1920 attest to the popularity of the gauze mask: policemen, typists, commuters, and even baseball players can all be seen wearing masks in an effort to ward off the disease. At the time, health professionals worried that these masks gave the wearers a false sense of security: to be effective they had to be cleaned (or changed) regularly and worn constantly. People rarely met these stringent conditions. Surgical masks have continued to appear in public every time there is a serious outbreak of a respiratory disease. Diseases like coronavirus cause us to look at the inside of a crowded airport terminal or a bus in the way that pioneering surgeons looked at operating theatres they wanted to keep clean: instead of harmless air they saw a soup of invisible germs.Dr Juliana Adelman lectures in history at Dublin City University"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4189582.1583083812!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit negotiations kick off in brussels","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDublin Port: under World Trade Organisation rules and tariffs, meat exports to the UK would be taxed at close to 50 per cent and dairy products at over 30 per cent. Photograph: Stephen CollinsCollinsNegotiators for Britain and the European Union meet for the first time on Monday to begin hashing out the future relationship between the UK and the world’s largest trading bloc.Britain left the EU after nearly half a century of membership in January, and is in a transitional phase until the end of this year, continuing to observe EU norms pending an agreement on what comes next. The UK and EU are poles apart on a series of sensitive issues from fishing to the so-called level playing field, any of which could collapse the talks. British negotiators say they want a free trade agreement with no obligations to align with EU standards, likening their aim to the arrangements the EU has with countries like Australia. The EU says ease of access depends on closeness of standards, because allowing the UK equal access with freer rules would disadvantage EU companies. It also says a bespoke Canada-style deal is not achievable before the end-of-year deadline Britain insists on, because without overarching alignment negotiators would have to work through each category of goods from oils to textiles one by one.‘Not Canada, not Australia’“The idea . . . is for the birds as you say in the UK,” French European affairs minister Amélie de Montchalin said in a speech in London. “You are not Canada, you are certainly not Australia, first of all because you can get here by train.”Irrespective of whether a deal is reached, the ambitions pursued by the government of prime minister Boris Johnson indicate a radical departure from the current situation, entailing customs and goods barriers on imports and exports to Britain. London now admits its choices entail “trade-offs” and “costs”, and trade commissioner Phil Hogan has warned companies must do more to prepare.The stakes for Ireland are high. The Irish economy will be between 3.2 per cent and 3.9 per cent smaller by 2030 if a free trade agreement is reached, compared to if current arrangements remained, according to analysis by Copenhagen Economics for the Irish Government. Britain says it will prepare for “no deal” if it feels insufficient progress has been made by June.Irish exportsSuch an outcome would mean almost twice as much economic pain for Ireland, with an estimated 7 per cent cost to gross domestic product. Britain would automatically begin trading under World Trade Organisation rules and tariffs in January. Meat exports to the UK would be taxed at close to 50 per cent and dairy products at over 30 per cent: according to the Central Bank, this could “potentially eliminate” Irish meat and dairy exports to Britain.Under the withdrawal agreement of last year, Northern Ireland is to remain aligned with the EU to avoid the need for checks along the land border with the Republic. This entails checks in the Irish Sea. The EU has made achievement of a deal contingent on the “effective implementation” of these arrangement, after secretary of state for Northern Ireland Brandon Lewis raised fears that London could renege by saying there would “not be a border down the Irish Sea, there’ll be unfettered access for business”.The dour days of talks begin with a meeting between the EU and UK chief negotiators Michel Barnier and David Frost. Talks will then split into 11 groups that will work concurrently, dedicated to specific areas like transport, energy, and fisheries. Four more rounds are planned by May, alternating between London and Brussels.Stay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4189356.1583083502!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"thousands try to enter greece after turkey opens borders","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMigrants from Syria, Iraq and sub-saharan African countries arrive on a dinghy near the city of Mytilene, after crossing part of the Aegean Sea from Turkey to the island of Lesbo on Sunday. Photograph: Elias MarcouReuters Thousands of migrants and refugees massed at Turkey’s western frontier on Sunday, trying to enter Greece by land and sea after Turkey said its borders were open to those hoping to head to Europe.In Syria, Turkish troops shot down two Syrian warplanes after the Syrian military downed a Turkish drone, a major escalation in the direct conflict between Syrian and Turkish forces.Turkey’s decision to ease border restrictions came amid a Russia-backed Syrian government offensive into Syria’s northwestern Idlib province.That offensive has killed dozens of Turkish troops and led to a surge of nearly a million Syrian civilians fleeing the fighting toward Turkey’s sealed border.Turkey backs the Syrian rebels fighting in Idlib province, and has sent thousands of troops into the area.Idlib is the last opposition-held stronghold in Syria.A Turkish official said the fighting in Idlib was directly linked to Turkey’s decision to open the gates for refugees to Europe.He said Ankara had changed its focus to preparing for the possibility of new arrivals from Syria “instead of preventing refugees who intend to migrate to Europe”.“Europe and others must take robust action to address this monumental challenge,” said Fahrettin Altun, the communications director for Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan.“We can’t be expected to do this on our own.”Mr Erdogan’s decision to declare his country’s borders with Europe open made good on a longstanding threat to let refugees into the continent.His announcement marked a dramatic departure from the current policy and an apparent attempt to pressure Europe into offering Turkey more support in dealing with the fallout from the Syrian war to its south.Under a €6 billion deal in 2016, Turkey agreed to stem the tide of refugees to Europe in return for financial aid, after more than a million people entered Europe in 2015.It has since accused the EU of failing to honour the agreement, and Mr Erdogan has frequently threatened to allow refugees and migrants to head to Europe unless more international support was provided.Turkey already hosts 3.6 million Syrian refugees, as well as others from Africa, Asia and the Middle East.On the Greek-Turkish land border, Greek army and police patrols thwarted attempts overnight by thousands to push into the country, using tear gas and stun grenades to keep crowds back.Officials said the situation was much calmer Sunday morning. But in the afternoon, authorities used tear gas and water cannons to push back another crowd attempting to cross.Migrants threw rocks and other objects, and one policeman was injured.The United Nations migration organisation reported at least 13,000 people had massed on Turkey’s land border by Saturday night, most of them apparently from Afghanistan.On the Greek islands, initial figures showed about 500 people had arrived from the nearby Turkish coast by Sunday afternoon.If the trend continued, it would mark an increase in the usual number of people who arrive on eastern Aegean islands from Turkey.Existing migrant camps on the islands are already dramatically overcrowded, and tensions there have mounted.In a small harbour on Lesbos, angry local residents refused to allow migrants, including families with young children and babies, to disembark from a dinghy that had just arrived.Groups of migrants who arrived on other parts of the island remained there for hours because local people prevented buses from reaching them to transport them to the main camp.More than 19,300 people already live in and around the island’s migrant camp, which has a capacity of 2,840.Protests by residents last week over the migrant situation degenerated into clashes with riot police on Lesbos and Chios.Greece said it was using “all available means” to tell migrants that the country’s borders were closed, including text messages to foreign mobile phones in the border area.In Syria, fighting escalated on the ground and in the skies.Syria’s official news agency Sana said the four pilots ejected and landed safely after their two jets were shot down.Turkey’s defence ministry said it had hit the two SU-24 aircraft as well as Syrian air defence systems after one of its aerial drones was downed.Earlier on Sunday, Syria said northwestern airspace was closed and any aircraft or drone that entered “will be treated as hostile and shot down”.The Syrian announcement followed two days of Turkish drone strikes in Idlib province.Syrian activists said the strikes killed more than 50 Syrian government forces and allied fighters.Turkey has lost 54 soldiers in February, including 33 killed Thursday in a single airstrike.Outraged, Mr Erdogan announced his country’s European borders were open on Saturday.The crisis in Idlib stems from a Syrian government offensive with Russian military support, which began on December 1st. – PARead more on how Europe attempts to deal with the migrant crisisStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4189800.1583106587!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"pete buttigieg ends campaign after poor result in fourth democratic primary","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tPete Buttigieg, former  Democratic presidential candidate, campaigning at a high school in Raleigh, North Carolina, on Saturday.  Photograph: New York Times\u0026nbspFormer US vice-president Joe Biden heads into Tuesday’s Super Tuesday contests with a huge boost after he surged to victory in the South Carolina primary on Saturday.Mr Biden, who has long argued that the southern state would be his “firewall,” clocked up a better-than-expected victory in the state, clinching almost 50 per cent of the vote.But former South Bend, Indiana, mayor Pete Buttigieg ended his presidential campaign on Sunday after a poor result in South Carolina. The 38 year-old – the first openly gay candidate to run for the Democratic nomination – had entered the race last year as a relative political unknown, but mounted a strong campaign, culminating with his victory in the Iowa caucus last month. But he ended at 8 per cent in South Carolina, polling particularly poorly among African-American voters. The strong performance by Mr Biden has imbued his campaign with a much-needed lift as the Democratic race enters a decisive phase with 14 states and one US territory due to vote on Tuesday. \u0026nbspSouth Carolina – the fourth state to hold its selection process after Iowa, New Hampshire and Nevada – also has the largest African-American population of the early-voting states. Fifty-six per cent of voters in South Carolina on Saturday were African-Americans, with 61 per cent of this cohort voting for Mr Biden. He won every county in the state, indicating the breadth of his support in South Carolina.Speaking to supporters in Columbia, Mr Biden thanked the voters of South Carolina for backing him. “Just days ago, the press and the pundits had declared this candidacy dead,” he declared. “Now thanks to all of you – the heart of the Democratic party – we’ve just won and we won big because of you, and we are very much alive.”He also made a barely veiled dig at front runner Bernie Sanders, asserting that Americans did not want a revolution but instead wanted “results”.“If Democrats want a nominee who’s a Democrat, a lifelong Democrat, a proud Democrat, an Obama-Biden Democrat, join us,” he said to cheers. “We have the option of winning big or losing big. That’s the choice.”Questions of candidacy Mr Biden’s commanding victory now puts him close behind Mr Sanders in the Democratic race. But he faces a tough battle tomorrow when more than a third of all delegates who will vote at the Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee in July are up for grabs. Polling suggests that Mr Sanders is on course to win California – the largest state in the union with a coveted 415 pledged delegates – and possibly Texas, though Mr Biden has been polling better in the state and is due to campaign there on Monday. Mr Biden is also polling relatively well in southern states voting on Tuesday such as Virginia and Alabama.The result of the South Carolina primary is also raising fresh questions about the viability of Amy Klobuchar. Her 3 per cent support is increasing pressure on her to drop out.Tom Steyer, the billionaire businessman who finished in third place at 11 per cent in South Carolina having invested millions in the state in advertising, suspended his campaign on Saturday night, stating that he could not see a path forward to the nomination. He has not yet endorsed another candidate.Michael Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York who has spent hundreds of millions of dollars in advertisements, was not on the ballot in South Carolina but is contesting Super Tuesday states – the results will offer the first indication of his level of support in the country. Prime timeMr Bloomberg was due to air a new prime time three-minute ad addressing his ability to deal with the coronavirus, the latest in a series of polished TV and online ads devised by his campaign.Mr Biden’s resolute victory on Saturday in South Carolina could underscore his argument that he is the best person to take on Mr Sanders.The Vermont senator, who won the nomination contests in New Hampshire, Nevada, and the popular vote in Iowa, responded to his second-place showing in South Carolina at a rally in Virginia, one of the Super Tuesday states. Mr Sanders’ surge in the first three primary states, had sparked alarm among many on the moderate side of the Democratic party that the high number of candidates is effectively splitting the non-Sanders vote.“There are a lot of states in this country. No one wins them all,” he said to his supporters. “I want to congratulate Joe Biden tonight.” But he urged his supporters to look ahead to Super Tuesday, where he is well-placed to win a number of states, building in part on his growing popularity among Hiic voters.Tweeting late on Saturday after the Biden victory was announced, US president Donald Trump tweeted: “Congratulations to Sleepy Joe Biden!”In a separate tweet he claimed that Democrats were “working hard to destroy the name and reputation of Crazy Bernie Sanders, and take the nomination away from him!”Stay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons february 2020","story":"Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2019 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514.  ​To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to https:telegraph.newsprints or call 0191 603 0178New neighbours rally round Harry and Meghan to keep paparazzi at bayPete Buttigieg pulling out of White House race after big win for Joe Biden in South CarolinaJoe Biden aiming to establish himself as the best moderate candidate to beat Bernie Sanders ahead of \u0026#39Super Tuesday\u0026#39The key actors battling for control of the Sahel Battle for the Sahel: the new frontline in the war on terrorBritish troops back on front line against jihadists as war on terror spreads to Africa\u0026#39Coronavirus will get worse before it gets better\u0026#39, Boris Johnson warns as UK cases jump 57 per cent in a dayBritish climber who was part of expedition that conquered Himalayan mountain for first time is missing in Scotland avalancheMcDonald \u0026amp Dodds, review: great detective, shame about the showWorkers \u0026#39to share in £1.8billion pay rise\u0026#39 if US trade deal comes offDowning Street and Department of Health locked in row over access to EU pandemic warning systemGeorge Harrison\u0026#39s guitar that he gifted to a friend who played it better is worth £400,000, Antiques Roadshow saysTory rebels bid to block northern section of HS2 in fresh Commons vote on MondaySchoolchildren in isolation as coronavirus infects staff at two schoolsTop Gear, series finale review: now here’s a bombshell – Top Gear moved me to tearsComment: From pandemics to data security, globalisation means we must be more resilientInvestigation: Pope’s envoy imposed \u0026#39Stasi-style\u0026#39 gagging orders on school staff and \u0026#39made\u0026#39 poor choristors  \u0026#39musical and academic refugees\u0026#39Three brothers on bursaries \u0026#39discarded\u0026#39 by prestigious cathedral choir schoolTurkey steps up Idlib offensive as Greece suspends asylum applications in fear of migrant spikeFirst positive case of coronavirus confirmed in ScotlandBritish Embassy workers withdrawn from Iran as coronavirus case numbers spikeWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"thousands asylum seekers ferried eu border pawns turkeys political","story":"Thousands of migrants were trapped on Saturday in a squalid no-man\u0027s-land beyond Turkey\u0027s border with Greece, as the realisation dawned on them that they had become pawns in a political stunt hatched by the Turkish government.Huddled crowds from Afghanistan, Iraq, Somalia and Syria gathered on a narrow road that sits between Turkish and Greek territory, their path to Europe blocked by razor wire and armed EU border guards.Less than 24 hours ago, many believed their prayers had been answered when the Turkish government announced it was opening its side of the border and laid on a fleet of unmarked, white buses to ferry migrants to its frontier with Greece. Now they are stuck in freezing temperatures with little food or water, resorting to pulling down tree branches for firewood and erecting makeshift tents, as it becomes clear that the path to Europe has been tightly sealed.Just yards away from angry confrontations between migrants and border guards, children no older than four or five, who were wrapped up in coats and wooly hats, ran around in the mud. A Greek government spokesman described the wave of migration as an onslaught, adding that it would do whatever it takes to protect its borders. And in Austria, Chancellor Sebastian Kurz hinted at border closures in the event that Greece failed to keep the crowds at bay.Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, Turkey\u0027s president, has long threatened to let refugees into Europe if they don\u0027t meet his demands. His latest move marks the most serious escalation in his attempts to secure more help from Europe and Nato in tackling the refugee crisis in Syria, where almost a million have fled war in Idlib province in recent weeks.   In a speech on Saturday Mr Erdoğan, Turkey\u0027s president, claimed that 18,000 people had amassed on the border and threatened to send a further 30,000.But in reality the number of people gathered at the main crossing, near the Turkish city of Edirne, appeared no higher than 5,000, while in nearby Ipsala a Turkish police officer said around 500 people had arrived.In what may soon become a sprawling refugee camp unless the crowds are dispersed by Turkish forces, women and children huddled around fires, masking their faces from the smoke.Rumours swirled at the border on Saturday about Turkish authorities transporting most of the migrants back to Istanbul at the end of the weekend, should Mr Erdogan feel his point has been made.The majority of those gathered in Edirne were young men, who angrily shouted at the Greek soldiers guarding their side of the border, behind a barbed-wire fence that stretched as far as the eye could see in each direction.Further south, dozens of migrants were attempting sea crossings to the Greek island of Lesbos in dinghies, with limited success.Some migrants claimed they had been beaten by Greek police, and that in at least one incident those who tried to cross into the EU had their shoes confiscated.Others told the Sunday  of their devastation as they realised they had been duped were now trapped at the border, Many who were unable to board free buses have resorted to paying taxi drivers around 100 lira (£12) and claim they are now out of money.Some migrants rode in on the back of pickup trucks driven by locals hoping to make some easy cash. Meanwhile, a group of taxi drivers bartered with migrants at a crossing near the Turkish town of Ipsala for transport back to Istanbul, after they gave up on entering Europe.Abdullah, an 18-year-old Afghan who came to Turkey with his five siblings six months ago, said they felt their hearts leap as they were waved across the Turkish side of the border, only to be greeted with barbed wire, soldiers and tear gas at the Greek side.We are devastated...we haven\u0027t even tried to cross again because we are too scared. One group today came back without any shoes, cell phones or bags. They were confiscated by the Greek police, he said.They lied to us, they said we could leave and now we are trapped here. We just want to go back to Ankara now but we don\u0027t have the money. I have no idea what to do.One Iranian refugee who said he was fleeing the theocracy in Tehran accused Mr Erdogan of ensuring him and his friends in a cruel political game, while two women from Somalia said they were ready to go back to Istanbul.Most of the people gathered at the border did not appear to have arrived from Syria\u0027s war-torn Idlib province, as they said they had already lived in Turkey without social security or ID cards for more than a year.We have been waiting for four years for this chance and now we are stuck here because the other side is closed, added an 18-year-old from Kabul who gave his name as Hourshid.We have jobs in Turkey but we left them to come here. Now I guess we have to go back.Since 2016, under the terms of the EU-Turkey migration deal, Ankara has been halting refugee flows towards the EU, which in turn agreed to give Turkey €3billion (£2.3 billion) and visa-free travel for Turkish citizens.Josep Borrell Fontelles, the EU\u0027s foreign policy chief, has said that the Turkish government has offered “reassurances” that Turkey intends to continue abiding by that agreement, even though its side of the border has been thrown open.As groups continued to arrive at Edirne on Saturday evening, Turkey continued to pile pressure on Western leaders for more military support on Syria and used the threat of more migration waves into Europe as a key bargaining chip.Mevlut Cavusoglu, the Turkish foreign minister, said the government has urged the United States to provide Patriot missiles as backup in northwestern Syria, following Syrian regime airstrikes this month which killed 55 Turkish soldiers.The Turkish president also called on Vladimir Putin, the Russian president, to step aside in Syria and allow Turkish forces to battle the Syrian regime alone.As night fell on Edirne, yet more migrants began to realise they had been duped as part of a cynical geopolitical game.As they trudged back through no-man\u0027s-land, they passed the sign in Turkish which had greeted them 24 hours earlier, when they were filled with false hope of safe passage to Europe.Turkey\u0027s border is its honour, the sign says.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"anglicans believe gay couples have right marry yougov poll suggests","story":"The number of Anglicans who believe that gay couples have a right to marry “are now clearly in the majority”, according to a new YouGov poll.Despite the Church of England’s official stance against same-sex relationships, almost half of Anglicans now believe that same sex marriage is right, with well over two-thirds of those aged 50 and under agreeing. The figures have prompted accusations that the Church of England is “kicking the can down the road” regarding attitudes to the LGBT community. The 2020 poll was commissioned by the Ozanne Foundation, which works with religious organisations around the world to eliminate discrimination and prejudice based on sexuality and gender. Jayne Ozanne, the Foundation’s director and a prominent gay evangelical within the Church of England – who had also commissioned the previous 2016 You Gov poll said: “These results show that those opposed to same-sex marriage are now clearly in the minority.”The results also show the huge mismatch between the Church of England\u0027s leadership and those who worship in our churches. “This is deeply worrying for the future of our Church.  Attitudes are changing fast, yet the Church of England appears to remain intransigent on a matter that is affecting the lives of so many of its LGBT+ members, their families and friends.  “What is more, younger Anglicans - often found within evangelical churches - are overwhelmingly clear where they stand on this issue, with nearly three quarters of the under 50s now believing in same sex marriage.  “The Church of England cannot afford to ‘kick the can down the road’ any longer, and needs to urgently agree a way forward so that those who wish to embrace and celebrate same sex marriages can do so.Ms Ozanne added: “To pretend that this is an issue on which many have not yet formed a view is to misunderstand the reality of what is happening in our pews.”For decades, the church has been ided over how to deal with LGBT issues and has recently embarked on a large study of human sexuality, Living in Love and Faith, which is due to be published later this year.The YouGov research surveyed attitudes amongst 5169 people in total across Great Britain, including 1,171 Anglicans in England.The figures come just a weeks after the Archbishops apologised for the House of Bishops’ recent “pastoral statement” on civil partnerships, which condemned sex outside heterosexual marriage. Towards the end of January, the Church of England stated that civil partnerships should be no more than “sexually abstinent friendships”. The guidance sparked furious criticism from LGBT campaigners both within and outside the church and prompted almost 4,000 people to sign an open letter to the Archbishops, organised by Ms Ozanne and three other Church of England members, that stated the “Church had become a laughing-stock to the nation”.Commenting on the YouGov poll results Rt Revd Paul Bayes, the Bishop of Liverpool and Chair ofthe Foundation, said: “These results provide a challenge to us in leadership within the Church of England to ensure that we understand the views of the people we serve. “Attitudes are indeed changing quickly, and we must be open to what the Holy Spirit is saying to us through them if we are to be an effective witness of God’s love to the nation.”A spokesperson for the Church of England added: “We know that there is disagreement in the Church of England over the question of same-sex marriage.“That is why we are preparing a major new set of teaching and learning resources that will help the Church to understand this question in the wider context of identity, sexuality and marriage.“We hope the resources will enable people in the Church of England to think more deeply about these matters and so to understand the differences among us better.  We do this because the Church values everyone, regardless of their convictions, as a person loved and made in the image of God.“By learning from and listening to one another, guided by Holy Spirit, the Church will find ways forward rooted in scripture and the Christian faith.”More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2020/03/01/TELEMMGLPICT000226360796_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqqVzuuqpFlyLIwiB6NTmJwd_IMXDuG20-9jzaA0wHyVc.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"pandemics data security globalisation means must resilient","story":"Pandemics like Covid-19 are just one of many threats that we must be better prepared forBehind the scenes in Whitehall, ministers and officials routinely wargame scenarios that most of us prefer not to think about. Marauding firearms attacks, 911-style plane hijacks, and global pandemics are just some of the crises for which the exercises are designed to prepare ministers and officials.The details, when they leak, can sound scary. But the fact that governments test decisions like the distribution of scarce drugs and have plans for makeshift morgues should be reassuring, rather than a cause for alarm. The details of particular exercises depend on the hypothetical scenario being tested – which is often the worst imaginable – and mean little for how a real terror attack might play out, or how coronavirus will spread.The exercises do mean, however, that ministers and officials – including the agencies responsible for operations on the ground – are more likely to be ready when an emergency comes. And, of course, experience teaches us that emergencies happen. Our circumstances change, and the nature of the dangers we face evolves, but life is inevitably and inherently about coping with risk. Somehow, this is something we have forgotten. When the Cold War ended, the danger of nuclear strikes appeared to fade. The risk of ethnic, ideological or interests-driven conflict between states also seemed to diminish. The common assumption was that liberal democracy had triumphed, the nations and peoples of the world would grow more alike, and we were living in a peaceful “new world order”. Science, reason and the market would ensure we would grow healthier and more prosperous.Yet with the rise of China, a revanchist Russia, rogue states like Iran and North Korea, and aggressive non-state organisations like al-Qaeda and Isil, this complacency has already proved misplaced.And we face new dangers, too. As our lives and economies become more dependent on digital technologies, we are increasingly reliant on the resilience and security of the systems – and the ethics, goodwill and cooperation of their owners – that provide them.The interconnected nature of the world economy means we are more exposed than ever to decisions made by foreign governments, financiers and business leaders. When Chinese growth falters, for example, the knock-on effects for the world economy will be severe.And there are other risks associated with globalisation. As the European migration crisis showed, in the modern world huge movements of people are possible. The decisions made by foreign leaders – like Angela Merkel in 2015, or Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who last week opened Turkey’s border with Greece – can cause grave consequences for many countries other than their own.As coronavirus is proving, the scale of international travel means viruses can be difficult to contain. Of course, Covid-19 appears to be especially contagious, and it was obvious from an early stage that there was little chance of containing it in Wuhan or even China. But its spread is likely to be even faster, thanks to Beijing’s initial response, and the incompetence and secrecy of states such as Iran.Then there is climate change. It is doubtful that global carbon emissions can be reduced quickly enough and at sufficient scale to prevent our climate changing, whatever Britain decides to do unilaterally. Heathrow might not be allowed one extra runway, but India and China are each planning to build hundreds of new airports in the next 10 years. And their overall emissions – which dwarf ours – will go on rising. As our climate changes and extreme weather becomes more common, we need to become better prepared to handle sudden events such as floods and storms as well as the longer-term change in our environment.So just as the Government prepares for what it calls “civil contingencies”, it needs to get better at preparing the public for the inevitability of unfortunate events. It needs to work out what role it can play in leading improvements in international institutions and cooperation. And it needs to assess whether its policies strike the right balance between prevention and preparation.Ministers were sensible, for example, to avoid overreacting to the initial spread of coronavirus. If they had prematurely ordered schools to shut down, there would have been an immediate and unnecessary blow to the economy as parents stayed at home to look after their children. But the experience of Covid-19 so far has already exposed important questions.The first stage of the Department of Health’s strategy is “containment”, yet direct flights from China to Britain were allowed to continue at the height of the contagion. Government travel advice for British nationals heading to affected regions has on occasion been contradictory and confusing.Nobody should expect the NHS constantly to operate at over-capacity for fear of a sudden surge in patients, but the Nuffield Trust has pointed out that there is “little fuel in the tank” should patient numbers spike. Ministers need to find ways of scaling up and down capacity according to the severity of a health crisis.British researchers are playing their part in the global effort to find a coronavirus vaccine, but Britain has no vaccine manufacturing plants. If and when a vaccine is discovered, experts have warned that we will need to wait in the queue to get it.As a country that prides itself on its adherence to international free trade, the UK has long been content for its companies to take their place in transnational supply chains. But with coronavirus, as with our new 5G telecommunications system – which ministers insist we can only build with the help of the Chinese company, Huawei – we may come to rue the lack of a national, or at least Western, capability to produce what we need. Countries have strategic necessities that can trump the purity of the market.This is just one lesson we need to learn if we want to improve our resilience. Global interdependency brings great advantages but new risks. We must get ourselves accustomed to living with these risks and, from new international institutions to reserved national capabilities, we have to do more to prevent and protect ourselves from harm.The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

teaching staff from at least two schools, prompting condemnation from parents. A class of infants in Reading and primary school pupils in the Cotswolds were among those facing a fortnight indoors as the effects of a devastating outbreak in Italy reached the UK.Boris Johnson sought to quell rising concern about the risk the virus posed to the classroom, saying he felt schools should still operate normally “as far as possible”.Speaking to reporters at a Public Health England centre in Colindale, north London, the Prime Minister added: “I don’t want kids being sent home unnecessarily.” As many as 30 children from the Willow Bank Infant School in Woodley, Reading are believed to be at risk after a staff member returned from holiday in northern Italy. The woman, who has not been named, spent one day in the school last Monday having flown home the day before, but only started to suffer from symptoms on Wednesday. By Saturday, she had tested positive for coronavirus and was being rushed to hospital in London, while pupils, colleagues and family with whom she had been in close contact have been required to go into quarantine. Cases of the potentially deadly illness spiraled over the weekend, with the Government saying the total had reached 35 in the UK as 12 fresh patients were confirmed on Sunday.Five of the new cases, from Surrey and Essex, are of particular concern to authorities as they contracted the virus without going abroad, meaning those who infected them remain at large.The school employee from Reading was said to have behaved “entirely properly” by remaining inside and ringing 111 when she felt unwell, rather than visiting a surgery. She is understood to have been staying near, but not in, one of the towns placed on lockdown by Italian authorities as the country struggled to contain the spread of the virus. The school will remain closed for several days after being left short-staffed by the number of people in self-isolation. However, frustration has begun brewing among parents, who questioned whether the self-isolation protocol was fit for purpose. Currently, only iniduals returning from the quarantined zones in northern Italy are being advised to self-isolate, while those who have visited the region north of Pisa, such as the member of staff at Willow Bank, should only do so if they develop symptoms.Natalie and Aaron Long are facing two weeks indoors at their home in Woodley, Berkshire, after their five-year-old son came into contact with the infected member of staff. Mr Long, 44, told the : “We are a bit gobsmacked that someone would come over back from Italy, knowing full well what has been going on, and come into a school with little children.”The family has also decided to keep their older daughter, aged seven, home from school. “Some of those children at school have underlying health conditions,” added Mrs Long, 37. “Our daughter will be eight years old soon, she is terrified about it. We have had to have quite honest conversations. She was worried because she is asthmatic.”Another of the coronavirus cases identified over the weekend - in Gloucestershire - involved a member of staff at St Mary’s primary school in Tetbury. A letter to parents from the headteacher, Jo Woolley, said “all people who have been in contact with the person” had been contacted and told to exclude themselves from school.A second case of the virus in Gloucestershire, revealed yesterday, was said to be linked. A secondary school in the east of Ireland was similarly forced to close after pupils and teachers were in contact with a man suffering from coronavirus.As Britain steeled itself to respond to a major outbreak, plans to call upon retired doctors and nurses were dealt a blow after health experts warned that older people were at far greater risk from coronavirus. The average 2 per cent death rate was found to soar to 15 per cent for the over 80s, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). Dr Jonathan Leach, Honorary Secretary of the Royal College of GPs, told the : “Retired healthcare professionals have a huge amount to offer the health service, and many would do so willingly, but any drafting in of their skills to help deal with Covid-19 would need to be their choice and with their full understanding of the situation and any associated risks, and that every effort is made to ensure they are protected.”Heightened anxiety over the arrival of a potential pandemic to the UK has also led to a spike in stockpiling measures from food companies relying on Italian produce. Warehouses are being filled with at least two months’ worth of supplies such as pasta, mozzarella and pesto amid fears Italy could impose a limit on foreign exports. More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2020/02/27/17/correction-0.jpg","title":"stock market correction coronavirus meaning definition sp 500 stoxx 600","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.What does a correction actually mean?

It may give rise to a further cycle of fearful selling.It could presage a 20 per cent decline in values, the definition of a “bear market”.More broadly, falling share prices matter in that many of us are invested in stock markets through our pension or other saving schemes.So when markets\u0026nbspfall, we are worse off.It’s estimated that more than $3 trillion of value has been lost from listed companies across the world this week.\u0026nbspHowever, providing we are not about to retire tomorrow we shareholders are only worse off on paper. Shares in the long term have tended to rise.Any other reason to be relaxed amid the market mayhem?Some analysts argue that major stock sell offs and corrections can be healthy if they bring an overheated market down to earth.“Stocks have moved upwards for many months without a significant correction — and there is a compelling argument to make that a correction is overdue,” says Kristina Hooper of Invesco.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

That’s lower activity, Mr Carney told Sky News.There’s less tourism - as you can see on our streets here in the UK. That’s lower activity as well.“We would expect world growth would be lower than it otherwise would be, and that has a knock-on effect on the UK.Oil prices also fell below $50 a barrel on the expectation that\u0026nbspindustrial activity will slow down sharply.Companies that rely on tourism have been particularly badly hit as people call off trips.

The only other similar object was spotted in 2006 and has since left its orbit around the Earth.Earth has a new ‘minimoon’, scientists announceThe newly discovered satellite will also leave Earth’s orbit, in the coming months, leaving\u0026nbspastronomers scrambling to get images of the object and understand its origin.“Obtaining the images was a scramble for the Gemini team because the object is quickly becoming fainter as it moves away from Earth. It is expected to be ejected from Earth’s orbit altogether in April,” said John Blakeslee, head of science at the international Gemini Observatory, which was responsible for the new images.In the picture, the object can be seen glowing at the centre, with stars streaking across because the telescope was moving to track the object as it moved around the Earth.The image was taken on 24 February, soon after\u0026nbsp2020\u0026nbspCD3 was first spotted.Astronomers hope to get more images of the object, in an attempt to learn more about it.They will look in particular to understand how bright it is shining and how much light it reflects – if it is especially dim, then it is likely to be a rocky body, but if it is shining brighter it is more likely to be a reflective piece of debris, such as a used rocket booster.“Additional observations to refine its position will help us determine this mystery object’s orbit and its possible origin,” he said.Astronomers expect to find many more such objects as new ways of observing them come online.The Gemini Observatory is part of the\u0026nbspNSF’s\u0026nbspNational Optical-Infrared Astronomy Research Laboratory, which is currently preparing the\u0026nbspVera C\u0026nbspRubin Observatory, which will scan the sky of seeing yet more similar objects.“We expect to find a population of these objects once the Rubin Observatory is operational,” said Mr Fedorets\u0026nbspin a statement. “Stay tuned!”Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It\u0027s not as glamorous as it sounds,” she said. “If anyone is ever planning on having sex on top of a pile of cash: don\u0027t. Or maybe real money is a bit softer, but the fake money is like paper, and when I got up off the bed, I turned around to get my robe and everyone gasped. I said, \u0027What is it?\u0027 And they said, \u0027You look like you\u0027ve been whipped a million times. Your back is covered in a thousand red scratches.”During the filming of the sequel to Steven Spielberg’s Jaws, cast members were terrified when real hammerhead sharks started circling them in the sea. The trouble was that their screams went unheard. The crew didn’t think they were in real danger to start with because it was written into the script that they yelled for help at that point.330 Sylvester Stallone and Dolph Lundgren – Rocky IVThe fourth in the Rocky film franchise to focus on the boxing career of the fictional Rocky Balboa, played by Sylvester Stallone, has some gripping and authentic-looking fight scenes. It’s no wonder then that during filming, Stallone actually asked Dolph Lundgren, who plays his opponent, Ivan Drago, to try to knock him out for real. But Lundgren hit him with such force that he was sent to the hospital and was in intensive care for over a week.Brando was infamous for his bad on-set behaviour. That is one reason why Paramount was nervous about getting him involved in Francis Ford Coppola’s mafia film. It didn’t start well, when on the first day of shooting, the actor who played the patriarch in the family, Vito Corleone, missed his overnight flight from LA to New York. His scene was rescheduled for the next day, but it cost producers $40,000.In his autobiography, rapper Gucci Mane said he was so tired on set of Harmony Korine’s crime film Spring Breakers, that he fell asleep during his big sex scene. The rapper, who plays Big Arch, a rival drug dealer of James Franco’s Alien character in the film, is seen having sex with one woman, while another sucks his toes. “I couldn’t keep my eyes open. I was knocked out, snoring . . . Harmony kept having to wake me up for takes.” In another interview, he explained why he was so exhausted. “I had a concert down there in St Petersburg, Florida, one of the days I had to shoot a scene. Same night. We started shooting at 10 o\u0027clock in the evening until 1 or 2 o\u0027clock.”The action star broke his ankle while doing his own stunt on set of the sixth Mission Impossible. The scene sees Cruise completing a fast rooftop jump from one building to another, when his foot slams into the side of the wall. But instead of collapsing in a heap, he keeps going as if nothing has happened, until the end of the scene when he can be seen hobbling away. He said: “I knew instantly my ankle was broken and I really didn’t want to do it again so just got up and carried on with the take. I said, ‘It’s broken. That’s a wrap. Take me to hospital’ and then everyone got on the phone and made their vacation arrangement.”730 Lizzy Caplan and Michael Sheen – Masters of SexCaplan was nervous when she had to take her clothes off in front of co-star Sheen in the TV series. It made her feel better that they were both shaky. But then disaster struck. “And we complete the scene, I place the hand on my breast and they yell “Cut” and he immediately walks over to a garbage can and throws up.“ Turns out Sheen had eaten something that upset his stomach, but Caplan didn\u0027t know that. She said: ”My whole self-confidence plummeted to the ground and I realised that I\u0027m a monster and anybody who touches me will immediately start vomiting and that’s just the way it\u0027s going to be.”830 Nina Dobrev and Paul Wesley – The Vampire DiariesNina Dobrev accidentally broke Paul Wesley\u0027s finger while shooting a sex scene in The Vampire Diaries.930 Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan - 50 Shades of GreyObviously this could be a load of hype to promote the first erotic film in the franchise, but there were certainly a lot of terrible sex scenes in which things could go wrong. Johnson, who plays Anastasia Steele, becomes romantically linked to Christian Grey (Jamie Dornan) and they act out their BDSM desires. Johnson, who wore a modesty thong glued to her body while Dornan wore a “wee bag” to protect his modesty, said: “I got whiplash once from him throwing me on the bed. So f***ing painful. I wish we had a gag reel from the shoot.”Michael Imperioli is best known for his role as Tony Soprano’s protégé, Christopher Moltisanti in The Sopranos. During the filming of his death scene in Martin Scorsese’s Goodfellas, Imperioli cut his hand on a glass and was taken to hospital, where the doctors sped in to treat his fake bullet wounds.During the filming of Groundhog Day, Murray was more irritable than usual as he was going through a orce and was prone to disappearing from set. He had been asked to get an assistant to ease communication between him, the director Harold Raims and the studio. He was against the idea, so he hired somebody who was deaf and spoke only in sign language, which nobody on set, including Murray, could understand. Ramis said: “Bill said, ‘Don’t worry, I\u0027m going to learn sign language.’ And I think it was so inconvenient that in a couple of weeks, he gave that up. That’s anti-communication, you know? Let’s not talk.”It was a small mishap for Dunham when her nude patch kept falling off in scenes that required nudity. Dunham, who plays aspiring writer Hannah in her comedy-drama TV series Girls, said: “I stopped wearing the nude patch after the first season of Girls. There’s not one guy who works on that show who hasn’t seen the inside of my vagina. You glue it over your vagina. It gets sweaty and always falls off. My male co-stars, at the end of the day, don’t care.”In one scene of Quentin Tarantino’s 2015 Western thriller, Jennifer Jason Leigh as Daisy Domergue plays a guitar. It is a vintage Martin guitar from the 19th century, worth roughly $40,000, which had been loaned out from the Martin Museum in Pennsylvania. But a misunderstanding on Russell’s part led to an expensive mistake. The valuable guitar was meant to be swapped over with a replica prop when he snatched it from her. Russell had not read the memo, though, and smashed the antique guitar against a wall, while shouting “Music time is over”. As a result, the Martin Museum – which called the guitar a priceless, irreplaceable artefact – vowed never to loan guitars out to movies again.1430  Robert Pattinson and Julianne Moore – Maps to the StarsThe Twilight and Lost City of Z actor played Jerome, a limousine driver and struggling actor, in David Cronenberg’s acerbic Hollywood satire. It was while he got intimate in the back of a car with Moore’s character, a washed-up actress, that he ran into problems and started sweating profusely. “I sweat like a f***ing crazy person,” he said. “I was trying to literally catch drops of sweat to stop them hitting her back. Afterwards she was like, \u0027Are you having a panic attack?\u0027 It was so embarrassing.”1530 Anne Hathaway and Jake Gyllenhaal - Love and other DrugsHathaway accidentally stripped off too soon when she thought cameras were rolling during the filming of Love and other Drugs. She stars alongside Jake Gyllenhaal in the erotic film based on the non-fiction book Hard Sell: The Evolution of a Viagra Salesman by Jamie Reidy. “I have to remove my trench coat and be nude underneath, and I thought we were filming,” she said. “But it turned out we were just rehearsing and I got unnecessarily naked in front of a lot of people!”In a 2007 episode of the reboot of Battlestar Galactica TV series, Olmos’s character William Adama, the commanding officer of BS Galactica, is playing around with a model ship when he gets carried away by improvising and smashes it to smithereens. The model ship was, however, museum quality and according to Olmos, who had no idea at the time, it was worth roughly $200,000.1730 Allison Janney and Michael Lerner in Life During WartimeDuring a sex scene against a wall for the 2009 comedy-drama, Allison Jamey\u0027s co-star Michael Lerner went crashing to the ground. “We had to have sex up against a wall and they started spraying us with glistening stuff to make us look sweaty, but no one seemed to realise that we were standing on a marble floor,” she said. “They said ‘Action’ and he pulled me up against the wall and his feet slipped out from under him and he went crashing down on the floor. It was terrible, but it was one of those moments I\u0027ll never forget.”1830 Ryan Reynolds and Olivia Wilde in The Change-UpThe Deadpool star was taken aback when his co-star Olivia Wilde painted smiley faces on her underwear during a sex scene, that he completely forgot what he was doing. “In the scene, she’s sitting there and I take her top off and the bra off, and she has those panties on, but she’s drawn these adorable little smiley faces on them,” he said. “And I forget every line. Not just from this movie, but from every other movie I’ve done.”1930 Sean Connery and Lana Turner – Another Time, Another PlaceSean Connery and the American actress Lana Turner were filming a love scene when Turner’s gangster boyfriend Johnny Stompanato showed up uninvited. Turner was playing an American journalist who has a love affair with a BBC war correspondent (played by Connery). But her boyfriend was so jealous that he showed up with a gun in his hand, and threatened to kill Connery. Bravely, Connery grabbed the gun from his hand and twisted the boyfriend’s wrist until he fled off the set. Turner’s turbulent life continued when her daughter Cheryl killed Stompanato with a kitchen knife fearing that he was going to kill her mother after he showed up at their house in the US – but in the trial it was deemed as justifiable homicide.2030 Christian Serratos and Michael Cudlitz - The Walking DeadThe long-running TV show focuses more on blood and violence than sex. But during one scene between Rosita (Christian Serratos) and Abraham (Michael Cudlitz) things nearly went pear-shaped when they had to get intimate in front of 30 crew members, who  were drinking coffee and eating ramen noodles. Cudlitz, who was on top of Serratos, said they were nearly naked but covered – but then as they were “humping”, the cover got knocked off, leaving Serratos practically naked. The actor said: “Then we just started laughing, because it\u0027s ridiculous. It\u0027s two people, we barely know each other, lying on top of each other naked.”During the filming of Blazing Saddles, a man wandered into a scene of the film. He wasn’t part of the crew or cast but when the director Mel Brooks got the man moved on, he returned again, seemingly not understanding the request. Brooks then sent over a waiver for him to sign and left him in the movie for a laugh. He can be spotted at the end of the film wearing a jumper and standing on a sidewalk watching the action as people run out of the Warner Brothers studio front gates.Not really a mishap, but it was certainly an awkward moment behind the camera for the then 17-year-old actor, who legally had to have his mother on set for his first-ever sex scene, in which he says, “It’s in. Oh, my God, it’s in.” “She got there, and I had fake sexual intercourse in front of her,” Mintz-Plasse said. “Afterwards we didn\u0027t talk about it we still don\u0027t speak about that moment.”2330 Sylvester Stallone and Sharon Stone – The SpecialistStallone and Stone had absolutely no chemistry in the 1994 American spy thriller, but when the Basic Instinct star refused to get naked for the shower scene, it was potentially a huge problem. Stallone admitted they had to get drunk on vodka for filming to even start. “Ok. Let it be known, I didn’t want this scene because Sharon was not cooperating. We get to the set and she decided not to take off her robe off. The director asks only a few of the crew to remain, and she still won’t take it off. I promised her I wouldn’t take any liberties, so what’s the problem? She said, ‘I’m just sick of nudity.’ I asked her if she could get sick of it on somebody else’s film. She was having none of it, so I went down to my trailer, bought back a bottle of Black Death vodka that was given to me by Michael Douglas and after half-a-dozen shots we were wet and wild.”2430 Margot Robbie and Alexander Skarsgard – The Legend of TarzanApparently Robbie – who plays Jane - punched her Tarzan co-star Skarsgard after getting carried away during the filming of their climatic sex scene. The director David Yates asked them to be a little more violently passionate. “I didn’t injure Alexander,” she said. “And I didn’t punch him in the face, at least not hard. But he’s a pretty strong guy. He can take it. We just got carried away a bit.”Cavill says he had to “apologise profusely” after he got aroused on set, adding that “It had only happened to him once”. “A girl had to be on top of me, she had spectacular breasts and I hadn\u0027t rearranged my stuff into a harmless position. She\u0027s basically rubbing herself all over me and, um, it got a bit hard.” He claimed there was nothing sexy about onscreen sex scenes. “All you’re doing is smacking your nuts against someone and nothing is going in.” But he added: “It’s not great when you’re in a professional acting environment and somebody gets a boner, is it?” It’s not just Henry Cavill who got aroused during filming a sex scene. Metcalfe, who played John Rowland, experienced the same issue during his first onscreen sex scene with Eva Longoria’s Gabrielle Solis. He said: “We were rehearsing and then the director was like, \u0027OK, get out of bed, we have to reset the set\u0027, and I was like, \u0027I need a minute.\u0027“ He added: “It doesn\u0027t happen that frequently” because ”there are a lot of people on set, and it can be very technical, but it happens from time to time.2730 Christopher Guest and Cary Elwes – The Princess BrideWhen you see the dashing Westley (Cary Elwes) fall to the ground unconscious during a fight scene in Rob Reiner’s The Princess Bride, it really happened. Christopher Guest, who was playing Count Tyrone Rugen, knocked Elwes out by accident, when he hit him on the head with the butt of his sword. Elwes also broke his toe during the first week of filming when he was “messing around” between scenes on co-star Andre the Giant’s all-terrain vehicle. But the actor, who was in his first major role, hid the injury for the rest of the film as best he could. “I was limping a bit, you can see it in some of the scenes – you can see that I was limping into the fire swamp (during a scene with Robin Wright).”The star was filming the scene in which he storms off after he discovers Craig Schwartz (John Cusack) has been renting out his brain to strangers. According to the director, Spike Jonze, a drunk extra then threw a beer can from a moving car at his head while shouting “Hey Malkovich, think fast!” Jonze liked the scene so much that he left it in the film. The extra had his day rate bumped up to $700 a day because he had a speaking role.2930 Viggo Mortensen – The Lord of the RingsWhen Aragon (Mortensen) thinks that two of the hobbits are dead in a scene in The Two Towers, he lets out a gigantic primeval cry as he kicks his helmet in anger and falls to the floor. This behaviour would seem like an appropriate response to the grief his character feels but in reality, the actor had actually broken two toes while kicking his helmet.3030 The entire cast of RoarBut whatever the mishap, nothing can surely be as bad as it was on set for director Noel Marshall’s family, who were cast in his 1981 adventure comedy film Roar? During filming, his then wife Tippi Hendren and her daughter Melanie Griffith, as well as his two sons, John and Jerry, were mauled by lions. Heddren suffered multiple scalp wounds while Marshall was bitten so many times, he ended up hospitalised with gangrene.130 Margot Robbie – The Wolf of Wall StreetThe actor says that acting in the scene where she has sex with Leonardo DiCaprio on a bed of money was really painful in The Wolf of Wall Street. “I got a million paper cuts on my back from all that money! It\u0027s not as glamorous as it sounds,” she said. “If anyone is ever planning on having sex on top of a pile of cash: don\u0027t. Or maybe real money is a bit softer, but the fake money is like paper, and when I got up off the bed, I turned around to get my robe and everyone gasped. I said, \u0027What is it?\u0027 And they said, \u0027You look like you\u0027ve been whipped a million times. Your back is covered in a thousand red scratches.”During the filming of the sequel to Steven Spielberg’s Jaws, cast members were terrified when real hammerhead sharks started circling them in the sea. The trouble was that their screams went unheard. The crew didn’t think they were in real danger to start with because it was written into the script that they yelled for help at that point.330 Sylvester Stallone and Dolph Lundgren – Rocky IVThe fourth in the Rocky film franchise to focus on the boxing career of the fictional Rocky Balboa, played by Sylvester Stallone, has some gripping and authentic-looking fight scenes. It’s no wonder then that during filming, Stallone actually asked Dolph Lundgren, who plays his opponent, Ivan Drago, to try to knock him out for real. But Lundgren hit him with such force that he was sent to the hospital and was in intensive care for over a week.Brando was infamous for his bad on-set behaviour. That is one reason why Paramount was nervous about getting him involved in Francis Ford Coppola’s mafia film. It didn’t start well, when on the first day of shooting, the actor who played the patriarch in the family, Vito Corleone, missed his overnight flight from LA to New York. His scene was rescheduled for the next day, but it cost producers $40,000.In his autobiography, rapper Gucci Mane said he was so tired on set of Harmony Korine’s crime film Spring Breakers, that he fell asleep during his big sex scene. The rapper, who plays Big Arch, a rival drug dealer of James Franco’s Alien character in the film, is seen having sex with one woman, while another sucks his toes. “I couldn’t keep my eyes open. I was knocked out, snoring . . . Harmony kept having to wake me up for takes.” In another interview, he explained why he was so exhausted. “I had a concert down there in St Petersburg, Florida, one of the days I had to shoot a scene. Same night. We started shooting at 10 o\u0027clock in the evening until 1 or 2 o\u0027clock.”The action star broke his ankle while doing his own stunt on set of the sixth Mission Impossible. The scene sees Cruise completing a fast rooftop jump from one building to another, when his foot slams into the side of the wall. But instead of collapsing in a heap, he keeps going as if nothing has happened, until the end of the scene when he can be seen hobbling away. He said: “I knew instantly my ankle was broken and I really didn’t want to do it again so just got up and carried on with the take. I said, ‘It’s broken. That’s a wrap. Take me to hospital’ and then everyone got on the phone and made their vacation arrangement.”730 Lizzy Caplan and Michael Sheen – Masters of SexCaplan was nervous when she had to take her clothes off in front of co-star Sheen in the TV series. It made her feel better that they were both shaky.

These include anyone waiting for coronavirus test results, anyone who has come\u0026nbspinto contact with a confirmed infected person, and anyone returning from a country significantly disrupted by the virus.Instead of sending staff home, PHE recommends that if a workplace has a confirmed case of the virus then they\u0026nbspshould wait to be contacted by a local Health Protection Team to discuss and determine what measures, if any, should be taken.Created with Sketch.Coronavirus: Cases soar of deadly new flu-like virus Show all 154Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with

This could include an adequate data plan on a mobile device that allows you to hotspot an internet connection wirelessly from your phone or tablet.Space images show drastic drop in China pollution as coronavirus hitsIf connecting to a work\u0026nbspserver meant only for internal use, it may be necessary to set up a virtual private network (VPN) in order to access it.\u0026nbspVPNs\u0026nbspand anti-malware software are also advisable for anyone using a\u0026nbspWiFi\u0026nbspnetwork they do not control, such as in a cafe or co-working space, however this should not be an issue for anyone in quarantine.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Time-management apps like RescueTume can help you stick to your schedule and maintain your regular hours.​What are your rights and will you still get paid?Any staff who have been asked to self-isolate are entitled to take the time as sick leave, according to health secretary Matt Hancock. He added that self-isolation should be considered “sickness for employment purposes”.How much pay a worker receives will depend on their contract, with most employers offering a certain number of sick days on full pay.Even if employers do not offer sick pay, workers are entitled to\u0026nbsp statutory sick pay (SSP) for up to 28 weeks. It amounts to £94.25 per week and is paid from the fourth day of sickness.Those hardest hit will be anyone who is self-employed or who work in the gig economy, who are not entitled to SSP\u0026nbspif they self-isolate. The Department for Work and Pensions has said that anyone deemed a public health risk could claim universal credit or contributory employment and support allowance.​Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

But rural and coastal communities voted out in large numbers during the 2016 referendum after the Vote Leave campaign argued that farmers and fishermen would be better off once free of EU rules.The government distanced itself from the official’s comments, adding: “We have made it clear the comments are not in line with government policy.”Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A home flooded after the River Aire burst its banks in East Cowick, East Yorkshire Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg takes part in a Youth Strike 4 Climate protest march in Bristol, south west England.

So absolutely\u0026nbspwe need our famers, and of course we are the bedrock of the largest manufacturing sector providing all those raw ingredients.\u0026nbsp“Clearly, there is a cold economic case. But you have to look at the wider aspect of all of this: farms are the backbone of rural Britain. Surely the last thing we want to go to is importing cheaper, raw ingredients produced to lower standards. We export our conscience and our production.”\u0026nbspLast week, the environment secretary George Eustice came in for criticism after he refused to rule out chlorinated chicken and hormone-treated beef being imported from the US as part of a trade agreement with Washington.Fishermen also fear promises made to them about\u0026nbspincreased catch quotas and controlling who fishes in British waters could be traded in exchange for market access during the talks with the EU, which are due to begin next week.Brussels has made clear it wants little to change in terms of access for European boats and quota allocation once the transition period is over in December.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

They believe the explosion came from the heart of the Ophiuchus cluster of thousands of galaxies: a large galaxy at the center contains a colossal black hole.Black holes don\u0027t just draw matter in. They also blast out jets of material and energy.The first hint of this giant explosion actually came in 2016. Chandra images of the Ophiuchus galaxy cluster revealed an unusual curved edge, but scientists ruled out an eruption given the amount of energy that would have been needed to carve out such a large cavity in the gas.The two space observatories, along with radio data from telescopes in Australia and India, confirmed that the curvature was, indeed, part of a cavity.The radio data fit inside the X-rays like a hand in a glove, co-author Maxim Markevitch of NASA\u0027s Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland, said in a statement. This is the clincher that tells us an eruption of unprecedented size occurred here.The blast is believed to be over by now: There are no signs of jets currently shooting from the black hole.More observations are needed in other wavelengths to better understand what occurred, according to the team.The findings appeared in the Astrophysical Journal.Additional reporting by agenciesBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

He slipped to third place in the Nevada caucus and barely registered with black voters in South Carolina, failing to capture a key demographic vital for the success of a Democratic nominee in the erse electorates in\u0026nbspcrucial high-delegate states on Tuesday.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHis absence could give a boost to Joe Biden as the leading\u0026nbspmoderate, or to Michael Bloomberg and Elizabeth Warren, as Sanders\u0027 opponents hope to edge him out of his lead and give\u0026nbsphis rivals enough votes to make them eligible for delegates - if Mr Sanders isn\u0027t their second choice.Following an unsuccessful bid to chair the Democratic National Convention in 2017, Mr Buttigieg\u0026nbspattracted\u0026nbspsignificant media attention with his entry into the race, where the\u0026nbspAfghan War veteran and Harvard and Oxford graduate was heralded as a\u0026nbspmoderate underdog.Created with Sketch.Democratic candidates compete on the campaign trail: In pictures Show all 25Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Jessica Canicosa, a precinct captain for Bernie Sanders, waits to greet caucus voters at Liberty High School in Henderson, NevadaA supporter of Amy Klobuchar in Las Vegas, NevadaHotel workers at the Bellagio in Las Vegas get to grips with voting papers during the Nevada caucusesMichael J Fox –\u0026nbspthe Back to the Future actor turned activist –\u0026nbspspeaks at a rally for Pete Buttigieg at Faiss Middle School in Las VegasVoters at a campaign event for Amy Klobuchar in Reno, NevadaA caricature of Bernie Sanders is projected on to a tree during a rally in Las VegasA woman waits to have a photo taken with Elizabeth Warren during a town hall meeting in Las VegasThe threat of coronavirus and other germ-borne illnesses was on some voters\u0027 minds at the Democratic caucuses in Henderson, NevadaFormer vice-president Joe Biden takes a selfie with a voter in Las Vegas ahead of the Nevada caucusesA member of Mike Bloomberg\u0027s election team in a campaign office in New York CityAmy Klobuchar changes her shoes backstage after giving a speech in Exeter, New HampshireA warmly-wrapped-up dog attends an Elizabeth Warren event at Amherst Elementary School in Nashua, New HampshireBernie Sanders, who romped to victory in New Hampshire against Hillary Clinton in 2016, talks to the media in ManchesterLisa Olney, of Wellesley, Massachussets, demonstrates her support for Elizabeth Warren in Nashua, New HampshireJoe Biden was hoping to improve on his poor showing in Iowa in the New Hampshire primaryElizabeth Warren, renowned for giving time to supporters for selfies, works the crowd at the University of New Hampshire in DurhamJoe Biden takes a selfie with a supporter and his child outside a campaign event in Somersworth, New Hampshire on 5 FebruaryElizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders quarrel after a confrontation in a TV debate in which Sanders claimed that Warren was not telling the truth about a conversation in which she claimed he had said a woman could not win the presidency on 14 JanuarySupporter Pat Provencher listens to Pete Buttigieg in Laconia, New Hampshire on 4 FebruaryElizabeth Warren jogs away after speaking to reporters during a campaign event in Nashau, New HampshireSupporters of Amy Klobuchar gather before a rally.

He responded: “I’m going to win South Carolina.”His victory had been telegraphed for weeks as his campaign shifted its focus from early primary states to the first one in the south, a stronghold of African-American support where the former vice president could expend his decades of political capital as proof that he can carry a erse electorate.While Biden’s campaign remained focused on winning South Carolina, his challengers have stressed that it’s just one state among many as they look ahead to Super Tuesday and bank on earning a significant chunk of delegates in states where Biden has spent little time or money.\u0026nbspSharing the full story, not just the headlinesOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This year, 14 states will vote on Super Tuesday, including the nation’s most populous states, California and Texas.\u0026nbspOf crucial importance, we will see the impact of former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg’s non-traditional, self-funded run, that has seen him invest up to $400m to win support in many of the states voting on Super Tuesday.In order to win any delegates (a candidate needs to amass 1,991 delegates to achieve the party’s nomination) candidates have to win at least 15 percent of the vote in the state.\u0026nbspSharing the full story, not just the headlinesThere are enough delegates at stake that a strong showing for senator Bernie Sanders could cement his spot as Democratic nominee. At the same time, should he fail to overcome his top rivals, the race could become a serious competition between two or potentially even three candidates.\u0026nbspHere’s a state-by-state breakdown to keep you informed heading into Super Tuesday.\u0026nbspAll demographic numbers are from the Centre for American Progress’ “States of Change” report.\u0026nbspThe Yellowhammer state has 61 total delegates – including 9 superdelegates – up for grabs on Super Tuesday.\u0026nbspDemographically, Alabama is one of six states – along with the District of Columbia – where black Democratic voters are the majority. Democratic voter composition in Alabama in 2016 was 71 per cent black, 26 per cent white and three per cent other races.\u0026nbspAccording to 2016 Census data, Alabama has a slightly higher than average population of iniduals 65 years of age and older – almost 20 per cent versus the 19 percent average. The state’s median household income is more than $10,000 less than the national average, $42,830 versus $53,657 nationally. \u0026nbsp\u0026nbspFiveThirtyEight predicts former Vice President Joe Biden will take the state, giving him a 61 percent chance at victory in the state. Mr Sanders is the next most likely to take the state with a 21 percent chance of victory, and Mr\u0026nbspBloomberg is in third with a 17 percent chance of victory.There are 31 pledged delegates available to win in Arkansas including five superdelegates. \u0026nbsp\u0026nbspDemographically, Arkansas’ Democratic voters are 69 per cent white, 36 per cent black, three per cent Hiic and two per cent other races.According to 2016 Census data, the state has a slightly higher than average population of iniduals over the age of 65 – 21 per cent versus the national average of 19 per cent – and a median household income of $41,262 more than $10,000 less than the national average of $53,657.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

He was given a 38 per cent chance to win the state. Mr Bloomberg is the next most likely to win, with a 28 per cent chance of victory. Mr Biden has a 25 per cent chance to win. \u0026nbsp \u0026nbspThe most recent poll examining the Arkansas electorate from Talk Business \u0026amp PoliticsHendrix College Poll reported that Mr Bloomberg had a 3.2 percent lead over Mr Sanders in the state.\u0026nbspJust under 20 per cent of respondents said they’d vote for Mr Bloomberg, while 16.4 per cent said they’d vote for Mr Sanders and 18.5 per cent said they’d vote for Mr Biden.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp \u0026nbspThis is a massive prize. California, the country’s most populous state, has 415 pledged delegates and 79 superdelegates up for grabs.California’s Democratic voters are 50 per cent white, 26 per cent Hiic, 15 per cent Asian, eight per cent black and one percent other races.\u0026nbspCensus information from 2016 shows that 17 percent of the state is over the age of 65, just under the national average of 19 percent. The state’s median household income is $61,933, which is $2,276 higher than the national average. Despite this, the state’s poverty rate, 14.5 per cent, is slightly higher than the national average of 13.6 per cent.\u0026nbspMr Sanders is overwhelmingly favoured in polling to win California. FiveThirtyEight gives Mr Sanders an 89 per cent chance to win, with poll averages predicting Mr Sanders will win between 24 per cent and 43 per cent of the vote and win an average of the state’s 227 pledged delegates. Every other candidate is at risk of falling under the 15 per cent viability threshold. The closest runner up, Mr Biden, is only expected to win an average of 17 percent of the vote and an average of 83 delegates. Mr Sanders and Mr Biden are the only candidates whose predicted averages exceed the 15 percent viability threshold.\u0026nbspThe Centennial State has 67 pledged delegates on the line and nine superdelegates.Colorado’s Democratic voters are 75 per cent white, 15 per cent Hiic, six per cent black, and four per cent Asian and other races.Census data from 2016 shows that the state has a population of iniduals 65-year-old and over that is 2.4 percent lower than the national average of 18.9 per cent.

Ms Warren – who is the state’s senator – has a 25 per cent chance to win. The next closest candidate is Mr Biden with an eight per cent chance of victory. Mr Sanders is predicted to win an average of 35 delegates from the state.\u0026nbspMinnesota – Senator Amy Klobuchar’s home state – has 75 pledged delegates, including 10 superdelegates.

Mr Biden is the next most likely to win, with a predicted 36 percent chance of victory. After that, Mr Bloomberg has a 19 percent chance to win and Ms Warren is given a two percent chance.\u0026nbspThe state’s Democratic voter demographics is 66 per cent white, 20 percent black, nine per cent Asian and American Indian, and five per cent Hiic.FiveThirtyEight predicts a close race in Oklahoma.

Now they have been pushed back,\u0027 says Idlib-based journalist.Relations between Russia and Turkey continued to sour on Sunday as the two countries edged closer to open confrontation over northwest Syria as their top diplomats struggled to defuse tensions.Meanwhile inside embattled northwest Syria, an activist described improving humanitarian conditions as the regime’s forces find themselves on the defensive in the face of a Turkish onslaught.\u0026nbsp“Now the situation has become better than before,” said Mustafa Dahnon, a journalist reached by telephone in the city of Idlib, the most heavily populated urban centre in the contested opposition-controlled province.\u0026nbspSharing the full story, not just the headlines“Because the military factions managed to regain control of villages, towns and cities,” he told The Independent. “In the past the regime was very close to the city Idlib. Now they have been pushed back.”Sunday’s fast-moving developments came following the killing of at least 33 Turkish soldiers in a Syrian regime airstrike in Idlib province on Thursday. The attack prompted Ankara to dramatically escalate attacks on military forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad and open its borders at Bulgaria and Greece to refugees yearning to head towards the west. \u0026nbspOn Sunday, Turkey claimed it downed two Russian-made Syrian regime fighter jets over the country’s opposition-controlled northwest and rendered useless a regime airbase near the town of Nayrab, according to Turkish media outlets. Damascus claimed it shot down a Turkish drone near the town of Saraqeb.\u0026nbspNeither claim could be independently verified.\u0026nbspHours later Damascus announced a no-fly zone over northern Syria, according to the official Sana news agency,\u0026nbsp a restriction it would be unable to enforce without Russia, its primary patron and military backer.\u0026nbspTurkey’s defence minister Halusi Akar on Sunday announced the launch of Operation Spring Shield, aimed at pushing back Assad’s forces from Turkey’s positions in Idlib.\u0026nbspTurkey and Russia tensions spike in SyriaUS military truck filmed ramming Russian jeep off the road in SyriaMasses of civilians flee regime bombs in Syria’s Idlib“We do not aim to have a face-off with Russia,” Mr Akar said. “Our aim is for the Syrian regime to stop massacres and to prevent radicalisation, migration.”\u0026nbspMr Akar said the Turkish offensive would entail targeting Assad regime assets that posed a threat to Turkish interests in northeast Syria.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It could also spell more misery for millions of Syrians penned up in the country’s northwest hoping to get to western Europe. \u0026nbspMr Erdogan’s government has claimed it allowed 76,000 migrants and refugees to get across the border towards Greece and Bulgaria as a way of putting pressure on the European Union to address Syria and to deflect domestic attention away from the losses the conflict has entailed.Greek and Bulgarian authorities are reporting far fewer numbers attempting to cross and insist very few if any are successful in traversing the heavily guarded frontiers.“No one can cross the Greek borders,” said a text message sent out by Athens authorities. “All those attempting illegal entry are effectively prevented from entering.

Am I mad  Actually, I think I’m pretty sane, although I may be biased.I’ll explain my reasoning.My abstinence from clothes shopping is no big secret. I’ve mentioned it many times before but I guess in these times of impending climate doom it’s trendier now. The irony, not buying clothes is in fashion.It’s a bit like feminism.That used to be “those bra-burning crazy women”  but now it’s OK. Cool, in fact. Probably because we live in a much more “woke” society.It must be my Blue Peter upbringing. After all, I’m always saying Blue Peter was woke before woke was a thing — the appeals, growing produce in the greenhouse, making things, inclusivity, ersity. It was ahead of the game!Often we overcomplicate matters, overlooking the easy option. Take not buying more clothes, for example. It has so many advantages . . .❶ Keeping your old clothes is a good incentive to stick to the same weight. I pretty much stopped growing by age  so everything I’ve owned since then still fits. Plus I don’t really wear tight clothes either, so fluctuating by a few pounds here and there is OK.❷ I’m pretty lazy and the thought of having to go shopping for clothes feels like a big effort. Even buying online is hard work.What to buy  Will it fit  How do Iit  What a hassle. When I was younger, I liked to shop with friends. But that novelty wore off long ago.Now, as a mum, when I see friends all I want is to have good conversations.❸ Not being fashionable is liberating. You don’t have to hang out with people who judge you on what you wear. You can hang out with people that like you for you. When people glance me up and down to check out my rags, I have a secret sense of satisfaction that I no longer worry what they’re thinking.❹ It’s way cheaper to not buy stuff. Think of all the money you’ll save.❺ I won’t bang on about it but clothes, consumer goods and stuff in general in our society are becoming too dis­pos­able and our Earth can’t cope. We are having to get rid of all of it in landfill and it’s just not sustainable. It’s killing the planet.So it’s a no-brainer.The other day I was with a couple of like-minded friends and one commented on the other’s top.The other replied:  “It’s five years old from HM.” The first laughed, then said: “Mine’s seven years old from Florence And Fred, so there.”Maybe one day we will live in a world where people will judge on how OLD clothes are, rather than how new.So we’ll get to the point where something being “so last year” is a compliment.WHITNEY HOUSTON ed to our shores on Tuesday, hitting the stage in Sheffield in the opening leg of her  UK tour.When I say “”, she hasn’t come back from the afterle but is performing in the form of a hologram. How Black Mirror.Apparently it’s the next big thing, with all manner of stars being resurrected,  holographically speaking, to entertain us.But why stop at Elvis or Marilyn  The show’s organisers say: “A lot of artists get tired of the road at some point, where they have to go and touch their audiences to earn a living. Whereasthey can create a hologram, they can  still have a le where they can go to weddings or enjoy baby showers but still have their music kept alive.”Lucky them. Not only can they perform simultaneously around the globe, multiplying revenue streams, but they will also always be pitch-perfect and look flawless. Better still, they can even be relaxing at home all along.

They didn’t.Then there was the  YK bug, when all of the internet was going to break down, resulting in cyber chaos. It never happened. Phew.As for stockpiling Tamlu for Sars . . . I didn’t. Luckily, I’ve made it this far. But surely, statistically, this just means the coronavirus may be the biggie.I guess the bright side is many people have already been stockpiling for Brexit.In the meantime, please wash your hands, everyone, and stop sneezing in public.Hey, we’re in , when holograms can do world tours.

Yes, there have been more than , confirmed cases of coronavirus in more than  countries around the world.But in the UK, where more than , people have been tested, there have been  confirmed cases.To date, there have been no deaths in the UK from coronavirus and only one Brit — an elderly cruise ship passenger in Japan — has died in total.So when Covid- is routinely referred to as the “killer virus”, that is something less than the whole truth. Because most people unfortunate enough to catch it recover.Even in China, where there have been over , cases, the ­numbers of ­infection are slowing.Containing the virus works. As we edge closer to a full-blown pandemic, a little perspective will go a long way.As those Brit tourists locked inside the Costa Adeje Palace in Tenere would probably tell you, the greatest threat posed by the virus is massive inconvenience, not sudden death.If you are not old, and have no pre- existing medical conditions, then coronavirus is slightly more le-threatening than regular flu — which killed , Brits last year.Every doctor will tell you that hands are a route of transmission — so keep them clean, and take a rain-check on handshakes, manly hugs and social kissing.Professor Hugh Pennington, a ­lecturer in diseases at Aberdeen University, says, “Just using ordinary soap and water is all that’s needed.It can make all the dference and really limit the spread of this virus.”We should be thinking about ­better personal hygiene rather than panic buying.I am not making the case for complacency. The world is facing the greatest health crisis for a ­generation.This week the first cases were seen in countries as far apart as Pakistan, Greece, Brazil, Nigeria and Wales.The cancelled sporting events are piling up. Schools are closing. The stock market is in freefall. This is not normal le.Personally, I am not getting on a plane until my daughter is the far side of her exams in the spring.My local gym has installed hand sanitisers and I use them.When I see someone coughing, I wish they had the common decency to cover their cakehole.But every one of us must walk the hard path between staying safe and staying sane.The Government’s worst-case scenario predicts half-a-million British deaths from the virus — which would exceed the number of British military and civilian deaths in World War Two.Is Covid- REALLY deadlier than living through — and fighting in — World War Two The Government should ditch the scare stories and tell us how to stay healthy. They should keep repeating how simple personal hygiene habits can contain the spread of Covid-.Keep calm, carry on and wash your hands.For as any doctor will tell you, there is nothing more contagious than panic.ANA De Armas is doing the heavy lting in promoting the new Bond film, No Time To Die.In the last week alone, Ana has appeared on the cover of Vanity Fair and Porter magazines. What’s lovely about the Cuban goddess is that she actually seems happy to be in a James Bond movie.“I was jumping all over the place and very excited,” she says about getting her role as CIA agent Paloma.In stark contrast, it is hard to imagine grumpy old Daniel Craig jumping with excitement at anything to do with the Bond franchise.“I don’t even call them Bond girls,” grumbles downbeat Dan.It’s like having Victor Meldew playing .DAVID Dimbleby, the nearest thing the BBC has to royalty, claims that: “The whole idea of a national broadcaster that speaks truth to the nation and is impartial and objective is under threat.”But whose fault is that Millions of us blame the BBC. Because during the great national debate about Brexit, the BBC was openly, unapologetically biased.The orthodoxy of BBC opinion is totally out of touch with the people who fork out the £billion a year for the licence fee.For years the BBC told those people that they are thick, ignorant racists who would all soon be dead.If the BBC had been “impartial and objective” in recent years, it would not be ripe for losing the licence fee.Prince Harry and the Queen have always seemed close.And in a family that is not big on displays of affection, the Queen’s face always seemed to light up in her grandson’s cheeky, ginger-bonce presence.But his North American exile means Harry will now see far less of his grandmother,  this April.If Harry has an IQ bigger than Meghan’s shoe size, I bet he will live to regret it.STORM Dennis, Storm Ciara and now Storm Jorge.For three weeks in a row, rain and floods have brought abject misery across the country from the north of England to Wales – the same areas that gave Boris Johnson his -seat majority.Homes have been ruined.

Like millions of other couples, they have lived together for a while, and now they are having a baby and getting married.Even the way they got that dog, Dilyn the Jack Russell rescue puppy, is reminiscent of other ­couples who get a pet because they have not yet got a baby.Boris is by nature an optimist. He presses ahead where more cautious career politicians would hang back, worried the whole thing would upset too many voters, especially those of an old-fashioned disposition.But Boris has horried them already, by becoming the first Prime Minister ever to live with his girlfriend in Downing Street.Old-fashioned voters ought to be delighted that he is now getting married to Carrie.He has always loved having children, the more the better as far as he is concerned.And he loves being married. This may seem a curious thing to write of a man who will have twice been orced, once the formalities to end his present marriage have been completed.But Boris is not one of those men who regards commitment with terror. With boundless optimism, he dismisses the doubts that might have held him back.His first marriage, to Allegra Mostyn-Owen, whom he met at Oxford University, was not a success. She had appeared on the cover of Tatler, was famous for her beauty and was a sympathetic and sensitive person.But she could not bear being married to such a driven man, who worked with titanic energy to make a success of his chosen career of journalism.She and Boris were completely incompatible, and very soon the marriage broke down.His second marriage, to Marina Wheeler, was in many ways a great success, and lasted for a quarter of a century. They had four children, and were clearly very much in love.From time to time Marina threw him out of the house for having affairs, but she did not generally hurl him into outer darkness.He would instead find himself staying, during these periods of banishment, with mutual friends.But one cannot imagine Marina, a successful lawyer with socialist convictions, would ever have been happy living at No as the we of a Conservative Prime Minister.Carrie will embrace that role. She has worked for the Conservative Party, understands how it works and sympathises with its aims.Ministers for whom she has worked pay tribute to her acumen.Only two PMs before Boris have ever got orced: the Duke of Grafton in the eighteenth century, and Sir Anthony Eden, who succeeded Churchill in .As so often, Boris is breaking new ground, determined to do things his own way, unwilling to observe conventions for which he can see no point.In the theatre of politics, he puts on a performance unlike anyone ’s, and of which not everyone can approve, but which everyone finds themselves talking about. He got into the Commons in  but was soon criticised for ious gross failures of responsibility.When he was found to have lied to the Press about his affair with Petronella Wyatt — he dismissed the story as “an inverted pyramid of pfle”, when actually it was entirely true — he was sacked by the then Conservative leader Michael Howard from the front-bench team.This meant that in  Johnson was in no position to run for the leadership, and had to watch fellow Etonian David Cameron take over. A less resilient character would have abandoned politics for a well-paid career in newspapers and television. Johnson went off and became Mayor of London.He reached the top on his own terms, and now he is doing something wonderfully conventional he is getting married.

This even earned comparisons with former Chancellor Phil “Spreadsheet” Hammond, another stick-in-the-mud Eeyore. But though senior civil servants should advise ministers discreetly, ultimately they must do their bidding.The Government won its large majority on a manesto of change. It cannot be ruled by Sir Humphreys, employing every trick in the book to delay and frustrate those elected to enact the will of the people.Sir Philip is a £,-a-year knighted bureaucrat who will no doubt end up with a gold-plated pension far beyond the dreams of ordinary workers.Instead of bleating he should face the reality of the situation.If he can’t or won’t do the job, the Government has to get someone who can.CONVICTED foreign thugs are already dodging deportation by using human rights laws.To add insult to injury, the taxpayer is coughing up millions of pounds to pay their legal bills.“Mr Big” drugs dealer Courtney Byndloss  hit the legal aid jackpot, racking up nearly £million for his fight against deportation. And an Eritrean terrorist was handed £,  to also help him escape being thrown out of the UK.Is it any wonder the public wants the Government to shake up this crazy system AT last, some happy news!In the midst of the winter floods, coronavirus and the stock market crash you could be forgiven for thinking the world’s a pretty bleak place.So the announcement that Boris Johnson and his partner Carrie are having a Downing Street baby is welcome news.And it’s nice to know he got more than Brexit done!Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Others are on borrowed time.Casualties could yet include the biggest fish of all, Cabinet Secretary Sir Mark Sedwill — Rutnam’s predecessor at the Home Office.If he survives, it will be at the cost of his second huge job as head of national security.Few of these shadowy Whitehall aristocrats will welcome Sir Calamity’s decision to wash their dirty linen in public.And with a career-long ­catalogue of costly blunders to his name, drama queen ­Rutnam could yet regret suing for unfair dismissal.Witnesses might testy to his “sneaky and snivelling” ­managerial style — including perhaps Amber Rudd, who blames him for destroying her career as a Cabinet high-flier.Rutnam left her to swing for his department’s unforgivable Windrush scandal and the deportation of innocent West Indian migrants.As Ms Rudd fell on her sword, Rutnam “went missing”.“She repeatedly asked for the information but it was never forthcoming,” says a friend.“Then a week after she resigned, the data was made available. The whole thing was very odd.”In other words, it stinks.Sir Philip had little time for Priti Patel.“He seemed to think Priti was stupid and treated her as such,” says an insider.Once exposed to daylight, such arrogance, coupled with third-party allegations of racism, can be politically explosive.We are witnessing a deceptively important battle on the home front, fought in parallel with Brexit.Downing Street believes it is winning the fight for ­sovereignty. But the mandarins are fighting a Fth Column battle to keep Britain tied to the EU’s apron strings.“The first six months are critical,” says a senior ­ministerial source. “It’s all to play for.”MILLIONAIRE lawyer “Sir” Keir Starmer QC – he pretends to hate the title – is now a racing certainty for Jeremy Corbyn’s job as Labour leader.This chameleon politician is a protege of Labour dud Gordon Brown.

Health Secretary Matt Hancock said we donapost take anything off the table as the global death toll neared , - including one Brit on a cruise ship in Japan. The Tory Cabinet minister, who is setting up a war room and passing emergency laws, warned scientists have said it is inevitable that the virus will become endemic in society. If that happens, he said, in a worst case scenario the UK may need “signicant actions” that would have “social and economic disruption” - which could include closing some schools with a specic risk and pulling ex-doctors out of retirement. Football events and concerts could also be banned, and people could be urged against using public transport. He told the BBC: Weaposre looking at all options, including those. However, he added there was also a risk of taking such actions too early. BBC interviewer Andrew Marr asked Mr Hancock directly: China of course isolated entire cities. is it conceivable under any circumstance that you’d try to cut off a city in this country  The Health Secretary replied: Thereaposs clearly a huge economic and social downside to that, but we donapost take anything off the table at this stage - because you have got to make sure you have all the tools availablethat is what’s necessary. “But I want to minimise the social and economic disruption, and at this stage we still have the hope - although the numbers where are rising fast - that we might be able to avoid this outcome.” Mr Hancock stressed that, with only  cases confirmed in the UK, right now people should not be closing schools. Asked about a possible ban on large public gatherings, he said: “We are looking at all those sorts of things, we do not rule them out, but there’s also a problemwe make decisions like that too early.”  Emergency powers could be used to enforce quarantinepatients resist, he told the BBC. We have the power now to ensure they are so the police can assist us in doing that.And stockpiles from no-deal Brexit plans are now being kept in case of a Coronavirus crisis in Britain, eh said. Mr Hancock said the country has  ventilators, and can ramp it up to  or ,needed.People should ensure they catch a cough or sneeze in a tissue which is thrown away, or in the crook of their elbow, he said, as calls to NHS  shot up by more than % in the last week.However, the Heath Secretary said “at this stage” people should “go about their ordinary business” and over-s don’t need to avoid public transport - despite the Director-General of the World Health Organisation warning they should.  Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the WHO chief, tweeted: If you are +, or have an underlying condition like cardiovascular disease, a respiratory condition or diabetes, you have a higher risk of developing severe #COVID. Try to avoid crowded areas, or places where you might interact with people who are sick. Mr Hancock said at the moment, that is not the advice in the UK. He added: “If we get to the position where this is endemic right around the world and large scale here then we will change the advice according to what the scientists advise.” "},{"url":null,"title":"downing street blocked mary beard","story":"NewsDowning Street blocked Mary Beard from British Museum job for her Brexit viewsDame Mary Beard is a renowned Classicist - but she was left off a list of new unpaid trustees for the British Museum when it went for approval by Downing StreetShareCommentsByDan BloomOnline Political Editor:,  MAR NewsDame Mary Beard has strident views against Brexit \" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - politicsSubscribeWe will use your email address only for sending you newsletters.

Two small bowls of popcorn were on the sofa and their two dogs, Bear and Digger, were around outside in the backyard. But there was no sign of couple Joseph and Summer, or their two young children Gianni, four, and Joseph Jr, three. It was clear they hadn’t been there for some days, and loved ones hadn’t heard from them either. It looked as though the McStay family had simply upped and left... but why  It was February  – Joseph, , and Summer, , had only moved into their home in Fallbrook, Calornia, four months earlier. Joseph ran a successful decorative water fountain business, called Earth Inspired Products, with his business associate Charles ‘Chase’ Merritt – a welder who helped with the construction. Summer was a real estate agent and devoted mum. They worked hard and raised their family with fun and laughter. On February , , concerned family visited Joseph and Summer’s home as they hadn’t heard from them. There was no sign of the family and with food left out, and dogs in the yard, it was as though they would be back any minute – but they had vanished. The last time they had been seen was on February  when Joseph had met with Merritt – he was also the last person Joseph had called. There was no sign of forced entry or any sign there had been a crime committed or a struggle had taken place. The family were declared missing. Soon after, the McStays’ family car – a white Isuzu Trooper – was discovered parked at a shopping mall near the US-Mexican border, and CCTV showed a similar-looking family walking into Mexico. On their computer, investigators found searches looking up what type of documents children might need to travel around Mexico, and it looked like someone had done research into Spanish lessons. Had they disappeared voluntarily to start a new le in Mexico  No one could come up with any reason why they would.  They hadn’t packed any of their things and there was over , that remained untouched in their bank accounts. Investigators were perplexed and the family’s loved ones were racked with worry. Joseph’s mum, Susan Blake, helped Merritt access money to keep the business going, but the company couldn’t work without Joseph at the helm. Susan sent Joseph emails begging him to get in touch. ‘Call me,’ she wrote. ‘I’ll help you.’ No one had a clue whether the family had been hiding something they were worried about and for three years, their disappearance was a complete mystery. The case was covered in TV shows and there were so many theories. Merritt even started writing a book about it – after all, he had been the last person to see Joseph on the day he went missing when they’d allegedly talked business for around an hour. In the book, Merritt planned on revealing how Joseph had confided in him that he thought Summer was trying to poison him. It was a wild suggestion that no one  thought was true.  Investigators did have their suspicions about Merritt. In an interview right after the disappearance, he referred to Joseph in the past tense saying ‘he was my best friend’, despite there being no evidence he was dead. Friends of Joseph said he’d confided in them that Merritt was doing ‘shoddy’ work and suspected he was pilfering money from him. There was another business partner, Daniel Kavanaugh, who told police Joseph was considering firing Merritt. It would have been a disaster for Merritt, who had a gambling habit that had racked up debts. Along with unpaid tax bills, he owed ,. On November , , an off-road motorcyclist was riding through San Bernardino County’s Mojave Desert – about an hour north of the McStay family home – and came across human skeletal remains just off the interstate.  It led police to two shallow graves. The McStay family had finally been found. Joseph’s remains had been buried with Joseph Jr. Summer was buried with Gianni – and found with them was a rusty lb sledgehammer. They’d all suffered skull fractures and the sledgehammer was believed to have been the weapon. Investigators determined Joseph and Summer had been murdered and the boys had been, too, as they would have been able to identy the killer. Local people placed crosses at the scene in memory of the family whose remains had been desecrated by wild animals. After three years of hoping they would be found, the fate of the McStay family had been discovered. But who had killed them  They didn’t seem to have an enemy in the world. The focus went back to Charles Merritt. Police discovered that the mobile phone belonging to Merritt had been placed near the location of the graves on February , , shortly after the last time the family had been seen.  And his DNA was found in the McStay car that had been abandoned near the Mexican border to make it look as though they had left of their own accord. There was evidence Merritt had been taking money from the water fountain business in the lead-up to the murders and that Joseph had confronted him about it. After Joseph disappeared, he continued to take money from the business and gambled thousands away. Despite the evidence being largely circumstantial, Merritt was arrested in  and charged with the murder of Joseph, Summer and their two children. The trial was repeatedly delayed as Merritt fired several lawyers and even tried to represent himself. Finally, in , the trial began. His defence said that there was no physical evidence to connect Merritt with the killings and there was no sign of attack in the home. They accused police of not considering other suspects – arguing Merritt wouldn’t have killed his best friend for money. The prosecution said Joseph was planning to cut Merritt out of the business. Had Joseph accused him of taking the money and told him of his plans   Merritt had gone on to take over , from Joseph’s account after the killings because he knew he wasn’t coming back. The motive was greed and the murders were brutal. ‘It was blow after blow after blow to a child’s skull,’ the prosecutor said. After a four-month trial, nine years after the McStay killings, Merritt was found guilty of four counts of first-degree murder. In January this year, he was sentenced to death for his crimes. Merritt, now , continued to insist he was innocent and accused authorities of framing him. ‘The thing that is bringing you solace is ending my le, at least for a while, for a crime that I did not commit,’ he told the court. ‘I loved Joseph. He was a big part of my le and my family’s le. I would never have hurt him in any way. I would never raise my hand to a woman or child. I did not do this thing. I know you do not believe this.’  Joseph’s mum, Susan, was emotional and called him a ‘despicable, evil monster’ and said that her le was a nightmare knowing how the family died. ‘You beat two precious little babies…’ she said to Merritt. ‘How scared were they  Crying for mommy and daddy  You are a low-le coward and a baby killer.’ Joseph’s brother spoke of his heartache. ‘You cannot get back time. And that was stolen from us,’ he said. ‘This world was robbed of four beautul souls.’ Summer’s sister, Tracy Russell, said their family were scarred for le and the pain hasn’t subsided with time. ‘Our family has already received a le sentence,’ she said.

Earlier this month, the country held its first auctions of permits to hunt elephants. But now the number of poaching cases is soaring at an alarming rate, fuelled by insatiable demand for rhino horn in Asia, where it is coveted as a traditional ­medicine and as an aphrodisiac. This horric image, taken earlier this month, shows the butchered remains of two of these magnicent animals, taking the tally of killings since April to almost % of Botswana’s total rhino population. The government there is trying to keep a lid on the situation, but conservationists say action must be taken or this species could die out by  in the southern African country. Eduardo Gonclaves, from the Campaign to Ban Trophy Hunting, says: “The restarting of trophy hunting in Botswana has given a green light to the poachers. “Trophy hunting and poaching are two sides of the same coin. “When it’s a black African killing an animal for bushmeat or to sell its body parts, it’s called poaching. When it’s a white foreigner who kills the same animal for fun and to keep its body parts, it’s trophy hunting. At the end of the day they are one and the same thing. An innocent animal is killed for greed, vanity or both. “It’s brutal, senseless and it is driving much of our wildle to the brink of extinction. “Now the new government has disarmed the anti-poaching patrols and is telling trophy hunters they’re welcome to come back and shoot endangered elephants. “As a result, we’re seeing absolute anarchy unfold. It’s hardly surprising this has happened. This was all so predictable. It’s an absolute disaster.”  Thousands of rhinos that once roamed Africa and Asia have been culled by poaching and habitat loss. Very few are found outside national parks and reserves. Between -, only six rhinos were killed in Botswana for their horns. In the past year alone, since the government announced its plan to bring back trophy hunting,  black and white rhinos have been killed, according to sources.

Daniel Warren, from Derby, who has autism and learning dficulties, suffered a flurry of punches to the head and arms.After the beating, he took refuge in one of his favourite cafes and broke down in tears, Derbyshire Live reports.The -year-old is now scared of leaving the house and is haunted by his attackersapos faces whenever he closes his eyes. When he was brutally attacked, Daniel said he was just minding his own business and doing what he loves - feeding the pigeons. The Spondon man said: The day started off brilliantly, I went to ArtCore because I love doing art, then I had a wander around town. I was going towards Derby Bus Station and I wanted to feed the pigeons, I’ve always loved the pigeons. It was nice and quiet around there, I like a bit of me time. It was around pm. That’s when they started swooping in on me, they punched me on my arms and smacked me in the head, you can still feel the lump. As they beat him up, Daniel said the attackers were taunting him and threw liquid which looked funny on his head. He said he struggled hard against the attackers and eventually managed to escape into Derby Bus Station. It was there that he saw one of his oldest friends and together they went to the Eagle Centre to get help. He said: She took me to the Eagle Centre to wash myself. We then went to Boots and told them what happened. They could see I was upset, then I went to Grand Café Caruso and I broke down in tears, I was trying not to. Daniel is a much-loved regular at the café and the staff treated him to a massive chocolate muffin to cheer him up.  After a short while, Danielaposs mum arrived on her way home from work and she informed the police at about pm. Daniel said: When I went to bed that night, I closed my eyes and all I could see was them, in my face. Some people are not very nice, I woke up the next day and I was shaking to get out the door. I was nervous. The following day was pancake day at college which Daniel said he had been looking forward to for weeks. He said: I was scared to come out my house but I thought it’s pancake day and I love pancake day. I thought no I’m going to go to college, everyone at college said I wasnapost my usual bouncy self. I told them what happened and gradually throughout the day I was getting better, coming out with pancake jokes. Instead of letting the incident push him over the edge, Daniel has decided to use his experience to help others. In the hours after the incident, Daniel made a YouTube video to raise awareness of autism and bullying.Posted on Monday, the video has achieved more than , views and has been shared  times on Facebook .Daniel said: Iaposve been attacked before, itaposs just because Iaposm dferent because of my autism. Thataposs why I put the YouTube video on, to make people aware about people with learning dficulties. Some people hide and bottle it up but I want to get a  going. I want to stand up for myself, I wonapost put up with it anymore. Daniel is a huge Derby County fan and goes to most home and away games. Since sharing the video, he said fellow Rams fans have sent him messages of support. He said: Even some Forest fans have messaged me. I never thought Iaposd see the day! My Derby County mates are absolutely horried, they are upset to say the least and Iaposm being polite. Daniel said he isnapost going to let the attack stop him from doing the things he enjoys. He said: It was horrible, I don’t want to go through that again. Itaposs  and still people are bullying people with learning dficulties.I’d like to do self-defence one day.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailAs glaciers melt and temperatures rise, the devastation caused by ­climate change can be found here at home... on these muddy slopes that should be covered in snow at this time of year. I’m standing in the Cairngorms National Park, where two million visitors a year enjoy skiing, hiking among the snow-capped peaks and, until now, husky rides from Alan Stewart’s Cairngorm Sleddog centre. But in April,  years after he and we Fiona opened up near Aviemore, the centre will close its doors for ever because it just doesn’t snow enough. Alan, , tells me: “Climate change has finished us off.” His centre is the first business to shut in the area due to global warming. The writing was on the wall in  when Alan’s pack of  Siberian huskies began moulting in winter as warm weather confused their normal cycles. And this year, instead of snow, Alan says: “We just have mud.” Alan, who has welcomed Sir David Attenborough and Bear Grylls to his centre, goes on: “Weaposve got ospreys nesting close to us and I’ve seen them affected by the rain. “I’ve seen flies in the middle of winter because the place is so warm. Craziest thing of all is Iaposve got huskies moulting in the middle of winter – that tells you what nature is saying to them, to us. “To train dogs professionally you need several months of snow but even in Europe you cannot get enough snow.” The park, in the eastern Highlands of Scotland, has seen declining wildle, putting endangered species at risk, because of the lack of snow cover. The Cairngorm Mountains, covering  square miles, are losing snow cover at an alarming rate. Once encrusted in ice and snow for most of the year, a third of it has disappeared over the past  years. It could be snow free by temperatures continue to rise.  A report by the Cairngorms National Park Authority says experts estimate there “is likely to be a substantial decline in the number of days of snow cover” by . It also warns of flooding and a loss in bioersity. I visited the UK’s last wilderness, the set for BBC’s Winterwatch, to discover the impact of ever-warmer winters. Mountain tops have just a smattering of snow and conditions are more like spring. The white pistes at Cairngorm Mountain ski resort, near Aviemore, are turning to barren slopes. To counter that, resort chiefs invested in a snow maker which spewed out almost  tonnes of articial powder every day for more than a month before the season opened.  Snow and ice are also of great signicance to the wildle here. These mountains are home to  per cent of Britain’s endangered species, like rock ptarmigans – a white game bird and relic from the last ice age –  pairs of golden eagles and  pairs of ospreys. But this delicate inter-action of wildle and plants is beginning to buckle. The ptarmigan and mountain hare, both native species which change colour to blend in with the snow, are pushed further up the mountains to avoid being picked off by predators. Another victim is the mysterious sparrow-sized snow bunting.  While thousands overwinter all around the UK from the Arctic, only  pairs are believed to now breed near the tops of the highest mountains in Scotland, making their nests at the edge of patches of snow to eat frozen larvae. Conservationists want to protect the capercaillie – largest member of the game family and one of Scotland’s treasured birds. Breeding has been hit hard by increasingly wet and erratic weather in spring and early summer. Despite spending a morning dedicated to trying to spot one under the watchful eye of wildle guide Duncan McDonald, we fail to find one.  Perhaps not surprising as numbers have dropped to just over , from around , in the s. Speyside Wildle is one of several operators which rely on tourists lured by the rich wildle and the area’s whisky distilleries. But even these have been hit – a heatwave in  halted production as water ran dry. There are also fears for another iconic Scottish species – the Atlantic salmon. Once abundant,  saw a low of , caught across the country. On the banks of Loch Morlich, Will Boyd-Wallis, head of land management at CNPA, explains: “This is an important habitat for the Atlantic salmon. It’s a breeding space for them. If the water gets too hot then these eggs are not going to be viable and the salmon are not able to breed. It’s important we keep that water cool.  “One way this occurs is through the melting of the snow, which can last until June. With less snow, this is going to have a big impact.” Ski workers literally see the effects of climate change up close.  Jim Coorfoot, who has worked at Cairngorm Mountain ski centre for  years, said: “Stormy weather is stripping away the snow. Last year was one of the worst on record. “Normally there is a reliable source of snow at the top of the mountain but we have had to switch that to the bottom with the use of a machine. “I worry it will accelerate quicker than we can mitigate against. Typically at this time of year the slopes would be covered but the weather now is just so unpredictable.” Temperatures up here this decade have been almost a degree warmer and five per cent sunnier than average.  Lee Schofield, of Highlands and Islands Weather, offers free forecasts to tourists. He cited temperatures in Carrbridge – . degrees higher last month than in January .

And in severe cases, bad conditions on puppy farms can lead to illnesses and complication costing up to £, to treat – and even mean the pooch being put down. The findings from a poll of vets have today been released by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs to coincide with a campaign to help pet-lovers carry out checks before buying a puppy or kitten. The move comes in the run-up to the introduction next month of Lucy’s Law, which will ban the sale of puppies and kittens by third party dealers including pet shops and online traders. The ban marks a huge victory in The Mirror’s campaign to end so-called puppy farming by commercial breeders with abysmal welfare standards. “I am delighted that a ban on third party sales of puppies and kittens is coming into force – it is a crucial piece of legislation that will help us tackle the abhorrent and heart-breaking trade of pets,” said animal welfare minister Lord Goldsmith. “Our campaign will help raise awareness of the dangers associated with buying pets online and deceitful sellers. “The animals reared on puppy farms are often in awful conditions which can lead to chronic health problems, behavioural issues, and, in the most tragic cases, death.  “This simply has to stop and the public can do its bit to help. “We urge anyone thinking about getting a pet to do the right thing. “Do thorough research and ensure you go to a reputable breeder in the UK.”Lucy’s Law will mean that breeders will have to sell directly to the public rather than hiding behind third party sellers. Tips for spotting the dodgy breeders include:Beware of anyone selling multiple litters Check a seller’s contact details to seethey are being used on multiple website and adverts. Check the animal’s age – puppies and kittens must not be sold under eight weeks old."},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus brits tenerife hotel can","story":"NewsCoronavirus: Brits in Tenere hotel can leave -UK vows to continue their careBrits staying in the quarantined H Costa Adeje Palace on Tenere have been told they can now fly homethey meet certain criteria, including that they show no symptoms of the Covid- strain of the diseaseShareCommentsByGerard CouzensMilo Boyd:,  MAR Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news video coronavirus-confirmed-cases-around-world-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news uk-news coronavirus-brits-tenere-hotel-can-\"\" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - daily newsSubscribeWe will use your email address only for sending you newsletters.

The Foreign Office has poured water on a centrally organised repatriation flight however. Today regional health chiefs said tourists who checked in after February  could leave as long as they fulfilled three key conditions which included their home countries “guaranteeing” their safeand their continued monitoring. A spokesman on the island said: “They can leave the hotel and fly home as long as they fulfil these three conditions. “The conditions are that they must be showing no symptoms of the virus, test negative in an analysis carried out  hours earlier, and their home nations must establish theirmechanisms and guarantee the continuity of their treatment once they .” Around  Brits who checked into the H Costa Adeje Palace before February  have already been told they can leave.

Cold, low-humidity environments are ideal for the disease, according to an analysis of  earlier studies by the Journal of Hospital Infection. Past strains included Severe Acute Respiratory Syndromeand Middle East Respiratory Syndrome . The analysis also found that coronaviruses can be rendered inactive using common disinfectants - but it is not yet clear whether the new coronavirus behaves in a similar way. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Robert Redfield said: On copper and steel itaposs pretty typical, itaposs pretty much about two hours. But I will say on other surfaces - cardboard or plastic - itaposs longer, and so we are looking at this. Disease experts say the new outbreak of the virus, named COVID-, is mainly spread from person to person through coughing or sneezing.Contact with fecal matter from an infected person may also transmit the virus, according to Mail Online .Transmission can occur when a person touches a contaminated object or surface and then brings their hands to their mouth, nose or eyes, though one scientist suggested this type of transmission is rare. Contamination from packages coming from overseas is even less likely, the New York Post reports.A CDC spokeswoman, in an emailed statement, said the agency is still looking into how contagious the virus can be when deposited on more common, everyday surfaces. Timothy Brewer, an epidemiologist in Calornia, said: The important big take-home message is that this is probably a small proportion of the transmission of respiratory viruses.  “Out in the community, these viruses are probably not surviving for a long time on surfaces.” There have been more than , global cases of the novel coronavirus globally - with more than , deaths recorded, the vast majority of which in mainland China. The virus has spread to  more countries apart from China, alarming public health authorities across the world.

There was a great deal of excitement in the week after Greta Thunberg announced she would visit the west England city and join a climate protest.Tens of thousands of people joined her on a march and watched her speak, in a high profile appearance covered by the Mirroraposs sister publication Bristol Post in great depth.Following in the wake of the outletaposs coverage were thousands of comments, many positive, but also many negative. They questioned the validity of climate science, suggested school children should not be able to go on strike, complained about disruption in the city and noted that young people have carbon footprints. There was also a lot of people that focused on Thunberg herself, a -year-old Swedish teenager who travels the world calling for action to tackle climate change. Amongst swathes of abuse were comments calling for and inciting violence against her and other young climate activists. Some had even called for people on social media to ‘be kind’ following the death of TV presenter Caroline Flack. The Bristol Post decided to give some of those responsible a  on its website. Kev Bennett Kev suggested that someone should grab Thunberg by her hair and swing her around. Can someone grab her pigtails and ms trunchable her over the fence, he wrote, referencing the infamous Roald Dahl character.When questioned by other Facebook users on the thread, Kev said she was aposnot a young childapos and aposalso a product of Anta parentsapos.Stevie Ralph-Taylor  Stevieaposs contribution to the debate was simple. On a post outlining the route of the march, he said: She should be burnt at the stake! Max Poncho Morgan  On a post discussing the School Strike for Climate, which Thunberg was a trailblazer of, Max said: milkshakes at the ready.

The group were kicked off the flight from East Midlands to Alicante after the fight broke out on the tarmac. Jake Hawkins and nine of his friends had been drinking at the airport, reports Leicestershire Live. The -year-old, who was due to get married to the mother of his two children after the holiday, had already boarded when a member of the ground staff ordered him off the plane because of the brawl at the bottom of the boarding staircase. Self-employed building maintenance worker Hawkins, who had used his own money to pay for some of his friends to join him on the trip, demanded the eight of them who had not been fighting should be allowed to fly to Spain. But the airport staff said no and called the police. After shouting and swearing at the airport ground staff, he turned his attention to the Leicestershire Police officers who arrived. One police officer said he was “dancing around in a rage” and acting as though under the influence of drugs. Meanwhile, other passengers, including a couple with young children, looked on in shock. All  from the stag party were kept off the plane, and the flight on the afternoon of October  last year left without them. At Leicester Magistrates’ Court on Tuesday, Hawkins admitted using threatening behaviour with intent to cause airport staff and police officers harassment, alarm or distress. The court heard no-one  in the stag group was charged with an offence. Prosecutor Michael Cole told the court: “This should have been a happy time for the defendant. He was going to Alicante with his friends. It was a stag do and he was the stag. “But as they boarded the plane a fight broke out between members of his group. There’s nothing to suggest he has anything to do with that fight. “They were all taken off before the flight left. It was delayed and it would have caused knock-on effects, causing disruption to people at the airport generally. “He became angry in his demeanour towards staff and that continued until police arrived. “It was foul language and general aggression.”  Ian Pridham, representing Hawkins, of Blyth Road, Worksop, Nottinghamshire, said his client’s recollections were “a blur” but he read from the police officer’s statement to the court. Mr Pridham said: “He says Mr Hawkins became extremely irate and was shouting and swearing and danced around in a rage. “He says the anger was towards the situation and he did not make verbal threats.” Mr Pridham said his client was a hard-working father of two and was remorseful. He told the court: “Mr Hawkins deeply regrets the outburst. He is ashamed of that. “He had looked forward to this weekend and he had booked it and paid for it but lost everything because two of his party acted like idiots.” Mr Pridham said his client had not been on drugs but might have appeared that way to the police officer because he suffers from ADHD.  He said: “Everyone was in high spirits. Perhaps in hindsight they shouldn’t have drunk at the airport beforehand but they did. “Unbeknownst to him, the high spirits amongst his group boiled over. “You have before you a very hard-working young man with a huge amount of responsibility on his shoulders. “He’s paying his way and not relying on the state.” The chairman of the bench, Stephen Bryan, told Hawkins: “People don’t want to go to the airport to see people screaming and shouting at airport staff and police officers. “To have to deal with a group of yobs having a fight is not acceptable to them or us.

Venables and Robert Thompson, both aged  at the time of the murder in , have never seen the inside of an adult jail for the two-year-oldaposs murder. One of them has been housed just  minutes away from Jamesapos devastated parents, Denise and Stuart Fergus, who are desperate for the pair to get aposproperapos sentences in prison. They hope that Jamesapos landmark birthday on March  will be one with a positive legacy as they continue their campaign, but are adamant celebration is the wrong word. Speaking on new podcast series, aposHelen Wood chats to...apos - a collaboration with the Manchester Evening News - Denise said: “There’s been no justice for James whatsoever.“Thereaposs only one thing that I asked for and that was for them to have a proper sentence in a prison. “I didnapost expect them to throw away the key - I knew one day they’d walk again, but at least I would have had some justice for Jamesthey’d have spent time in an adult prison.  “But they never have done, they were put in a children’s secure unit where they got the best of everything so thereaposs no justice there again. “In fact I feel that they’ve been rewarded for the crime that they have committed - not punished.” When James was abducted, tortured and killed in February  in Bootle, Merseyside, it sent shock waves across the nation which have never been forgotten. Venables and Thompson served eight years in children’s secure units - the former was sent to the Red Bank Home in Merseyside while the latter was housed in Barton Moss Secure Care Centre in Manchester.  After being freed in , they were given new identities at the age of . Years later, when Denise and her husband Stuart found out they had been housed in close proximity to their home in Liverpool - one just  minutes away - they were devastated. Denise said: “They may as well have put one each side of me, at least then I would have known where they were and I would have kept a closer eye on them.” The couple told Big Brother winner Ms Wood how over the years they would be approached on the street by complete strangers who claimed to have knowledge about Jamesapos killers lestyles at the childrenaposs units.Stuart said: “We could be out shopping one day and someone would come and speak to us and then walk away. “We’ve had people knock at the door, total strangers who say she [Denise] was not getting the correct justice.” While Thompson has kept a low profile, Venables - whose identity has been leaked online - was sent to prison in  and  over possession of child abuse imagery. This prompted Denise to  petition the government  to conduct a public inquiry into her sonaposs case, which she believes raised a aposnumber of issues that have been swept under the carpetapos.In the petition, which received more than , signatures, Denise questioned why experts deemed Venables to be rehabilitated, and called for the report of the prison service into an aposincidentapos at Red Bank secure unit to be published. The government responded: The offender was convicted of further offences as a direct result of robust and effective monitoring. Therefore the Government considers that a public inquiry into this tragic case is not necessary. The frustrated mum - who also has thee other sons, Thomas, Leon and Michael - believes that Venables should be held to account for his identity being leaked online, believing itaposs aposhis faultapos.  She continued: “He’s untouchable, that’s the way it feels. All the money that’s spent on him to hide his identity, hundreds of thousands have been spent on him.” Stuart agreed, adding: “He’s laughed in the face of the government. Despite the horror of that day, Denise has always remained calm and composed and has dedicated her le to getting justice for her son. But for her family, itaposs a fight that is yet to be won. Speaking to Big Brother winner Helen Wood on the podcast, which is a collaboration with the Manchester Evening News, Denise said: “There’s been no justice for James whatsoever.  “Thereaposs only one thing that I asked for and that was for them to have a proper sentence in a prison. “I didnapost expect them to throw away the key - I knew one day they’d walk again, but at least I would have had some justice for Jamesthey’d have spent time in an adult prison. “But they never have done, they were put in a children’s secure unit where they got the best of everything so thereaposs no justice there again. “In fact I feel that they’ve been rewarded for the crime that they have committed - not punished.” Since his death, Denise and her family have worked tirelessly to help other families in James’ name through the work of the James Bulger Memorial Trust. The charity supports young people who are disadvantaged through bereavement,crime, hatred or bullying, by providing family holidays. They have events throughout the year to fund raise for the charity, and the next one will be their biggest yet. This year’s Black Tie and Tiara Ball, Saturday, March , will celebrate a milestone that James sadly never reached.

Vanessa Franco ordered what she thought was the fast food chainaposs new vegan Quorn fillet burger.She said she was horried when she took three bites and suspected that it was chicken because the burger tasted dferent. The mum claims she complained to staff at the restaurant in Colliers Wood, south-west London, and they started laughing before replacing the chicken burger with a Quorn one. KFC said it would speak to staff and offer Vanessa a free meal as a gesture of goodwill. Vanessa, who recently turned vegan and has been a le-long vegetarian, said: I realised the texture tasted dferent. I drove back to KFC and asked them to confirm it was a vegan burger. That’s when the girl who served me told me it was a chicken fillet burger. She then called her colleague, who told me to come inside.  She also saidI took bites out of it then why didn’t I notice it was a chicken burger  I explained I have been a vegetarian my whole le. With her baby son asleep in the back seat of the car, Vanessa, of Pollards Hill, south London, wanted to carry on the conversation in the drive-thru. But she said staff insisted she come inside instead.  She added: I then went in with him [her son] and had to wake him up, the manager then came out. That’s when he gave me a vegan burger, didn’t apologise and laughed and said aposyou should have known it was chickenapos. All of the staff stood there staring at me. I felt humiliated and have been left traumatised due to not only a le style choice but also religion being broken and made fun of.  I was speechless and canapost express how disgusting their customer service was. KFC later apologised. A spokesman said: This isn’t great and we’re really sorry for what happened here. Our vegan burger launched last month and we took its arrival seriously – putting strict new processes in place to make sure it’s served properly, including the use of separate coloured tongs and storage units.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailMob target Emilio Di Giovine knew it was an offer he couldn’t refuse... a rare reunion with his daughter, the Mafia Princess. The former crime boss left an Italian hideaway to join celebrations – in Lancashire, of all places – for Marisa Merico’s th birthday. It was a milestone both father and daughter never expected to see. For Marisa recalls loved ones being killed as she grew up – before taking over the Mafia reins herself when her dad was in jail for two murders and other crimes. And Giovine, , has had a bullet with his name on since turning informer on Milan’s feared ’Ndrangheta gang.  Marisa says: “It is such a celebration, as at one stage I didn’t think I would make it to .“It could have been very dferent, given my former le. Many people in my family died young because they were involved in the Mafia. “Many were gunned down or died as a result of drugs, so the fact I’m here today celebrating with Dad is very special.  It is the first time in  years he has been back to England and  years since he has left Italy. “When I met him at Manchester Airport I just hugged him so tightly, it was such an emotional reunion. I can’t believe he is here, where I have lived most of my le. It’s surreal.”  The birthday bash at a country hotel near Marisa’s Poulton-le-Fylde home marked the first time she had seen her father in more than six years. He now lives under a secret identity and is even airbrushed out of family photos. Giovine became a marked man after testying against his fellow ’Ndrangheta mobsters. He ran a drugs and arms racket before being jailed in the late s and ’s. That was when Marisa – then just  – took over, smuggling arms and cash across borders and mixing with notorious mobsters. She was jailed for two years and nine months for using £.million of laundered Mafia money to buy a house in England.  Marisa was held in Durham Prison alongside murderers Rose West and Myra Hindley. But Marisa turned her back on crime and spoke about her past in an interview with the Sunday Mirror six years ago – after a cloak-and-dagger meeting with her dad. These days, she is a contented grandmother of two. When not giving talks about her le, she is studying for an honours degree in criminology and wants to help prisoners change their lives. Marisa’s le story was turned into a book – Mafia Princess – and is being filmed for Italian Amazon Prime. She wore a Versace dress as her kids Lara, , and Frank, , joined her at her bash – and The X Factor finalists Tre Amici were the star turn.Giovine says: “I’m so proud of Marisa, she is so lovely and beautul. To be here is so wonderful. I was absent for so many birthdays that I had to be at this one. “Family is everything, to be here with Marisa in England is a dream come true. I was so emotional when I saw her, I cried like a baby. I missed out on so much and I am very sorry for that. “I was flying around the world or in prison, I didn’t spend the time with her that I should have.”  Marisa says: “There were many times Dad hasn’t been able to be there – my wedding day was one. “There was a price on his head and a gang were after him. He wasn’t able to give me away. We decided it was too risky. Thank God we did. As I pulled up in my wedding car there were men on bikes with guns waiting for him. “They wouldn’t have thought twice about killing me in the crossfire. As Dad wasn’t there they didn’t shoot but it could have been very dferent.” Marisa was born into the mob after her mum Pat – a Blackpool teenager working as an au pair in Milan – fell for Giovine. His mother Maria was known as Granny Heroin for her ­ruthless leadership of the city’s Ndrangheta gang. Anything – anyone – could be used for gain... including Marisa when she was a baby. Giovine hid contraband in her cot and in  of his car as he smuggled cigarettes across the Alps on family “holidays”.  Marisa recalls another crime run, saying: “I went to Klosters where Dad did a deal with a big arms dealer and I had to pretend I went to a posh English school.” Her parents split when she was one. Pat took Marisa back to Blackpool when she was nine. But she ed each summer and remembers, aged just , posing with a doll in one hand and her dad’s gun in the other. At , she ed to Milan and joined “the firm”. Marisa delivered up to £, to gangsters in Seville, Spain. She married henchman Bruno Merico – father to Lara.  Marisa recalls: “Dad sent Bruno and I to Calabria to pick up an arms shipment. It was a -hour drive with me, a distraction in a tight dress, sitting almost on Bruno’s knee as the weapons took up so much space. At dawn we stopped for a coffee and saw five carabinieri cars at the service stop. We decidedwe drove on and didn’t stop it would look suspicious. “So we had a coffee. By the time we were going the policemen were standing right by our Citroen. We got in and, cool as you like, took off like Bonnie and Clyde. This was our le.” Marisa also left sums of £million at drop-off points to be laundered or used to buy weapons or drugs.  She even hid money in her daughter’s carry cot – just like Giovine.

The Duke and Duchess’ security team were based near the couple’s plush eight-bedroom, ocean-front mansion on Vancouver Island. The protection officers only moved out when Harry, , flew back to the UK last week for his remaining public appearances before stepping back fully from royal le. A neighbour said: “There used to be a security team there. They moved out a few days ago when Harry went. We haven’t seen them since.” Other officers are understood to have stayed in a waterfront hotel since Harry and Meghan arrived in November. Details of the Airbnb base came as it emerged that the couple’s nine-month-old son Archie will notto the UK when Meghan joins Harry here for their final engagements.  It is understood that will stretch the resources of the Met Police, which is in charge of protecting the couple. While the Duke and Duchess are being protected in the UK, their son will also require security in Canada. It will intensy the debate about the cost of the couple’s protection, which the Mirror revealed is estimated to be as high as £million per year.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailA mum of nine does three loads of washing a day and runs bathtimes like a conveyor belt. Manchester mum Claire Ambrose was just  when she had her first baby Jake, but he was tragically stillborn at six months into her pregnancy.At  she welcomed her twin girls Jessica and Leah, who are now that age themselves - Jessica being the first to move out of the familyaposs home in Failsworth to live with her boyfriend, Manchester Evening News reported .After separating from their dad shortly after they were born, Claire raised the twins alone until meeting partner Chris Boyle, with whom sheaposs had seven more children - four boys and three girls. Thereaposs Alex,  Alicia,  Kayleigh,  Lewis, nine Marissa, eight Leo, six and the youngest, four-year-old Tommy. Itaposs the love of that aposbaby phaseapos that has kept Claire, now, , yearning for more. If it wasnapost for a breast cancer diagnosis in December - and the treatment sheaposs now having - she admits she would probably have had more children. Despite the anxiety that followed her stillbirth and the premature arrival of her twins, who came five weeks early, her pregnancies were straightforward, with just the usual morning sickness. We didnapost plan on having so many, said Claire. But we didnapost stop it either. We were quite laid back really and the children always asked me to have another one too. I loved getting a bump and feeling movements. It was probably a bit of enjoying pregnancy and that baby, baby stage. I think as soon as the youngest starts to walk and talk and is able to answer back, thataposs when I want another baby - one who canapost answer back she laughed. I would like another girl, because my youngest girl is now eight, but I canapost because of the health problems. When it comes to managing such a big household, Claire - whose shortest labour was with Alicia, who was born at home just  minutes after she started with contractions - says itaposs all about being organised.  The family live in a neat three-storey, four-bed town house. By the time the kids get home from school each day, sheaposs got tomorrowaposs unorm hung on the back of the living room door ready to go. Three loads of washing are usually done each day - the children bring their dirty washing downstairs and separate it into darks, lights and colours. Theyaposre quite good at helping out really, Claire said. The older boys might just chuck it down but generally they all do their bit. If the washer breaks, which can happen a lot, I just want to cry. We do have to work as a team or  it just doesnapost work. Sunday is the day when we pull everything out and do a big clean and itaposs the day we get the homework done too.  Creative homework is the worst, it does get a bit messy and Iaposve had to ask another mum for help carrying things to school before nowitaposs been a big project theyaposve had to make. Claire said that bath time is aposlike a conveyor beltapos with the kids taking it in turns to jump in either the bath or the shower. Iaposll run the bath for one and then when one is in the bath another will get in the shower and itaposll just carry on like that until theyaposre all done, said Claire. She helps things run smoothly by making sure each of the children has a full set of unorm to last the whole week. The younger ones will have five polo shirts, jumpers and trousers washed and ironed ready for a Monday. It comes at a cost though.  With £ each for a pair on school shoes, the footwear bill for the seven school aged children amounts to £ alone, and thatapossone pair lasts the year. Claire is savvy with money though and saves wherever she can - making the most of sales, offers and cashback sites. Now unable to work since her cancer diagnosis, Claire has done part-time jobs around the children whenever she could - most recently at McBrides Cleaning last year - and Chris works full time manufacturing frames at Shepley Windows in Dukinfield. The child benefit cap, which means families can now only claim it for up two children, wasnapost brought in until after her children were born so Claire gets £ a week for the youngest seven. On top of that she gets £ a week in child tax credit. But with bills including the £ a month rent, nearly £ a month for gas and electric and £ for council tax, as well as the weekly £ food shop, thereaposs little spare for luxuries.  She canapost do the shopping in one lot either, because thereaposs nowhere to store it all. Theyaposll easily go though  pints of milk a week, six boxes of cereal and endless toilet rolls. Iaposll buy a pack of  toilet rolls about every three days and put four in each bathroom, said Claire, but almost daily youaposll get someone shouting from the toilet that they need one. Weaposve had to run out to the corner shop while theyaposre still on the toilet before now. The children donapost go without. They have smart clothes, consoles and tablets like most kids, but Claire says such big items are always for their birthday or Christmas. The four boys share one bedroom, the three youngest girls in another and twin Leah now has her own room. Theyaposve never taken them abroad and any family holiday is usually spent in a caravan at a Haven site. With so many children, it wouldnapost be worth risking a fine for a cheaper holiday in term time.  Claire is all too aware of the judgements people make about big families, and is keen to change that stigma. There are people I know who don’t work because they don’t want to, theyaposre too lazy or whatever, said Claire. I could afford the kids when I had them. We had Chris bringing a wage in too, but even now I still want to be able to give my kids as much as I can. And I have tried to teach the kids thatyou want money you have to earn it. There is slot of stigma that people have children for the benefits - andthey are capable of working and choose not to then fair enough. Don’t get me wrong, I love being home with my kids, but I know thatI’m ever going to be able to take them abroad on holiday, or give them nice things, I’m going to have to work for it. I’m not scared of doing that. She added: With regards to the benefit cap in respect of more than two kids, then yes in some ways why have them allyou can’t pay for them and you’re not willing to go and get a job. But it’s a bit unfair to bring the rule in and cap all big familiesthere are circumstances that get in the way of them working.  Claire hasnapost had much external support apart from that of her own mum, who was able to help more when she was younger, before she had health problems of her own. Her dad died when she was  and her only sibling, brother Anthony, lives in America. The comments do hurt sometimes, she said. You do get comments where they say that I bet the kids are scruffy or the house is disgusting or that I smoke, drink, or take drugs, but to be honest I clean my house daily. I don’t smoke, I certainly don’t go drugs and I had my first glass of wine since Christmas last weekend as a mini celebration for being able to lie on my side again after my op - and that was won on a raffle. I rarely go out. I don’t have the money to waste. I’d rather it went on my kids. Things in my house like new carpets I get off pay weekly companies. I don’t have the money to pay for expenses like that in full. But I want my kids to have a nice home. I don’t spoil them, they don’t get new clothes every weekend, or lots of treats, or money for nothing. On their birthdays they get to pick what they want for tea, like McDonaldaposs or KFC and again I use money off vouchers. I do my best. They might not be as lucky as some kids and get as much as some kids, but they never complain. I always try and make them appreciate what they have got and tell them there are children out there who have a lot less. They also are lucky enough to have brothers and sisters who will always be there for them to talk to and keep each other company.  If they ask why they can’t go on a plane, I reply something silly like, aposthere isn’t an aeroplane big enough for us allapos, or aposmummy doesn’t have enough pennies yet, but one dayapos. I also try and take them on free days out to places like Heaton Park or Blackpool. It doesn’t have to cost an arm and leg, money doesn’t have to be wasted on arcades, mine will be happy playing on the beach for hours and having an ice cream. Claire and Chris recently decided to separate, but she says they remain good friends and he will be there for the children as much as he can. For now she needs to concentrate on her breast cancer treatment and recovery to hopefully give her many more years to enjoy her big brood.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailPrince Charles and Princess Dianaaposs marriage was a very complicated one, and their troubles started before they even said I Do. The heir to the throne was reportedly under a huge amount of pressure to find a royal we and settle down, so popped the question in February  after meeting Lady Spencer just  times. Diana, who was just  at the time, nervously laughed when her boyfriend got down on one knee in the nursery at Windsor Castle - but she was delighted to place the stunning sapphire engagement ring on her finger. Shortly afterwards the couple shared their happy news with the world and well-wishers started counting down the days until their Royal Wedding. And while people couldnapost get enough of what appeared to be their fairytale love story, things were very dferent behind the scenes. But as the wedding planning began Charles had to go about his royal duties as normal, and left for a tour of Australia and New Zealand just a few weeks later. Saying goodbye at such an exciting time should have been dficult for the the couple, but years later Diana admitted that something he did that day broke her heart. Royal expert Anthony Holden wrote in his book Charles: A Biography that when the future princess went to say her goodbyes to Charles, the phone rang. He claims it was Camilla.  Rather than ignoring the call and saying finishing their goodbyes, Charles is said to have picked up. Diana walked out of the room and the Prince simply started a conversation with Diana. Holden writes: [Diana] was weeping because her last minutes alone with the prince at the palace had been interrupted by a phone call. It was Camilla, wanting her own fond farewell. So tender was the conversation that Diana had felt obliged to leave. That moment, she said  years later, ‘just broke my heart.apos” Looking back at the early days of the coupleaposs relationship with the power of hindsight, there are signs that everything wasnapost as perfect as people hoped.  Former BBC News anchor Angela Rippon sat down with the couple for their final interview before the wedding. She watched it back for the first time for the Channel  documentary Charles and Di: The Truth Behind their Wedding. She said: With the knowledge of hindsight you read so much more into body language, what was said, looks that were given, reactions. Thataposs the value of hindsight isnapost it. But the final few moments of the interview really stand out to her, when she wishes the couple a letime of happiness.  Charles looks Diana, but she looks down at the floor. That expression on Dianaaposs face at the end speaks volumes. Maybe we should have read so much more into that five seconds at the end the interview. It might have told us so much more about what was to come. Before they went in they were given a briefing by the Queenaposs press secretary Michael Shea.  He told them very firmly that the interview would be endedthey asked any questions that had not been agreed. During the interview Michael stood directly behind Angela out of camera shot, but in Dianaaposs eyeline. Iaposm not quite sure how comfortable it made her feel. I got the impression that Princes Charles was very protective towards her.

Mum Meghan Markle is expected to leave nine-month-old Archie in Canada when she s to the UK this week for her and husband Prince Harryaposs last days as working royals.It is thought that Archie will stay with a nanny and family friend Jessica Mulroney while Meghan, , and Harry, , are here. Harry ed to the UK last week, and he and Meghan are due to appear together at three events early this month before they officially quit public le on March .  The Queen, , and the Royal Family are understood to be very sad that they have seen so little of Archie since he was born in May last year, the Sunday Times reported.Archie hasnapost been the UK this year and for the past three months has been in Canada, where the Sussexes have been staying in a waterfront mansion on Vancouver Island. The Queen and Prince Philip, , met their great-grandson at Windsor Castle when he was two days old, but missed his christening two months later because they were attending an annual private weekend they host at Sandringham.  Archie is said to have met his cousins Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis at a polo match in July, but contact since then has been minimal, it was reported. Harry and Meghan have kept Archie out of the public eye.The last official sighting was a photo - showing Harry holding his son - that was posted on the coupleaposs Instagram account.Meanwhile, detectives protecting Harry and Meghan have been staying in a luxury taxpayer-funded £,-a-week Airbnb in Canada.The Duke and Duchessaposs security team were housed close to the coupleaposs eight-bedroom oceanfront mansion on Vancouver Island, having access to a beach and sea views. Only when Harry flew back to the UK last week for his remaining public appearances before stepping back fully from royal le later this month, did the protection officers move out.  A neighbour said: There used to be a security team there. They moved out a few days ago when Harry went. We havenapost seen them since. Other officers are understood to be accommodated where on the island and had been staying in a waterfront hotel since the couple arrived in Canada in November. It is understood the move will stretch resources on the Met Police, who are in charge of protecting the couple, further. While the Duke and Duchess are protected in the UK, it will mean their son will also require security as he remains in Canada.

As rain continues to fall on Yorkshire and waterways such as the River Aire continue to spill over, towns in East Riding are getting deeper and deeper underwater. The Met Office has declared this month as the wettest February since records began in  – with a UK average of .mm, beating the February  figure of .mm. Huge amounts of that have fallen on Yorkshire, where dozens of flood warnings have been issued for low lying areas across the county. Two of the people whose lives have been massively impacted by the flood are Kevin and Catherine Lorryman. They live in a bungalow in Snaith which is now almost completely underwater.Kevin said seeing only the roof of his home rising above the floodwater is heartbreaking. We are going to have to demolish I think, he told the BBC. Mrs Lorryman added: We are just in a dream world at the moment and there are people all over this town exactly the same, itaposs a nightmare. Kevinaposs story was first reported by Hull Live on Wednesday when his home was under just ft of water. At that point the water levels had risen to just below the windows, consuming the outside the property.“It was  when that house was built and it’s never been wet, he said at the time. It’s never been like this. Never. It’s ft deep. If it goes another foot, we’re going to have to go in and put stuff on top of the kitchen worktop. We’re going to have to get a container hired and physically take all the stuff out with a team of us. We’ll probably never get insurance again. I’m going to have to flood proof it. I’m going to rebuild it in case it happens again. That’s all I can do. Thousands of items including clothing, bedding and toiletries have been donated for those people who were forced to leave their homes and are being distributed at the sports hall in Snaith. The Lorrymans are not the only family impacted by the floods. Linda Bonner said she has lived in Snaith for  years and was unable to sleep due to the worry.  “I live just around the corner and we’re all sandbagged up off George Street, she said on Wednesday morning. I’ve not slept all night. You’re looking out to see what is happening. I’ve been here nearly  years and I’ve not seen anything like this. Never.” Sandra East, who has lived in Snaith for  years, said everybody is concerned. “It’s never been like this, she said. You’re alarmed aren’t you   “Water never chooses where it’s going to go and you don’t know where it’s going to go so everyone is alarmed. Everybody is concerned, not just for themselves. It’s a good community and people are concerned about each other.” In Snaith planners recommended steps to mitigate flooding risks including making some houses capable of withstanding cm of water. But distraught residents in the area are now dealing with flooding nearly at ceiling level. Andrew Percy, the MP for the area, has met with residents and Environment Agency chiefs today, and called for the government to review how it allocates flood defence money.  Mr Percy, Conservative MP for Brigg and Goole, said : We live in a flood risk area, but thereaposs no precedent of it in this area, thereaposs no record of flooding in this area. There has been a record level of rainfall, but it is becoming more normal and we need to look at how we need to manage flood resources in the country. Simply having all the water landing here at the bottom of the catchment isnapost ideal. The government is going to have to do a full review of how we deposit flood defence resources. Rain-soaked areas in East Yorkshire have been battered by torrential downpours for several days, causing the River Aire to bust its banks and leave an area the size of Lake Windermere under water.  Despite the dramatic water levels, last night there were no reported evacuations in deluged towns in East Yorkshire for the first night since the flooding started, authorities have said. East Riding of Yorkshire Council said water levels are generally dropping or remaining stable in Snaith, Gowdall, East Cowick and West Cowick, but are expected to remain high for several days.

Baffour Amponsah, , David Powell, , and -year-old Alfie Taylor broke into the home in Gravesend, Kent while brandishing knives and wearing masks. The trio woke their victims who were asleep upstairs and demanded cash. The victims were tied up, punched in the head and ordered to lie face down on the bed by one of the men while the other two raided the house. The thieves made off with jewellery and cash before one of the victims managed to overpower the man holding them down. He pushed the thug out of the bedroom, locked the door and called the police after the suspects fled. Officers attended the scene on July  last year, along with a police dog who tracked the suspects to another property. Elizabeth Woods, , who opened the door to the nearby house tried to stop officers entering and attempted to set her dog on them. Amponsah and Taylor were discovered hiding in the house - one in a bed and the other in a wardrobe. Police seized jewellery and cash belonging to the victims as well as designer handbags, shoes and approximately £,. A cannabis cultivation of around  plants was also discovered in a downstairs room. Amponsah and Taylor were arrested and both pleaded guilty to aggravated burglary. Woods was arrested and charged with perverting the course of justice, permitting the production of cannabis and possession of criminal property. Police arrested Powell on July  and he was found to have a black face mask and gloves in his pocket which connected him to the crime.Powell denied aggravated burglary but was found guilty by a jury following a trial at Woolwich crown court. Amponsah, from Lewisham, pleaded guilty to burglary and was sentenced to nine years’ imprisonment. Taylor, from Rotherhithe, pleaded guilty to burglary and landed an eight year prison sentence. Powell, from Gravesend, was found guilty of burglary by a jury and was jailed for  years. Woods was sentenced to  months in prison. Detective Constable Rebecca Ward, of Kent Police, said: “This was a violent burglary and an extremely terrying ordeal for the victims. “Not only were they threatened with knives and tied up, they were assaulted without being able to defend themselves. “However, the bravery of one of those victims resulted in him being able to call us while the offenders were still in his home.

Speaking to thousands of people in St Peteraposs Square, the Pope announced his cold will force him to skip a week-long Lenten spiritual retreat with senior Vatican officials that had been due to start later in the day. He appeared at the window of the Vaticanaposs Apostolic Palace for the first time since Wednesday for his weekly Sunday noon message and blessing. He said: Unfortunately a cold will force me not take part this year . I will follow the meditations from here. It is the first time that Francis has missed the annual retreat in Ariccia, south of Rome, since he became Pope in March . The pontf attended the Ash Wednesday mass earlier this week and he appeared to be suffering from a cold. He was seen blowing his nose and coughing during the service and his voice sounded hoarse.The Vatican had previously said only that he was suffering from a slight indisposition. His spokesman Matteo Bruni dismissed speculation that Francis was anything more than slightly unwell. There is no evidence that would lead to diagnosing anything but a mild indisposition, he said.  On Thursday, The Pope cancelled a trip across Rome to celebrate Mass and on Friday he could not attend a meeting about an articial intelligence conference.Despite cancelling official engagements due to his illness, during the week he continued to work from his residence at the Vaticanaposs Santa Marta hotel and received people in private, Mail Online reports.Pope Francis has taken ill at a time when Italy is battling a surging outbreak of the potentially deadly coronavirus - though there is no suggestion he has it himself.

It was so inspirational.”Grove’s principal teacher of computing, Gavin Pyott, said it was ‘fantastic’ to have Chris’s input when encouraging pupils to take an interest in computing and showed the students that there were many dferent avenues in digital that they could explore.He said: “It is really important to have people like Chris come in to school and encourage pupils to come in to computing in ways that we couldn’t and show you can actually have a really successful career.“He managed to get across to pupils that it really was important to stick in at school in a way that actually inspired the pupils, even though we tell them all the time.“However Chris is a real le example of someone from Dundee who went on to be massively successful and shared with the pupils that the real le skills that they are learning here at school are what people in the industry are looking for.“It was fantastic that Chris was able to take the time out of his schedule and spend the morning with our pupils with a massive thanks going to teacher Kiran Oza who organised the whole day.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2020/02/Dundee-Arbroath.jpg ","title":"ness nearing dundee first team comeback as mcghee returns","story":"Jamie Ness is nearing ato the Dundee first-team as he steps up his recovery from a calf problem.The former Rangers and Stoke man has been in full training this week after suffering yet another injury problem in the Scottish Cup defeat to Motherwell in January.The central midfielder’s time at Dens Park has been more stop than start with an ankle complaint picked up in July at Cove Rangers the first of a number of spells on the sidelines.Boss James McPake says tomorrow’s home clash with Arbroath may be too soon but a hectic spell over the next few weeks could see Ness pressed back into action.“Tomorrow might come too early for Jamie but he’s had part of a session Monday, full sessions Tuesday and Wednesday with new insoles in his boots which seem to be helping,” said James.“He’s not had much game time so we’ll maybe get him up to speed in training.“Four games in  days might change that, though.”After the visit of the Red Lichties tomorrow, Dundee face Alloa at Dens on Tuesday ahead of a trip to Ayr United next weekend.The Honest Men then call in at Dens the following Tuesday before another home game for the Dark Blues sees Dunfermline in town in just over a fortnight.The Dens men go into tomorrow’s contest with almost a full squad of players. vw, px\"  Long-term absentee Jordan Marshall is the only first-team player ruled out.Jordan McGhee is ready toafter surgery to sort a wrist complaint while Cammy Kerr will push for Christie Elliott’s spot on the right side of defence after recovering from his own surgery on his knee."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2020/02/DNic_Tele_Fball_Podcast-8-scaled-e1582122918392-940x547.jpg ","title":"renewed calls for dundee to have park and ride to compliment low emission zone","story":"Environmental campaigners have renewed their calls for Dundee to have a park and ride facility on the city#s outskirts to reduce carbon emissions.Doug McLaren of the Dundee Re-Use and Recycling Centre believes the city cannot effectively slash its carbon footprint unless complimentary measures beyond the proposed low emission zoneare considered.Mr McLaren, who spoke during discussions about the LEZ this week, said: #The consultation processwas actually very helpful # to my mind a lot of good stuff came from it.#I hope it doesn#t stop there as this is quite a narrowly focused thing # there#s so many other issues I think we#ve got to take into account.#The LEZ itself isn#t sufficient, it doesn#t have all the answers # the park and ride issue should now be top of the table.The proposed LEZ # which is yet to be agreed # has proven contentious among campaigners.The preferred option, with a relative majority of % following the consultation, will allow non-compliant vehicles to access three car parks at the edge of the city centre.It also fails to include Lochee Road, one of Scotland#s most polluted streets # a move described by critics as #absurd#.Coldside councillor Helen Wright says further measures need to be considered for other heavily congested streets such as Forfar Road, regularly used by heavy goods vehicles to access the city centre.Ms Wright said: #Coming to Dundee  years ago I had no problems at all.

Nearly three years later I fear the dream is still a long way from that reality.Mid Argyll Youth Development Servicescertainly seems to have ambitious plans for an indoor skate park and this is to be lauded, however a quick look online will show an apparent apathy with regard to moving forward with the project. A young man created the #Lochgilphead Skate Park Association# on Facebook in , yet a final post in  indicated how little the proposal had moved forward. If the project needs more money to actually get it built we need to know how much, so that appropriate funding can be sought.What is causing the project to take years to come to fruition The potential for help by the £ million Tarbert and Lochgilphead Regeneration Fund in  was dashed when councillors instead decided that improvements to road junctions, streets, a cycle track and indoor bowling were more important, and allocated a staggering £, to feasibility studies for these projects alone, this is before any work is actually done, you understand.That is a great deal of money for feasibility studies and design works.Let us be realistic # in nine long years the community has gone from the initial excited buzz about a skate park to finally managing to purchase a plot of land upon which to build it in early . From there it seems the project has not been able to move.In the meantime the youngsters who worked so hard to give momentum to the project appear to have given up hope and are now probably giving thought to employment prospects rather than having fun.It is a sad state of affairs.But rather than giving up hope, let us reignite this campaign for our children to have the dream of a skate park in Lochgilphead whilst they are still young enough to enjoy it.Nick MacIneskar, TayvallichSir,With regard to your story in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser #Inveraray seawall in need of attention#, would it be possible to contact BEAR Scotland and ask themthey could also create an access point to the shore Possibly at the bus stop at Barn Brae. Thanks very much.Marion McIntosh, InveraraySir,I should like to make an appeal to all MPs, MSPs, councillors and all lawmakers that in  they make no new laws.At the beginning of this new decade they should improve the laws they already passed. I would even like for them to go further and reduce the number of laws that are in existence.Now please don’t get me wrong, I am not against all laws. What I fear is that instead of addressing the issues which are negative to iniduals and society, legislators believing that by extending what are regarded as crimes changes society for the better. Their belief is wrong.We know that parking on pavements is wrong #upskirting# is horrying smoking in a car in which they are children is unacceptable dropping litter is shameful driving through a red light is dangerous.What we need is the range of social and cultural influences that help us feel that we should behave in a positive way. In the s, s and s the majority of people regularly attended churches and religious organisations. In these environments people developed feelings of what was right and wrong. Positive behaviour was also developed by participating in the extensions of these organisations through activities in young mother groups women#s guilds, choirs, and religious celebrations. These helped develop positive moral compass in people.Equally, most children and young people went to youth organisations such as the Girl Guides, Scouts, the BBs, army and naval cadets. Even into the s local authorities ran youth clubs and had excellent people called #youth leaders#. No more. #We cannot afford them# is the call of the day. Without them the honourable behaviour of society will continue to deteriorate.So my plea to politicians is simple # stop making us all criminals by passing more and more laws and start supporting and encouraging agencies, groups and people who indirectly and directly instil in iniduals behaviour of which all can be proud.Finlay CraigCoveSir,There is all the hoo-ha at the moment over the lesser royals deciding its going to be a better le that beckons from opting out from royal duties # perhaps wanting a less stressful, more normal, le for themselves and their family as ordinary people away from the media hype and national newspapers.It was lovely, however, to see in the same week front page on the local paper a real regional award for a less well-known commoner.An MBE given for services to the local youth community, making this two great awards for Lochgilphead in recent years and showing that local strong ladies in Mid Argyll do have what it takes.Hard work and true Scottish grit and determination in their hearts for the area and community. More of the same meritorious awards for the ordinary people of Scotland please.Credit to all editors and staff for their outstanding journalism given over the years in all of Scotlands progressive, thriving local papers.Stephen Jones, Oban"},{"url":null,"title":"keep that mojo burning 4 below","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsFrom Oban,  Below previously graced the MOJO stage before in  with a blistering set from their debut album Alpha, to great acclaim.

A wee van and a motorbike were behind them at the time and they let them pass and they disappeared down the twisty road at an incrediblespeed.They reached Tighnabruaich at about  o#clock and saw Fulmar in the water, but when they stopped to speak to Johnny Malcolm and Donald Turner they were told she was not in the water more than # an hour and still not fully rigged. They were quite right but George Smith said they were busy getting Psyche ready for launchingbut they would be out first thing in the morning to bend on the sails and finish off the rigging.They got their storesin the yard and with these and their luggage went aboard in two trips. Things were soon put sufficiently enough in order to allow them to get to bed and after watching Psyche go down the slip they were soon in their bunks. It was a beautully clear evening but distinctly cold.Next morning they were up at sevenand about eight the yard men came out and finished up their jobs. Jimmy Smith fixed up the slipping clutch and suggested we do away with the present gear lever fancy arrangement which was not strong enough for its work. This the Skipper agreed to though it meant a less handy working but it did away with the pin and shield that broke up the dog-house seat, they being replaced by a removable hatch cover. It certainly made sitting in the dog-house more comfortable.The Skipper went ashore to the village for meat and some curtain hooks while Archie watered ship and the other two continued cleaning and clearing up aboard.At quarter to twelve they were away under full sail and in brilliant sunshine but with a cold north-westerly they ran to Ardlamont then beat up to Tarbert, being passed just outside Tarbert as an aeroplane flew close overhead, by Blink. They noticed a huge oil tanker doing trials just off Arran.They were anchored off the herring pier before  o#clock and they had supper-cum-lunch then went ashore. The Pilot to visit a friend, the others to get milk in the village then to walk to the end of the road on Loch Fyne. On their way they spoke to an enthusiastic English pair, working in their garden, who wanted to know off which yacht they had come.During the evening Arcturus and Tunnag came in and one or two motor boats. Zaidie was in when they arrived and Leonora was anchored across Loch Fyne in Buck Bay.All aboard, Margaret and Archie went off to the islet in the harbour to get some roots for their new garden then soon afterwards all turned in, for though it was a glorious looking evening it was perishingly cold and the stove, lit as soon as they anchored, had been very welcome.On Sunday they were again up early and found a dull overcast day. The Pilot, ashore for water, heard a poor weather forecastfrom a fishing board. On the strength of this they hurried breakfast and by  o’clock were away with a south-westerly breeze.The Skipper gave the first beacon a rap with the boom-end as they ran out of the harbour. The beat down to Ardlamontand thee ran the engine for five minutes to get out of a nasty lop. The sun came out for about five minutes but by the time they had reached the Carry Buoythe rain had started and it got heavier and heavier.The wind strengthened with the rain and they moved up very fast into Tighnabruaich Bay then up to Loch Riddon to anchor off the pier at Ormidale. As they passed Tighnabruaich they saw Torridon was on Fulmar’s mooring and they watched her crew panicking to get off before Fulmar arrived. They wondered what the Torridons said when they saw Fulmar pass on through and realised that they could have stayed where they were. As they passed Glen Caladh the new Jansi of Kames passed under a not very healthy-sounding engine.They had lunch and the stove was lit then Margaret and Archie went ashore to visit friends and when they came back they brought with them a big sack of coal . The late afternoon and evening were spent below talking and listening to the rain hammering on the deck.Monday morning it was dry but blowing hard. They got the anchor early and motored to the moorings. The sails were hoisted to dry them and St Roma came close by to make their number and at one time a big school of thrasher whales went through the Kyles heading east and at a great speed.About noon they went ashore for a visit to the hotel and for a run round the Ardlamont road . Back aboard they had lunch and soon after packed up and came home."},{"url":null,"title":"the cinema on wheels returns","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe screen machine will be rolling back into Mid Argyll at the end of the month.Bringing with it a host of movies for film fans the Screen Machine will be in Campbeltown Road car park in Tarbert from Wednesday January  to Thursday January  and Lochgilphead Resource Centre car park from Friday January  to Sunday February .Musical fantasy film Cats, based on the Andrew Lloyd Webber stage musical, features an ensemble cast including James Corden, Judi Dench, Jason Derulo, Idris Elba, Jenner Hudson, Ian McKellen, Taylor Swt, Rebel Wilson, and Francesca Hayward.Also known as Star Wars: Episode IX, Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker is an epic space-opera film.

So how did Britain look before human interventions  Dense forest  or open woodland Research now favours the latter.Plants and animals evolved in equilibrium for thousands of years before humans impacted the landscape. Essential to this balance were ‘keynote species’ including aurochs , bison and tarpan . By grazing, these animals trampled and eroded soils, dispersed seeds and redistributed nutrients, thereby keeping the forest open. This in turn encouraged growth of large trees while also creating numerous habitats and microenvironments for a wonderful ersity of plants and smaller animals.Now this bioersity is severely threatened by modern monocultures , and massive quantities of pesticides, fungicides, fertilisers and #weed# killers. It is no wonder that insect numbers have plummeted, many bird species are endangered and wild-flower meadows have virtually vanished. So could we recreate this natural order on unproductive land and save our wildle For Isabella Tree and her husband Charlie Burrell the answer is a resounding #yes#. In her book #Wilding#, Tree describes #wilding# their , acre farm at Knepp, West Sussex, that had been unproductive for years.They introduced longhorn cattle, Exmore ponies, deer and pigs but otherwise left well alone. Within months they saw a dference # most scrub was cleared, producing an explosion of plant and animal species. And where grazers were deterred by spiny or unpalatable plants, oaks emerged that will eventually form an open woodland.But Knepp is isolated. More rewilding sites are needed with wildle corridors between them to support the populations and genetic ersity essential for long-term survival.Surely parts of Argyll are ideal for rewilding. We already have beavers creating new waterways to support aquatic species – now how about some large grazers to open up the landscape and perhaps one day recreate the ancient Celtic rainforest "},{"url":null,"title":"hair raising happenings at the co op","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowLochgilphead Co-op staff are on a fundraising mission which they hope will raise awareness and help overcome stigma around mental illness.Trusting her hairdresser Nicky MacDougall, from Casa in Ardrishaig, Tina Holloway will have her hair shaved off to raise funds for the Scottish Association for Mental Health .Explaining why she decided to take on the challenge, Tina said: #I didn#t really think before I opened my mouth.

This is a stunning route and the views over the Sound of Jura to the islands of Islay and Gigha are a rich reward for screaming muscles on the testing climbs.This will be the third year this increasingly popular event will take to the road. As it is a sportive, the Kilberry Loop is a non-competitive event and at just short of  miles long is perfect for a first-time competitor. Of course, for more competitive cyclists who want to push themselves or who are in training, the Kilberry Loop Sportive is a great event to get a personal best.The quicker cyclists in  managed the course # which has almost  metres of climbing # in under two hours, which is quick, and there are others who complete the course inside a comfortable four hours, so there is room for all abilities.Around  cyclists of all ages took part last year, with a couple of gentlemen in their early s and those in their twenties joining in # and organisers hope this year#s sportive will attract even more athletes.To make the event even more attractive Mid Argyll Cycling and Triathlon Club hopes to include race timing for the first time. And, for the third year, the Kilberry Loop Sportive is supported by British Cycling, the nation’s largest cycling organisation and national governing body for cyclesport, which actively helps and encourages people to get into cycling.If you’d like to sign up for this year’s Kilberry Loop Sportive or want more information visit the Mid Argyll Cycling and Triathlon Club website."},{"url":null,"title":"the voyages of the fulmar part four","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAs crew for our cruise we were lucky, as we have been for the four previous years, and were able to get both the Doctor and Pilot to come again. The Purser, however, found the lure of the theatre too great and she decided to spend her holidays working with a Repertory Company in Aberdeen.Again we were lucky in having a ready-made substitute in Chris Paterson, the Pilot’s we of nearly a year’s standing. We gave her the rank of Tanky – a piece of gunroom slang meaning the midshipman who trots around with the navigator or, in other words the Pilot’s Mate.As usual at the beginning of a cruise we got up early – .am – and quickly finished up our packing, loaded the car, shut up the house, and were on our road by ten minutes past seven. It was a fine bright morning with a light southerly breeze and quite promising though the weather forecast the night before had been not too cheerful. It was dead low water at Renfrew Ferry and as there was a big convoy of Army Transports crossing from north to south there was no delay in our getting across and at .am we were at the top of The Rest having had an easy and practically trafficless trip up Loch Lomond. Twenty minutes later we had Inveraray behind us.We called in at the BRS Depot at Lochgilpheadand collected our three boxes of stores and at ten to ten arrived at Crinan having passed several yachts already making their way east. The basin was busy with in it, amongst others, Arcturus, Vivien, Makoya, Boomerang, and Tookay, most of which were homeward bound. The Fulmar was lying at the back of the basin outside a motor boat and Vanda and as we unloaded the car we had a long carry round and everything was dumped on the basin wall before being taken aboard. Luckily it was turning into a lovely day. The only fly in the ointment was the poor Major – he had developed a paralysis of his back legs the day before and could do nothing but sit where put and look pitully about and only occasionally managed to drag himself a foot or two.The Mate and Bosun after being treated to tea on board Vivien got down to unpacking and stowing our gear and while they were about it the Doctor arrived with his gear and plentul supplies of Medical Comforts, a huge cake, packets of chocolate and a big box of chocolates. Dumping his stuff with the rest on deck he and the Skipper then went to the hotel and drank success to the cruise. They learnt that the night before had been a bit of a night and Arcturus was still showing its effects rather markedly.While the Mate continued the storing the Bosun got petrol and paraffin and the Tar went up to the farm for milk and at half past twelve they, with the Doctor, had lunch. Meanwhile the Skipper had gone to Ardrishaig and got a lot of fresh storesa new screwdriver, and meths. Being too early for the steamer he, after having had a beer at The Anchor, sat on a seat near the pier and had his lunch of six cookies and a sausage roll and listened to the Test Match on a portable set a man sharing the seat had with him .The Pilot and Tanky duly came off the steamer and by half past one all were aboard and the final gear stowing was completed. The car was parked on the steep hill between the farm and the basin and the batteries were disconnected then, while the Bosun, Doctor and Pilot, shted Fulmar to outside Melora on the east wall, the Skipper and Mate went up to the shop and got some strawberry tarts.At half past two the Karma came in from sea and we went into her water but had to wait in the lock for a wee motor boat whose owner had not turned up but was due soon. While we waited a man from a big Belfast motor boat that was lying in the basin spoke to the Skipper and complimented him on the sailing directions and thanked him for them. The Skipper did his best not to look smugly gratied. We filled in the waiting time by having a cup of coffee and one was handed up to the Doctor who was waiting to see us sail.At five past three we were away under engine being waved on our way by the Doctor and promising to be at Tobermory on the following Friday to pick him up. As the wind was light west-south-west we kept the motor going until we could fetch the Dorus Mor then up went the sails and beer was indulged in to mark the start of the cruise.We went nicely for a little but the wind fell very light. An unknown yacht and Mimosa were coming south and, against the flood tide, were making nothing of it. We passed close by the latter and spoke to John Hamilton then as we headed up for the Ardluing buoy we could see her being pushed slowly back to the northwards stern first. We, too, were being carried too far to the eastward and the engine went on to get us into the Scarba Sound stream and we kept it going till up to Leica Point where the wind came away again, this time from the true west.The tide rips at Fladda were in very good form and we fairly roared through the narrows and on up to Easdale but thereafter the breeze went flukey and light ying between north-west and south-west but, as the sun was shining brightly, it was very pleasant slipping along slowly in the smooth water. There was no sign of the usual heavy swell one expects to meet either side of Easdale Point. Away up to the north between Duart and Loch Don we could see half a dozen boats, led by Cerigo, making their way south.At six o’clock we heard a poor forecast promising rain and strong winds to come and listened for a while to the Test Match and heard of the collapse of the Australians in the st innings. The glass was slowly but steadily coming back and we feared the forecast was probably on the right lines.As we came round the north-west point of Seil Island and headed over for Dun Island off Puilladobhrain the wind died and the sea turned to glass so we got the sails down and stowed and the motor was started up.As we approached Puilladobhrain we saw a nished yawl coming down from the Oban direction under power and she passed in just ahead of us. As we were to learn later she was the Sol and at her helmwas a #bearded ancient# with a shock of white hair and a white beard. As we rounded the Fulmar Beacon we passed Kerlo coming out. In the anchorage were two motor boats and as we went slowly up to the south end of the pool we passed far too close to the bows of one of them owing to the Skipper misjudging the tidal drt. One of the crew came hurriedly out on to her forecastle and frowned at us as we slipped past with only inches to spare.It was dead calm when we anchored at half past seven but we were sorry to see that the drop in the glass was now being accelerated."},{"url":null,"title":"ormsary man in oman endurance event","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowAn Ormsary man is about to embark on the challenge of a letime as he cycles over ,km in a bid to be crowned BikingMan Oman .Lindsay McCrae, , will be one of only  cyclists to take part in BikingMan Oman, part of a series of ultra-endurance cycling events where competitors test their limits of strength and stamina.In , Lindsay bought a road bike through his employer#s cycle to work scheme and what started out as an active commute with a few local races thrown in for fun, soon became an opportunity to challenge himself in some of the toughest races on two wheels.His first big win came in the gruelling City to Summit duathlon from Edinburgh to Ben Nevis.

I think I#m just stubborn and that#s what keeps me pushing on when other people take rest breaks.#Lindsay, who works in sales technical support for an aquaculture equipment company in Inverness, fits his training around his job, spending one to two hours on a turbo in his garage three or four times a week, with longer rides of two to five hours at the weekends. His father#s greenhouse in Ardrishaig proved to be a useful training venue to shelter from the elements over the Christmas holidays as he prepared for his biggest challenge yet.The BikingMan Oman race starts in Muscat, Oman#s capital city, before heading out on the Arabian Peninsula, through the Hajar Mountains, across the Ash Sharqiyah Desert and along coastal roads back to the capital. The competitors will climb over m during the race, that#s the equivalent of climbing Ben Nevis almost seven times.Unlike cyclists on the Tour de France, BikingMan athletes are unsupported so must carry all their food and equipment with them.For Lindsay, one of the biggest challenges will be the weather. #Temperatures at the moment are around - degrees but can reach higher which can be dficult to manage on the steeper sections of the course. That#s where my nutrition and hydration strategy will need to be spot on.#But in case it all sounds like hard work, Lindsay highlights one of the main benefits of his high-octane adventures: #The best part is definitely refuelling after the race. I will burn about , calories over the -hours of my target time, so my recovery will mainly involve eating cakes and other calorie rich foods.#Lindsay grew up on the Ormsary Estate and attended Lochgilphead High School. His family still live in the local area and will be following his adventures closely over the five days of competition.The race takes place from February  to  and Lindsay will cover ,km in a bid to take the title."},{"url":null,"title":"ceilidh to boost hall funds","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowToe-tapping tunes and a busy dance floor are on the cards for a Craignish ceilidh.Ardfern ceilidh band, All about the Cake, will take the stage and have the dancers reeling all night.

It was all so surprising.#I have never won anything for essentially just being myself.

As we stood about on deck while the dishes were being washed a boy from one of the motor boats passed in his dinghy. He was wearing blue shorts and red stockings which brought from the Pilot the remark: #In Brodickyou don’t wear red stockings you might just as well be in Lamlash.#All but the Skipper and Mate went ashore on Centre Island for a stroll. The Major was still completely paralysed in his hind quarters but he was full of spirit and when the Bosun held up his hind legshe galloped along. It was a quiet peaceful evening with a very light northerly breeze but it was distinctly chilly and there was a magnicentsomewhat lurid sunset. The shore party back aboard the Bosun took the Tar off in the dinghy and they landed on Eilean na Beithe and while the former explored the island the latter played on a shingly shore – it was long after dark when they ed.At half past ten we began to turn in and, as always on the first evening, this was a longer business then usual as pillows and blankets had to be allocated and pillowslips put on but by a quarter past eleven we were all in bed and shortly after that a light shower pattered on the deck. The problem of what to do with the Doctor’s mattress was solved by the Pilot double banking his bunk. We were all very glad to have had such a good day for the start.It was noticed that voices were still coming from the ladies’ cabin when the last of us in the main cabin fell asleep.The Tanky brought an innovation to the Fulmar # #Quickies# # a patent washing gadget that saved precious water.We had a dead quiet night with, as far as any of us knew, no rain but the forecast was not good, promising north to north-east winds, force  to  with frequent heavy showers. The glass had continued its steady drop. When we turned out, a light but cold north wind was blowing from a well broken up sky.We had a breakfast of bacon and eggs then the Bosun took the Major ashore for his walk. The latter was possibly a little better and was able to take a few steps on the deck, but ashore on the rough ground could do nothing. While they were ashore the big motor boat with the red-stockinged boy left after very nearly going ashore on Seil Island while getting his anchor aboard.At twenty past ten we were away under engine, but as soon as we were outside the sails went up to the north-easterly breeze and we set off for the Sound of Mull. There was no sign of the swell that is usually met south of Kerrera and we got along quite well, but we could not point any higher than a mile or so south of Loch Don. The Pilot went below and brewed a welcome cup of tea which warmed us up, then we took a tack right up to the south coast of Kerrera and had a close up view of Gylen Castle and the Skipper waxed historical.Putting about again we passed close south of the Potlid Island, but when we were about halfway across to Loch Don the wind died and the strong ebb began to force us south and about the same time the rain came on.The engine was started and we headed up for Duart, but our progress was pitully slow, and indeed at one period we but barely held our ground. The Lady Rock and Lismore Lighthouse seemed never to get any nearer closing. When the engine had run an hour we waited for the first sign of the old familiar falter but none came and we began to hope a cure for its stopping had been effected by replacing the HT coil.This change was a despairing effort made because it was the only thing we had not tried, though all the pundits declare it could not possibly be the cause. The engine would either go or not go, they said, and it would never startthe coil was defective. We got one scare when it staggered for a moment, but the Bosun, who was at the tiller at the time, said we had just passed though a big mass of floating seaweed and may have got some round our propeller.As we were to prove later the cure had been found and the engine ran impeccably all the cruise and the Skipper had a lot of unkind thoughts about all the many professional motor experts who had caused him a great deal of trouble, not a little acute anxiety and more than considerable expense through their failure to diagnose a not very obscure disease.As we came up to the Black Memorial Tower Leonora crossed our bows making for Oban and another yachtpassed close by south bound under engine though by this time quite a reasonable and, for then, favourable breeze was blowing from the north-east and our sails were drawing.We learnt later that the owner’s we would not allow a sail to be set under any conditions as long as she was aboard – a pity, we thought, as she certainly was a lovely job and we felt it would have been betterthe we had decided to stay ashore.At Duart we stopped the engine and were able to make good progress, but the rain got heavier and heavier and our sandwich lunch was taken below in relays. Then at about three with the turn of the tide the wind died completely and the engine was started again. Near the Grey Rocks we saw St Roma coming south under power so we altered course to intercept her then at slow speed turned back the way we had come for a few hundred yards while we exchanged news.We heard a thoroughly bad forecast at mid-day, the wind had gone, the rain was stotting in the glassy sea, and, though the glass had come back only a fraction, we decided to call it a day so, with the Bosun the only dissentient, made for Loch Aline. As we turned inshore at Ardtornish we saw Seewolf to the north of us, becalmed but heading south, and guessed she would be joining us later. Coming in, when between Morven Pier and the Ferry Pier, the Skipper held too close to the west shore and the bottom showed up suddenly far too clearly for our peace of mind and a quick sheer out was necessary.Through the narrows we turned to starboard and anchored at half past four in Kyle Bay in a flat calm and the rain coming down heavier than ever. Gratefully we realised that it was not quite as bitterly cold as it had been out in the Sound.Seewolf came in shortly after going very slowly and Hamish Lawrence called over that he had run a big end and was on his way to Oban for repairs and to hand over to brother Alec and his family. Soon after that we were joined by a small motor boat, Saguenay, flying a blue ensign which, in view of her size, the Skipper was sure she was not entitled to do and then a little later, while we were warming up with some coffee, Lindisfarne arrived and anchored close beside us with Guy Clephane in his usual tremendousform – he’s a proper marvel is Guy.Hamish Lawrence came across in his dinghy and came aboard for a gin and while he was there Guy called over inviting Tanky and the Pilot across to Lindisfarne then sent the Pilot back to Fulmar to fetch the Bosun. Hamish gone, the Skipper began to put nine inch tacklines into our line of flags as we had discovered at Rothesay at the Royal Clyde Centenary Regatta that without them our line was about fteen feet too short and we wanted them to be right for the Queen’s visit to Tobermory.When the Pilot came back he and the Bosun got the tents up as the rain was by then torrential.We had a supper of sausages and beans and while the dishes were being done the Bosun took the Major ashore. He was walking a little bettervery slowly, but there was, unfortunately, no concrete results from his exercise.At nine o’clock we went in two loads across to Seewolf and were offered drinks OR tea, but the Skipper insisted on both. We were, however, not allowed any biscuits with our tea as to have them would have meant opening a new box and broaching Alec Lawrence’s stores. The Tanky had not wanted anything but tea, but Hamish had given her a good strong gin which she tried to hide on a shelf behind her and it was only got rid of when the Pilot took it off her hands and quickly put it to its proper use. The Bosun was drinking beer and when he opened up the tin a goodly portion of it bubbled onto the fitted carpet in the cabin.On board Seewolf were, besides the two paid hands, Hamish’s mother and his two sisters. The old lady, well over eighty, was in grand form and waxed eloquent on #The old days# and the greatness of #Belshaft#. Also on board was a great big collie who was obviously petted and spoilt beyond measure and he behaved more like a lap dog than the great big clumsy creature he was.It was half past eleven before we went back to Fulmar all in one load with little enough freeboard for the dinghy considering the conditions. There was a nasty little lop on the water, the northerly wind was bitterly cold, and the rain was as heavy as ever. As quickly as possible we got below and into our warm bunks, not even the Bosun wasting any time about it, though he did read for some time after all the rest were sound asleep."},{"url":null,"title":"selkirk-gallery-strikes-gold-new-exhibition","story":"A BORDERS-based artist is bringing some Byzantine influence to a small museum in Selkirk.From next month gold will dominate Halliwells House as Alexandra Warren launches her exhibition in the Robson Gallery.Born in New York and raised in Greece, Alexandra developed a love of Cycladic sculpture and Byzantine icons.And despite spending the past  years in the Scottish Borders her work is still heavily influenced by the continuation of the Roman Empire.Her magnicent human figures and extensive use of gold leaf reflect a letimes influence.Alexandra told us: ldquoIrsquom very happy and honoured to have the opportunity of a solo exhibition in the lovely Robson Gallery in the historic Halliwellrsquos House, Selkirk.ldquoIrsquoll be presenting large figurative pieces and a series of small figurative paintings.\"Each piece is created with gold leaf, paint and shellac on wood , all inspired by Greek Byzantine icons - since I was lucky enough to have spent my childhood in Greece.rsquorsquoThe Traces of Gold exhibition opens on Saturday, March  and runs until the end of May.Assistant curator Phoebe Stewart said: ldquoWersquore delighted that Alexandra Warren is exhibiting with us in the Robson Gallery at Halliwellrsquos House.\"Her exquisite work, reminiscent of Greek Byzantine art, is a must-see.\""},{"url":null,"title":"jim-clark-driving-trail-cover-scenic-borders","story":"A CROSS-BORDERS driving trail has been created for visitors wanting to learn more about rallying icon, Jim Clark.The -mile adventure trail will take drivers on a tour of the Borders with pit-stops showcasing regional beauty spots as well as locations steeped in motorsport history.Launched by the Jim Clark Trust, the trail hopes to engage visitors and help them discover the places and stories behind the former double Formula One Champion, Clark.The trail starts and ends at the Jim Clark Motorsport Museum, Duns, and is completely free of charge as it is designed to enhance the experience had at the museum.From the museum, a trail map guides visitors to Chirnside, Jim Clarks hometown and final resting place, then to Berwick-Upon-Tweed where Jim began his racing career.

finances required for a new Peebles High School.Local Conservative council leader Shona Haslam and the local authoritys education portfolio holder Carol Hamilton hit out earlier this month at what they claimed was a financial snub from the Scottish Government.Their claims infuriated Deputy First Minister John Swinney, who reiterated Holyroods commitment to help following the school fire in November.But last weeks budget announcement by the Conservative Independent administration has now sparked a fresh row.According to the figures presented a new Peebles High will cost around pound million - with only pound million coming from an insurance settlement.The claim that there will be a pound million deficit has led to MSP Christine Grahame seeking clarication.The councils chief finance officer David Robertson has confirmed that Peebles High has an insurance value of pound million.And that the local authority is working with loss adjuster appointed by Zurich on a final settlement - expected to be made next month.But the correspondence has now thrown up more questions, with Ms Grahame demanding to know where a pound million deficit will occur.She told us: \"The claims being made by Councillor Haslam and her Tory colleagues are going to be massively concerning for the school community.\"As soon as the scale of the damage from the fire was apparent I wrote to SBC to check that insurance would cover the cost of rebuilding ndash I was told yes, it should.ldquoCllr Haslam has already been caught in one lie by saying the Scottish Government has refused funding for the rebuild when SBC have never requested it. And why would itit was covered by insurance ldquoIs it the case that the insurance company has rejected a claim for new build and will pay only for reinstatement of the damaged areas  If that is the case then she should come clean. She is claiming the school faces a pound million deficit.\"The only explanation I can offer is that this is the cost of replacement of damaged areas but on this Ms Haslam is silent.ldquoI await her response, but in the interim I would ask her seriously to desist in trying to play politics with this to get a disingenuous hit on the Scottish Government and SNP.\"It serves no one and is unnecessarily causing genuine concern amongst the local community when efforts should be going into ing stability and normality to students, parents and staff.Scottish Borders Councils administration has committed to delivering replacement secondary schools in Galashiels, Hawick and Peebles in the next six years.Councillor Haslam believes that an improved replacement school for Peebles school along with using parts of the remaining building needs to be factored in to the calculations.In a response to Christine Grahame, she said: \"As you are well aware the insurance will only pay to replace what was lost.\"This will still result in a music department in a windowless basement and a science department in labs that are not fit for purpose.\"Despite this our school continues to produce first class scientists and musicians but I believe they deserve more and better.\"We had planned to replace Peebles High School in the next  years. To only do part of the school now would be a  economy and impact on future plans to replace outdated buildings.\"I know how keen you are to see a new High School delivered in Galashiels so am perplexed as to why you are so against Peebles getting the same facilities  Perhaps you could clary  I am certainly not satisfied with half measures for our young people.\"We are also extremely keen to ensure that other towns developments are not held back as a result of this fire. So Galashiels and Hawick remain on schedule to be delivered. This means that our Conservative led council will be delivering three new High schools, two new primary schools in the next six years, quite an achievement as I am sure you will agree.\"This is held against the backdrop of a cut to our capital budget this year of  percent.\""},{"url":null,"title":"former-melrose-winger-backs-murrayfield-abseil","story":"A SUPERHERO abseil down the Murrayfield

He was .As a descendant of the famous Ballantyne clan, whose links to the Scottish woollen trade can be traced back to the mid-th century, Mr Brett upheld the family tradition by carving out a successful career in the fast-changing Borders textile industry.The son of an army officer, Lt Col. Denis Brett, and his we Katherine , Denis Roland Brett was born in  in Dehri Dun, India, where his father was serving with the Leicestershire Regiment.At the age of seven he was sent to Blairmore preparatory school in Aberdeenshire, then on to Haileybury School in Hertfordshire. There Rolyrsquos cricketing talents were quickly spotted, and as a member of the schoolrsquos st XI he had the distinction of hitting a six into the stands at Lordrsquos in the annual fixture against Cheltenham.On leaving school he was offered an apprenticeship by his uncle, David Ballantyne, in the family-run Henry Ballantyne  Sons mill at Walkerburn. It afforded him an invaluable insight into the business, supplemented by day release classes at the nearby Scottish College of Textiles in Galashiels.Additional work placements were undertaken at Ballantyne Sportswearrsquos Caerlee Mills in Innerleithen and at another family-run mill in Dalkeith. By his mid-s, Roly had been appointed mill manager at Ballantynersquos March Street Mills in Peebles.In  the Peebles operation was taken over by DawsonLtd ndash later to become Dawson International plc ndash before a restructuring of the Dawson empire in the mid-s saw Robert Noble Ltd take over as the new management company at March Street Mills.By now Mr Brett has risen to become the firmrsquos production director, and a further change of ownership came in the late s when Robert Noble was sold to Yorkshire-based textile company Moorhouse  Brook. Shortly afterwards Robert Noblersquos new managing director resigned, and Mr Brett was appointed his successor, remaining in post with the company until his retiral in  at the age of .Richard Ryley, a sales director with Robert Noble who worked alongside Mr Brett for  years, described him as a great colleague and incredibly approachable. ldquoHe was respected and well-liked not only by workers at the mill, but by associates in the textile trade throughout the United Kingdom and beyond.ldquoHe possessed great charm, but never shied away from making big or tough decisions. He was a wonderful mentor, and I will always be grateful for his sound advice and the support he willingly gave to myself and to all members of staff.In  he was appointed Deacon of the Scottish Borders Manufacturersrsquo Corporation, later serving as a Walkerburn Community Councillor, and for a time was a director of Live Borders, the culture, sport and leisure trust for the Scottish Borders.However, without a doubt the most important event in Roly Brettrsquos le was his marriage to Betty Taylor, at that time working as an auditor with Edinburgh firm Rolleston Somerville. They first met by chance, as Rolyrsquos cousin Alastair happened to be going out with Bettyrsquos flatmate Stroma.Love quickly blossomed, and Roly and Betty were married in Strathdon Church, Aberdeenshire, on September , . After honeymooning in Perthshire, the couple set up home in a rented cottage at Cardrona, then at Kaimend, Innerleithen, before a final move in  to the family home at Caberston House, Walkerburn.The couplersquos four sons - Chris, Jeremy, Mike and Alex ndash were all schooled locally and shared their fatherrsquos passion for sport and motor cars. Family le meant everything to Roly, with Betty and the boys always at the centre of his le.His exploits on the cricket field matched his business achievements. A member of the England Schools side that included future test stars Mike Brearley and Richard Hobbs, the young all-rounder turned down a county contract with Lancashire and opted instead to play his cricket north of the border.An elegant batsman and skilful off-spin bowler, Rolyrsquos cricket career included spells with the Dunfermline, Kelso and Selkirk clubs. He captained Selkirk on their ground-breaking tour to Barbados in , and the following year led the Souters to a Border League  Border Knock-out Cup double.Once his playing days were over, Roly qualied as a cricket coach, helping steer the South of Scotland u- side to its first Scottish Championship.A familiar adversary during his cricketing career was Gala wicket-keeper Ronnie Murray. ldquoRoly was a breath of fresh air when he first arrived on the Border scene, said Ronnie. ldquoHe was an excellent all-rounder, a true sportsman and also great fun to be with.ldquoHe played in a very good Kelso team that included players like John Rutherford and Michael Taylor, before helping inspire Selkirk to a string of successes in the s. You could always depend on Roly to anchor an innings, while he had a knack of picking up quick wickets when he came on to bowl.Golf was another sport at which he excelled, twice winning the Woollen Merchants  Manufacturers Cup, competed for annually at Sunningdale. The ornate trophy is kept on display at the British Golf Museum in St Andrews.As well as being a member of Peebles Golf Club, he also held memberships with Luffness Golf Club in East Lothian and Port Salon Golf Club in Donegal, close to Rathmullan where his father moved after retiring from the army.An interest in classic cars led to the ownership of a number of models being kept at Walkerburn over the years, including a vintage Daimler, Porsche and Mercedes SL.In  Mr Brett was diagnosed with frontal lobe dementia, a progressive condition affecting behaviour, personality and speech.As the disease began to take its inevitable toll, the love and support shown by Betty, members of his family and close friends , in addition to the kindness and understanding shown by staff in the BGHrsquos Cauldshiels Ward and at Murray House, Kelso, ensured Roly received the best possible care in his final months.Mr Brett is survived by Betty and their four sons, his sister Jo, brother Will, daughters-in-law Denise, Shona, Debbie and Mumba, and by eight grandchildren.A service of thanksgiving for Roly Brettrsquos le will be held in the Borders Crematorium, Melrose, on Tuesday, March , at pm.J.D.R.S."},{"url":null,"title":"dates-confirmed-2020-innerleithen-music-festival","story":"ORGANISERS have announced that this years Innerleithen Music Festival will take place during the weekend of August -to-.Now in its th year the festival continues to provide a great  for fantastic music in the heart of the Borders.True to its tradition there will be events taking place across multiple venues in Innerleithen.And, as usual, much of the activity will be centred at the Vale Club where lsquoLive and Localrsquo will be staged over the three days.Andy Wright from Innerleithen Music Festival said: \"The Innerleithen Music Festival has a strong reputation amongst artists and audience alike.\"Bands and singers approach us throughout the year enquiring about performance opportunities.\"Over the years we have showcased hundreds of bands and solo performers from across Scotland and farther afield, including such household names as Eddie Reader, Capercaillie, Skipinnish as well as traditional music favourites Phil and Aly.\"Last year one of our largest audiences was for local musician and rising star Tommy Ashby who is currently carving out a great reputation on the national music scene.\"Ahead of the festival this summer a fundraising concert will be held in the Union Club on Saturday, March .Already confirmed for next months concert are Redwood Rejects, Soul , All the Angels, Bobs Boiler Room and Dylan Paterson.Tickets go on sale from lsquoThe Hub on the High Streetrsquo, Innerleithen on March ."},{"url":null,"title":"gareths-newspaper-snaps-help-replace-peebles-high-camera","story":"A local photographer who captured haunting images of firefighters tackling the blaze at Peebles High School has donated the profits of his pictures to the school.Award winning photographer Gareth Easton was in Peebles when his children, both pupils at Peebles High, called to say the school was on fire.This week he spoke to reporter and former colleague Hilary Scott, about how he turned his pictures of the pupils running from the burning school, into an image of students with beaming smiles.INNERLEITHEN photographer Gareth Easton has snapped murder scenes, G riots, drugs raids, and even gambled with his own le aboard a trawler by capturing the danger inherent in commercial fishing ndash which netted him a national award.Never did he imagine that his next big job would be photographing the inferno of the secondary school both his children attend.ldquoOn the day of the fire I was working in Peebles.

You should self-isolateyou have travelled to any of the following places:to Hubei province in China in the last  daysto Iran, areas of northern Italy in lockdown or \"special care zone\" areas in South Korea since  Februaryto other parts of mainland China or South Korea, Thailand, Japan, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore, Malaysia or Macau in the last  days and have a cough, high temperature or shortness of breathto other parts of northern Italy , Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos or Myanmar since  February and have a cough, high temperature or shortness of breathHow do I self-isolate The best place to self-isolate yourself is obviously your own home, where you should stay for the duration of your quarantine.This means you shouldnt go to work, school or public areas, and not use any public transport or taxis.If you need something from outside your home, you canask friends, family members or delivery services to carry out errands for you.But youre advised to try to avoid visitors to your home, though it is OK for friends and family or delivery drivers to drop off food and other supplies.WhatIm not at home Of course, its possible that any coronavirus symptoms could arise while youre out and about.If this is the case, the official advice insists that you do not go to a GP surgery or hospital, as that could spread the virus inordinately.Instead, you should try to find a room to isolate yourself away from others. Ask for helpyou need to, but try to stay at least two metres away from other people.Open a window for ventilationyou can, but otherwise touch objects and surfaces as little as possible, and call  for advice.If you find yourself on public transport and become unwell, you should go back to your home or place of residence immediately.How long should I self-isolate for ,params: .pushYou may need to do this for up to  days to help reduce the possible spread of infection.What are the symptoms of coronavirus Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses, with the Centers for Disease Control and

illness.The symptoms are similar to other illnesses that are much more common, such as cold and flu."},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus-self-isolation---can-affect-rights-pay-work","story":"UPuntil a week ago many of us had probably never heard the term lsquoself-isolationrsquo.But now not a day goes by without us being aware of people who have been asked or chosen to isolate themselves in order to try and minimise the spread of the Coronavirus.Nicole Rogers, Solicitor at DAS Law, has been looking at the impact this has on workers rights and pay.If I feel that I should be lsquoself-isolatingrsquo, can my employer deduct my pay for the time I am away from work This will depend on the facts.If you are otherwise fit for work but are taking precautionary steps by lsquoself-isolatingrsquo, technically you are not entitled to pay.However, it is good practice for employers not to deduct pay in these situations.An employee would usually be lsquoself-isolatingrsquo on the advice of a doctor and it is sensible for an employer to show understanding in order to fulfil health and safety obligation and maintain good staff relations.In addition, to withhold pay could encourage an employee toto work prematurely which might potentially risk spreading the virus.Many employers can allow temporary flexible working arrangements where employees can work from home.What are my rightsIrsquom quarantined and my boss refuses to pay my salary If you have contracted the virus, normal rules around sick pay will apply and you will either receive Statutory Sick Payor contractual sick pay.If your employer has specically told you not to come into the workplace as you have been in or to an affected area, you would ordinarily receive your normal pay.What is unclear is a situation where an employee remains off work as they have been quarantined or recommended to isolate themselves.In those circumstances, it would not strictly be considered as sick as the reason for the absence isnrsquot because the employee is unwell and therefore has no entitlement to sick pay.There may be a contractual clause relating to such circumstances and how this time off should be paid.In the absence of any contractual clause, the position will be that the leave will be unpaid .Can I be forced to use my annual leaveI am lsquoself-isolatingrsquo You cannot be forced to use annual leaveyou are medically unfit for work.However in many other circumstances, your employer can force you to take annual leavethey provide you with adequate notice twice the amount of the days you are being forced to take.For example, to force you to use  daysrsquo holiday, your employer must give you  daysrsquo notice.Again, this may risk good staff relations and given that employers and employees will likely be unfamiliar in dealing with a health crisis of this magnitude, it will be good practice for both parties to mutually agree how leave will be taken.,params: .pushWill I be paid statutory sick pay while Irsquom away from work Onlyyou are medically unfit for work and meet the eligibility criteria for Statutory Sick Pay.Will my pay be affectedI have to stay at home due to my

school.You must noty your employer as soon as possible and advise, where practicable, how long the disruption is likely to last.This time off is unpaid but you may request to use this time as paid annual leave.If I am on a lsquozero hoursrsquo contract will I lose pay for the time I am away from work Genuine zero-hour workers have no right to be offered work and no obligation to accept work.Therefore, you will likely have no right to pay.In the event that you have been advised to self-isolate, your employer will be entitled to simply not offer you any work until the isolation period

She was full of old stories. She had come to East Lothian when she was a young girl and lived there ever since. But she brought with her the stories she had been told when she was wee. They were tales told to her by her grandfather, a crofter from the west of Scotland, who had moved his family to the north east in hard times. Her grandfather had shared the stories collected by folklorist Donald Mackenzie, who wrote Wonder Tales from Scottish Myth and Legend.Now, in her old age, she loved sharing her version of these stories with her grandchildren. They were a mix of old legends and she knew that there were dferent versions. But the version told to her by her grandfather was of course her favourite.Her grandchildren settled around her fireplace and sipped their hot chocolate in anticipation. Their gran always sat in silence for a moment before speaking. It was asshe was waiting for a curtain to raise in their imagination.Then she began her story.ldquoBeria was the queen orsquo the dark times, the ruler of winter. She wis tall and strang. In fact she carried a great hammer, with which she made the Scottish mountains. She had a fearsome temper and looked scary, with one eye and lang white hair. There are mony stories aboot her, this is just ane orsquo them.ldquoYe see, while she ruled winter, at this time orsquo year, the signs orsquo spring began tae appear, and she felt she wis loosing her power. People grew less feart orsquo her and began tae resist her power. They looked forrit tae the arrival orsquo the summer queen, who wis carsquod Bride. She was the bringer of light and plentul times, and so people loved her and looked forward to her arrival. Beria was jealous orsquo her.ldquoThis is why Beria kept Bride a prisoner. She made Bride work hard and kept her in ragged claes.ldquoLike Cinderella! exclaimed the youngest, excitedly. Her gran smiled and nodded.ldquoBut Bride managed tae escape, helped by the man she loved, who became known as King Angus, and ever since people have celebrated that day. It wis oan February , but many years ago the calendar changed, and sae itrsquos February  that I celebrate Bridersquos day.ldquoAnd sae Bride wis free and wore new claes, which were bright and colourful. She set aboot sowing the seeds orsquo spring. She sprinkled snawdraps, and the blossom was encouraged tae bloom. The first bird tae sing in celebration of Bridersquos freedom was a wee linnet. Its sweet singing filled the air with the sound orsquo spring, and ever since folk huv carsquod the linnet lsquoThe Bird orsquo Bridersquo.ldquoBut what about Beria, wasnrsquot she mad that Bride escaped  asked one of her grandchildren.ldquoIrsquom coming tae that. She wis indeed. When she heard that Bride had escaped, she was furious, her rage knew no limits! She knew that this would end her power. She tried tae capture her again but she fled with Angus. Sae Beira took her great hammer and struck the ground with it, making ice and frost tae kill the grass and flowers that had dared tae start grawing. But the linnets continued to sing and this encouraged mair birds tae sing as well. It became a chorus.ldquoEnraged, Beria collected her servants, who were hags who rode on shaggy goats, while she rode on a huge black steed. They raised storms and winds tae silence the birds, and tae blow ower trees and strip them orsquo branches.ldquoThen she pursquod dark clouds ower the land, and ripped them open, sae cauld rain drenched the land, destroying food and making the soil drookit, killing livestock and ruining peoplersquos hames.ldquoWow, Beria was angry, and pretty mean too, said a grandchild.ldquoAye, she wis.

It lasted fir mair than a week!ldquoWi arsquo these storms fishermen couldnae fish, the food orsquo folk was being wasted as the fodder and winter stores were ravaged by the storms.ldquoBut then March arrived and mair light filled the days. This increased the strength orsquo Bride, the summer queen, who ed with her husband Angus to sow mair seeds orsquo spring.ldquoIn a last desperate attempt tae keep her power, Beria took three days orsquo deep winter she hud kept aside, and used them tae bring blizzards and snowstorms. She coated the land in a white freezing blanket.ldquoBut after these three days, the winter queenrsquos power wis spent. Bride and Angus once again ed, riding through the countryside, chasing awa the hags and sowing spring wherever they went. The birds sang their heids off.ldquoIt wis arsquo over for Beria, at least for this winter. She fled, throwing her hammer underneath a holly tree, which is why nae grass grows under a holly tree. She hid for a while on top orsquo a mountain on the Isle of Skye, carsquod Beinn na Caillich. But she was weak now, and when the days and nights became equal inshe knew her reign was over.ldquoSae she retreated to the Green Island tae drink frae the magic well orsquo youth, tae replenish her strength. She bade her time there, kenning she would be able taeand reclaim her throne when darkness once again ed tae the land.ldquoIn autumn, said one of the children.ldquoAye, smiled the gran.ldquoAnd thatrsquos why we hae arsquo these winds and storms just noo.

Earlier this year, a report ordered by the Scottish Government recommended thousands more deer be culled annually across the country to address the issue.Dave Morris, former director of Ramblers Scotland, the countryrsquos association representing hillwalkers, said: ldquoWe have major problems in Scotland with too many deer and the effect itrsquos having on the natural habitat.ldquoI think Caenlochan is the worst area for deer in Scotland and Balmoral is part of the problem.ldquoItrsquos time the Royal Family,they are serious about climate change, start reducing numbers of deer.Robbie Kernahan, director at Scottish Natural Heritage said: ldquoThe estates in the South Grampian and Caenlochan area, including Balmoral, have been working with SNH to reduce deer numbers.A SNH spokesman added: ldquoOur recent Deer Progress Report showed that while challenges remain, signicant progress has been made by landowners and managers.ldquoSNH leads a programme of work to promote sustainable deer management across Scotland, recognising the essential role it needs to play to help address climate change and bioersity loss.ldquoResearch shows deer numbers increased in Scotland from  to , but numbers have since stabilised because of increased culling, which is sometimes necessary to ensure healthy deer populations, reduce road traffic accidents and prevent signicant damage to our agriculture, forestry and nature.A Balmoral source said: ldquoRed deer are an iconic addition to Balmoral but there can be a clear conflict between deer culling and ensuring local forests are maintained around the estate.ldquoThe estate is doing itrsquos very best to ensure a balance is maintained and is working with relevant authorities to ensure this is achieved.A recent report has said up to one million wild deer, nearly double previous estimates, could be roaming the country, damaging the landscape and hampering environmental efforts.The findings, published by the Deer Working Group, is urging Scottish ministers to crack down on uncooperative Highland estates that refuse to control deer numbers to protect their lucrative hunting market, by using legal powers to enforce culls.But landowners have criticised the recommendations, saying the report comes in sharp contrast to similar research by Scottish Natural Heritage published just two months earlier.The body that represents rural businesses and landowners, Scottish Land and Estates , also insisted conflicting evidence on the future of deer management in Scotland should not overshadow the recent progress achieved.It maintained the issue was not about overall deer numbers but about their impact on local areas.Sarah-Jane Laing, chief executive of the SLE, said: ldquoSubstantial progress has been made in the operation of deer management groups over the past five years, with the sector demonstrating its ability to respond and adapt to new challenges and manage deer in a way that is sustainable and safeguards public interests.\"Some deer estates in areas such as Glen Artney and Strathtay, Perthshire, have red deer densities above  per square kilometre, while numerous parts of Inverness-shire, the Cairngorms, Deeside and Angus have between  and  per square kilometre. The report endorses SNHrsquos identication of the need for signicant changes in deer management as an important issue in climate crisis mitigation measures, and recommends that it is addressed as a priority. Conservationists argue that red deer, who often roam in vast herds, prevent woodland and shrubs from naturally regenerating.Ms Laing added: ldquoThe right density is also dependent on pasture availability rather than a strict number applicable across every region."},{"url":null,"title":"fidelma-cook-coronavirus-shows-veneer-civilisation-thin","story":"Twenty-nine people were killed,  seriously wounded and , lightly so, mainly from falling glass, as two thirds of the cityrsquos windows were shattered.Situated just three kilometres from the city centre and next door to a large suburban area, the factory blast affected almost , homes and completely destroyed ,.The residents were put up in a mixture of private housing, authority flats and hastily collected mobile homes.

Allies of Cherry feel Robertsonrsquos fingerprints are all over some of the moves that have been made against her within the Westminster group over the last year or so.Cherry, currently the MP for Edinburgh South West, has become one of the most recognised parliamentarians at Westminster since she won her seat in , feared and admired in equal measure. She was instrumental in defeating Boris Johnsonrsquos plan to sabotage parliament late last year and is a formidable speaker from the floor of the House. This has caused jealousy among lesser-plumed party colleagues who have dutully toiled in the party for years without any recognition. ldquoShersquos just in the door five minutes, they say, ldquoand already shersquos coveting Nicolarsquos job. Thatrsquos the real reason why she wants to run for Holyrood.ldquoSo, do you really want the First Ministerrsquos job, I ask her. Wersquore sitting in a tidy constituency office in Edinburghrsquos Jam Tarts district.

Irsquom hoping to catch her off-guard when I ask her the big Nicola Sturgeon question.:Scathing complaints accuse SNP MP Joanna Cherry of making party look regressiveldquoI donrsquot want to replace Nicola I want to get to know her better, she says. ldquoBut the pair of you can hardly stand to be in the same room as each other, I say. ldquoThatrsquos just idle speculation, she replies. ldquoNicola and I have so much in common we both studied law wersquore passionate feminists and passionate about reducing inequality.Another great week for #heraldonsunday.

Irsquom proud of her and of how well shersquos represented the cause of Scottish independence. I want to support her in leading Scotland to independence and in securing ourto the European Union. I certainly have my dferences with her, not least on her support for the proposed reforms of the Gender recognition Act, but more unites us than ides us.Ah yes, the Gender Recognition Act: never has something so scarcelyunderstoodby the vast majority of the general population caused so much turbulence within the gilded chambers of a political party. For those who inhabit the world outside cyberspace and the political bubble this is what it means. The Scottish Government wants to make it much easier for people to change their gender by enabling them to \"self-declare\"rather than endure a prolonged process. Cherry and other feminists within the SNP, most notably Joan McAlpine, convenor of Holyroodrsquos influential Culture, Tourism, Europe and External Affairs Committee, have urged caution.Both women have endured abuse and intimidation from within the party for expressing concerns for womenrsquos sex-based rightsthe proposed GRA reforms come to pass. Cherry is careful to say that the abuse has come from ldquothe tiniest of factions who wield ldquodisproportionate influence.ldquoAs an out gay woman who fought section  and has campaigned for LGBT rights for decades, accusations that I am transphobic are offensive. The online abuse does take its toll but I am more worried about the cumulative and detrimental effect on what it does for the role of women in politics and in the media young women in particular. I donrsquot like the way this is characterised as a problem in the youth wing of the party.:MP Joanna Cherry: Scotland will be ignored at WestminsterldquoMany admirable young people are involved in Scottish politics and I know a number of women and men in Young Scots for Independence and SNP Youth who have spoken to me privately about their concerns. The abuse is deeply misogynistic. The attacks on me and other women in the party are clearly a breach of our code of conduct and must be dealt with.ldquoIrsquom very proud of the fact that in Scotland we have very good rights-based protections for trans people. No one is seeking to change that. However, women have legitimate concerns about the proposed changes to the law on gender recognition.Within the SNPrsquos Westminster group you sense she is admired rather than loved and therersquos not a little resentment at her high profile. One of her party colleagues at Holyrood has been aghast at her treatment at Westminster: ldquoShersquos a really sharp intellect, as forensic in her approach to politics as she was to the law. She does have what Burns called a guid conceit o hersel. This is admired and expected in male leaders, but women are held to a dferent standard and expected to show humility. She needs to build alliances though that is the clubby bit of politics which can evade hard-working women and allow mediocre men to advance.Cherry challenges my suggestion that the party could do without this contest in Edinburgh Central. ldquoCompetition in politics is healthy, she says. ldquoDebating ideas is good for developing policy. This isnrsquot being disloyal to the leadership. Holyrood and Westminster proceed by debate this is how we get to the nub of things.The fabled independence Plan B, which the party rejected last year, has ed for inspection now that Boris Johnson simply wonrsquot discuss a second independence referendum. This is another area where Cherry is perceived to be at odds with her boss. She rejects this.ldquoI wouldnrsquot back a wildcat or illegal referendum. How could I, given my legal background  I endorse Nicolarsquos declaration that this should proceed legally. However we have reached an impasse: people keep voting for us and opinion polls show support for Yes is hovering around %, yet Johnson wonrsquot budge.ldquoMy experience of knocking on doors is that there are lots of soft Nos who are interested in the idea of Scotland staying in the EU through independence. But we have to look at the economy and currency the process of getting back into the EU and how longrsquos it going to take. We must also deal with the border with England and de-dramatise it. The idea that people wonrsquot be able to have a cup of tea in Berwick without showing their passport is ludicrous. Wersquore all in the common travel area.\"Cherry is keen to stress that seeking a ruling from the Supreme Court on Holyroodrsquos competence to hold a referendum without Londonrsquos agreement does not amount to support for a wildcat vote.\"If we pass a bill through Holyrood to hold a referendum this might be challenged by the UK governmentrsquos law officer and then arrive at the Supreme Court. Any organisation could challenge it. Under section  of the Scotland Act within four weeks of a Bill passing the Advocate General, the Attorney General or the Scotlandrsquos Lord Advocate could choose to refer the question of the Billrsquos competence to the Supreme Court.ldquoIt would be for them to decide by a process of statutory interpretation whether this Bill was within the powers of Holyrood. Irsquod hope they wouldnrsquot just look at the Act but note the two countriesrsquo markedly dferent routes of travel and all the recent democratic votes in several political jurisdictions. If they said the Bill was within Holyroodrsquos competence wersquod have our referendum. Andnot I donrsquot think wersquod lose anything.Cherry would probably have been a judge by nowshersquod continued her legal career, with the prospect of earning much more money. She had a stellar career specialising in prosecuting sexual offence cases. Why did she choose this uncertain and venomous arena where party rules canrsquot prevent a woman from experiencing abuse and venom simply for adhering to long-held principles ldquoIf Irsquod known it would be like this I wouldnrsquot have stood for election, she says, ldquoand itrsquos sad that women might be put off entering politics because of it. And I donrsquot think Irsquove had the support I should have had through all of this.ldquoBut wersquore now at the end game for Scottish independence and the focus is on Holyrood.

That rat-tat at the window is there in the stories that keep coming ndash some ridiculous, some full of sound advice, like handwashing.But there is, it seems to me, more to this coronanxiety than the virus. It connects with other prevalent anxieties. A virus changes the threat we feel around other humans, and thatrsquos problematic at a time when it feels ashate is on the rise globally, and populist movements are tapping into our fears around globalisation and immigration.Among the most worrying symptoms of this anxiety is the associated racism.

But the story is just that ... legend, and now generally accepted as such by most historians.Far from attempting to prove his power over everything in the universe,anything, good King Canute was proving the very opposite. He was actually demonstrating to his sycophantic hangers-on that, as he saw it, only the Almighty in Heaven was possessed of such powers as could command the very elements and that mere mankind should heed Him in all His ways.Of course, history is not a science.

So should we follow suit  Should compulsory vaccination be the norm  The UK Health Secretary, Matt Hancock, has already said that hersquos ldquolooking very seriously at compulsory vaccination for school children.Figures show that childhood immunisation rates are dropping across Scotland, and the rest of the UK.The question about whether Britain should follow Germanyrsquos lead is timely ndash as the rapid spread of coronavirus underlines just how vulnerable society is to mass outbreaks in the era of globalisation.A coronavirus vaccine is still some way off, butone was developed tomorrow, there would be queues outside clinics across the country.Yet, at the same time, the so-called anti-vax movement is on the rise, as growing numbers of parents turn their back on the idea of immunising their children for fear of causing some greater harm, or because of religious beliefs.Many anti-vaxxers are convinced that they risk ldquogiving their child autismthey have them vaccinated. That belief, however, is scientic nonsense.Why Germany The decision was made in the midst of a global rise in measles cases. From today,a parent refuses to get their child immunised in Germany, theyrsquoll face a fine of around pound, and their child will be banned from nursery or school.The German law was passed after the nation listened to months of parliamentary debate, including testimony from medics who spoke both for and against compulsory vaccination.Germanyrsquos health minister described the move as both ldquochild protection and a bid to ensure that all members of society were protected. The World Health Organisation says % of any given population must be vaccinated to prevent mass outbreaks. Itrsquos called ldquoherd immunity.Measles is surging in Europe. In , there were , cases. By , that had risen to ,. In the first six months of , there were nearly , cases and  deaths. In the same period, there were  cases of measles in the UK ndash many linked to European travel.The moral dilemmaAt the heart of the issue of compulsory vaccination lie two huge moral questions. First, should any parent have the right to refuse vaccination and endanger the le of their child Second, does any parent have the right to put the rest of society at risk by refusing vaccination for their child If the answer to those questions is no, then the path starts to open up towards a policy of compulsory vaccination.The main parties in Germany ndash the Christian Democrats and the Social Democrats ndash supported compulsory vaccination legislation. However, the Green Party offered an alternative.Greens were very critical of compulsion as a public health policy, and suggested instead a major education campaign. However, any attempt to raise ldquopublic awareness about the necessity of vaccination is an uphill struggle in the age of online conspiracy theories, which is where most anti-vax propaganda springs from.Theof measlesLast summer, WHO announced that measles had officially ed to four European nations previously deemed free of the disease ndash Britain, Albania, Greece, and the Czech Republic.The WHO announcement was made in the lead-up to Germany voting for compulsory vaccination. The loss of the UKrsquos measles-free status is surely a warning sign that something is going wrong when it comes to vaccination.Prior to widespread measles vaccination being introduced in the early s, the disease killed around . million people globally every year. By , measles was killing only , a year around the planet.Across the Western world measles is making a comeback. Even though the United States officially ldquoeliminated measles in , there were outbreaks across the country last year. Portland, Oregon, saw officials declare a public health emergency after one outbreak.In , there were  cases of measles in  states. The Centre for Disease Controlconfirmed this was ldquothe second-greatest number of annual cases reported since measles was eliminated.Most had not been vaccinated against measles. The CDC says US outbreaks are down to travellers bringing measles back from overseas, and the virus then finding a breeding ground among the unvaccinated.In some parts of America, such as Washington state, only % of children were fully vaccinated in  ndash although in other areas the rate is as low as %.In Washington, only % of children were exempt from vaccination on medical grounds ndash the rest refused vaccination because of their parentsrsquo religious or philosophical beliefs.WHO has described the anti-vax movement as among the  biggest global health threats. ldquoMeasles, for example, has seen a % increase in cases globally, WHO said.ldquoThe reasons for this rise are complex, and not all of these cases are due to vaccine hesitancy.ldquoHowever, some countries that were close to eliminating the disease have seen a resurgence.Global dimensionIn January , health officials blamed distrust of vaccine for an outbreak of measles among New Yorkrsquos Orthodox Jewish community. Some  people were infected after a child caught the disease.ldquoThe initial child with measles was unvaccinated and acquired measles on a visit to Israel, where a large outbreak of the disease is occurring, the New York City health department said.ldquoSince then, there have been additional children from Brooklyn who were unvaccinated and acquired measles while in Israel.Measles is still relatively common in Africa and Asia. Some  people brought measles back to America from other countries in .A study in the medical journal BMC Medicine, in May , into measles-immunisation policies in seven dferent healthcare systems, found that ldquorecent policies aimed at increasing childhood immunisation rates through the introduction of compulsory vaccination are certainly producing positive effects, by raising the proportion of children protected against measles.Publications by the British Medical Association have referred to the anti-vaccination movement as a ldquoneedless waste of le.Some % of the worldrsquos population thinks vaccines are dangerous.

France has seen a % rise in the number of measles cases, from  in  to  in .Of the  people diagnosed with measles between April and June last year in England,  were aged  or over and had not been vaccinated.The  cases of measles represented a substantial increase in the rate of infection in just three months compared with January-April of the same year.Nearly half of those who contracted mumps in Britain were unvaccinated. Last year, between April and June, some , people were infected by mumps. The previous quarter saw just  people contract the illness. The , figure represents a -fold increase on the  diagnoses of mumps in the last three months of .ldquoThese stark rises in mumps and measles cases show that complacency about vaccines is misplaced and dangerous, said Simon Stevens, the chief executive of NHS England. He has promised to ldquotackle the fake news peddled on social media.Lies, damned liesMuch of the anti-vax panic goes back to the discredited claims of medical doctor Andrew Wakefield. He claimed in The Lancet in  that the MMRvaccine was linked to autism. The General Medical Council later found that Wakefield had been dishonest in his research. The Lancet retracted the article. Wakefield was later struck off.The British Medical Journal described Wakefieldrsquos claims as ldquoan elaborate fraud. Wakefield was accused in reports of intending to financially profit from his bogus research. The scandal did little to silence Wakefield. He directed the documentary Vaxxed: From Cover-Up To Catastrophe in .Ian Lipkin, professor of epidemiology and director of the Centre for Infection and Immunity at Columbia University, compared the film to ldquoscience fiction, adding: ldquoAs a documentary it misrepresents what science knows about autism, undermines public confidence in the safety and efficacy of vaccines, and attacks the integrity of legitimate scientists and public health officials.The scientic evidence in favour of vaccination is insurmountable. Vaccines eradicated smallpox, which once killed one in seven children in Europe. Vaccines have also nearly wiped out polio. Estimates have been made thatevery child in the United States was given full vaccinations from birth to adolescence some , lives would be saved and  million infections prevented.However, Facebookrsquos use of micro-targeting algorithms allows anti-vaccine groups to aim adverts at the parents of young children, and undermine science. One fairly typical ad read: ldquoHealthy -week-old infant gets  vaccines and dies within  [hours].What history tells usWe just need to look back into the past to see how dangerous the anti-vax movement is ndash take Stockholm in . Religious objections led to an anti-vaccination campaign. This resulted in a drop in the take-up of vaccination in Stockholm to just over %, compared to around % in the rest of Sweden.A major smallpox epidemic broke out. That led to a rise in vaccine uptake, and the epidemic came to an end.In the UK in the s, questions were raised about the risks and effectiveness of the whooping cough vaccine. Vaccination dropped from % to %. The result was whooping cough epidemics and a number of deaths of children. Vaccine uptake then increased to above % and the disease declined dramatically.After the MMR controversy, there was a measles outbreak in Ireland. Immunisation levels had fallen to below % nationally. In some parts of Dublin the uptake was as low as %. There were more than  cases and three children died.In Wales in , there was an outbreak of measles in Swansea. Some , were infected, one died. In , the uptake of MMR in Wales was %. In Swansea by , however, in the wake of the MMR panic, uptake was as low as .%.Whatrsquos to be doneAustralia tackled the anti-vax movement by introducing ldquono jab, no pay and ldquono jab, no play. This withholds state payments like child care benefit, child care rebate and family Tax benefit for parents who have children not fully immunised. It also penalises childcare centres which admit non-vaccinated children.ldquoNo jab, no pay was introduced in . By July , , children who had not been previously fully immunised were vaccinated.Many people understandably feel uncomfortable with this level of parental coercion. The British Society for Immunologyrsquos chief executive, Dr Doug Brown, favours public information campaigns.ldquoTo make this compulsory in the UK, there are concerns that it could increase current health inequalities and alienate parents with questions on vaccination, he said.ldquoThere are also major doubts about how such a policy could be implemented and monitored and risks resulting in unintended consequences as well as a loss of public confidence in vaccines.Shirley Cramer, chief executive of the Royal Society for Public Health, says: ldquoCompulsory vaccination should be a last resort.The politicsAside from the politically problematic fact that health is a devolved matter, therersquos one issue which complicates the idea of compulsory vaccination across the UK ndash regional disparity.In Scotland and Northern Ireland the take-up rate for MMR is %. Although that figure is high for Scotland, overall vaccination rates are still dropping here.

But why should Scotland and Northern Ireland ndash which have herd immunity ndash consider compulsory vaccination when the issue is primarily a problem where Public opinion will be the big test. In the age of coronavirus do we have the tolerance, as a nation, for those of us who would put others, as well as themselves and their own children, at risk when it comes to health What we know for sure is that the German experience of compulsory vaccination which begins today will be watched closely by politicians and health professionals around the world.The rise in measles cases, coming at a when the world is focused on coronavirus, may create a tipping point where the public feels health outweighs parental liberty. We can already see how little opposition there is in the West to health-enforcement measures such as quarantine in the face of coronavirus.We should also remember that Britain has made vaccination compulsory in the past. In , the Vaccination Act required that all children be vaccinated against smallpox. Refusal resulted in a pound fine ndash a lot of money in Victorian times.

What we really need to understand is why people donrsquot act on allegations of this nature.Read more:Lord David Steel just as bad as paedophile MP Cyril Smith, victims claimThere are several reasons. The first is that those who sexually abuse children groom not only children, but also adults, which allows them to continue their abuse over time and access multiple victims.This was particularly evident in cases of sexual abuse in Scottish football where abusive sports coaches put considerable efforts into building relationships with parents of children they abused.The second reason is that we expect those who commit abuse to be monsters - identiable as morally corrupt and depraved. When we meet someone we like,there are allegations about them, we think lsquoThey canrsquot be an abuser, they seem nicersquo. The problem with this is that monsters donrsquot get access to children ndash people being nice do.

Similarly, some children are also cycling without a helmet and I would urge parents to ensure their children are suitably equipped to go out cycling safely.”Committee vice-chair Councillor Rosemary Bruce added: “Aberdeenshire schools are great supporters of the Bikeability scheme which provides training and advice for both the pupils and their families.

Fair funding for our inter-island ferry service is still to be agreed and, once government commitments and ring-fenced funding is taken into account, there is a real terms reduction of . per cent in the support the government provides towards the running costs of core council services.“Our annual funding from the government, on a like for like basis and without ferry funding is, per head of population, £ less than Shetland’s allocation and £ below the allocation for the Western Isles. If Orkney was funded in the same way as the Western Isles, we would receive up to £. million more each year to deliver council services.“A great deal of thought and effort has been devoted to finding ways to lessen the impact on our community, our staff and the organisation itself. But we are having to recommend a range of cuts to services that are valued by people in Orkney. These are dficult decisions to make.”The measures recommended by the committee would result in a reduction of the council’s workforce by the equivalent of . full time equivalent posts.Of these, one full time equivalent post is currently vacant. For the remaining posts, the intention would be to avoid compulsory redundanciespossible and look instead at alternatives such as redeployment, voluntary redundancy and retirement.The committee also recommended that a contribution of up to £. million should come from the Strategic Reserve Fund to support services during the year ahead.The committee’s recommendation that Council Tax bills in Orkney should increase by . per cent from April  is agreed, it would result in an overall Council Tax income of £. million during  – .The committee’s recommendations go to a meeting of the Full Council on Tuesday, March ,  for further consideration.If approved, the following Council Tax charges, in the table below, would apply in Orkney for the year ahead.Households with only one adult living in the property will continue to receive a discount of  per cent on the charges detailed above.Further details in The Orcadian on Thursday. vw, px\"  copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

From the former perspective, the big positive about the Scots so far this year is that they have conceded the fewest tries and the least points of any of the six teams. Few would have predicted that a month ago.Hamish Watson got the nod for man of the match against the Italians, another indication that the open-side flanker is back to his very best. Others to stand out were loose-head prop Rory Sutherland, the find of the tournament, and Watson’s back row colleague Jamie Ritchie.Elsewhere at the weekend France proved just too good for Wales in Cardf, and are now the only side left with the chance of a Grand Slam. The French have been very impressive this season and have about five or six players who would be in a combined Six Nations team so far.At Twickenham there was a typical battle between two outfits who prefer brute strength to artistry. What little flair was evident mostly emanated from Ireland in the latter stages, but England had got so far ahead by half-time the game was really over.Sadly once again we had a referee, this time Jaco Peyper, seemingly unwilling to penalise a side which is consistently in breach of the offside rule.Irish fly-half Jonny Sexton, who had an awful game himself including making a complete mess of two kicks, could regularly be seen complaining to the referee. That even included pointing to players who were blatantly in the wrong place, but Peyper refused to take action.Only midway through the second half, when the Irish were all but buried, did Peyper appear to notice that so many white shirts were lying on the wrong side of the ball. I found that absolutely baffling.A week on Sunday Scotland will be in action again, this time back at Murrayfield against leaders France. That could be close, with the French chasing a clean sweep and the Scots still harbouring hopes of finishing third or fourth in the table.While the Finn Russell saga shows no sign of sorting itself out, and Adam Hastings likely to continue at number  despite being out of touch against Italy, it would be good to have a couple of players back from injury. The presence of either winger Darcy Graham and lock back row Sam Skinner would strengthen things in both departments.Team of the tournament so far: Elliot DalyJonny May , Robbie Henshaw , Gael Fickou , Mattia BelliniRomain Ntamack , Antoine DupontC J Stander , Jamie Ritchie , Gregory AlldrittAlun Wyn Jones , Bernard Le RouxRory Sutherland , Julien Marchand , Joe Marler .: : : : : : : :Two of my favourite footballers, in my opinion the greatest ever strikers from their respective international sides, celebrated their th birthdays over the past week.Last Thursday it was the turn of Jimmy Greaves, who sadly is not in good health having suffered a serious stroke five years ago.A documentary on BT Sport that evening covered all aspects of Greaves’ career, ranging from his early days at Cha, a big money move to AC Milan, theto Tottenham Hotspur, the shock transfer to West Ham and his final days in non-league football.The programme also touched on the hepatitis which he suffered from during the - season. He was warned that he would lose up to a yard in pace as a result of the illness, but bounced back with four goals in an away victory over Norway.Then came the  World Cup, an injury against France and Greaves’ omission from the side for the final. To see his replacement Geoff Hurst, who was an inferior player, score a hat trick and ultimately receive a knighthood, must have been dficult for Greaves. But typically he was magnanimous about the issue.At the end of his West Ham career Greaves succumbed to severe alcoholism, which brought his contract to an end. After four years away from the game he made a comeback with Barnet among other non-league clubs, and although still impressive his best was long gone.Greaves later forged a new career in television, first with Star Soccer and then more famously as the funny half of the Saint and Greavsie double act with Ian St John.I have to laugh when the likes of Gary Lineker and Harry Kane are sometimes compared to Greaves. Watching old footage reveals how a good number of his goals involved running from just inside the opposition half, beating two or three players and then rounding the keeper. Comparison  There really is none.On Monday it was the th for Denis Law, my boyhood hero and favourite player of all time.Law has also not enjoyed the best of health, suffering from debilitating eye problems and also from prostate cancer. But happily he appears to be in reasonable fettle at the moment, well enough to appear at the recent BBC Sports Personality of the Year event and attend former Manchester United team mate Harry Gregg’s funeral at the weekend.They say it is not always advisable to meet your heroes, but I would gladly pay money to interview Law.: : : : : : : :It was reported last week that Neil Fenwick is in the frame for the Shetland football manager’s job.If that turns out to be the case then good luck to the Lerwick Spurs player coach.When the position was first advertised last year the wording suggested it would be a dficult task, with the applicant likely to need a strong back-up team. That probably explains why so few people came forward.I’m not convinced anyone needs to be going through an interview process over this. None of the most successful people to have held the position were subjected to such scrutiny, and they mostly did the job very well.If Fenwick is indeed the man, let’s all get behind him.: : : : : : : :There is obviously still plenty of power in the conveyor belt which produces Shetland athletics talent, as evidenced by the success of young Layla Todd at the weekend.The -year-old’s fourth-place finish in the Scottish National Cross Country Championships was a tremendous achievement, a credit to both her and her coaches.With distance runner Seumas MacKay now too old for the junior inter-county squad and sprinter Katie Dinwoodie just having a year or two left, it will be necessary for younger competitors to fill the void.

No chance.Whatever you think of the so-called “gypsy king”, who has not always endeared himself to the general public, he is massive box-office entertainment.Wilder may still be given a third fight, which would be disappointing, or Fury’s next outing could be a unication battle with fellow Briton Anthony Joshua.That could well be a mismatch, as Fury appears to be in a dferent league from the muscle-bound Joshua.

In early , they decided to have insulation work carried out in their home following a cold call by Mark Crilly. that Mr Crilly, a former footballer who played for the likes of Ayr United, St Mirren, and Raith Rovers, came to their bungalow in July  and offered to carry out ious jobs as part of a grant scheme. Underfloor and internal wall insulation and a staircase to allow insulation to their loft room – then only accessible by a loft ladder – was part of the package.The work began in February  after confirmation that Julie and Rachel were eligible for the insulation scheme grant as they were in receipt of working tax credits. Mrs Child claims that after initially stating that he was working under one of the warm home schemes, prior to the work being carried Mr Crilly said he now had his own company – the Central Heating Team. February  to begin the work and fitted the staircase. February that the remaining materials would be delivered on st February and that the fitters would then finish the staircase. February in which she outlined work outstanding and issues related to the work carried out along with photographic evidence of it. She also told him that she would leave a key for the workmen to access her house as she had to go to Inverness for surgery.: “They were very happy with their job, but I went in to have a look and the staircase was dangerously on a forward tilt. There was no headroom # you actually had to duck to get in the attic space. So I brought this all to Mark’s attentionand he said #yes, I’ll get them to do something about it# – but what they did was wedge in an extra bit of wood underneath the staircase to try and put the tilt backward. It’s not fixed to the floor, there’s no banister, there’s no handrail at the top. I started looking at building regulations and there isn’t two metres clearance.”She added: “The underfloor heating was fine, no problems –but I think that is really all they are capable of doing because they weren’tjoiners.”After multiple messages asking Mr Crilly what would be doneto recty the damage Julie conducted a search through Companies House to finddetails of the Central Heating Team. She discovered that it was a limitedcompany but that it did not mention Mark Crilly at all.She spoke to one of the company’s directors, David Mastertonwho told her that Mr Crilly was merely one of their lead generators and that itwas through them the underfloor insulation had been carried out. She added thatshe was told Mr Crilly did not have the correct certication in place to undertakethe internal wall insulation. Mrs Child said that Mark Crilly emailed her in April  to say that Mr Masterton would arrange for a joiner to sort the staircase as soon as possible. In June , Julie managed to track down the joiner in question.He told her that Mr Crilly had casually mentioned that there might be work for him but nothing more. Mrs Child claims that the joiner inspected the work at her home and said he was shocked at the poor workmanship and was not interested in trying to put it right.In September , Julie employed the services of theStornoway-based firm Alex Murray Construction.She said: “I went to Alex Murray Construction and they said ‘they have cut through ceiling joists, which they haven’t reinforced, it’s dangerous – you shouldn’t be using the stairs # that all needs to come out or be strengthened.’“They sent us a quote for about £, to put it back to what it was before. They suggested that we speak to the building inspectors.”In November  Comhairle nan Eilean Siar conducted a building inspection of her home.Mrs Child said: “They said ‘your home insurance is invalid. There are major structural ceiling joists that have been chopped through without any reinforcements –you have a problem and have an assessor come in, the first thing they are going to do is come up to the attic and your insurance will be void#.”Following the building inspection, Mrs Child contacted Mr Crilly to determine who was liable, to which she claims he said he was.After sending him the quote and building report, and withher house no longer insured and vulnerable to the winter weather, she sent aletter at the start of December. This explained that the couple would give MrCrilly fourteen days to pay the quote in full otherwise they would take legalaction.She said: “He did email us and offer the deposit and money on completion but as we had already told him, the construction company would not accept that. They needed the money paid up front. He never got a valid quote for the work with them nor took it any further. All he has done is stall at every opportunity.“He has made us feel very foolish and like complete idiots.We came over here for the quiet le and we’ve no mortgage – so that we can makea few changes with our little business. There is no money in the bank to repairwhat he has done.” contacted Mr Crilly for comment, but we have not received a response."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/001WH2102NCA.jpg","title":"west highland free press audio","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineEvery week service users at Tigh na Drochaid Resource Centre in Portree produces an abridged audio version of the West Highland Free Press.

He works extensively at Westminster, Dublin and Stormont.In the late s, he was music critic for the News Letter and contributed to the New Musical Express.He says he uses music to escape from the pain of supporting Everton, Cltonville and Ballymena Rugby Club, not to mention the politics.And he equivocates excellently in true political fashion over his choices - and how they could all change overnight!He says: “The problem with picking a Top Ten is my taste can change from time to time. So perhaps the best option is mixing some old favourites with a few which only made the grade recently.” . Anyone who knows me will not be surprised my first pick will be a Van Morrison track. There are so many which mean so much. Caravan, In the Garden, Tupelo Honey among dozens of classic songs. But I’ve decided to go with a track from the new album Three Chords and the Truth. Morrison thrives when he dips into spirituality and mysticism. At  the Man still has it. The song is Dark Night of the Soul, Van Morrison.  Glen Hansard’s music has been a source of much enjoyment in recent years. Great tunes but my choice is a track featuring Clarence Clemons’ son Jake. Drive All Night, Glen Hansard  John Martyn was a genius. His music transcends styles and fashions. Solid Air one of the finest albums ever produced. This song is just beautul.May You Never, John Martyn. .Nick Drake died a young man but left a powerful legacy of fine music. This song is particularly haunting. Northern Sky, Nick Drake  Following a pattern here, this artist is also dead. Sandy Denny remains a personal favourite. The combination of her voice and the genius of Richard Thompson leaves a song which will never grow old. Who Knows Where the Time Goes, Fairport Convention.  There has to be some sweet soul music. The Rev Al Green remains a voice without equal. Let’s Stay Together, Al Green.  In the same direction, Marvin Gaye could melt the hardest heart. His music both political and romantic. Of course, he’s dead too.What’s Going On, Marvin Gaye . Big fan of the Waterboys. Mike Scott is immensely talented. This is a wonderful version of a Van song from Astral Weeks. Sweet Thing, The Waterboys.  The Alabama Three never receive the plaudits which they deserve. Woke Up This Morning is generally the band’s signature tune but this is even better. Hello..I’m Johnny Cash, Alabama Three . Just love J J Cale. This track is magical. Cocaine by J J Cale My choice will probably change next week and I’m amazed I’ve missed Springsteen and Peter Green’s Fleetwood Mac. But that’s it for now, pop pickers.

Van Morrison – Tupelo Honey, lesser known song from the Belfast Cowboy that in all the times I have seen him live, he has naturally never played!. The Waterboys – Whole of the Moon - just a wonderful anthem of my youth and still such a great song today, took me a long time to realise the lyric was a comparison between two people, “I see the crescent, you see the whole of the moon”. Sam Baker – Broken Fingers, a Texan who “got caught up in someone ’s war” after terrible injuries learned to play the guitar again and wrote this song about the process, read the back story before listening.. Dr Feelgood – All Through the City – first live band I seen in Belfast at  years old, had a huge impact on me and after all these years, Jim Bolan thank you for taking me!. Foy Vance – Two Shades of Hope – a wonderful singer songwriter from our wee country, and what a song!. Linda Rondstadt – Your No Good - I have probably bought this album times in dferent formats, loved it from no age.. David Bowie – Heroes - A song and artist who came alive for me when I went to Live Aid with John Connor in , best performance of the day . Bap Kennedy – Working Man – from the fantastic Sailors Revenge album, sadly Bap is not with us anymore, greatly missed. Was lucky enough to have him play at my th birthday party in the BT club, Vincent Close got him to do some Energy Orchard stuff!. Van Morrison – Into the Mystic- is there a better song to raise the spirit, “let your soul and spirit fly into the mystic” ace.

And they are calling themselves the Upper Bann congregation of RPCIto dferentiate themselves from the main church, which has around  congregations in the province. Mr Dunlop confirmed that they had broken away from the RPCI over the analysis of ‘sin’ during a sermon at Loughbrickland, and the issue was raised with the sessionat the church. Mr Dunlop was one of four elders, and the minister is Rev David Silversides.He added he was not prepared to go into details, as the matter could have legal implications. But the Upper Bann website claims, “The matter spiralled out of control, when Biblical and church procedures were ignored. Spurious ‘discipline’ was enacted against a number of members and it was impossible for some to continue.” The upshot was that Mr Dunlop was excommunicated. He and another elder moved out, with  members, “for the sake of the peace of the Loughbrickland congregation”. The website adds, “As it is an ongoing controversy, still before the ecclesiastical courts – elements of which my come before the civil courts – we refrain from presenting details at present.” The website claims that members excluded from Loughbrickland were denied “constitutional redress within the RPCI”, and they decided to move to Portadown, and set up the first Covenanters Church in the town.The Watson Centre was available and they moved in earlier this month, with ‘Upper Bann Reformed Presbyterian Church of Ireland ’ sign on the gable wall. Rev David Silversides, who has been minister at Loughbrickland for around  years, confirmed that Mr Dunlop had been excommunicated by the church. He added, “It was a long-drawn-out situation, but I don’t want to comment any further.” He referred to the RPCI’s main ruling body – the Synod – where the clerk, Rev Edward McCollum of Ballymoney, also confirmed the excommunication. “It’s is a dficult situation and I cannot see a resolution,” he added. Mr Dunlop said the Relief group was in Portadown for the long haul and had a viable congregation of people in the wider Upper Bann area who were committed to the new church. “We are becoming well established,” he added.Storm Ciara:  of the most shocking photos of the damage flooding left in its wake Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\""},{"url":null,"title":"people  ","story":"A Ballyclare man who slipped into a #dark place# during a bout of mental ill health is cycling across Northern Ireland#s football grounds to raise funds for Action Mental Health.

For these were not just trad troubadours whose genius would grace any stage where Irish music is celebrated but each of them in turn was exemplary in passing on the tradition to the next generation.Mayo harpist Laoise Kelly, who reminded us that the cry in Ireland from our betters was once, ‘hang the harpists and destroy their instruments’, not only excels at our national instrument but has founded an international school for an cláirseach on Achill Island. No better person to pick up the Musician of the Year Award.Ned Kelly from Tipperary, a box player, has inspired an entire community to use music to give hope with his ‘In Tune for Le’ traditional orchestra — scores of whom played from the balconies at the Waterfront Hall as his accordion raised the roof in Béal Feirste Cois Cuain.Then there was the golden-voicedheartbroken Lilis Ó Laoire from the Donegal Gaeltacht whose voice and values connect us with an area where language and song are the very backbone of the community. Lilis had buried his mother the previous day and his presence paid homage to all those who had acted as a bridge of song from the past to the present day. His rousing closing number – a traditional ditty rewritten to mark the event — was a highwater mark of an outstanding evening. Ón osna is sine a thig an ceol is binne, as Seosamh Mac Grianna observed Full marks to the set-designers who used images of Belfast to illuminate a glittering gathering – the shards from the surface of the Titanic Centre, the dome from the Dome of Delight and the yellow cranes in comic-book style —and kudos also to TG for bringing these awards to Belfast for the third year in a row. Maximum Respect. Meas Mór.Both those who attended and those who followed the live broadcast on TG were, indeed, “immeasurably enriched” by the Gradam Ceoil Awards, as the VIP who opened the Waterfront Hall had predicted.And who was he Prince Charles, of course.You can watch back at Gradam Ceoil on the TG player at www.tg.ie"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"if you want to get ahead get a hat","story":"I LIKE hats. And caps. I have quite a nice collection of headwear, worn and aged, like myself, dispersed between Dublin and Belfast, Donegal, the car boot and all the places in between. It used to be customary for men to wear headware. Look at any old photos. Dunchers and flatcaps galore. Peaky blinders in multitudes outside factories, mills, shipyards, farmyards, public houses, marts, markets, country fairs. Hats were also popular. Paddy hats, trilbys, bowlers. Though bowlers were more for Orangemen on parade or English civil servants on The Mall. Country men were hat and cap people. Christy Ring even played hurling in a cap. So my grá for head gear used to be widespread. And now its coming back into vogue. Especially the omnipresent baseball cap. It is the preferred head covering for rappers, golfers, other sports people, urban youth.I have a couple of baseball caps. And a few hand-knitted wooly hats. Síle Darragh knitted me a dark blue tea cosy-type one. Lucilita a white one. Both were too big. But very warm all the same. Wooly ear warmers. There are really fine knitted yokes for sale in expensive shops in the west of Ireland. But they are very dear. I covet one of those. Hint hint. Extra Large.I also have a Stetson. It was presented to me in Texas. It has an enormous brim. I only wear it indoors, usually while watching Westerns on TV. I haven’t the nerve to wear it outdoors. Before the presentation our man in America, Larry Downes, was very concerned that the Stetson should not be a black one. Apparently the bad guys wore black ones. So he insisted that my Stetson would be white. So it is. I never told Larry but I preferred a black one. I favour Jesse James or Billy the Kid over Hopalong Cassidy or The Lone Ranger. But Larry had his way.I have another hat which I’m also shy about wearing outdoors although I like it very much. It’s not unlike the one Martin McGuinness wore during the Easter Centenary events. I wore mine as well. I would like to have the nerve to wear it more often the way Martin started to do. Martins hat now features in many posters and pictures of him. I think the hat darkens his face too much and he looks too stern. He was stern sometimes but my best memories of Martin are when he was hatless and happy.One day he and I were going to see Brit Secretary of State Peter Mandelson. On the coat stand outside his office a hat was perched. To Martin’s chagrin I put the hat on my head and we breezed in to talk to Peter.“I have a hat like that” Peter told me cheerfully. “I wear it in the grounds of Hillsborough House.”“If you want to get ahead get a hat,” I replied, removing it and placing it on my knee. “You have very good taste in headware. That’s something we have in common.”When we finished our meeting I put Peter’s hat back on my head and Martin and I left.“You can’t take his hat,” Martin hissed at me. “That’s stealing”.“Stealing! They stole our country,” I said. “In the gospel according to Cleaky, I’m liberating it. This is appropriating the Imperialist Misappropriators.” Cleaky was a great liberator. An outstanding appropriator.One time in Australia John Little gave RG and me some fine head covers. We picked up two Koalas as well. Ach is é sín scéal eile. But that’s another story. No Koalas were harmed in the telling of this tale.I like tweed caps. I have one which belonged to my friend, the late Kevin McKenna. We swapped caps one time. I wear Kevin’s cap regularly. I also have a cap belonging to another friend, the late Stan Corrigan. His lovely we Kathleen gave me it. It is that cap which triggered this column. I lost it last week after the recent Ard Chomairle meeting in Dublin which mandated Mary Lou to explore the possibilty of agreeing a Programme for A Government For Change.I was distraught about the loss of Stan’s cap. I realised very quickly after the meeting that it was missing. But where  I enlisted the help of Saint Anthony. Again.Was it in Dawn Doyle’s car  No she told me when I phoned her. Or out the back of Ard Oig where RG picked me up  No. There was no sight of it when Keith searched the back lane in the dark in the midst of Storm Ciara.Next morning the search continued. I prowled the back lane of Ard Oig before being summoned heartbroken into a meeting. While I was so engaged, that darling man Mick O Brien drove back to the CWU building where the Ard Chomairle met.He ed triumphantly.“I have your hat,” he declared and handed me a Russian Cossack type piece of hairy millinery.“That’s not my hat,” I told him as I tried it on.“It’s lovely on you,” Mick told me. And so it was.But I was still fretting for big Stan’s cap. Negotiations for Government  The Sinn Féin surge  The posturing by Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael’s leaders  Shadowy friggers running Sinn Féin  I focused with my comrades on all this but beneath my new, well nearly new, Cossack hat my wee mind refused to give up on big Stan’s missing cap. Apart from the sense of loss how could I face Kathleen  She’s a Tyrone woman. Hell hath no fury like a Tyrone woman chastising a man, particularly a Belfast man. My nerves were wrecked.“An bhfuil cead agam dul amach ” I asked Mary Lou. “May I go out ”“Tá” she said “Yes, but please take off that Russian hat#. and get your hair cut.”I exited despondently stage left, as sheepishly as Micheál Martin after Mary Lou scalped his arse. Out the back of Ard Oig the old Dominic Street flats, now demolished, are a building site. I made my way gingerly through the muck. A burly workman greeted me.“A great election result,” he said.“Yup,” I replied, “Did you find a cap ”“Is it a Bugatti ” He asked.I wonderedhe had a selection of caps. A Malloy. A Hanna. A Magee. But no he only had one. Stan’s Bugatti. He pulled it out – a grey wet crumpled item – from beneath his yellow high-vis vest.“That’s it!” I cried as I resisted the urge to hug him. Instead I told him about big Stan. His eyes welled up with tears.“I’m glad I found it,” he told me.“You look very like a painting my Granny had of Saint Anthony,” I told him.He looked at me warily.“Thank you,” I gushed.“No problem. Tell me one thing,” he asked.“Anything,” I replied.“When are you getting your hair cut ” He asked.“Soon,” I told him. After all he did find big Stan’s cap.He smiled at me and as he turned away I really could see that he looked remarkably like my Granny’s picture of Saint Anthony. I felt an urge to fall on my knees in the muck to offer a prayer of thanks to him but I suppressed this. So instead I just thanked him again. He smiled beatically.Now I’ve Mick’s Russian hat as well as big Stan’s cap. It’s great. No need to worry about the wrath of Kathleen. Or Mary Lou. Unlike Micheál Martin. If I had two heads I’d be landed."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"they just cant get enough of shirley","story":"PATHOS, poignancy, hilarity and a fortnight in Greece will collide once again as Tara Lynne O’Neill revives her Shirley Valentine on the Lyric stage this month.Before the initial Shirley run back in September, she had been approached to play one of Willy Russell’s most iconic creations by Lyric Executive Producer Jimmy Fay, a part, at the time, she had no hesitation in accepting., words of script later, Tara Lynne, along with director Patrick J O’Reilly, is preparing to bring the housewe back along with a lot of “sun shimmer” for a limited run at the end of this month.When we meet, Tara has just ed from Dublin where she was reading for Embrace a Giant Spirit, a Seamus Heaney showcase in Christ Church were she read his poem, Markings. In between dodging the last remnants of Storm Ciara, the former St Genevieve’s High School pupil and Derry Girls actress is warm, funny and straight talking about how her version of Willy Russell’s creation is “very much of this particular period in time”.She said: “Audiences have come with their friends, then they’ve come again and brought their mums, mother-in-laws, it’s phenomenal. Audiences feel like Shirley and it’s a gt that they want to give to other people. With the character of Shirley, I suppose it’s that thing that people always talk about, about being a ‘strong female lead’. Well, what is a strong female lead  To me, a strong female lead is someone who is flawed, they show their flaws. Shirley is just every woman and that is what is beautul about her. The character of Shirley has so many dilemmas that every woman faces, no matter what we are.“In the play Shirley talks about being back in school, she believed that good things were not meant for her.“A lot of us come out of school feeling like that or afraid to try stuff because we are afraid to fail.“I’ve been asked to contribute to a piece ITV are doing for International Women’s Day in March – what would you say to your younger self  The only thing I would say to my younger self is to try stuff, fail,you fail what is the worst that can happen  You get back up and you do it again, you do it better. This industry is constantly trying, but you can also play it safe. Shirley has been afraid to make mistakes her whole le. She’s got the . children, the nice house, it’s spotless, the husband, Joe, he’s out working, there isn’t much more she can do. It’s basically a question then of, ‘Is this it ’“Yes, Shirley is  and when I say that on stage people laugh because today, in , it’s so young. But actually  years ago  seemed older, people acted and carried themselves older. I’m  and I go, ‘Well, I’m young.’ We’ve come a long way, I think.”During the production’s initial run, Tara Lynne spoke of how, post-show, she had some “brilliant, absolutely incredible conversations” with women and men of all ages.“I had women in their s want to talk about the play, sixth form students talk to me about how they related to it.”Tara Lynne said that the revival of the play is also a fitting tribute to her friend and assistant director, Julie Maxwell, who tragically passed away last August during a night out in the city centre.“I know we all will truly miss her, I truly miss Julie, I have all the notes that she gave me during our first run of rehearsals. I feel that the success of the show and its second staging is a good way to honour her.”When the curtain comes down on this run, Tara Lynne will be preparing to start filming for the juggernaut that is Channel Four’s smash hit Derry Girls. Playing Ma Mary, the matriarch of the Quinn McCool clan, Tara Lynne has gained something of a cult following with her s perm, jumpers and ‘punt purse’ throughout the show’s two series.“We will hopefully be getting the script soon and I’ve no idea what is in them yet. We will be filming May through to July and I can’t wait to see everybody and the third series will be out later in the year. I’ve also written a play for the Belfast Festival later in the year so it’s very much a case of watch this space.”•Shirley Valentine willto the Lyric Theatre from February  until March .

The combination of a growing younger population, gently rising property prices, and some of the lowest housing costs in Ireland or Britain means that Belfast is a hub of activity for younger people in the property market.In order to gain a greater insight into the experience of these first-time buyers in the local property market, the ATN spoke to two young couples that recently bought their first homes in Belfast as well as real estate expert Colin Moran of Property People. Our goal was to investigate what motivates young people out of the rental market towards purchasing, as well as the factors involved in choosing their first property.Fionntan Smithof Ladybrook, and his fiancée Ciararecently purchased their first home, a semi-detached four-bedroom house with a back garden, in Gransha, in the heart of Andersonstown. They said their purchase was a reflection of their two main priorities: an advantageous location and the space to start a family.“Before we purchased we were both living at home with our parents and saving money: we weren’t keen on getting into the rental market and always having that insecurity over your head,” Fionntan said.“Once we knew we wanted to start a family together we looked at a number of locations and homes. I suppose we could have looked at something cheaper down the road, or a more modern home further out in the ‘commuter ring’, but we decided that our priority was the advantages of living in such an older, settled, well-established area like Gransha.“There’s barely any crime here and being in the middle of West Belfast gives you’re the proximity to the city centre, pubs, public transport, the shops. At the same time, we have plenty of rooms and we have a big back garden, which allows us to raise a family.”Chris Campbell-Palmerand his partner Yvonneon the other hand, decided to purchase their first property – a three-bedroom terraced house – just off the Ravenhill Road in Southeast Belfast after eight years of co-habiting in rented accommodation.“We took the step of getting our first home because ultimately we were sick of moving so often, sometimes due to poorly-maintained properties and disputes with landlords,” they told the ATN.“Financially at the end of the day it is more expensive to rent and that isn’t sustainable. We looked at flats first but there’s a real lack of affordable apartments in Belfast, so that’s when we expanded outwards to look at houses in South and East Belfast, where prices are affordable for first-time buyers.“Even though it’s an older property which needs a bit of work, the house we settled on has more space than a typical terraced house, so we can have friends visit or maintain a lodger. Eventhe area is new to us it’s only a mile walk to the Ormeau Road where most of our friends are as well as being close to the city centre for work.”Director of Property People, Colin Moran, concurred with both couples’ choice to move out of the rental market and into owning their homes.“Purchase every time would be my advice. Despite the flexibility of renting, is in my opinion not a good long-term housing option,” he said.“Owning your property gives you much more stability over the future of your home and an asset that can be sold or passed on to future generations. As far as location and the features of the home you settle on, buying a property is very exciting and provides the buyer the ability to choose their home to reflect their personality, le choices, and future. For dferent people that will mean dferent things but the priority is to make sure your home fits your le as it is much more than just the building itself but how it can enhance your le.“In terms of professional advice, I would urge people to get on the property ladder at an affordable entry point, and aim for a % deposit as you have plenty of time to pay it off,” he added.“In terms of an investment, a good investment property is in a location that will be desirable for tenants to ensure occupancy, be of a good standard or at price that reflects any refurbishments. The numbers have to work in terms of rental yield as well, and that is key to bear in mind and somewhere were buyers should seek advice from an expert.”"},{"url":null,"title":"northern ireland traffic alerts latest delays and disruption","story":"The road has been closed.

National Institutes of Health AF FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappImage of the coronavirus. Maeve Sheehan, Alan O#Keeffe, Rachel Farrell, Hugh O#Connell and Wayne O#ConnorMarch   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailAll pupils and staff of a secondary school in the east of the Republic of Ireland have been reported as #close contacts# of the confirmed case of coronavirus in the country.The principal, staff and parents of pupils of the school have been notied.Following risk assessment, all pupils and teachers are being treated as close contacts of the confirmed case, the National Public Health Emergency Team have confirmed.The school will close for the duration of the incubation period, which is  days.All pupils and teachers are being asked to restrict their movements until the end of the incubation period and will receive guidance on the meaning of ‘restricted movements’.Public health doctors will actively follow-up with all students and teachers on a daily basis over the coming  days, a spokesperson said.Dr. Tony Holohan, Chief Medical Officer with the Department of Health, said: “Contact tracing has assessed that close contacts of this patient includes pupils and teachers of a secondary school. Public health doctors are in direct contact with pupils, their parents and the staff involved.Patient confidentiality in this case, and in all cases, should be respected. The Department of Health will provide updated information as necessary.”The Department of Education said: “The Department of Education is available to assist the school in any way necessary. The Departments of Education and Health are in regular contact.The closing of this school was a decision made on public health grounds after risk assessment deemed it appropriate. All other schools will remain open. The Departments will continue to communicate with all schools on this issue.”Yesterday it emerged that a patient, a male in the eastern part of the country, is currently receiving appropriate medical care after testing positive for Covid-, the HSE revealed.The man had been in Northern Italy and did not contract the virus from contact with another confirmed case here, including the case confirmed in Northern Ireland on Thursday. He came forward himself with symptoms. Tests confirmed he had the virus only hours before the announcement was made and authorities then began the process of tracing those he may have come into contact with.Dr Tony Holohan, chief medical officer with the Department of Health, said the likelihood of more cases in Ireland is now moderate to high but added that, for members of the public who had not been out of the country, the likelihood of contract the virus was still extremely low.Dr Holohan said: This is not unexpected. We have been preparing for this eventuality for many weeks now. Public health protocols have been in place since January and are operating effectively.The health service is well used to managing infectious diseases and has robust response measures in place.Dr John Cuddihy, director of the Health Protection Surveillance Centre, said: The HSE is now working rapidly to identy any contacts the patient may have had, to provide them with information and advice to prevent further spread.It is important to note that the risk of transmission through casual contact is low.It is the second case of coronavirus on the island of Ireland, after the first case in Northern Ireland was confirmed earlier this week.The patient had arrived at Dublin Airport from northern Italy before travelling to Belfast by train.The Irish Cabinet is expected to meet to discuss measures to contain the virus, such as curtailing public events, while the cancellation of St Patrick#s Day events around the country has not been ruled out.Government departments are being asked to provide facilities for people to self-isolate in the event of a coronavirus outbreak here, the Sunday Independent has learned.Newly-commissioned nursing homes that are not yet in use or facilities at colleges and universities across the State could be used as spaces for people to self-isolate as a precaution in the event they cannot do so at home.It would beyou ended up with a lot of people who are symptomatic but do not have a suitable home setting in which to self-isolate, a Government source said.Here is a look at the total confirmed cases of Covid- across the world.This could include patients in nursing homes, people in Direct Provision who have to share a room with others or those caught up in the housing crisis who are also forced to share a room with others.Departments are being asked to provide details on facilities they would be able to make available to be used as temporary isolation units. Such facilities would not be used as field hospitals for people who are diagnosed with the coronavirus. It#s not for sick people. If you are sick and need to be isolated we are prepared for that, the source said.Government preparations for dealing with an outbreak of the coronavirus will be stepped up this week with an inter-departmental group of secretaries general to meet to assess ious contingency plans.Nursing homes will have to consider restricting visitor access to protect residents from the coronavirus, according to industry representatives, with older people and people with underlying illnesses most vulnerable to the virus.The chief executive of Nursing Homes Ireland, Tadhg Daly, said he was also concerned about a shortage of equipment, such as face masks, to protect staff from the coronavirus.In the private sector, the majority have single en-suite rooms, so the level of preparedness is good, he said.The English language school sector is expected to lose millions because of travel restrictions designed to contain the virus. Many student trips due to take place this month and in April have already been cancelled. Marketing English in Ireland estimates that more than , student trips in the coming weeks will be cancelled, at a cost of more than €m.The National Bus and Rail Union is calling for Perspex protective shields for drivers on the country#s national bus routes. Unlike Dublin Bus vehicles, Bus Eireann services in regional areas do not have automated cash dispensers or protective shields.The union was told last week that the Northern Irish passenger who travelled from northern Italy to Dublin Airport and then on to Belfast did not use public bus transport.The woman is now self-isolating in Northern Ireland and the train on which she travelled to Belfast has been sanitised. It is believed that several people who had contact with the woman on her journey home from northern Italy have also been forced to isolate themselves. These include the passengers who sat two rows in front, two rows behind and across from the woman on the Aer Lingus flight to Dublin.The cabin crew have also been placed in self-isolation for  days as a precautionary measure.Irish IndependentRelated Content at the Royal Hospital near the entrance of the AampE department. \"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph sunday-le news dda .ece AUTOCROP wh --_sun__I.JPG w,https:www.belfasttelegraph sunday-le news dda .ece AUTOCROP wh --_sun__I.JPG w,https:www.belfasttelegraph sunday-le news dda .ece AUTOCROP wh --_sun__I.JPG w,https:www.belfasttelegraph sunday-le news dda .ece AUTOCROP wh --_sun__I.JPG w,https:www.belfasttelegraph sunday-le news dda .ece AUTOCROP wh --_sun__I.JPG w\" data-sizes\"auto\"   at the Royal Hospital near the entrance of the AampE department. \"NewsexclusiveSpecial coronavirus pods set up at Northern Ireland hospitals to fight disease Special coronavirus pods are now in action in Northern Ireland after our first confirmed case of the disease.\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming c .ece AUTOCROP wh AFP_PDZ.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming c .ece AUTOCROP wh AFP_PDZ.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming c .ece AUTOCROP wh AFP_PDZ.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming c .ece AUTOCROP wh AFP_PDZ.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming c .ece AUTOCROP wh AFP_PDZ.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"Republic of IrelandHunt for contacts as first case of coronavirus confirmed in Republic of IrelandThe first case of coronavirus has been confirmed in the Republic of Ireland.UKThirteen new UK coronavirus cases as total climbs to Thirteen new coronavirus cases have been confirmed in the UK as the number of people infected climbed to . with Minister for Health Simon Harris \"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming cd .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_c-bd-ea-a-ccdbb_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming cd .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_c-bd-ea-a-ccdbb_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming cd .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_c-bd-ea-a-ccdbb_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming cd .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_c-bd-ea-a-ccdbb_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming cd .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_c-bd-ea-a-ccdbb_ w\" data-sizes\"auto\"   with Minister for Health Simon Harris \"Northern IrelandCoronavirus risk remains low in Ireland – senior health officialA senior Irish health official has urged the public not to panic about coronavirus, insisting the risk level remained low in the country.,,,],\"customPriceBuckets\":[,,,,,],\"targeting\":Most ReadHunt for contacts as first case of coronavirus confirmed in Republic of IrelandSecondary school in Republic of Ireland to close for  days after all pupils and staff confirmed as #close contacts# of coronavirus caseSinn Fein leader warns Greens not to facilitate Fianna Fail Fine Gael governmentSix people die in three road crashes in  hoursCelebrity chef Rachel Allen#s son Joshua jailed for  months,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriMoneyTechnologyAnalysisTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleTravelSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Since launching in Belfast in , Co-Founders has delivered four cohorts involving  people who formed more than  teams - over  of whom are still working together. Twenty teams have received Proof of Concept funding, and eight teams have progressed to the full-time Propel pre-accelerator programme.Co-Founders has attracted software engineers, data scientists, sales and marketing experts, medical professionals, mechanical engineers, researchers, undergraduates and PhDs as well as people who have experienced a problem in a certain industry or from everyday le and want to develop a product to solve it.Participants in the new North West programme will have the added incentive of being in the running to win one of five pound, proof of concept grants from Innovate UK, the government’s innovation agency, which will be awarded to five teams with the best developed ideas at the end of the programme.Sonya Kerr, programme manager of Co-Founders, said Catalyst was hoping to attract  to  people from Derry, Letterkenny and across the North West to sign up.“We know there is a wealth of talent in the North West and a lot of people who have great ideas or are restless to try something new, who will really benefit from meeting others with dferent skills needed to build a start-up that they wouldn’t normally have a chance to meet,” she said.“Teams on Co-Founders are willing to try something dferent, meet new people and stretch themselves. We certainly don’t expect everyone to leave their jobs immediately and create a start-up but by helping people validate their ideas and build teams, it becomes a real option for many.”For example, of the nine teams who completed Catalyst’s first Co-Founders programme, three are still together and two have received over pound, in funding to build and launch their products.While on the programme, Co-Founder teams get access to co-working space within Catalyst to allow them to grow their own networks.Applications are now open for the programme at: co-founders.coThe deadline for applications for the North West programme is March . googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Since launching in Belfast in , Co-Founders has delivered four cohorts involving  people who formed more than  teams - over  of whom are still working together. Twenty teams have received Proof of Concept funding, and eight teams have progressed to the full-time Propel pre-accelerator programme.Co-Founders has attracted software engineers, data scientists, sales and marketing experts, medical professionals, mechanical engineers, researchers, undergraduates and PhDs as well as people who have experienced a problem in a certain industry or from everyday le and want to develop a product to solve it.Participants in the new North West programme will have the added incentive of being in the running to win one of five pound, proof of concept grants from Innovate UK, the government’s innovation agency, which will be awarded to five teams with the best developed ideas at the end of the programme.Sonya Kerr, programme manager of Co-Founders, said Catalyst was hoping to attract  to  people from Derry, Letterkenny and across the North West to sign up.“We know there is a wealth of talent in the North West and a lot of people who have great ideas or are restless to try something new, who will really benefit from meeting others with dferent skills needed to build a start-up that they wouldn’t normally have a chance to meet,” she said.“Teams on Co-Founders are willing to try something dferent, meet new people and stretch themselves. We certainly don’t expect everyone to leave their jobs immediately and create a start-up but by helping people validate their ideas and build teams, it becomes a real option for many.”For example, of the nine teams who completed Catalyst’s first Co-Founders programme, three are still together and two have received over pound, in funding to build and launch their products.While on the programme, Co-Founder teams get access to co-working space within Catalyst to allow them to grow their own networks.Applications are now open for the programme at: co-founders.coThe deadline for applications for the North West programme is March . googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Sister Clare Crockett was a self-confessed party girl with a promising showbusiness career in front of her but she turned her back on fame to follow God when she joined the Servant Sisters of the Home of the Mother at just . Since her tragic death at just , many miracles have been attributed to her intercession. Clare grew up in Derrys Brandywell and was a popular and outgoing girl who and dreamed of being famous. googletag.cmd.push By her late teens, she had secured an agent and was on the verge a successful acting career, but like many girls her age she spent her weekends drinking in pubs and clubs. She wasnt a bit religious growing up, her sister, Shauna Gill, remembered. We used to dob mass and Clare and my sister, Megan, would go and buy fags and theyd buy me a Taz bar to shut my mouth, she smiled. Clare made her acting debut in Sunday Paul Greengrasss film about Bloody Sunday. She had also landed a gig presenting a youth show on Channel  and had been approached by Nickelodeon about further presenting roles. googletag.cmd.push In the year , Clares friend had to drop out of a trip to Spain and she was asked to go in her place. It was only after her name was on the ticket that Clare realised it was a Retreat, organised by the religious order the Home of the Mother. She thought she was going to Ibiza for a free trip away, laughed Shauna. Clare would later describe how she spent the first few days of the trip smoking and sunbathing, but on Good Friday she experienced something that was to change her le. The group attended a Good Friday service and the congregation were asked to kiss the Crucix. When Clares turn came, she had an overwhelming feeling that Jesus loved her and had died for her. She later told people that her sins had nailed him to the cross. She kissed the cross and it was her le. That was it, said Shauna. Clare ed to Derry as a very dferent girl, but it took her another year to answer Gods call to become a nun. She tried to fight it, said Shauna. If our father was giving her a lt to the Bound for Boston bar she would say dont drive past the Long Tower chapel because God used to stand at the gate calling to her. On one of her many nights out Clare had too much to drink and went into a toilet cubicle to be sick. She had a strong sense that someone was watching her and then heard Gods voice in her head saying why do you keep hurting me  Clare said she felt that she was nailing Jesus to the cross once again, and in that moment she decided she should devote her le to him.  She told her family she was moving to Spain to be a nun with the Servant Sisters of the Home of the Mother who she had met on the Retreat. We were shocked, admitted Shauna. She was the most dramatic, outgoing person you could ever meet in your le. I think the priests thought she was a big eejit at the start. But Clare had always been her own person and was determined not to let anything stand in her way. She didnt care what anyone  said, Shauna recalled. She had never cared what anyone thought of her. She used to wear horrible clothes, well to me they were horrible. Clare was stunning, but she didnt care what she looked like. She would just run her fingers through her hair and go out the door. Heartbroken at their daughters decision to start a new le so far from home, the Crocketts hoped she would be back after a few weeks, but Clare surprised everybody by fully embracing her new way of le. That was her le and there was no talking to her, said Shauna. We still sit and say did that really happen, did she really go away and become a nun  but she was so happy and she never complained. She made a dference to so many peoples lives. Clares determination to become a nun never wavered. She later said God told her I will be your mother, your father, your language, your country. After taking her first vows on February ,  she took the religious name Sister Clare Maria of the Trinity and the Heart of Mary. She went on to take her perpetual vows on September ,  and served the Servant Sisters of the House of the Mother in Belmonte and Valencia in Spain, Jacksonville in America and Guayaquil and Playa Prieta in Ecuador. Clares magnetic personality and gt for music and song helped her connect with people and she had a special affinity with children. Carmelite priest, Fr Stephen Quinn, who celebrates a Mass in memory of Sister Clare every month, said her extraordinary story blew him away. He first heard about Sr Clares story when he watched All or Nothing:Sr Clare Crockett the film made by the House Of The Mother Order about her le. The film shows footage of Clare during her  years with the Order and charts her le from her first Retreat until just days before her death. To witness someone of little or no faith experience Christ in such a radical way and who lived her le in such a radical way is amazing. She fitted more into her  years than most of us ever will. Its not just the attributed miracles. You have to look at who this girl was and the le she came from and how she became a nun. When you see nuns these days they are old women in their s and s, but this is a girl who gave her whole le to God and that is the greatest miracle of all. Towards the end of her le Clare started suffering from severe migraines that made her physically sick. It emerged after her death she was suffering from a bleed to her brain, but she had continued to work as hard as ever telling her Sisters that she wrote a blank cheque to God every day. Every time you saw her she had a guitar in her hand and she was singing and she had a whole tribe of wains behind her, Shauna recalled. Just days before she passed away Sister Clare told her fellow nuns that she knew she was going to die young and even suggested she might die at  like Jesus had. On April , , Sister Clare was crushed to death in the stairwell of her school in Playa Prieta in Ecuador as she attempted to guide five girls to safety during an earthquake. She was -years-old. When her body was discovered she was carrying a piece of her guitar in her hand.  Her mum, Margaret, who passed away on lSeptember  last year at  from vascular dementia, never got over her daughters death. She cried a wile lot, said Shauna. Shed say why did our Clare leave me  but shes doing more now that she has died than she could ever have done alive. It makes the grieving easier. She is doing so much for people. After Clare died she was brought back to Derry and laid to rest at the City Cemetery where her grave has become a place of pilgrimage for visitors from around the world. We were overwhelmed, said Shauna. Shes just not another person who died, people have kept her legacy and her name going. Theres a wee man who comes from Toome every fortnight with flowers from Marks  Spencer and goes to her grave. Thats her effect everywhere you go. People are just devoted to her. A prayer group which asks Sister Clare to intercede for them meets weekly in Derry. We have a packed room every time and people get a great feeling, said Shauna. Several miracles have been attributed to Sister Clare, including the birth of twins to an infertile couple and the recovery of a young boy on le support whose parents had been told he would die. So what would Sister Clare make of calls for her to be made a saint  She would love it, smiled Shauna. She went from only ever wanting to be famous and live a le of luxury to giving everything up. But she made the right choice. She said Im going to be famous. Im going to be a famous nun. The Mass in memory of Sister Clare takes place on the second Sunday of every month in Termonbacca at pm.Her anniversary Mass will take place on Sunday, April , in Termonbacca. The Sister Clare Novena prayer group meets every Monday at the Search youth group premises in the Iona Business Parkat .pm.

Sixty minutes. Once the sliotar is thrown in, a game evaporates in a flash. Yet so much can happen. The helter-skelter of championship does that. For the camogs of Slaughtneil, they are just  minutes away from the upper echelons of club camogie. A passport to the very top of the tree. A fourth successive All-Ireland title would equal Buffers Alleys feat of the s. The Wexford club won the  title before losing the decider to Corks Killeagh the following but bounced back to annex the next four titles. googletag.cmd.push A Slaughtneil win on Sunday would also see them join Corks Glen Rovers on the roll of honour, who have four titles to their name, on the roll of honour. Standing in their way are Michael Hopper McGraths Sarsfields. The former All-Ireland winning forwards team, - which includes four of his daughters – must be sick of the sight of the Emmets at this stage. In Slaughtneils breakthrough year, Eiliacutes Niacute Chaisides player of the match performance saw her curl over the insurance point and supply the ammunition for Mary Kellys early second half goal to sink Sarsfields. The following year, snow stalled the road to glory and by time the game was fixed for Clones, Sarsfields had no answer to new attacking ace Tina Bradley, who rattled up a - tally, powering Slaughtneil to glory again. googletag.cmd.push Last year the landscape changed in the form of a new challenger emerging from the west. It was Ardrahan who took Sarsfields crown but they were edged out by the Derry giants, who defeated Mags DArcys St Martins in a Croker snowstorm to complete three-in-row. Slaughtneils four-year unbeaten run came a cropper in the league last summer at the hands of neighbours Swatragh at Davitt Park. By the time the championship rolled into town, normal service resumed. After a semi-final win over the Davitts, they slugged it out with Ballinascreen before retaining their title. From their first All-Ireland winning team of , five players have moved on. Denise McGuigan retired with two All-Ireland medals in her collection. Her cousin Dervlagh had the sameby the time she jetted off for a teaching career in Dubai. Mary Kelly moved to Glasgow after the first title, also to start a new job. This season, manager Damien McEldowney had to plan without defensive duo, sisters Eiliacutes and Broacutena Niacute Chaiside who opted to go travelling. Into the defence came Eiliacutes McGrath to cement a place and there was afor Clare McGrath, who missed out of the  after having a baby.    players in line for a fourth All-Ireland final starting berth:Jolene BradleyJosine McMullanGraacuteinne Niacute ChathaacuteinAoe Niacute ChaisideTherese MellonSinead MellonLouise DouganSiobhaacuten BradleyShannon Graham.  After a season at midfield, Faoiltiarna Burke opted out of the  and Cliona Mulholland has slotted into the vacancy. Mary Kellys shoes were filled by Tina Bradley. Josine McMullan had originally moved from corner back but was converted into a ball winner at full-forward. She lost her place for the Loughgiel game to Olivia Rafferty before a recall for the All-Ireland semi-final. If McEldowney and his selectors retain the same starting line-up, it will see nine players start all four All-Ireland finals. Slaughtneil and their highly-respected physio Moira-Jane Devlin will have been thankful of the five week play-off since their win over Scarf-Ogonnelloe. Shannon Graham was forced off with an ankle ligament injury, but manager Damien McEldowney is confident she will be available for selection. CHANGES As the Emmets peek out west, there are changes in the Sarsfields camp from the previous encounters. Yvonne Lyons has been replaced by current Galway club all-star keeper Laura Glynn between the posts. Sinead Cannon has moved from attack to corner back in place of cruciate ligament victim Rachel Murphy. In the other corner is former midfielder Kate Gallagher. There have been changes to their half-back unit. Erica Leslie picked up a hip injury that kept her out of the - to - county final win over St Thomas. She ed for the All-Ireland semi-final. So too did Maria Cooney. She had her foot in a cast for six weeks following a broken ankle sustained in the second half of their win over St Thomas. Tara Kenny tore her cruciate ligament before Galways All-Ireland final win over Kilkenny in September. Sarsfields only starter on the winning side was Sarah Spellman and she wasnt without injuries woes, having to get over a broken thumb to play her part in their - to - victory over St Vincents. The five-week break will have given Leslie, Cooney and Spellman every chance of making full recoveries, which will be a welcome boost as Hopper ponders who picks up Tina Bradley. His daughters Clodagh and Niamh – who picked up a hamstring injury in the  final – line out in the midfield zone, with Orlaith and Siobhaacuten forming the spine of their attack. There has been an injection of youth to their squad. Rachel Murray, who played Sarsfields last All-Ireland final appearance, Cora Kenny who was on water bottle duties in Clones that day and Joanne Daly were all part of last years Galway minor team. Another newcomer is Aoibhe Deeley who has mixed underage camogie with a career in athletics, where she specialises in the hurdles. Slaughtneils defence will be thoroughly tested. Graacuteinne Niacute Chathaacutein will be the favourite to pick up Siobhaacuten McGrath. Ceacuteat McEldowney could go onto Rachel Murray, with Eiliacutes McGrath assigned to Cora Kenny, who scored the match-winning goal in their extra-time win over Mullagh in the Galway semi-final. It is in the midfield area where the game will hinge. Slaughtneil had a tough physical battle with Scarf-Ogonnelloe, like they did with Thomastown in . Back then, it served them well. Clare McGrath, Bridiacuten McAllister and Aoe Niacute Chaiside will have a huge to roll to play across the half-back line, with Shannon Graham getting back to full power after injury. They also have their quarter-back, Louise Dougan back in the sweeping role but in her absence from attack puts a huge emphasis on the movement of Therese and Sinead Mellon to provide the link in the half-forward ision. Eight-time winners St Pauls Kilkenny , St Lachtains Kilkenny and Pearses Galway accompany Slaughtneil in the three-in-row club. The Emmets have made a habit of breaking records and who would bet against the Bill and Agnes Carroll Cup making another foray up the Halfgain Road on Sunday night. VERDICT: SLAUGHTNEIL PROBABLE TEAMS SLAUGHTNEIL: Jolene Bradley Ceacuteat McEldowney, Graacuteinne Niacute Chathaacutein, Eiliacutes McGrath Bridiacuten McAllister, Aoe Niacute Chaiside, Clare McGrath Shannon Graham, Cliona Mulholland, Siobhaacuten Bradley, Tina Bradley, Louise Dougan, Josie McMullan, Sinead Mellon, Therese Mellon. SARSFIELDS: Laura Glynn, Sinead Cannon, Laura Ward, Kate Gallagher, Erica Leslie, Maria Cooney, Joanne Daly, Aoibhe Deeley, Niamh McGrath, Clodagh McGrath, Orlaith McGrath, Sarah Spellman, Cora Kenny, Siobhaacuten McGrath, Rachel Murray. KEY BATTLE Siobhaacuten McGrath v Graacuteinne Niacute ChathaacuteinIn Sarsfields last three championship games, Siobhaacuten McGrath has amassed - of her teams combined tally of -. While man come from placed balls, it is her all round play that makes her the pivot of their All-Ireland challenger. Graacuteinne Niacute Chathaacutein will need the help of her midfield to limit the supply butshe can at least break even in her duel with McGrath, it could tip the scales in Slaughtneils favour.

Ryan McGeough was coached by Gregg at Portstewart FC for three or four years as a teenager. “My mum texted me about his death and I couldnt believe it,” McGeough said. “I hadnt seen him in a few years and I would have loved to run into him and have a yarn but unfortunately I never got the chance.” Gregg, who was voted as the best goalkeeper of the  World Cup, a native of Tobermore, passed away at the age of  and aside from his talents between the posts he was most famous in football circles for his heroics during the Munich air disaster in February  which claimed the lives of  people. googletag.cmd.push Harry pulled some of his team-mates from the burning plane, after disaster struck on theirjourney from a European Cup victory over Red Star Belgrade. Among those he saved were Bobby Charlton, Jackie Blanchflower and manager Sir Matt Busby. Harry played  games but was a larger than le presence. Anybody who ever had a conversation with Harry would have remembered it,” stated Irish FA Chief Executive Patrick Nelson in a statement to the County Derry Post. Gregg started his club career with Windsor Park Swts, the reserve team of Linfield, before signing for his local club Coleraine. At the age of  he earned a move to Second Division side Doncaster Rovers before switching to Manchester United for pound,, which was a world record fee for a goalkeeper at the time and made  appearances for the Red Devils. googletag.cmd.push He entered management and became manager of Shrewsbury Town, before taking charge of Swansea City, Crewe Alexandra and Carlisle United. Gregg also had a spell as goalkeeping coach at Manchester United and as assistant manager at Swindon Town. Harry was appointed an MBE by The Queen in  for services to football, and was then made an OBE in , also for services to football. Each week the Harry Gregg Foundation facilitates a wide range of activities for thousands of people in the Coleraine area and beyond through participation in football and ious other activities. Sir Alex Ferguson, who took his United team to play in Harrys testimonial in Belfast in , paid a tribute on Manchester Uniteds Official Website. “Harry was a man of great character and a true legend at our club. I remember that he was always very excited and proud to host our youth team at his boarding house for the Milk Cup every summer, so he could recount the tales of his playing days. I loved his company and the many pieces of advice he gave me.” While back in Ireland, Gregg bought the Windsor Hotel in Portstewart and began coaching the local soccer team. One player who remembers him fondly was goalkeeper Ryan McGeough who would go on to win two Derry championship medals with Coleraine GAA team. GREGG THE COACH “He was thecoach but as a goalkeeper you got a lot more attention from him than everybody. He was the first goalkeeper coach I ever came across that made the goalkeepers train with the outfielders. “Ray Woods was an England capped goalkeeper whenUnited won the league in   and they bought Harry for a record fee. “Harry said to me the only reason why they bought him was that Woods was a linie,” recalls McGeough, referring to Woods reluctance to leave his six-yard box. “Harry was the first goalkeeper to sweep outside his box and cover for defenders. He would always have had you out in the box organising your defenders.” McGeough soon learned Greggs approach to goalkeeping during one of those coaching sessions with Portstewart. “Peter Schmeichel was my hero and having played European handball, he brought in the spreading himself”, McGeough continues, explaining the Danes trademark star-jump, making himself as imposing as possible. Harry Gregg didnt agree and stopped his young proteacutegeacute advancing a la Schmeichel during training.   It was by far and away the best coaching I have ever had. Ryan McGeough  “He dropped the ball and said you, e on it and you , challenge him. If you do the spread again, you will do this all night. In Harrys era, you ed and took the ball and man. “It was by far and away the best coaching I have ever had. I havent spread myself since in case Harry was watching,” laughs the affable McGeough. “He would have taken it as serious coaching a  year old as a senior.” “He taught you how to manipulate forwards on a one on one and force the forward to make the first move. What he was teaching was far and beyond seen before. “If another manager, who is not a goalkeeper, says something to you, you could question it butHarry said something to you - you just did it. “Wed sit around the changing room listening to him for an hour and a half after training. Hed be telling us stories about Best, Charlton and Busby. When you are a big Man Utd head, you are in dreamland listening to him.” McGeough speaks of how goalkeeping has changed and in the era of televised games too much of the routines being similar. “In Harrys day there were so many dferent styles and I would prefer to play the way Harry played.” READ ALSO - He was larger than le on the pitch.

However, McKnight was not to be denied and in the seventh minute he dispossessed Corey Laverty and hit a shot that squirmed through Leneghanrsquos hands and into the net.Albion had barely time to celebrate as, virtually from the restart, Tollymore won a free kick that was delivered into the box, by McLister, for Ruairi Toner to shoot into the net.United slowly began to take a stranglehold in midfield with Marty McCourt and Tommy Kane dominating Burke and Rooney. On the left wing, Marty Devlin was giving the Albion defence a torrid time with his pace and power.Just on the stroke of half-time Albionrsquos Ryan Beckett fired a free kick over the Bearsrsquo crossbar.Despite having wind advantage, Tollymore were unable to create any chances of note and they were rocked in the th minute when Albion centre half Allan Cousins found himself unmarked in the Tollymore area to head a corner kick past Leneghan.Despite this setback, Tollymore held their nerve and Jack McCourt and Matt McCormick linked up for McCourt to run through on goal. Unfortunately, Albion lsquokeeper Joel Collins made a superb finger tip save to block McCourtrsquos shot.United were well on top, but were lacking the guile to open up the Moira defence until the introduction of veteran striker Adrian lsquoSparkyrsquo Howard.Within moments of Howardrsquos arrival in the st minute he got on the end of a McLister flick to shoot past Collins in the Albion goal.It was now all Tollymore as the Bears pushed for a winner and Albion were reduced to ten-men after Darryl Irwin was dismissed for a cynical foul on Marty Devlin as the striker burst through on goal, after being put clear by Tommy Kane.Virtually on the stroke of full time, Corey Laverty picked out Howard with a superb pass only for Collins to make another excellent save. Extra time saw Tollymore playing with the wind and forcing a succession of corners that Albion did well to defend.Albion seemed content to play for penalty kicks and it was only in the last couple of minutes of the game that they came out of their defensive shell, but were unable to penetrate a resolute Tollymore defence.Albion netted their first penalty with Marty McCourt equalising and then the fun started. Leneghan saved the second spot kick and Albionrsquos Joel Collins then blocked Corey Lavertyrsquos effort to keep things level at -. Leneghan then saved the third Albion kick before Marty Devlin scored to nudge the Bears in front at -.The Moira men levelled things with a cracking penalty leaving United with two more penalties to win. Unfortunately, Howard shot wide to leave the scores - and one penalty apiece left.Once again Leneghan made an unbelievable save to hand the initiative to United and Adam Rea stepped up to blast the ball into the net to send United into the final.Match sponsor: Diamond Pats, Newcastle.Tollymore United Moira Albion MID ULSTER LEAGUE CUP S

South Down MP Chris Hazzard during a meeting in Berlin last weekend with representatives from the Executive Board of the European Left.The MP was warmly received by delegates from the EU member states who congratulated Mr Hazzard on Sinn Feinrsquos recent success in the Irish election.Mr Hazzard said that it was ldquofantastic to receive a warm welcome from representatives of the European Left.He explained that throughout the Brexit negotiations, European solidarity with Ireland was ldquoremarkable and it was fitting that he had the opportunity to thank representatives from across the EU for that support at their Executive Board meeting.Mr Hazzard said that it was also important to take the opportunity to call for continued support in the months ahead.ldquoBrexit is by no means complete and Ireland will need ongoing solidarity as European and British government officials commence trade talks next month, the MP continued.ldquoWe canrsquot allow the British government to adopt a casual approach to their international obligations and responsibilities to protect both the Good Friday Agreement and our all-Ireland economy.Mr Hazzard revealed that it was also ldquofascinating to be involved in a discussion regarding the need to deepen understanding and relations with all European Left parties in the time ahead, especially in relation to tackling the climate emergency, workersrsquo rights, gender equality and the increasing need to counter the growth in extreme, far-right politics throughout Europe.Also this week, the South Down MP described British government immigration proposals as ldquounpopular, unworkable and a direct threat to economic well-being in South Down.Responding to proposals confirmed by the Home Office that immigration policy in Northern Ireland will change from next year, the MP warned that far from strengthening the economic wellbeing of society, the proposals are a direct threat to the local hospitality, tourism, retail and agri-food sectors.Mr Hazzard declared: ldquoIt is hard not to view these proposals as an elitist, xenophobic attack on overseas and low-paid workers, the vast majority of whom we simply cannot live without.ldquoIndeed, most worryingly, these proposals are a cruel attack on our care sector the wonderful, selfless heroes whom we all rely on to take care of us and our families in our hour of need.Mr Hazzard said it is ldquoabundantly clear that the Home Office has completely ignored what he described as the ldquoNorthrsquos unique and special circumstances and has shown nothing but contempt for local business and industry leaders who have engaged constructively with British government officials in recent years.The MP added: ldquoSinn Feacutein will be raising these concerns directly with the British government in the weeks to come..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/26th February 2020 Down.jpg","title":"Down District has two of worst roads in NI  ","story":"TWO of the worst roads in Northern Ireland are in Down District and just miles apart, it has been revealed.They are the Shore Road in Strangford and the Blackstaff Road in Clough which are placed first and third respectively in the list of the provincersquos worst roads, the Department for Infrastructure has confirmed.New statistics revealed by the government department confirm that a total of  defects mdash including pot holes mdash were recorded on both roads last year.Government officials say that  defects were recorded on the Shore Road and  on the Blackstaff Road.The Department has confirmed that between  and  it paid out a staggering pound.m to drivers across Northern Ireland whose vehicles had been damaged by potholes.Years of underinvestment has led to a deterioration of Northern Irelandrsquos roads according to Stormont infrastructure minister, Nichola Mallon, who is making poundm available to help address the issue.The cash will also be used for winter gritting services and to help repair the tens of thousands of street lights that are out across the country.Ms Mallon explained that years of underinvestment as well as the impact of severe winter weather has led to deterioration in the road network and in recent years this has impacted on the level of vehicle damage compensation payments.Last year, Northern Irelandrsquos public spending watchdog warned that it would cost more than poundbn to deal with structural maintenance.The Northern Ireland Audit Office published a report highlighting how a lack of investment was having a deteriorating effect on the overall condition of Northern Irelandrsquos road network and found that a lack of funding had led to a signicant reduction in the number of potholes being recorded and approved for repair.Ms Mallon said that ldquofrustratingly for a number of years now not enough money had been allocated to her departmentrsquos budget to maintain roads and repairs were having to be done on a priority basis.ldquoWhile I have inherited severe and challenging budget constraints, I am committed to finding solutions that deliver better for our communities and improve lives, she said.ldquoI have impressed on the new finance minister the need for additional money to deal with this issue and other critical pressures. Sustainable infrastructure is key to improving lives and connecting communities.Confirmation of the poundm funding package to deal with roads maintenance, winter gritting and defective street lights comes just weeks after the Recorder revealed that while the lights were back on at Stormont after MLAs ed to work, they were continuing to go out across the district at an alarming rate.In mid-January, almost  street lights were not working in East Down, plunging many areas into darkness and the Department for Infrastructure confirming that due to budgetary pressures it was only able to provide a limited repair service.Province-wide, it was estimated that in excess of , street lights were not working with the government department having only a small number of engineers at its disposal to repair all of them.Downpatrick topped the league table for broken street lights in East Down with  in need of repair. Newcastle was in second place with  street lights not working.Other district hot spots included Ballynahinch where  street lights were out of order, while where,  faults were reported in Killyleagh,  in Castlewellan and Crossgar and  in Saintfield.In Ballygowan,  street lights are currently out of order with  and  faults reported in Ardglass and Killough respectively.Downpatrick councillor, Dermot Curran, has welcomed the infrastructure ministerrsquos commitment to invest poundm and hopes that many of the potholes and defective street lights across the district will be repaired.He said while the defects will be repaired according to their priority, he hopes that Ms Mallon will secure additional support from the Stormont Executive to carry out a full repair programme.ldquoThe minister is having to deal with a legacy of under investment in the roads network and she must be given every assistance by her Stormont colleagues. There are clearly budgetary pressures across a range of departments but it is is vital that we invest in our roads and wastewater infrastructure in particular, continued Cllr Curran.ldquoMs Mallon clearly has the needs of people at heart and hopefully she will be given additional monies to help address the particular problems we have in Down District. It is important that all road repairs are carried out to a high standard to that the work will last..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/26th February 2020 Down GAA.jpg","title":"Down goals revive hopes  ","story":"DOWN left it late before getting the better of Longford at a bitterly cold Pairc Esler on Saturday night.Itrsquos ever so tight now in the race for second place behind an unbeaten Cork in the Division  table with Down, Longford, Derry and Offaly all on five points after four games.Saturdayrsquos game seemed to be heading for a draw as the sides were locked at - to - with less than  minutes remaining.However, two late goals from Cory Quinn and James Guinness put paid to a brave Longford challenge as Down ran out two point winners.Longford were dealt a blow before the game with star forward Rian Brady ruled out with a chest infection and his replacement, Peter Lynn, who scored two points in the early exchanges, had to go off injured after  minutes.It was Lynn who opened the scoring in the first minute, but Downrsquos fleet-footed set of forwards quickly got into gear and created scores for Barryand Darren OrsquoHagan before Liam Connerton brought the sides level again in the sixth minute.Cory Quinn and Lynn swapped scores as did Jonny Flynn and Darren Gallagher to leave the sides in deadlock at - apiece after  minutes.Flynn and Donal OrsquoHare then edged Down two clear as the first half headed for conclusion, but a total of six points were scored in added time.Gallagher and a rsquo from lsquokeeper Paddy Collum made it - apiece, but Kevin McKernan pointed Down back into the lead.

In these opening minutes, BRA did enjoy a sustained period of play in Down High territory, but the home town defence was watertight.Back at the other end Ben Gibson was unlucky not to get points when he was adjudged to have been held up over the line after a period of play close the BRA line.Finally, around  minutes into the half, the pressure turned into points with Joe Charles driving over from short range for an unconverted try.It was the second half before Down High added to their tally.

And that they did.Winger Jonathan Graham was the player to touch down, reaching out to score on the back of some great work in the maul by the dominant Down pack.The conversion attempt from out wide fell short leaving Down with a slender - lead and around six minutes of play left.The closing exchanges were tense with BRA making their way into Down territory on a few occasions, but a few vital pieces of defensive play saved the day, one of these being a crucial turnover from replacement David Corrie.The refereersquos final whistle on the back of a BRA knock-on was greatly welcomed by the large home support.Down have now drawn Bangor Grammar in the semi-finals mdash a side they have both beaten and lost to earlier in the season.Down High School Belfast Royal Academy SUBSIDIARY SHIELD Q FINAL.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/26th February 2020 Legislation.jpg","title":"Legislation welcomed on review of road running  ","story":"A REVIEW of controversial legislation governing road running events has been welcomed by two local politicians.The Department of Infrastructure is to review new rules which place a financial hurdle in the way of running and other sports clubs organising events on public roads which have to be closed, hitting them in the pocket.The new legislation governing the administration work associated with road closures to allow events to take place in safety left organisers potentially paying as much as pound,, but local politicians worked with Newry, Mourne and Down Council in a bid to keep costs to a minimum.Road closure orders for events were previously free, but the new legislation removed this concession and in addition to impacting on running and sports clubs, the new law also applies to community groups organising fun days which require a section of road to be closed.The government departmentrsquos review of the new legislation has been welcomed by South Down MLA Emma Rogan and Mournes councillor Laura Devlin.Ms Rogan said the legislation placed a ldquodisproportionate financial burden on road running events while Cllr Devlin hoped the review agreed by Stormont minister Nichola Mallon will lead to ldquopositive change.Ms Rogan said the new law on road closures meant that a number of road running events cannot keep up with the costs of traffic management.ldquoFewer events are applying for closure permits as a result of this change and, most recently, this affected the Dark Hedges half marathon in Antrim, she explained.The MLA added: ldquoMy Sinn Fein colleagues on the Stormont Infrastructure Committee raised the need for the legislation to be amended so this burden can be lted from organisers, particularly those of smaller events.ldquoThis one size fits all approach for road racing traffic management is impacting on local communities. I welcome a review initiated by the government department to look at the impact of this legislation which needs to be amended so many local events can thrive once again.Cllr Devlin said while there were many positive aspects of the new legislation, such as providing a framework to ensure special events can be held on roads safely and legally, there were a number which have caused great dficulty to charities, running clubs and other groups doing vital work in the community.ldquoWhen this legislation was introduced by a previous minister there was uproar among local community groups, football and running clubs as well as charities who all hosted small road races to raise vital funds for their own causes, she explained.ldquoThis legislation represents another layer of red tape and, for many, resulted in them ceasing such events which was very disappointing for all involved.Cllr Devlin explained that while Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos policy was amended to accommodate local not-for-profit groups, the Stormont legislation remained ldquoflawed.She continued: ldquoI welcome that Minister Mallon has confirmed that she is aware of the concerns around the legislation mdash introduced before her time in office mdash and has committed to reviewing it. This common-sense approach is very welcome.ldquoThe government department has confirmed that the review will commence in the coming months, with Ms Mallon seeking views and asking stakeholders to engage with the process.

However, the securing and locating of a temporary mobile facility for the short-term was welcome.Mr McGrath said that while the building was able to use a generator provided by the contractor for the switching-on of a sustainable Christmas tree provided by the council, the generator did not remain in place.He continued: ldquoI have contacted council and made representations and have been told the relevant committee has discussed and approved the long-term use of a generator which will allow activities to commence soon. This is welcome but not ideal.ldquoApparently, there are some dficulties with the Ministry of Defence in securing the correct wayleave permission toenable electricity to be brought to the building.

Once the wayleave agreement is in place, work to install the connection will begin.A council spokesman said: ldquoNewry, Mourne and Down District Council is unable to comment on the discussions between NIE and the Ministry of Defence, but will continue to liaise with both parties to progress the completion of Ballykinlar Community Centre.ldquoRegarding a temporary supply of electricity, the council is exploring a range of temporary options to supply electricity to the centre and cannot provide a timescale at present..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/26th February 2020 Patrick.jpg","title":"Patrick leads Newcastle team to victory  ","story":"NEWCASTLE AC are the new undisputed NI and Ulster senior cross-country champions.The race ed to Ulster University at Coleraine for the first time in several years on Saturday and Newcastle AC secured the title for the second grime in five years.The club won the title back in  and they were intent on stopping City of Derry from winning for the fourth year in a row.This year again the bus of lsquomaybesrsquo turned into a bus of lsquodefinitesrsquo and  runners and lsquoone hanger onrsquo set off for the north coast, or at least almost to the north coast in typical February wintry conditions.First up were the three women who travelled and it was such a shame that there wasnrsquot a fourth runner, for surely the women would have been destined for senior team medalsthey could only have found one more volunteer con.Shalene McMurray is notorious for her fast starts, but she settled in sensibly into the pack early on.The women had three times of the k lap that included a bit of climbing along with mud, mud and more mud mdash hardly any firm going on the course at all plus a gale that would cut anyone in two mdash tough conditions where only the tough would prevail.Emma Mitchell, these days running for Clonlfe Harriers, pulled away and won with relative ease in :.

Archaeologists and conservation architects within the department worked together to design a historically appropriate roof.What has been achieved is an outstanding piece of architecture that safeguards this important and historic place.“The project has been designed to be sustainable on many levels. The materials used are durable, traditional materials. The oak used for the roof is from a sustainable source.”The minister added:“Heritage forms a key component of our tourism economy.

We hope that our work will become part of the history of Carrickfergus, and that people visiting the castle will enjoy this beautul structure for years –not centuries – to come.”Welcoming this phase of the works, the Mayor of Mid and East Antrim, Councillor Maureen Morrow, said: “Over the past year we have seen the bustle of activity on this project around the castle, and the public outreach work for the project captured people’s imaginations far and wide.

Some politicians began to converge on a stupid solution: privatising MOT tests to save public cash.  \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...If that happened, then instead of going to government-run test centres, a car owner would go to a garage to get the road worthiness tests done, as happens in England and Wales. It is a very bad idea.It would be privatising a sphere of public le where we should instead keep out any hint of profit.Inevitably, garages that issue MOT certicates have a vested financial interest in telling vehicle owners they need to get work done.Most car owners, like most computer owners or most homeowners,know nothing about the mechanics of cars . So when they are told something needs to be done to their carand that it will cost £X, they can only stand blinking at the person who is telling them so, because they do not have the expertise to know better.In Great Britain there are said to be safeguards against this commercial incentive on the part of MOT garages to tell you that you need work done . I make two observations in response. The first is an anecdote. The only time I needed an MOT in England, in the s, I was told by an MOT approved garage in north London that I needed to spend hundreds of pounds on something that, in the end, after further research, I didn’t need done at all.The second is a startling statistic that this newspaper carried on the front page some years ago.In Great Britain, where cars were then first testedafter three years on road that initial MOT was failed by .% of cars.In Northern Ireland, where cars are first tested after four years, the initial failure rate was a mere .%.Cars in the Province had a far higher pass rate than newer cars in Great Britain, despite the NI cars having a full extra year of usage and wear and tear than the GB ones.Neil Greig, of the Institute of Advanced Motorists, told the News Letter: “This clearly shows there is something wrong with the system in Great Britain. It is failing cars at three years old that should be passed. The suspicion is that it is to get garages business.“The system is supposed to be tightly controlled, but there are still legions of stories about people going to a garage and feeling that they have been ripped off.”It would be madness to introduce that system into NI, replacing our rigorously impartial system, but some voices are calling for it due to the current MOT delays. Stormont, which loves easy solutions, could axe our MOT centres.For many years I have driven old but quality cars, including a Toyota and Honda. I find it a cost effective way to run a reliable car.Some years ago, I asked an NI garage near where I then worked to tell me what it needed for MOT. They said it needed A, B, C, D, E done, cost £. I didn’t have time to get a second opinion, said fine, and booked it in. But before I got the work done I was driving past a garage in Co Down that specialised in some of the things I was told I needed, so I stopped and said: “I’m due MOT, I think the car is OK butyou could just check A, B, C, D, E.” The garage said A. B and C need done, not D and E. The estimated bill for the work plummeted. Baffled, I went to a trye-brake outfit and asked them to assess A, B, C. They said only A, B need done. The total bill was only £, not £, so I cancelled the booking at the first garage, got the basic work done, booked an MOT, and passed.This is not to imply that garages are fraudulent. They might, for example, be doing what sales folk call ‘selling up’ and advising you to get work done earlier than needed.But getting second quotations is too time consuming, so latterly prior to an MOT I have just fixed basics – tyres, lights and brakes— then put the car through to seeit passes.The vehicle is being assessed by an impartial adjudicator who has no vested interest in telling you whether or not it is roadworthy. If it fails thenyou pay a re-test fee, which helps fund the system.It is a good system, that we should keep.• Ben Lowryis News Letter deputy editor• Ben Lowry: There will be an internal UK border in the Irish Sea, whatever Michael Gove says"},{"url":null,"title":"it almost norm now be older dad downing street ","story":"Sam McBride: If Sinn Féin waits for unionists to help plan Irish unity, it may wait a long timeQUB Students Union President in row over IRA Facebook postsNewsLatestTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthOpinionPeopleRead ThisSportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats OnThings To DoArts and EntertainmentNightleRetroLestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensNewsOpinionIt is almost the norm now to be an older dad in Downing StreetIt is not without precedent for a prime minister to become a father while still in Downing Street, but it is a rare event.By The NewsroomMonday, nd March , : am\"\"News Letter editorialOr, more accurately, it was a rare event.Boris Johnson will become the fourth premier to have a child in more than  years, yet he is the third in recent years.Both Tony Blair and David Cameron had a child while they were still prime minister.

Who they are will have a real influence on Welsh Labourrsquos prospects in  and beyond. We are the most successful part of the UK Labour family over the last decade in terms of winning elections and running a national government. However, that cannot be taken for granted. An unpopular UK leader could make our task much harder next May.The first and most important attribute the next UK leader must have is the ability to fulfil the mission of our party - to become a party of government again across the UK, not just a party of protest. I want someone who can implement our labour values in government, not just talk about them.That requires some honesty about why we took such a beating at the general election, together with the willingness and strength to do something about it. Offering more of the same would be a betrayal of people who need a UK Labour government and will condemn the UK [or what is left of it] to a further decade of the Tories.We didnrsquot get hammered in  for one reason alone - there were a number of them. Agreeing to the election in the first place when we plainly were not prepared. Agreeing to an election certain to be dominated by Brexit. Our vacillation on Brexit when people wanted certainty and leadership. The factional infighting. The demonisation of the last UK Labour government, asthat would encourage people to vote for us. I grew up with  Tory years in power and I know that things really did get better following Labourrsquos victory in .An overloaded manesto with some popular policies but without a key central message. A costed manesto that then had a huge extra spending pledge added to it, meaning that people didnrsquot believe that we were serious or credible one even the policies they liked. A staggeringly inept UK campaign that wasted the amazing dedication of our volunteers, prepared to go out in the cold and rain to campaign. Our abject failure on anti-Semitism. This and much more.Many people recognised that Boris Johnson is a dishonest man who is completely out of touch with most peoplersquos lives. Lots of people still voted for him or refused to vote Labour because they could not trust and support us. Our own people - long term Labour voters - struggled to support us. Our leader was undeniably part of the reason why. Blaming our defeat solely on the mainstream media or whichever side of the Brexit ide we favour isnt honest and will not help us to win in the future.I donrsquot much care whether someone claims they are from the left, soft left, centre or old right of the Labour Party. We all have a stake in our party and the countries of the UK. These are serious times and we need a serious figure who can nail the Tories and the clown in number ten.Irsquove been interested in what Lisa Nandy has to say and believe that Lisa and many other figures have a key role to play in rebuilding our party ndash first as a credible opposition, then as a credible alternative government at the next UK General Election.However, I think the person best placed to win the argument, and even more importantly to help us win an election, is Keir Starmer. Itrsquos not the protesting, or the taking part that counts. Itrsquos the winning and the decisions you get to make in government that can change peoplesrsquo lives and change the country for the better. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

There are things being said by many that we need to listen to.But, after speaking to many of the candidates personally, and asking them all tough questions - I am backing Keir Starmer for Leader. I think hersquos got what it takes to hold this government immediately and robustly to account to build a team of all the talents and crucially that he has the vision, ideas and credibility to win again.Keir joined me on the streets of Penarth speaking to voters and local businesses during the election campaign ndash and it was clear by the warmth of the reception he received that he is someone who has the immediate credibility and credentials to be our future prime minister, and would work in partnership with Welsh Labour.He has crucial experience of public service and confronting powerful vested interests for the good of the country. He acted to prosecute MPs who had abused expenses and Murdoch journalists in the phone-hacking scandal when he was Director of Public Prosecutions.We need to win back these voters that we lost in the last general election. It was heart-breaking on election night, to see Labour lose places like Wrexham and Bridgend.The UK Labour Party must get back to being a party that votersrsquo can trust.

The Minister will be aware of incidents in my own community. Why have the Government not yet proscribed these organisations, and what steps will they take to review the situation urgently And I asked Home Office ministers why we should trust them over deportation flights when there are serious unresolved concerns about the Windrush scandal and wider detention and deportation policies.I said: ldquoThe Minister is asking us to trust a Department and system that have had repeated and costly failures.

Natural Resources Wales and the Welsh Assembly should not ignore the issue this time around.Responding to public concerns about the new plans, a spokesman for the Welsh Government said: ldquoIf EDF Energy submits a formal application, Natural Resources Wales will carry out a thorough assessment of the proposed activity before making a determination, having regard to the need to protect the environment and human health, as required by the Marine and Coastal Access Act .ldquoI know many constituents are very worried, said Stephen Doughty MP for Cardf South and Penarth.ldquoWe shouldnrsquot be a dumping ground for others, and I will continue to raise concerns on behalf of residents and report back any information I receive.To comment on the proposed sample plan, visit NRWrsquos consultation page before Wednesday, March  at: naturalresources.wales permits-and-permissions permit-applications-consultations-and-decisions current-consultations-marine-licence-applicantions hinkley-point-c-sediment-sampling-plan-sp  langen article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It was Captain Robertrsquos who did it.Mr Davies spent time conducting research in Bilbao, Durango, Gernika, and Alicante where he consulted Spanish historians and met with descendants of those involved in the civil war.Outwitting Franco: The Welsh Maritime Heroes of the Spanish Civil War can be purchased on Amazon for pound in paperback.Alternatively, it can be purchased digitally for pound on Kindle. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Of those who received the benefit,  per cent were unemployed.Universal Credit began in  and has been gradually rolled out across the country. It was designed to simply the benefits system for working age people by merging six separate benefits into one payment.But features such as the -week wait, the -child limit and the benefits cap, as well as public spending cuts, have been associated with a rise in rent arrears, food bank usage and child poverty.Local homelessness charity, Llamau, has expressed concern for young people who are being enrolled on the scheme.Joe Payne, head of vale services and family mediation for Llamau, said: ldquoPrior to the introduction of Universal Credit, a young person may have claimed Job Seekers Allowance or Employment Support Allowance but this is no longer an option.ldquoUndoubtedly, the five week waiting time and a very low National Minimum Wage for people under  is going to cause young people untold hardship and in a lot of cases, spiralling debt.A Department for Work and Pension spokesman said the increase in  to -year olds claiming Universal Credit is lsquoin line with expectationsrsquo as it has been rolled out to every job centre.Jane Hutt, AM for the Vale of Glamorgan, said: ldquoI am concerned at the rise in the number of claimants, particularly young people, who need to access Universal Credit.ldquoCare leavers in particular are being disadvantaged by the changes. I do not believe the concerns that have been raised by claimants, by employers and by organisations advising and supporting people affected, including those who are in employment, have been addressed and I will continue to raise them on behalf of my constituents.The government has committed to ending a four-year benefit freeze in April this year, meaning millions of people will see their payments rise by the same rate as inflation.Councillor Kathryn McCaffer, Vale of Glamorgan Council youth champion, said: ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council is working with a range of partners to mitigate any adverse impacts and offer a iety of support to young people in financial dficulties. Those classed as Not in Education, Employment or Trainingcan access the Inspire  Work programme, which provides financial help to pay for the likes of work clothes, training and travel costs.ldquoVulnerable tenants are protected from debt through the direct payments system. Currently around  per cent of tenants have this system in place, which allows a portion of Universal Credit payments to be made directly to the council to cover rent.ldquoThis year, the council has been able to secure over pound, of additional income for tenants by helping them secure backdated claims, ensuring the correct benefits are being received, assisting with appeals, and helping secure the best tarfs for utilities. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

How do those people then stay, snuggled in snoozy paradise for hour upon hour until their alarm gives them a nudge and they arise rested and ready for a new day  I have never been a good sleeper, even as a child. If anything at all is playing on my mind, I never lose my appetite, but I will lose slumber. I have friends who similarly suffer. I use the word suffer quite deliberately, because lying there in the dark at am it can feel like everyone  is snuffling softly but for the wide-awake person, it can feel horrendous. As the time ticks closer to the alarm and still sleep will not come, it can feel quite anxiety-inducing and so the vicious circle whizzes, fizzes and flies through your brain making sleep feel further and further away.But, as this is a lelong way of living for me and I am overwhelmingly a lsquocrack on kinda womanrsquo, I have developed ways to use this time effectively. I listen to podcasts, and have learned about biohacking, how broccoli defends itself and the many twists and turns of the Brexit negotiations whilst the street snoozes. I catch up with messages . I also think a lot. I just lay there in the dark and puzzle though story ideas, events from the day and issues facing friends, family and myself. In a twisted way, this time and opportunity has become quite precious to me. I donrsquot know when  in the day Irsquod have the time and space to just ponder, muse, consider and percolate. It is during this time that I have considered my earlier point about jealousy.

Rather than adhering to a nationally prescribed learning program, schools and practitioners will be able to make decisions that best meet the needs of specic learners.As well as contributing to the framework, St Josephrsquos has also introduced their own bespoke curriculum, and is one of only  Curriculum Innovation Schools in Wales.The St Josephrsquos curriculum is based on findings in child development and cognitive science, with staff undertaking extensive learning on how childrenrsquos bodies and minds develop.Lessons have been designed to enhance pupilsrsquo personal, social and physical development, whilst also providing a detailed knowledge and understanding of the world, both past and present.The school has also benefitted from signicant on-site works, including the refurbishment of all classrooms, a complete reconfiguration of the Foundation Phase learning spaces and a state of the art new-build Nursery.Staff regularly deliver learning experiences outside of the classroom, as the schoolrsquos grounds include a playing field, wooded area, pond, orchard, wildflower meadow and polytunnel.The implementation of the schoolrsquos ambitious curriculum has seen standards improve year on year. Last yearrsquos National Reading Tests saw the average child in St Josephrsquos score within the top  percent of the country, with similarly high standards achieved in mathematics.Headteacher, Gareth Rein said: ldquoWersquore extremely proud of our achievements at St Josephrsquos. Everything we do is based on the best available research and is designed to help each inidual child thrive.Cabinet Member for Education and Regeneration, Councillor Lis Burnett, said: ldquoThe new Curriculum for Wales is inspiring schools to take a more holistic approach toward learning. It encourages them to focus more on how and why the curriculum is being delivered, rather than delivering specic content and academic results.ldquoSt Josephrsquos have done a brilliant job in helping craft this approach, and in turn have seen their own curriculum and learning practices blossom.St Josephrsquos will be hosting an open day on Wednesday March .

The short list of potential locations for e-bike stations includes Penarth Town Centre, Cogan Train Centre, Penarth Train Station, Llandough Hospital, The Esplanade, Cosmeston Country Park, Cardf Bay Barrage, and Pont-y-Werin Bridge.The scheme hopes to encourage people to switch from their daily car journey to e-bikes, saving on average g of CO for every  kilometre travelled.The average round trip from Penarth to Cardf is km, which would save ,g of COused daily.Nextbike Managing Director, Krysia Solheim, said the Penarth scheme would be great for those who commute into the capital.ldquoWe know from our research that a lot of commuters already cycle from Penarth into Cardf, said Ms Solheim.ldquoE-bikes will make that journey easier and quicker than ever before, which will hopefully persuade more people to switch from four wheels to two on a daily basis. Picking up an e-bike instead of jumping in the car is also a great way for people to reduce their own personal carbon footprints to help our communities tackle climate change.ldquoPenarth will play an important part in leading the bike share revolution in Wales - itrsquos an exciting time - and we want the community to be as involved as possible.\"Councillor Peter King, Cabinet Member for Neighbourhood Services and Transport, said: ldquoFeedback from the Nextbike consultation was overwhelmingly positive, with many residents hoping to see the expansion of the scheme to the wider Vale.ldquoHaving declared a climate emergency last year, and having recently proposed a pound.m investment into tackling environmental issues, the Nextbike scheme will be a leading example of our commitment to tackling climate change and improving the wellbeing of our residents.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work.

With their parents Sam and Christina , they lived in Florence Court, Edenderry. A fth brother Bertie, tragically died at a young age.The four brothers shared an unbreakable bond centred chiefly around football. They played together for The Church Lads Brigade and were members of the Edenderry United Team which won the McKinney Cup in . Joe went on to play for three seasons for BanbridgeTown and during these seasons the team was unbeaten. Indeed, Joe had a trial for an Under  Intermediate Team.In his mid s he stood in for an absent member of a rugby team and ended up as a scrum half and team captain. He was a long associate of Chambers’ Park Rugby and wore his Club blazer with immense pride.Joe married Pearl Forde in  andever there was a ‘marriage made in heaven’ this was it.They adored each other and ‘sparred’ with one another as only true soulmates can. They had one adored daughter, Elizabeth, who tragically died aged  in  a sorrow Joe and Pearl bore in quiet faith. Le was never the same for Joe after his beloved Pearl died on  February .Joe, as with all his siblings, was raised in a Christian home and infused with a quiet yet unbending Christian faith. His willingness to bear the burdens of others and his desire to aid his fellow man manested itself in his role as a trade union shop stewart. His integrity and forthrightness earned respect and in most of his workplaces he was both foreman and shop steward. Physically tough he relied upon God in times of sorrow for the inner strength which toughness cannot supply.He was also, with his brothers, a member of Seagoe Church Lads Brigade Pipe Band and the quartet of three pipers and a drummer often practiced in the front room of their family home.Joe also thoroughly enjoyed the Lambeg Drums and Saturday nights in his mid to latter years were spent at ious drumming competitions. Joe was employed in ious weaving factories, one of which was Brookfield Mill in Banbridge and he was heartbroken when it closed down.Pearl and Joe and Elizabeth enjoyed many seasons at their caravan in Kilkeel and Saturday nights were taken up with playing pool with his good friend Sinclair Brown. Later they upgraded to a bigger caravan and continued their trips until Pearl’s death.Joe lived all his le in Edenderry and much of his married le in the house beside his parents in Watson Street.In his latter years after Pearl’s death Joe had a very structured schedule. A daily trip up the town included first stop Winnie’s Newsagent in Woodhouse Street for his paper, which had to be rolled up and secured with an elastic band. Next visit was to Gaynor’s Cafe in Church Lane where the staff didn’t even need to ask what Joe’s order was but once his foot crossed the door they had already started preparing it. His night time routine included a walk up around Portadown. But when family became concerned for his safety, he assured them that nobody would touch him and that he always carried his walking stick anyhow.As an avid Edenderry man, Joe was heavily involved in the generational annual construction of Edenderry arch. Mr Roney’s funeral was on Monday February  in Seagoe Parish Church following by interment in Seagoe Cemetery.\"\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bGbJRg bZbGUI\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-gtfDJT hQGsjX\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bGbJRg bZbGUI\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-gtfDJT hQGsjX\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportWhats OnLestyleMore from Portadown TimesAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-bYSBpT sc-elJkPf kHpvMx\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherEducationBusinessPoliticsHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessFollow us    "},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/EHP_20191205_4696_web.jpg","title":"pulse pr a decade in northern ireland communications","story":"Posted on Friday  January  by Ulster Business Pulse PR’s Grainne McGarvey sits down with Ulster Business at the Fitzwilliam Hotel in Belfast to chat about marking  years in business amid an evolving media landscape, growing from strong entrepreneurial family roots and the next step in her company’s journey A bold decision a decade ago to go out on her own and establish Pulse PR has seen Grainne McGarvey work with a range of clients to help sell their message to a wider audience. In the last few years Pulse PR has worked with clients include Applegreen, during the roll-out of its first stores in Northern Ireland, jewellery retailer Argento that has over  high street stores in Ireland and one of Ireland’s most iconic gt wear brands, Belleek. And with a business spirit which has helped take root due to her father’s own entrepreneurial background, Grainne’s developed her own firm over the last  years – growing with the changing media landscape, creating communications and marketing strategies, working with tech start-ups from the ground up and building on strong media relationships. “For seven years I had worked with PR agencies and businesses such as Barclays, Tayto and Tesco. I was approaching  and I decided it was now or never,” she told Ulster Business. Networking at Down Royal Racecourse with a pocket full of business cards saw her leave with three clients, and from that, the business was born. Although Pulse PR was initially centred around work with public relations and press, Grainne now works with a lot of start-ups, particularly those within tech – her business is also based at Catalyst, formerly the Northern Ireland Science Park, which is the largest technology park here. One of those she’s now working closely with is IRP Commerce – a £m turnover software development company which made it on to Deloitte’s Technology Fast  list of high growth technology companies seven times. “That relationship started eight years ago with a press release, and now I work with them to target retailers, manufacturers and distributors across the UK, promoting its e-commerce  at national conferences and building strategic relationships with key players in the e-commerce industry. When I started it was very traditional PR, and dealing with newspapers and magazines. Now, it’s also grown further into the digital sphere with online PR, blogging and video testimonials. “I’ve seen a big sht in how my time is spent from when I started  years ago. Although clients still value print coverage, there is definitely a demand to create engaging campaigns for social media. “Because of how the world is changing, I have had to ersy as well. It’s about being flexible and realising the developing trends, and trying to adapt. I’ve always been comfortable in front of the camera or with a microphone in my hand so turned this into a business opportunity to host events, commentate on radio or host  at tech conferences – there is an under-representation of women in this sector so it’s a gap I believe I fill.” As a self-employed businesswoman, Grainne extends her reach with clients by collaborating with freelance photographers, designers and videographers. “You have to get results for your clients. I purposely keep my client list manageable so I’m not competing against myself and I can broaden the scope of activity I do for them,” she says. Grainne also works with Catalyst on its Springboard programme as a marketing domain expert, giving start-up companies assistance when they are bringing their product to market. She says most of her clients come through referrals from other companies she’s been involved with. “Referrals are great as it means I’ve done a good job for the person referring me. I also find a lot of work comes from people I have previously worked with or went to school with. Northern Ireland is known for having two degrees of separation – this also applies in the business world.” She’s also been working with the Ulster Farmers’ Union this year to help promote the organisation’s Open Farm Weekend. It’s an initiative, sponsored by Bank of Ireland UK, to allow members of the public to pay a visit to a farm for the first time. “This is a new sector for me, but the principles are the same – find out the end user and then apply the right marketing tools to engage with them. “It’s about fitting in with a company and how that business thinks – being adaptable and working out what they want, and trying to help them grow. It’s about presenting a strong and clear message, developing strong media contacts and also working across digital and print media to boost reach.” In  years, the media and PR landscape has evolved, including how information is consumed. “But I’m still a firm believer in knowing the basics,” she says. “It’s about having the experience and the education to be able to do it. After my degree and Master’s, I studied to gain additional post-graduate qualications from the Chartered Institute of Marketing. I’m a firm believer in le-long learning. Too many people starting in the industry think all the need is a smartphone and an Instagram account. “It’s competitive, but there’s always enough business for everyone out there. You really just need a few clients and then you turn your focus to them, as well as working with others as and when they come. A few projects naturally ended last year so I’ll be expanding my client list in the coming months. It’s always exciting to start with a new company or entrepreneur. “It’s about being flexible and being aware of what is going on with your clients, and being proactive. Being a sole-trader means you are flexible and can work closely with companies, either in their office or remotely as an extended member of their marketing team. I have often thought about employing more staff, but I believe clients want to see me working on their account, rather than meeting me at the pitch and then being passed over to a junior member of staff. “There’s a great satisfaction in helping an innovative small business, which is set for bigger things, and working alongside them in getting their message out there, building, growing and creating jobs. You really want to work with them and help build their business. “It’s about building the relationships and contacts, and that’s something you can’t teach. People buy from people and I believe one of the reasons I have kept many of the same clients for  years is because I always go the extra mile and am true to my word.” Grainne’s desire  years ago to go it alone with Pulse PR is something she says is very much part of the family story. “My father Malachy is an entrepreneur, a mechanic by trade, but he’s always been able to turn his hand to everything,” she says. My sister Orla was also self-employed as a pharmacist. I’ve been brought up in that environment and we’ve always had support and a ‘can do’ attitude from our mother Geraldine. I had a baby, Gabriel, four months ago but didn’t get the option to take maternity leave. This is the downside of being self-employed, but the flipside means I can work from home when I need to.” As for the next  years, Grainne says it’s about trying to give something back, using her skills to help those who have little or no experience in knowing how to bring their message and products to the fore. “I’m still as passionate about business as I was  years ago. I’m excited to see how I can continue to use my skills to add value to clients to ensure their message and their voice is heard.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail_MM-Photo-1.jpg","title":"manufacturing month ni to showcase strength of sector","story":"Posted on Tuesday  January  by Ulster Business Economy Minister Diane Doods with Manufacturing NIs Stephen Kelly Northern Ireland’s burgeoning manufacturing sector will be showcased as part of a major initiative to highlight the strength and excellence of the industry here.

The revamp is part of the Department of Finance’s Reval – which is a reassessment of the rates system which businesses pay. While still a draft schedule of values, each council will also have to apply its own regional rate, based on the new proposed figures.“The Cathedral Quarter isn’t just about eating and drinking,” Gareth Neill, BID manager, Destination CQ told Ulster Business.“We have a vibrant ecosystem of arts and culture and fantastic built heritage that makes this area stand out, hospitality plays an integral part to the quality of le in this part of Belfast – for a city to be striving to attract new residents, increase our tourism offer these are crucial to the city’s success. “We are concerned about that the potential knock-on effects to the affected business owners and there’s a very real possibility it will have an impact on the price of a pint to the people who come to socialise in Cathedral Quarter. The knock-on effect of outdated methodology for calculation of rates on licensed premiseshas a potentially crippling effect on jobs and character of this area.”A spokesman for Land  Property Services said: “In Northern Ireland, nearly % of pubs will have no change or a decrease in their Net Annual Value .“Any business rate payer who thinks their new valuation may be incorrect, can contact LPS to arrange an informal review and supply any relevant information before the new valuation list comes into force on  April .”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/mip1.jpg","title":"mipim taking belfast to the world","story":"Posted on Friday  January  by Ulster Business Joe ONeill and Suzanne Wylie Belfast Harbour boss Joe O’Neill will help lead a private and public sector delegation to MIPIM – the world’s biggest commercial property event – as chairman of the taskforce. He chats to John Mulgrew about the big announcements, fighting off the competition and attracting a global giant to Northern Ireland For Joe O’Neill and the wider delegation heading to potentially warmer climates, the proposition of selling the city and wider region to major investors has gotten easier.In the five years since Belfast ed to MIPIM – an event which sees tens of thousands descend on Cannes in France for four days of real estate and development – the private and public team, and taskforce, have developed a “strong ” in which to sell the city and Northern Ireland, with hopes of attracting a big name insurance or tech firm on the list.“MIPIM is a great  for the promotion of city-wide initiatives, and demonstrating to investors and to occupiers the growth potential in the city, and the opportunities for them and that the key stakeholders are all aligned behind an appropriate growth agenda,” Joe says.“You see dferent sizes and scales of stands out there – you see some really ambitious stands and proposed developments, so Belfast has to see it’s entry point into that. Belfast first and foremost will be competing against peer group cities within the UK… but then it is a worldwide show, so you will be competing against other cities.”Belfast is leading a major delegation this year, and will also be joined by representatives from other Northern Ireland councils, including those that are part of the Belfast Region City Deal, such as Mid  East Antrim. That deal is also going to be a focus for announcements and development, during the event.This year’s delegation will be led by a host of top private sector developers in Northern Ireland, alongside Belfast City Council and organisations such as Belfast Harbour. That includes Bywater, Wirefox, Titanic Quarter, Tribeca, McAleer  Rushe and Graham Group, along with the two universities and others working within related fields from law, professional services and the supply chain.For Joe and the delegation, MIPIM represents an opportunity to announce some of Belfast and Northern Ireland’s wider major new infrastructure and commercial plans. Previous visits have included the announcement of major offices schemes, hotels and apartment developments.“We will have a series of announcements – some of those announcements will be new, and some will be progress, and demonstrating to investors or occupiers that progress has been madeit’s a multi-year scheme, to show we are delivering.“… we have new projects coming through the pipeline in ious sectors. This year we are looking at launching schemes around digital innovation. That aligns with one of the themes in the Belfast Region City Deal, for the city and councils in the deal. We have a particular focus on cyber-security as an investment and operating location – particular those from the US.”Joe says that would be in addition to the already well-established cyber-security development at Catalyst in the Titanic Quarter, and that new names are coming in to the marketplace creating a “cluster” around the sector, and setting up Belfast and beyond as a new global hub.“We are looking at announcing some details around the Belfast-Dublin-London corridor,” Joe says.“As an economic corridor, or triangle. Post-Brexit, there are clear synergies in developing a proposition where companies can avail of the three locationsthey are looking at a global footprint, and see advantages to locations in three cities.”The issue of increasing connectivity between Belfast and Dublin also remains high on the list – improving the speed and frequency, and making developers aware of the new Belfast Transport Hub, which will transform the city’s rail and bus connectivity when complete.For Belfast Harbour, it’s also bringing the expansion of its already successful film studios to MIPIM, amid further plans to grow and develop the hub to attract big names and become the largest of its kind outside London.“We will be revealing more of our expansion plans, which is being supported by NI Screen,” Joe said. Some of those delivering their own presentations to potential investors will include the Harbour, Belfast City Council, Catalyst and the universities. “We are out looking around, when we are there, at what dferent cities are doing – seeing whether something works well, and looking at our competitive advantage in that area.”As for the strengths and attraction for potential investors, Joe says: “Skills, talent and technology are very much at the fore. Agility as a small region and to be able to respond, and seeing that team Belfast is there and that we are aligned with a particular project. It doesn’t have to be taken back home and introduced to someone .“There is the emergence of Belfast as an attractive city – investment opening up, and people are always looking at new markets. “Part of the initial roll-out when I took on the chair of MIPIM, the role was to go around to ask those who were on board previously to ask about it,it had changed. Everyone noticed and recognised considerablechange over the last four years. “We were pioneering and establishing ourselves four years ago, now they felt we were very much a concerted and effective operating team… the collective was a powerful message, and having  or lunches involving all of the stakeholders at one time. It’s a really strong  to take on the next chapter.”So, for Joe and the rest of the MIPIM delegation, what would be considered a major goal or success on the back of the visit to the commercial property show in March  “A particular focus this year is to attract key institutional investors – the big insurance companies for example. That’s a chicken and egg situation… you need to have product, to have product you have to show that you have occupiers and a steady revenue stream. “What we have been able to say to the investment market is ‘we have product and we now have sustainable occupation coming through… now it feels like the right time for you as an investor, to come in, and to support further investment’.”Asked whether replicating the successes of our neighbours in Dublin in attracting tech giants such as Apple, Facebook and Google is also on the cards, Joe says: “Something like that, or a major investor. For them to do that – a technology or an investment company – they need to see that the public, private and third-tier sectors are all collaborating together to make an effective market, and I think we are good at doing that now.”And the timing couldn’t be better for the delegation – now able to go in with a clear mandate and message with the restoration of the Executive and ato day-to-day power-sharing politics.“The positive thing for us is with the government and secondly, somearound Brexit… it takes those two challenging issues off the table.” πView all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/johnm1.jpg","title":"companies must act quickly on new ir legislation reforms","story":"Posted on Monday February  by Ulster Business At the start of this year the government launched a review into the changes to IR legislation which will affect medium and large private sector organisations and have far-reaching impacts on the way they engage with non-permanent workers, writes John Moore, managing director, Hays NI.The timeframe between the review and the reforms coming into effect in April is shorter than many would have liked but with the reforms now on the horizon, companies need to act, particularly those in sectors such as technology, construction and finance where use of contractors operating as personal services companiesis common. At a basic level, the reforms to IR legislation sht the responsibility of determining the tax status of personal services company workers to the company that engages them where previously they could self-certy. The original rules required the freelance contractor to determine their tax status, but HMRC believed non-compliance was common.Now,a person’s assignment falls outside of IR legislation, they are deemed to be self-employed, so gross payment will be made to the PSC. Butthe assignment falls inside of IR, the professional should be treated as an employee, applying PAYE and NIC deductions from their payment. In simple terms, the tax arrangements for contractors are changing so that they won’t get such a good dealthey can’t demonstrate their work is out of scope and employers will have to pay more for using and keeping what were previously non-payroll workers.This will have a big effect on how people choose to work and who they choose to work for, not to mention how organisations plan and budget. An organisation’s policy towards contractors will affect how attractive they are to freelancers. But on the other side we’ve already seen some risk averse companies adopt a blanket ban on freelancers just to be safe – meaning they are missing out on skilled professionals they need to deliver projects.In Northern Ireland, as where, it’s likely the IR reforms will hit technology hardest, but the effects could be wide ranging across roles in construction, project management and finance.We’ve heard anecdotal evidence of IT contractors leaving the big banks and starting to view early stage tech companies with less than  employees more favourably because they fall outside the scope of the legislation. When similar legislation was introduced in the public sector in , hundreds of highly skilled contractors left roles to join organisations who were prepared, often leading to projects being scrapped. Now the private sector is catching up, preparation is key and anyone who hasn’t done a review of what it means for their capacity should do so urgently. A Hays survey showed % of private sector firms expect cost increases when IR reforms come into effect, % expect to lose key talent and % think it will be harder to bring in non-permanent workers. A third of organisations surveyed were completely unaware of the reforms – a big concern given how tight the labour market is.So, first you need to determine whether assignments are inside or outside of IR. You need to have full visibility of all workers your organisation engages who are paid via agencies and consultancies as well as knowledge of how they are paid. You will also need to have the expertise to determine the tax status of each assignment. When you know that you can then start communicating with freelance workers, renegotiating working arrangements, standardising onboarding procedures and decidingany specialist skills need to be brought in house to get projects over the line.If you expect to use a high volume of temporary workers in , outsourcing your temporary worker provision through a managed services programme could be an option, as an expert would carry out accurate assessments for every temporary worker placed with you.Whatever stage you are at, don’t ignore IR. It’s coming and you need to understand it.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/EHP_20200109_-3489_web.jpg","title":"nie networks keeping the lights on and a focus on the future of power","story":"Posted on Thursday February  by Ulster Business Paul Stapleton, managing director of NIE Networks, sits down with Ulster Business to chat about the future of energy here, huge investment across Northern Ireland and the responsibility of keeping the lights on for almost two million people In the last three decades, Paul Stapleton has already seen signicant sweeping changes across the energy industry, and is now helping lead the charge towards a carbon neutral economy with an ever-increasing focus on green power.He is now at the helm of NIE Networks – an organisation responsible for the electricity network here, delivering reliable power to , businesses, homes and farms right across Northern Ireland.“Our role is to provide a safe and reliable network – keeping the lights on  ,  days a year,” Paul told Ulster Business.And part of that responsibility and ability to ensure strong and reliable electricity flow is an investment of around £m each year, working towards a  ‘net zero’ carbon emissions target and embracing the key changes and evolution in power here.“Many dferent players need to work together to ensure the electricity system of the future can achieve what it needs to achieve in terms of zero carbon and remaining economically efficient, and reliable, at the same time,” he says.“We are the custodians of the electricity network – everything between where power is generated and up to and including the meter in your home or business.“Our network is connected to , customers – that’s every home, every farm, every business, and every organisation in NI. It’s a regulated utility business, and commercially, everything is regulated by the Utility Regulator.”Paul’s been in the energy industry for his entire working le. The Limerick man joined ESB in  where he held a number of senior management positions, before taking up his current role in May .He’s taken over NIE Networks as it’s hitting record performance targets, with those likely to improve further still this year.“The network is in as good as condition as it ever was, and we are giving a good service in terms of continuity of supply. “In , we achieved a ‘customer minutes lost’ average of  minutes, which is the lowest in our history. But we will continue to look at improving further. Where faults do occur, % are fixed within three hours and % within less than  hours. “We operate in business cycles around regulatory price controls. We are now just over two years into a six year price control. “There has been some downsizing, cost-reduction and efficiencies, while we are gearing up to deliver a signicant capital investment programme. We are investing more than £m a year in upgrading, refurbishing and maintaining the network.“The focus in present terms is about delivering for today and looking to enhance our services to customers.”But it’s the future of NIE Networks, power generation, and a new Strategic Energy Framework, which will become the focus for Paul and his team in the coming years.“A lot of my focus is about planning for the future, as well as the day-to-day,” he says. “The longer term horizon is now looking out to ,” he says. “The UK Government has enshrined in legislation the target that the economy will be entirely carbon neutral.”For Northern Ireland, it’s already broken recent records in terms of the move towards green energy. “There is a huge amount to be done and it’s a very challenging target,” he says.“It’s a huge change and transition. But I think all the scientic evidence regarding climate change suggests it has to be done, and maybe has to be done sooner.“The headline target was that we would hit % from renewable sources by . We actually achieved that target and are now at %. That is very signicant progress. It puts us ahead of GB and the Republic of Ireland.”NIE Networks has invested around £m in the network to facilitate this generation. In the last few years the number of power generators connecting to the network has grown to ,, whereas two decades ago it was reliant on the three main power stations here.“The bigger challenge is how do we use that green energy to displace carbon  That brings in transport and heat, and that’s something where the electricity sector will play an important role.“As we all start adopting electric vehicles, as I think we all will in the next decade, we have to make sure people have the ability to charge them, at home and in public spaces. It’s our role to connect the chargers and to make sure we have a network which has the capability to meet the demands.”But Paul says there’s signicant positivity out there, with a younger generation in Northern Ireland and throughout the world embracing the small everyday changes that have to be made in order to tackle an international problem.“We are in the policy framing stage and  is going to be key. There is a call for evidence now from the Department for the Economy to inform the development of a new Energy Strategy for Northern Ireland and I would encourage anyone who has any interest in energy or climate change to contribute into that.“Hopefully that will lead to the development of clear policy initiatives, targets and measures for Northern Ireland and that will set the context for the market to respond.“I think there is economic opportunity for Northern Ireland, but there will be some downsides. We need to minimise the downsides and maximise the opportunities.”NIE Networks is currently examining its role in the future energy market in Northern Ireland. That includes looking at how it can make the distribution network more open and accessible in order to allow burgeoning technologies, such as battery storage, heat pumps and electric vehicles, to be introduced and operate in a sustainable way.“We see our role as evolving. Historically, we were somewhat passive – we provided an infrastructure which shipped electricity from A to B. Now, we need to be much more proactive and we are part of an overall system.”That includes a role in balancing when green energy is available and when it is required and in high demand on the distribution system. “All of that needs a more connected and dynamic distribution system – rather than just being seen as a physical infrastructure,” Paul says.“We need private investment and developers who are willing to invest in new solutions, whether it’s wind, solar, electric vehicle charging or heat delivery. All of those need policy directions, but they also need a network to connect to, so we have a major role to enable all of that.”Paul says most businesses and iniduals now know that they “have to get on this journey” in order to play their part in tackling climate change, reducing their carbon emissions and improving energy efficiency.With Brexit, there have been concerns over the future of the all-island energy market. But Paul is confident that it will be secured, despite the UK’s exit from the EU. “That continuing is really important for businesses in Northern Ireland. Currently, all sides in the Brexit debate seem comfortable that the Single Electricity Marketwill continue, so we don’t see any specic threat around that.”As part of NIE Networks’ Northern Ireland-wide investment in infrastructure – of around £m a year – it has recently completed a £, investment in the Cathedral Quarter area of Belfast – where our interview took place – which is home to many of its best known pubs and restaurants. “That gives us a more resilient and reliable supply, as well as capacity for the future,” Paul says. Some of the other latest investments include projects in Enniskillen in advance of a new public realm scheme, along with another in Newry.“Right across Northern Ireland we are continuing to invest,” Paul says. “There is a lot going on. There’s a lot to do today, challenges, to keep efficient supply for the economy, but equally we need to plan for the future.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
