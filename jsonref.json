For people younger than 65, that ratio is closer to 1 in 1,400. Despite representing a much higher vaccination rate than younger age groups, the demographic accounts for most of the 1,200 deaths from Covid-19 in the nation each day.A total of 800,266 deaths and 50,226,427 coronavirus cases were reported as of 15 December.  The United States has the highest number of reported total Covid-19 deaths in the world, followed by Brazil and India.  The nation is now bracing for a potential surge in infections due to more time spent indoors with colder weather and the highly transmissible Omicron variant of the virus.  According to Victorian health authorities, a person who later tested positive for the Omicron variant of Covid-19 attended two venues in the inner Melbourne suburbs of Fitzroy and Collingwood on Friday, 10 December.First up, some Covid numbers out of Australia. The country’s most populous state of NSW has once again seen a significant jump in cases with 1,360 new Covid cases in the latest reporting period. Victoria recorded 1,405 new Covid cases and three deaths. Here’s what we know so far about Omicron’s spread in Australia. Data processing delays in England may have affected today’s figure, the agency added. The variant was first detected in southern Africa last month but has already been reported in 77 countries, WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told reporters. But, he stressed, “the reality is that Omicron is probably in most countries, even if it hasn’t been detected yet.” “Omicron is spreading at a rate we have not seen with any previous variant.” He also cautioned against “dismissing Omicron as mild”. “Surely, we have learned by now that we underestimate this virus at our peril,” he said.  “Even if Omicron does cause less severe disease, the sheer number of cases could once again overwhelm unprepared health systems.”The prime minister made a last-ditch call for his backbenchers to support the move in a private meeting an hour before the first vote, and managed to win over a few. However many still said they would oppose the move, branding the new rules illiberal, a “fundamental change in the relationship between the citizen and state” and a “knee-jerk” reaction. Labour said that 101 Conservatives voted against the government, by far the largest rebellion of Johnson’s premiership since the 2019 election. During a debate in the Commons on Tuesday, Tory MPs raised concerns over the recent problems some people have reported in ordering lateral flow tests, saying this would hinder some people’s ability to use a Covid pass to access some venues. Some backbenchers also claimed that forcing people to confirm their vaccine status was unethical, and there was no evidence it would avoid them passing Covid on because even those who have been vaccinated could catch and transmit the virus. Here’s the full story: From Wednesday, people in England will have to demonstrate proof of either two Covid-19 jabs or a negative test to gain entry into nightclubs and settings where large crowds gather, including unseated indoor events with more than 500 people. In a second vote, MPs also retrospectively approved the extension of mandatory face coverings for most indoor venues, including cinemas and theatres by 441 to 41 votes.Today’s figure has pushed the seven-day moving average of new cases to 49,506, marking the highest level this year.  Earlier today, government spokesperson Gabriel Attal said there were no plans to impose new domestic restrictions but that officials were closely monitoring the situation in the UK in case they may need to impose travel restrictions."},{"url":null,"title":"the secret teacher we re pushing our super learners into a squeezed middle","story":"Surely we can instead encourage our students to aim higher for longer rather than to settle for less sooner. Photograph: iStockAnything new needs powerful branding and a solid marketing team behind it. Until the new Junior Cycle rollout most of us didn’t realise that this also applies to educational reforms. Thanks to poor marketing the new Junior Cycle has more going for it than most teachers will ever see. Its merits outnumber its failings, but this remains lost on many thanks to a failure to recognise that it only had one chance to make a first impression.It was peddled with equal doses of enthusiasm and naivety, to teachers who by and large fell into a massive vacuum somewhere between the two. What became clear is that to put together a project as huge as Junior Cycle reform is one thing, to bring it to market quite another. There are very serious lessons to be learned from that for Senior Cycle reform. The content itself is merely one of many aspects, and we know that now.Knowing one’s client is also key. Educational reform only needs to be successfully sold to one stakeholder for the rest to run smoothly. Appropriate inclusion and consideration of teachers means that complaints from unions need not feature heavily in the narrative. Getting a critical mass of teachers on board is a total game changer for any new initiative. Our enthusiasm rubs off on our pupils, and so does our lack of it! Parents, the third stakeholder, are unlikely to go against the two who spend their days in the classroom.My biggest “content” gripe lies in the grade bands for the Junior Cycle exams, and indeed for the Leaving Certificate too.With the now-defunct Junior Certificate we had a total of seven bands, the lowest being “no grade” and awarded to those achieving under 10 per cent. From there it was six bands covering equal 15 per cent ranges. Under the new system the top grade is the narrower one, and therefore there is just a 10 per cent range for the highest reward, the “distinction”, allocated to those who achieve in excess of 90 per cent.The large section from 55-89 per cent covers just two descriptors. (We may label them descriptors but they are still grade bands. “If it waddles like a duck and quacks like a duck ...”.) Within this squeezed middle of just two categories, the top 15 per cent are awarded a “higher merit” and the bottom 20 per cent a “merit”. Those from 40-54 per cent are awarded the status of having “achieved”, making a result between 20 per cent and 39 per cent worthy of “partially achieved”. According to the new system below 20 per cent is “not graded”. So the new (allegedly improved) approach offers a reduction in the number of grade bands, and also varies the size of them. Put another way, three equal categories above 55 per cent have become three of very different sizes.You may be wondering where I am going with this. Differentiation means that in my class of 29 there are 29 iniduals, each bringing their own particular academic profile and set of learning requirements. My experience so far of Junior Cycle tells me that the assessment bands are anti-differentiation. Think anti-discrimination, but here it is anti-positive discrimination!Some of our super learners are getting pushed back into a squeezed middle which could suck them dry of the very motivation they will need to climb out of it and towards a higher grade in a Leaving Certificate exam. If they give it their all for a distinction which then eludes them, how are they to brace themselves for a more arduous climb with any genuine conviction that they will succeed?Early in my career I learned from fellow teachers who were significantly more experienced than me that “centring” when grading was an absolute no-no. Being willing to avail of the whole range of marks sends a clear message to students that there is no such thing as “it’s impossible to get an A” or “everyone always passes”.Using the full breadth of the scale does generate more work, as it can involve challenging conversations with the parents of those not doing so well, or producing something extra to stimulate those who are truly excelling. Both of these are worth it to see how pupils improve and thrive as a result. To over rely on the middle ground is to create a perception in students that this is most likely where they will end up. A sense of inevitability about the eventual result impacts on the effort made during the task.These young people are still in their formative years, and this is key to my concern about our State Examination practices. Given that the new Junior Cycle is a low-stakes assessment scenario, I struggle to see the need to quell ambition by offering so little to aim for in the upper grade bands. It is especially disconcerting to see that a pattern seems to be emerging here in Ireland around this. Take the Leaving Certificate grade bands as we knew them until 2017.Until then you had two shots at an A grade: 90 per cent or more earned a candidate a coveted A1 and there was also an A2 for those who achieved between 85- 89 per cent. Under the new system those with 89 per cent and 80 per cent are awarded the same grade, a H2 (or an O2 at ordinary level). So again in Senior Cycle the trend is to push the sense of achievement further out of a student’s reach.In my view both sets of grade bands are due an overhaul. Or do we want our squeezed middle to become a settled mediocrity? Is that in young people’s best interest? Surely we can instead encourage our students to aim higher for longer rather than to settle for less sooner."},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"John Feehan\u0026rsquos book charts effort to protect Offaly habitat and inherent bioersityStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"booster programme to get huge overhaul in race against omicron","story":"Taoiseach Micheál Martin: no plans to close schools early ‘at this stage’. Photograph: Stephen CollinsCollins The State’s booster campaign is to be overhauled with a massive redeployment of healthcare and public sector staff, who will be asked to prioritise Covid-19 vaccinations in the face of a potentially imminent Omicron wave.Hundreds more general practitioners and pharmacists will be asked to join the booster programme as the State races against time to give the population adequate protection against the latest Covid-19 variant.The Government is extremely resistant to the idea of any major new restrictions and is placing the focus firmly on the revised vaccination campaign which will be launched imminently by the HSE.Many vaccination centres will have extended opening hours, from 8am to 8pm, there will be extra centres in Dublin and Cork and other areas as well as increased capacity in existing centres and provisions made for record levels of testing.A source said the inoculation campaign had now entered its most challenging period since last January and that multiple workforces would be redeployed in the latest battle against the novel coronavirus.The Government will lean heavily on general practitioners as part of a “national effort” to prioritise vaccinations, meaning there will be less availability for other health issues. The plan is to have every GP vaccinating the public, up from the estimated 75 per cent currently providing this service. The Government also wants to see 1,000 pharmacies giving the jabs, up from about 550.The pace of the campaign will be accelerated and from December 20th the inoculation of high-risk children will begin, with other cohorts following from January 10th.Next doseA senior source said that people in their 30s and 40s can expect to hear “this side of Christmas” when they will be offered the next dose.Taoiseach Micheál Martin on Tuesday night called on the country to “hold the collective nerve” as the latest figures show that approximately 1.25 million have received a booster shot.Chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan said results on Tuesday indicated that approximately 14 per cent of the State’s new infections were now due to the new Omicron variant.He updated the Coalition’s three party leaders on Tuesday night about the state of play ahead of a crunch meeting of the National Public Health Emergency Team (Nphet) on Thursday.Government figures are extremely resistant to any suggestion of harsh new restrictions, while Mr Martin has said there is no plan to close schools early “at this stage”.He told RTÉ that a “collective objective of all of us is to keep schools open”.A spokesman for the Department of Education said the scheduling of school holiday periods are not due to change.“There are no plans to alter the school break at Christmas. There is no evidence to suggest that extending school holidays has a public health rationale.”The Netherlands announced on Tuesday that it would close primary schools a week earlier amid concern about children infecting older relatives over Christmas.VulnerableMeanwhile, there is concern in Government about younger age groups who got the one-shot Johnson \u0026amp Johnson vaccine and who may be especially vulnerable now as they wait their turn. The issue has been raised with Dr Holohan and the National Immunisation Advisory Committee (Niac).The World Health Organisation (WHO) said on Tuesday Covid-19 vaccines appeared to have become slightly less effective in preventing severe disease and death, but did provide “significant protection”.The Omicron variant first detected in South Africa and Hong Kong last month has now been reported by 77 countries and is probably present in most worldwide, but should not be dismissed as “mild”, WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said.“Omicron is spreading at a rate we have not seen with any previous variant.“Even if Omicron does cause less severe disease, the sheer number of cases could once again overwhelm unprepared health systems.”Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"omicron variant is spreading at unprecedented rate who chief says","story":"Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director general of the World Health Organisation, says Omicron should not be dismissed as ‘mild’. File photograph: Martial TrezziniEPAThe Omicron variant first detected in South Africa last month has now been reported by 77 countries and is probably present in most worldwide, but should not be dismissed as “mild”, World Health Organisation (WHO) director general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has said. “Omicron is spreading at a rate we have not seen with any previous variant,” the WHO director general told an online briefing on Tuesday. “Even if Omicron does cause less severe disease, the sheer number of cases could once again overwhelm unprepared health systems.”Vaccine booster shots can play a role in curbing the spread of Covid-19 as long as people most in need of protection also get access to jabs, he also said.Also on Tuesday, global public health expert Dr Mike Ryan of the WHO said that the world cannot vaccinate or lock down its way out of the Covid-19 pandemic.The executive director of the WHO’s health emergencies programme said continued public health measures were required as the Omicron variant would put pressure on health services, even if it was a milder disease.Speaking at an online webinar organised by the Institute of International and European Affairs, Dr Ryan said people have been looking for “silver bullets” or “unicorns” to end the pandemic, but they “don’t exist”.He said there needed to be a “multi-pronged” approach, in which consistent advice is delivered to the public.“What has worked during this pandemic is layered, risk-orientated, evidence-based, consistent advice to people. That’s the only way out of it. We can’t vaccinate our way out of this. We can’t lock down our way out of this,” he said.Dr Ryan said some countries have moved away from the basic health measures such as social distancing, hand-washing and mask-wearing.“Even if Omicron turns out to be a milder disease on an inidual basis, if we generate millions and millions and millions of cases, we will fill the hospitals up. We will fill the ICUs up,” he said.“We need to refocus on public health and social measures, vaccinate the unvaccinated. We need to make sure hospitals are ready.”Boosters should be administered to specific groups within the population, particularly older persons and people with underlying conditions.However, he said it was important to do both boosters and getting those who are unvaccinated vaccinated as quickly as possible.“That is the best use of the vaccine,” he added.Equitable accessOn the issue of equitable access for vaccines, Dr Ryan spoke about the Trips (Trade-related aspects of Intellectual Property Rights) waiver, which would temporarily waive patent rights to facilitate more widespread manufacturing worldwide.He said waiving technology rights “doesn’t necessarily make vaccines”, but said it must be viewed as a “global, strategic effort”.The WHO’s target was to have 40 per cent of the world vaccinated by the end of this year, but it is way off that, he said.“If a fire brigade goes to a fire today, it doesn’t distribute water on the basis of who can pay. It distributes that water based on whose house is burning, whose house is most at risk. We need a system that is much more coherent and we need technology transfer,” he said.Speaking in response to arguments that waiving the rights would have a negative impact on vaccine innovation in the future, Dr Ryan said it was public money that drove most of the investment.“There are extraordinary circumstances in which we really have to look at patents and intellectual property. When the patent for seatbelts was shared, Volvo didn’t go out of business,” he added.

Photograph: iStockExecutives at the National Lottery want to stop any future quirks of fate causing seemingly endless Lotto jackpot rollovers by changing the rules to allow for must-win draws after a certain period of time. Premier Lotteries Ireland chief executive Andrew Algeo is to appear before the Oireachtas finance committee on Wednesday, where he is set to call for regulatory approval for changes that will ensure “an improbably long wait for a capped jackpot win cannot occur again”.In his submission for the committee, he says the company was proposing that a draw would have to be won, if not by someone who matched all six numbers then by someone who matched five, after a certain period of time elapsing without the jackpot being claimed. This “would also allow us to provide certainty to Lotto players, as to the latest date on which this record €19 million jackpot will be won by”.The last Lotto jackpot was won in early June, and the top prize has been capped at just over €19 million since October.The EuroMillions jackpot is capped once it reaches €190 million and after it stays at its maximum allowed limit on five consecutive occasions, it must be won. If no player matches the five numbers from the main panel plus an additional two so-called Lucky Star numbers – which is the normal requirement for winning the EuroMillions jackpot – it is shared at the next prize tier at which there are winners. That has only happened once in the EuroMillions’s 20-year history. ‘Highly unusual’Mr Algeo will tell TDs and Senators on the committee that it is “highly unusual” that the Lotto jackpot would remain unclaimed for more than six months.“Given the tickets purchased since early June, the chances are akin to rolling a die 37 times without the number six arising,” he will say.“Then again it was somewhat unusual that we had Lotto jackpot winners on three consecutive Saturdays just before this long roll. Variation in jackpot roll lengths occur because each lottery draw is a pure game of chance without memory.”He stresses that it is in the National Lottery’s interest that the jackpot was seen as “both aspirational and possible” and he said that meant jackpots would have to be “large enough and won frequently enough”.The deputy regulator of the National Lottery, Derek Donohoe, is to tell the committee that the Lotto was “operating in line with the game rules”, stressing there are “no regulatory issues” calling the draw into question.In his submission Mr Donohoe notes that “independent observers from KPMG attend every Lotto draw”.“The current extended period without a jackpot win is unusual in the history of the game, but it is not unusual in the history of lotteries. Statistically unlikely events are part of the nature of games of chance and lotteries,” he adds.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"party leaders meet nphet as holohan says omicron now accounts for 14 of cases","story":"Taoiseach Micheál Martin said: “Omicron is of serious concern and we do know that the booster can give great protection.” File photograph: Dara Mac DonaillAnother 3,887 cases of Covid-19 have been reported in the State, the Department of Health has confirmed.The department also said on Tuesday evening that as of 8am on Tuesday, there were 493 Covid-19 patients in hospital, of which 109 are in ICU.Speaking amid the latest figures, chief medical officer Tony Holohan said that results on Tuesday indicated that approximately 14 per cent of the State’s new infections are now due to the new Omicron variant.Meanwhile, the Government has asked the health service to provide a revised Covid-19 booster plan that will immediately accelerate the level of vaccinations within days.This will involve longer hours at centres, new satellite centres and staff being redeployed from across the public sector.The plans come as party leaders prepare for a meeting with members of the National Public Health Emergency Team (Nphet) on Tuesday evening.There is significant resistance at a senior level to any call for further restrictions. Sources believe Ireland has been outlier in comparison to other European countries in terms of the length and severity of lockdowns.It is understood the chief medical officer, Tony Holohan, will update the party leaders and lead Ministers on the latest Covid trends ahead of Christmas.A source said the meeting is for politicians to get an “update”. Politicians have been anxious that Nphet may recommend increased restrictions after its planned meeting on Thursday.Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly brought a memo to Cabinet on Tuesday outlining new plans to redeploy health service staff to the vaccine campaign and to draft in people from other parts of the public sector, including people going through the public sector appointments process, it is understood.Mr Donnelly told the meeting that he had asked the HSE to begin putting in place arrangements for the administration of paediatric vaccines to children aged 5-11 years.Ministers were told on Tuesday that the HSE had previously anticipated that the booster programme would have capability to administer 250,000 doses per week from January onwards.Mr Donnelly said that he has emphasised to the HSE the importance of ensuring that an updated implementation plan can deliver an “appreciably greater volume of activity during the remaining weeks of December and into early 2022”.He also said he had spoken directly with GP representatives and pharmacy representatives to ensure they were central to a national effort to administer more boosters.He told the meeting that he is pushing for vaccine centres to operate additional hours, additional satellite centres if necessary and the necessary workforce requirements, including the redeployment of existing health service personnel and secondment of personnel from other parts of the public service.Taoiseach Micheál Martin had earlier called for “all hands on deck in relation to the booster campaign” due to “serious concern” about the Omicron variant of Covid-19.Speaking on his way into a Cabinet meeting on Tuesday morning, Mr Martin said it was “critical” that more GPs and pharmacists get involved in administering vaccines.“We need everybody on board now, all hands on deck in relation to the booster campaign because Omicron is of serious concern and we do know that the booster can give great protection,” he said.“So I thank everybody who has been involved and I think there’s ongoing engagement now that we can get as many GPs to continue and stay involved and get more involved and likewise to get more pharmacies involved in terms of administering the vaccine over the coming days and the coming weeks. I think that is critical.”Mr Martin said people deserved credit for adjusting their behaviour over the last six weeks and that had impacted on stabilising hospital numbers and case numbers.“Anything else is speculation at this stage. Given the nature of Omicron we are in ongoing contact and engagement with public health, but the focus over the last number of days has been on the booster campaign, working out the most effective ways that we can expand it and get more people jabbed as quickly as we possibly can.”A more than 10-fold increase in cases of the Omicron variant of coronavirus in Ireland in one week has prompted Government officials to rush to put in place responses.Omicron cases now account for 11 per cent of all infections in Ireland, and officials expect cases to continue to rise over the coming weeks.In response, Mr Donnelly said on Monday that booster shots would now be administered just three months after completing the initial vaccination course.The acceleration of the booster campaign in the next 10 days is vital, immunology expert Professor Christine Loscher has said.Speaking on Newstalk Breakfast, Prof Loscher called for the vaccine booster campaign to be immediately extended to everyone who received the one dose Janssen vaccine, “regardless of age”.The one dose vaccine has waned with some now down to 20 per cent protection, she said.While “coming down the cohorts” had been sensible to date, those who received Janssen now needed to be prioritised, she urged.A lot of young people received the Janssen vaccine and they now needed to get the booster quicker, she said.There had been a three-week delay in implementing the booster campaign after it was approved by Niac, she said, and as a result cases had accelerated.Every effort had to be made in the next 10 days to get the maximum number of vaccines “into arms,” to avoid the number of Omicron cases “climbing quickly”.More than 1.2 million booster doses have been administered so far, latest figures show this includes 97,000 third doses to people who are immunocompromised.Meanwhile, the chairperson of the Irish Medical Organisation’s GP committee, Dr Denis McCauley has called on the public not to seek an appointment with their GP unless it is urgent.The change to three months before a booster dose would increase demand and put more pressure on GPs, he said.He urged people not to seek appointments with their GP if the complaint was not urgent and if they could wait until after Christmas.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"eu prepared to move unilaterally on ni medicines coveney says","story":"Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney. Photograph: Alan BetsonThe European Union is prepared to move ahead unilaterally with legal changes to ensure the flow of medicines into Northern Ireland if agreement with the United Kingdom cannot be found, Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney has said.Discussions are ongoing this week between the EU and UK teams to try to come to an agreement, with lead negotiators Maros Sefcovic and David Frost set to meet twice in a bid to make progress by Christmas.Mr Coveney said it was possible that there could be a breakthrough on medicines by then, but that broader issues including on customs and food, plant and animal checks would not be agreed by the end of this year.“Between now and Christmas it is possible I hope to find agreement on the medicines issue,” Mr Coveney said.“I think the EU is anxious to move ahead unilaterally on that, if the UK doesn’t agree an approach, because certainly the EU wants to ensure that medicines can flow freely into Northern Ireland from Great Britain.“The other issues we know in all likelihood are not going to be resolved between now and the end of the year: SPS checks, customs checks and a range of other issues.”Red lineTime is short on medicines, as a grace period on enforcing EU standards on medicines that are shipped from Britain into Northern Ireland is set to expire on January 1st.On Friday a British official briefed London-based journalists that the UK government no longer considered the removal of the European Court of Justice (ECJ) as an arbiter of disputes over Northern Ireland’s post-Brexit arrangements to be a red line in negotiations.However, chief negotiator Mr Frost subsequently tweeted that the issue of governance “including the Court of Justice” remained an issue, adding: “We will not find a durable solution that does not deal with all these problems.”Mr Coveney said that the briefing had been “retracted”.“Clearly there was a briefing that has essentially been retracted. So look, I think we shouldn’t make a big deal of it, to be honest,” he said.“I think we have to go on what what David Frost says. He’s the chief negotiator he speaks for the prime minister on Brexit issues.”Before it was retracted, the dropping of the ECJ red line was heralded as an encouraging sign that a deal could be near, particularly as it was followed by the granting of 23 extra licences to French fishing boats by the UK government, easing tensions on another contentious issue.The government of prime minister Boris Johnson warned in recent months that it would use the sensitive article 16 clause to unilaterally suspend the enforcement of the post-Brexit arrangements designed to avoid a hard border unless concessions were granted, but subsequently appeared to move away from the idea."},{"url":null,"title":"minister asks officials to expediate publication of nbp contract","story":"Minister of State at the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform Ossian Smyth said if the ownership did change, ‘it would have required the consent of the minister’. Photograph: Gareth ChaneyCollinsMinister of State at the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform Ossian Smyth has said he has asked his officials what they can do to “expedite” publishing the National Broadband contract.Mr Smyth told the Dáil on Tuesday night that the ownership structure of National Broadband Ireland (NBI), the company set up to manage installing broadband access, “remains as it was at the signing of the contract”.Mr Smyth was answering parliamentary questions on behalf of the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications Eamon Ryan, whom Mr Smyth said had a cold and could not attend.Sinn Féin TD Ruairí Ó Murchú asked if the minister would address issues recently raised in the Sunday Business Post and The Currency in relation to the plan and NBI’s corporate structure, financial arrangements, long-term viability and ability to deliver.Mr Smyth said on the matter of the ownership, Metallah Ltd is the 100 per cent owner of the shares in the capital of NBI, “save for the special share of the Minister which does not provide ownership rights”.Granahan McCourt Dublin Limited is the 100 per cent owner of the shares in the capital of Metallah Ltd and is owned 50.9 per cent by Granahan McCourt Fund Limited, a David McCourt controlled company and 49.1 per cent by an entity managed and controlled by Oak Hill advisors, Mr Smyth said.“The ownership structure remains as it was at the signing of the contract. The investors are providing funding through the purchase of shares in NBI and the provision of shareholder loans,” he said.“I’m advised that using both instruments is a standard form of investment in infrastructure companies and reference to both as being equity investments is common practice.“The initial drawdown of committed shareholder funds by NBI was €100 million in January 2020. This was drawn down for the release of any subsidy by the State. I’m advised that no shareholder distributions have been made to date.“I’m also advised that a further drawdown of investor funds of €20 million will be made in the coming weeks and that the full amount of committed equity of €175 million is covered by guarantees.”Mr Smyth said if the ownership did change, “it would have required the consent of the minister”.End of yearNBI was awarded the State contract to roll out broadband to 540,000 homes and businesses in 2019 after Eir and ESB-Vodafone joint venture Siro withdrew from the competition.It was forced to cut its target for the number of premises “passed” by the network this year from 115,000 to 60,000 as Covid-related delays hit the initial rollout.Mr Smyth said it was recently confirmed to the department that the number of premises passed by the end of December will be in the order of 35,000, while between 50,000 and 60,000 premises will be able to “order or pre-order a service by the end of the year”. He said build is underway for more than 121,000 premises.“There’s been a huge publication of the contract, some parts are redacted. As I understand, that’s in line with the mandatory provisions of Section 36 of the FOI Act of 2014,” he said.“But as far as possible, I have asked my officials to see what they can do to expedite that.”"},{"url":null,"title":"miriam lord when it comes to christmas craic sinn f%C3%A9in is an absolute hoot","story":"‘I dressed for the occasion in red, a Ceann Comhairle. I think it would be a bit much to don the beard and the hat, so I left it,’ said Sinn Féin president Mary Lou McDonald. Photograph: Gareth ChaneyCollinsMicheál decided not to treat the chamber to a festive warble on his last Dáil appearance of 2021.Mary Lou was scarlet for him.Understandably, with the end in sight, he was in good spirits. But he had no intention of losing the run of himself either.“I won’t take off Chris de Burgh,” promised the Taoiseach.Aah, go on. It’s Christmas.He was spoilt for choice. But what particular song was on Micheál’s mind before his final Leaders’ Questions of the year?Patricia the Asset Stripper?High on Boiled Eggs?The Taoiseach didn’t say, but there could be only one Chris de Burgh tune worth crooning under the circumstances, for sitting across the floor from him was a Sinn Féin vision in crimson.What a way to round off the session. Micheál serenading Mary Lou across a crowded chamber: his Lady in Red.We’ll just leave that image there, so as not to ruin the Christmas entirely.This was all the Ceann Comhairle’s fault. Seán Ó Fearghail was so desperate for some seasonal cheer he wondered, as he called on the Sinn Féin leader, “Are you going to inject some Christmas spirit?”If he was looking for a dollop of yuletide merriment he can’t be faulted for turning to that party’s president for a dig out because when it comes to the Christmas craic, Sinn Féin is an absolute hoot. And if it’s good enough for Merry Gerry, her predecessor, then it’s good enough for Mary Lou.Perhaps he was hoping she might delight the Dáil with another little number from Gerry’s IRA handbook, sorry, songbook.Then Eoin Ó Broin could apologise afterwards for her poor judgement, swiftly followed by Matt Carthy and David Cullinane taking the apology back, followed by Carthy apologising for his apology but still not taking it back.Wisely, Mary Lou left the dodgy singing to former deputy Adams but, in an effort to help the chair, she pointed out that she made an effort on the sartorial front.“I dressed for the occasion in red, a Ceann Comhairle,” she replied. “I think it would be a bit much to don the beard and the hat, so I left it.”Whereupon Micheál remarked bashfully about not doing a reprise of Chris de Burgh’s hit song, the one which became synonymous with the late Princess Diana.“Although I might get a more polite response from An Taoiseach if I was attired in that manner,” she added, long of the view that she never gets a proper answer to her questions during their weekly heckle sessions.Mary Lou looked very glam in her scarlet satin jacket with matching scarlet skirt and camisole. All dressed up, but had she anywhere to go? Her Sinn Féin colleagues in the chamber on Tuesday seemed in great form too, maybe they were going to enjoy some Covid restricted acceptable socialising later in the evening?Best not to tell fun-lovin’ Crimbo party animal Gerry though. He’d probably be the one roaring “Shots! Shots! Shots!” at his former charges between rounds and dropping Jägerbombs into their pints, for the laughs.The Taoiseach is away in Brussels on EU business for the next while so he got his greetings in early, wishing Opposition deputies and Leinster House staff a Happy Christmas and thanking the Ceann Comhairle for his tolerance and patience.“I hope it can last another session.” Mary Lou also extended compliments of the season to one and all before launching into the vexed question of booster shots and how quickly they can be jabbed into as many arms as possible before Christmas. The Government hasn’t been fast enough with the rollout, she contended, telling the Taoiseach his urgency has come very late in the day. “We needed the ‘all hands on deck’ approach two months ago.”Furthermore, she said, “the slower number of boosters administered in this third round of vaccinations has nothing to do with a public lack of willingness to come forward” and all to do with “operational” issues.“We are a highly vaccinated population,” she reminded Micheál as we yearned for those less complicated days when politicians talked of a “highly educated” population or a “highly progressive population”.The Taoiseach is among the highly vaccinated. “I took Moderna myself on Friday. I waited in a queue, in a line. The mood was great. People talked to each other. Lots and lots of people are waiting in line and happy to get the booster vaccine.”Away from Covid, Mattie McGrath pleaded for funds to complete the refurbishment of South Tipperary General Hospital. He said the Taoiseach recently visited the hospital and met management. The building is three quarters finished and he was quoted at the time as saying he couldn’t understand how the job wasn’t done as it was “low hanging fruit”.Mattie kept up the fruit theme.“Whether it be apples, pears or oranges – I hope it’s not bananas – we want this fruit. And it has to be delivered for the management there, the very hardworking staff and to the patients. . . Why don’t you give them the low hanging fruit?”Micheál, a great man for the fruit, was concerned that Mattie didn’t appear to have much time for bananas.“Can I just say, bananas are very good for you and you should eat one a day,” he told an unimpressed McGrath.“They repeat on you,” he responded.“But they contain plenty of potassium.”The Taoiseach assured him that the department and the HSE was actively looking into providing extra capacity. And he finished with some parting advice for the Independent TD for Tipperary.“Anyway, you should not forget the odd banana in future.” "},{"url":null,"title":"taoiseach does not rule out more covid restrictions but says we must hold our nerve","story":"Taoiseach Micheál Martin has not ruled out further Covid-19 restrictions before Christmas. File photograph: Julien BehalPA WireTaoiseach Micheál Martin has not ruled out further Covid-19 restrictions before Christmas, but said that “we all need to hold our collective nerve” in the latest wave of the pandemic. Mr Martin also said it remains the intention not to close schools early before Christmas as part of a bid to slow the spread of the virus.He made the remarks on RTÉ’s Six One News ahead of a meeting between the three Coalition leaders and chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan and other members of the National Public Health Emergency Team (Nphet) on Tuesday night.Mr Martin said he has been in touch with Mr Holohan and Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly in recent days on the potential threat posed by the highly transmissible new Omicron variant. He said the HSE is working hard on a revised plan to expand the booster vaccination programme, pointing to an intention to open new vaccination centres at Richmond Barracks and the RDS in Dublin as well as to increase the use of GPs and pharmacies to administer jabs.Mr Martin said 1.25 million booster doses have been administered and there is “significant momentum” in this regard, which he suggested will be accelerated. He said the vaccination programme for children with underlying conditions or those living with vulnerable family members is to start next week. Mr Martin said people have reduced socialisation and this has had an impact on levelling out and reducing hospitalisations and ICU admissions.Question of restrictionsAsked if there will be a need for formal restrictions, Mr Martin said Dr Holohan’s perspective will be sought and “we want to talk things through in an informal way initially”.Mr Martin also pointed out that some of the restrictions announced in Britain as a response to the Omicron threat have already been in place here and “it has had an impact”. He said: “That’s why we brought in supports for hospitality and so on because we’ve taken steps, we’ve already introduced restrictions. “But as I’ve been saying consistently I can’t rule anything out. We will need good discussions. “What I am heartened by is that over the last two months people have responded to public health messaging by changing their behaviour.”Mr Martin also said a “collective objective of all of us is to keep schools open”, and speaking in response to suggestions that they could close for Christmas two days early, said: “That’s not our intention at all at this stage.”Asked if he anticipates an address to the nation between now and the new year, Mr Martin said: “A week is a long time in Covid – I’ve learned that now over the last while. “What I would say to people is we all need to hold our collective nerve. “We’ve been through different waves of the pandemic. We’ll get over this wave as well.”Booster recordSpeaking in the Dáil on Tuesday, Mr Martin had said there will “certainly” be a need for a record of people receiving their Covid-19 booster shot. Mr Martin said that while the booster campaign is currently focused on administering shots, the issue of Covid-19 digital certs for those who have received a booster shot will have to be looked at. He was responding to a question from Fine Gael TD Richard Bruton in the Dáil on Tuesday. “I know that speed is absolutely the premium at the moment in rolling out the third dose or the booster dose. I would just like to ask are there plans to ensure that the EU-compatible Covid Digital cert, which is the record of vaccination, that that will include the third dose?” Mr Bruton said. “Because, as you know, from tomorrow, France, for example, requires people over a certain age to have had three doses before they can go participate in certain activities. There will be a need for a record of this third dose.”Mr Martin said that as about 1.25 million have received a booster shot, he did not think “it would be fair at this stage of the booster campaign differentiating in terms of access and so on”. Also on Tuesday, Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly and Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney announced that the State had pledged to donate up to 3 million more vaccine doses to the Covax initiative, which aims to guarantee fair and equitable access to vaccines worldwide.The latest pledge is in addition to 2 million vaccine doses already committed to Covax by the Republic.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"teflon mark set to lead new dutch government as crises stack up","story":" Dutch prime minister and leader of the People’s Party for Freedom and Democracy  Mark Rutte: a canny manager in a crisis with an instinct for when to stop digging. Photograph: Phil NijhuisThe new Dutch coalition government, which finally came together on Monday evening, has no shortage of policy issues, any one of which could be described as on the verge of crisis.That is good news for the four parties involved. Not only will the new cabinet be able to tackle the real concerns of the electorate immediately it takes office in January, but each of the four will have an opportunity to show why it deserved to return to government – and what has changed.It’s almost a year since the third consecutive coalition of premier Mark Rutte collapsed on January 15th in a blizzard of recrimination over a scandal in which tens of thousands of families were wrongly accused of illegally claiming child benefit payments and forced to repay money they didn’t have.In the months that followed, it was not alone difficult to imagine the same four parties – Rutte’s Liberals (VVD), the Christian Democrats, centrist D66 and socially conservative Christian Union – returning to power unchanged, but even more difficult to imagine “Teflon Mark” again at their head.Yet that is his skill: he’s a canny manager in a crisis with, usually, an unerring instinct for when to stop digging. Coalition dealThat’s why, as news of the coalition deal broke on Monday evening, his response was low-key. “It’s a good agreement,” he said. “But in the end it will be all about execution.” The 50-page agreement went to each of the parties on Tuesday, and goes to MPs on Wednesday prior to a two-day debate on Thursday and Friday, the start of the Christmas recess. The new cabinet of 20 ministers, half of them women, will be sworn in by King Willem-Alexander in the new year.In many ways, Rutte is correct. It is a good deal, though there were real missed opportunities for change along the way.Having been returned as the second-largest party, D66 leader Sigrid Kaag failed to optimise the benefits of that “moral victory”, not least by claiming the high moral ground when Rutte was censured for lying to parliament – so that she herself was forced to resign as foreign minister for failing to evacuate vulnerable staff from Kabul when the Taliban overran Afghanistan. If there was a moment when Kaag was regarded as a woman with the steel to elbow Rutte out of the top job, it didn’t last.Similarly, there was a moment when Christian Union might have been replaced in the new coalition by a ground-breaking merger between the Labour Party and GreenLeft, which could have led to far-reaching change in areas such as the liberalisation of euthanasia and the abolition of the five-day “reflection period” for women seeking abortion. Housing shortageIn the end, perhaps too wise to the fate of junior coalition partners, neither left-wing party had the stomach for the risk.As it is, the single biggest crisis facing the Netherlands this Christmas is a shortage of affordable accommodation. The country needs almost a million new homes by 2030, a situation that has worsened consistently during the past three governments. Rutte now sees it as a “fix” worth being remembered for. Another popular fix will be reform of the education system, with free or subsidised nursery care to facilitate longer school days. Alongside will come tax changes encouraging employers to hire more.Climate change is another big policy beast, and the new coalition plans a multi-billion-euro package aimed at cutting nitrogen dioxide emissions. D66 maintains the number of farm animals will need to be halved and the row over how that will be done looks set to add farmers’ protests to the housing protests and anti-vaxxer protests already common at weekends.Those three issues alone – perhaps combined with road pricing and more research into nuclear power – could modernise and future-proof Dutch society.

The vaccines will not stop the spread of the virus in the short or medium term, but that is not a disaster. Indeed the vaccines were not designed to end transmission. It was evident to me at the time I helped with the procurement of doses, as interim chair of the Vaccine Taskforce, that the intention was to stop people from getting severely ill or dying. It is clear that the omicron variant is more transmissible than delta. But what is not clear — indeed, what is utterly unlikely — is that it evades the vaccines’ ability to prevent severe disease and death. Studies may suggest that the two jabs of AstraZeneca are not very good at preventing you from catching Covid, but I am absolutely certain that they would provide excellent protection against severe Covid. I\u0027ve been astonished to see the lack of clarity with which some public figures speak of vaccines. The terms “evade” and “resistance” are being used in a misleading way. When politicians talk of vaccine resistance, they should always make clear that it is very, very difficult for any variant to become “resistant” in the medium term to the full spectrum of immunity that these fantastic vaccines offer. The booster campaign is still very important. It will be required for years to come. However, we must define its purpose. Boosters ought to be administered for the protection of the elderly and the immuno-compromised, who may struggle to maintain a decent immune response. Thus any campaign should, logically, discriminate. It should start with the elderly and most vulnerable and then work its way down.Instead, we have the unseemly sight of 30-year-olds queuing around buildings for vaccines while not all the over-65s are boosted. In theory, a 65-year-old who has waited two weeks for their appointment might be asked to wait in the same line as a 30-year-old who booked a day or two ago. If the purpose is to prevent hospitalisations and deaths from rising, this makes very little sense. Such a strategy would only be cogent if we wanted to eliminate transmission, but that is, at the moment at least, an impossible dream. And while it would of course be desirable if we could give a booster to anyone who wanted one, the real world means we face a very real trade-off between boosting the young and caring for the chronically ill. Given that young and healthy people not only have a very low chance of suffering severe Covid in the first place, but also already have substantial immunity from severe disease thanks to the first two jabs, I cannot see how boosting them is more valuable for public health than doubling our focus on the most vulnerable and cracking down on the backlog of chronically sick patients, such as those with hypertension, diabetes or even cancer. The cat is out of the bag, however. A virtually indiscriminate booster campaign is underway, and that inevitably means sacrificing the care of elderly diabetes for the very marginal benefit of boosting the antibody concentrations of the young and healthy. I fear that we be inadvertently causing a lot of human suffering. Dr Clive Dix was Interim Chair of the UK Vaccine TaskforceMore from NewsHow lockdown helped Star Hobson’s murderer carry on attacking toddler, despite family’s warnings\u0026#39Ministry of Fear\u0026#39 fails to unnerve Tory vaccine passport rebelsMen caught wolf whistling or bothering women should be prosecuted, police toldUK demands changes to Northern Ireland Protocol so businesses can get Covid supportJK Rowling ‘erased’ from Fantastic Beasts trailer in wake of more transphobia accusationsThe Tory grassroots will never forgive BorisMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"eadruf cross shaped pendant covered runes reveals mysterious","story":"“Who was Eadruf?” historians are asking, after the discovery of a cross-shaped pendant which revealed a new and “mysterious” Anglo-Saxon name.Detectorists found an 8th or 9th-century golden cross on the shores of the River Tweed, near Berwick, in 2020 - an area that was formerly part of a religious centre in the Kingdom of Northumbria.Studies of the pendant have revealed it was etched with runes that spell out “Eadruf”, a previously unknown name that experts have described as “etymologically mysterious”.While “Ead” may mean something like “fortune” or “happiness”, Prof John Hines, an archaeologist and linguist, has said: “No personal name element ‘ruf’ can be identified in any Germanic language.”The discovery of the inscribed pendant, announced as part of the British Museum\u0027s annual summary of finds from across the UK, has prompted speculation as to the identity of the only Eadruf ever recorded.The use of gold to craft the cross suggests that its owner was likely a high-status figure, with possible links to Anglo-Saxon royalty or monastic communities.Prof Hines, of the University of Cardiff, has suggested that the unique moniker “Eadruf” could be an early Medieval nickname formed from the contraction of a name popular with “the upper social strata in Northumbria in the 9th century”.It is possible, Prof Hines has said, that the newly unearthed epithet derives from “Eardwulf” - a name shared by notable historical figures, including a deposed and exiled king of Northumbria.It has also been suggested that the owner of the mysterious golden cross was Eardwulf of Lindisfarne, who was bishop of the monastic community when it began a long migration from its historic base on Holy Island to Durham in the 9th-century.While the identity of Eadruf remains a mystery, Ben Westwood, Durham finds liaison officer, who is responsible for recording archaeological discoveries, said the pendant owner was “clearly embedded in … the early medieval, early Christian fabric of the North East region”.The golden cross was one of 50,000 finds made in 2020. They also included a 13th-century silver matrix used to imprint wax seals, with the name of a high-status medieval woman known as “Matilda de Cornhill”, and a hoard of 6,500 Roman coins.More from News\u0026#39Ministry of Fear\u0026#39 fails to unnerve Tory vaccine passport rebelsMen caught wolf whistling or bothering women should be prosecuted, police toldUK demands changes to Northern Ireland Protocol so businesses can get Covid supportJK Rowling ‘erased’ from Fantastic Beasts trailer in wake of more transphobia accusationsThe Tory grassroots will never forgive BorisPharmacies told they cannot have extra rapid Covid tests, even though entire cities have run outMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"harry dunn anne sacoolas lawyers say agreement not yet made","story":"Hopes that the alleged killer of Harry Dunn could be brought to justice in the UK were dealt a blow on Tuesday.Lawyers for Anne Sacoolas, the US citizen accused of causing 19-year-old Harry’s death, said they had not yet struck an agreement for her to face a virtual trial in the UK.The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) had announced on Monday that Ms Sacoolas would face Westminster Magistrates Court on January 18 charged with causing his death by dangerous driving on August 27, 2019.The CPS and Foreign Office have been in negotiations with Ms Sacoolas’s legal team for the hearing and future trial to be held via video link.A spokesperson for her lawyers, Arnold and Porter, said: “While we have always been willing to discuss a virtual hearing, there is no agreement at this time.”A Crown Prosecution Service spokesman said: “While the challenges and complexity of this case are well known, we remain committed to securing justice in this matter.”Ms Sacoolas was allegedly on the wrong side of the road when she crashed into Harry Dunn on a road outside US military base RAF Croughton in Northamptonshire.US authorities refused a request for the extradition of Mrs Sacoolas, the wife of a US intelligence officer, after asserting diplomatic immunity on her behalf, and she returned to her home country before being charged by the CPS with causing death by dangerous driving in December 2019.Earlier this year, Amy Jeffress, Mrs Sacoolas’ lawyer, said she would be willing to perform community service in the US and make a “contribution” in Mr Dunn’s memory, as well as meet his family.Claiming Mrs Sacoolas has “never denied” responsibility for the crash, Ms Jeffress said that, since the charge pending in Britain against Ms Sacoolas would not usually result in a prison sentence in the US, her client was not inclined to return to the UK to face trial.However,Robert Buckland, then the justice secretary, rejected the proposal, saying Ms Sacoolas must face justice in the UK.If she does face trial in the UK and is found guilty, the UK could seek her extradition from the US, although legal sources suggested another option could see her serve her sentence in the US.On being told the news on Monday, Mr Dunn\u0027s mother, Charlotte Charles, said: “My family and I are feeling very emotional and overwhelmed, having just learned the news that Mrs Sacoolas is now to face our justice system.

A formal offer of a Visiting Fellowship was proffered to me in February 2019, facilitated by Dr Douglas Hedley, Professor of the Philosophy of Religion at Clare College, and arranged through the necessary actions on the part of Cambridge and the University of Toronto. In the autumn of 2016, I had rented a 500-seat theater (on a whim, you might say) in Toronto, Canada, and delivered fifteen 90-minute public lectures entitled The Psychological Significance of the Biblical Stories. Surprisingly, all the lectures attracted a sold-out house. Furthermore, the majority of the audience consisted of young men, a notoriously difficult audience to attract to such things. The initial lecture, Introduction to the Idea of God, focused on the first two sentences of the Book of Genesis. Those who came to watch and listen walked their way with me through the remainder of that great book during the remaining fourteen.By the close of 2018, when initial arrangements were being made regarding my Fellowship, some four million people had watched the first lecture on YouTube, with a multitude more listening on my podcast. The series has now been viewed or watched forty million times. It has, in addition, attracted a widespread positive response from Christian Catholics, Protestants, and Orthodox believers alike (even widespread positive critical response), as well as large swathes of the Orthodox Jewish and Islamic faithful. In a further unexpected twist, the lectures have also proved popular with those who regard themselves as explicitly atheistic.I recount this only to explain why the initial invitation from Cambridge was proffered: it has proved increasingly difficult for those concerned about our traditional and religious heritage to propagate their message — their ideas — to the modern community, and the success of my venture generated some great curiosity. After the success of the Genesis venture, I had the ambition to continue my investigations and discussion with the Book of Exodus. Knowing that I am an amateur in such matters (being possessed of no training in formal theology) I thought it would be prudent to test my knowledge and understanding in a setting that would challenge what I was assuming and potentially rectify my profound remaining ignorance. I therefore set out with my would-be Cambridge hosts to hear the opinions of those who had made the study of Divinity their central calling before I presumed to re-engage upon my lecture series. It was a great honour for me, and I say this most truly, to be offered this opportunity as a psychologist and an academic interloper. My invitation raised some hackles behind the scenes, however, based on what I would call a wilfully blind “misinterpretation” of my putative political views. In consequence, the invitation was unceremoniously rescinded, on an excuse which I later learned had been manufactured post-hoc. This happened, conveniently as well as treacherously, when Dr Hedley, my sponsor, was absent conducting his affairs in India. I discovered that I had been cancelled not as a formal notification, but accidentally, on Twitter. This, to say the least, was a shock. Earlier this year, however, I received an invitation to return. In the aftermath of my cancelling (and other too-similar incidents), an intense battle had been waged to make the sort of gratuitous forbidding that had been applied to me impossible. A group of Cambridge dons arose to challenge and reword a set of revisions to the university policy on free speech that would have, ironically — if that word is strong enough — made future similar cancellations both easier and more likely. Then they attempted to find twenty-five people who would affix their names to a petition that forced a full, anonymous and binding vote on the matter. This specific effort took months. People were afraid to sign afraid that making their support for such a change public would expose them to sanctions similar in consequence to those that befell me afraid that they would be mobbed and cancelled. But enough people eventually did so, and the matter was duly brought forward to Regent House, Cambridge’s ultimate governing body. And when the vote was called, an unusually large proportion of those eligible to cast their ballots turned out to make their opinions known. Almost nine out of ten of the fifteen-hundred or so who did so voted to make such cancellations impossible in the future — a larger margin of victory than any of the academics I spoke with about such issues of governance could recall. Obviously, something was transpiring of far broader significance than the mere revoking of my inidual fellowship offer. And, so, to the first of many reasons why I love Great Britain. Cambridge (like Oxford, from which it is descended, much as it dislikes to admit it) has a highly decentralised college structure. Both great institutions are more a loose collection of autonomous colleges, each with their own history, tradition, architecture, peculiarities of self-government, and educational aims. This arrangement allows for maximal liberty and creativity in thought and action at the most vitally important level — the local — while simultaneously enabling an optimal level of cross-college rivalry and cooperation.Furthermore, and most significantly, this free and loose organisational structure makes bureaucratic capture of the entire institutions extremely difficult. This, in turn, makes the rectification of mistakes, which will inevitably be made, possible and even likely. And that might just be the salvation of the rapidly-corrupting modern university, as well as everything downstream from that culture (and that is everything). And the rebellion at that august institution and elsewhere against the ideological forces currently threatening free discourse and inquiry in the academy is just beginning. Mark my words.My wife and I returned to Cambridge on November 17. I attended a number of seminars there, and delivered two public lectures (as I did a week later at Oxford, where I had also been invited to meet, speak and teach). I used these opportunities to discuss and test a proposition key to the body of thought I have been developing and communicating about for many decades: that we all perceive the world not as a set of self-evident objective material facts, but as a system of meaning, and that we do so by applying a framework which when described is a narrative: a story. I proposed further that this fact has profound — even revolutionary — implications for how we understand science and theology and for how we conceptualise ourselves, existentially, in the world. These ideas were markedly well received. I also had the great privilege of talking for several hours while at Oxford first to Sir Roger Penrose, perhaps the world’s most renowned living physicist, and then to Dr Richard Dawkins, who is rather uniquely a Fellow both of the original Royal Society (an honor bestowed upon outstanding scientists) and of the Royal Society of Literature, founded in 1820 by King George to “reward literary merit and excite literary talent.” Dr Dawkins is, as well, perhaps the world’s most famous and influential atheist. Dr Penrose and I (along with Dr Stephen Blackwood, who served as mediator) discussed his fascinating artistic proclivity for geometric tiling — an endeavour related, in my opinion, to the relationship between mapping a territory and the territory itself. I spoke with Dr Penrose mostly to inquire and to learn, as his knowledge roams far afield from mine, and was well-rewarded in my efforts, as our conversation literally ned the micro- and macro-cosmic realms. I spoke with Dr Dawkins (after long, tentative and increasingly amicable correspondence beforehand) to clarify my ignorance of his well-defended positions, particularly in relationship to his opposition to religious belief and behavior. Suffice it to say in the latter case that we have much more to talk about. I greatly enjoyed both opportunities and will be releasing a video recording of the former and an audio of the latter in the very near future.I believe that these conversations went very well. I certainly found them intensely engrossing and informative. And I regard it as another great privilege and opportunity to place them online, where they will be made available to millions of avid listeners around the world. I can do that because I am a free-speaking citizen of Canada, a member of the British Commonwealth and, except for our own sporadic and inexcusable foolishness, a country shaped to the core by the English Common Law tradition. Furthermore, I can make those discussions and all my talks and seminars at Oxbridge available on YouTube, the technologically-revolutionary platform invented by Americans who were even at the time of their revolution and are still now in some real sense sovereign British citizens, insisting on their due and intrinsic rights.And what would the world be without the recognition of those rights? A stifling web of intrigue a system of archaic dynasties a tribal mess of clans, steeped in nepotism, warring with one another for access to the short-term exigencies of power. I realise that there are other lights in the world, apart from the UK and its subsidiaries and once-dependents, although I would argue that even the European countries that profess respect for freedom of speech and thought (in reality, fealty to the ine word, both secular and inescapably religious) have done so in no small part because of the influence of that great land. And the fact that Dr Dawkins and I came armed, so to speak, with radically different viewpoints and conceptions was a spur to our very productive conversation, and not an impediment. And the fact that such discussions and their dissemination are possible throughout so much of the world (rather than positively forbidden and fatally dangerous) is another one of the reasons I love Great Britain.My talks at both Cambridge and Oxford appeared uniformly welcomed by faculty and students alike (with a single exception: a rather courageous and comic young woman, dressed in a full-body lobster suit, who popped in during my most public talk at Cambridge to shout “feminism” and dance briefly about). Why was that reception so positive, uniform, and manifold, when I was apparently ignorant and malevolent enough to be banned from the campus only two short years ago? The students at Cambridge remained seated when I entered the hall just prior to my first talk, although they had lined up down the block for most of the day beforehand, while the Oxford crowd, anxious as they are not to be outdone, gave me a (overwhelmingly moving) standing ovation before I spoke there.I say that not in triumph, I hope, as that would be the sort of pride that deservedly invites a fall, although I might need to confess occasionally harbouring at least a quizzical smile about such things. Such a public response seems at curious odds with the idea so invidiously insisted upon that I was and am a fundamentally malign person, characterised by literally unacceptable political opinions. The same mode of interaction made itself evident in what were many dozens of encounters with inidual students on the streets and in the colleges at Oxbridge: no fear, no disgust, no contempt, no hatred — just a series of extremely inviting, pleasant, and often surprisingly deep and intimate inidual encounters with fine mostly young people, striving with all due effort upward and onward, informing me forthrightly that they were doing so.  Perhaps an inquiring and curious journalist could discuss, among other issues, the fact of my fellowship revocation, the Regent House vote, and the positive response to my presence at Cambridge with the soon-to-depart Vice Chancellor (another Canadian — we are a pesky and intrusive lot), Prof Stephen Toope, whose precipitous retirement from the glorious UK academic and cultural scene was somewhat synchronistically timed, given the aforementioned vote and my subsequent re-invitation. Or, perhaps it could all be discussed with the tiny number of iniduals, still meddling madly and unrepentantly behind the scenes, who orchestrated the whole false thing in the beginning. And the fact that a journalist could inquire about such things is yet another reason why I love Great Britain, with its profound commitment to the idea that the curious have the right to interrogate and investigate those who have been granted authority or usurped power.After our university sojourn — after having been granted access to the original writings of Charles Darwin and Isaac Newton, after attending the most beautiful imaginable choir-accompanied services at the magnificent chapels gracing both institutions, after walking down the hallowed historical halls of higher learning in a setting constantly overwhelming and remarkable for a mere colonial, accustomed to history on a much more minor scale — my wife and I were privileged to tour the British Parliament, accompanied by one of the peers of the realm.And she was great, if I might be so bold to say so: everything a hopeful outsider uncorrupted by the pervasive cynicism that corrupts our time might have wished for — kind, charitable, engaging, unpretentious, articulate, elegant, and possessed of that wonderful accent, bestowing upon its possessor the immediate impression of high intelligence. In the Palace of Westminster I stopped for a moment at the precise centre of the heart of that remarkable building and lifted my eyes upward directly under the immense chandelier suspended under the beautiful and ornate domed octagonal ceiling. I perceived then that I was standing at the base of the realisation in stone, wood, and the air itself of the Cosmic Tree, Yggdrasil itself, the liana joining heaven and earth, the object of the most ancient of sacred visions and religious transports, the very lifeline between the skies that beckon forever above and the suffering and fallen ground we tread upon. If I could have asked for something more to befall me at that moment it would have been the music of the ine to accompany that vision, perhaps Bach’s great third Brandenburg Concerto, although I would have settled for the British national anthem, God Save the Queen. That lobby is most certainly not the untrustworthy, corrupt and damnable site of power, dominance and oppression, but the very place where the practical redemption of a great people is continually undertaken, governed by the transcendent and necessary principle of the unalienable right to express the Logos as conscience, soul and rationality itself dictate. That lobby, enshrined in that Palace — that cardinal Castle of the Word — has been a very light unto the world, concretised and embodied there simultaneously in stone, tradition and living action. It is the very place where the sovereign voice of the people meets the voice of its representatives, to be carried forth into its eventual incarnation into the body of laws we separately and jointly accept, adopt and act out. We are all carriers of the temptation to resentment and the desire to compel and force those who disagree with our presumptions that poses an eternal threat to the integrity of our souls and our societies. We are all possessed by the attributes of the Auschwitz capo — the Gulag trusty: the willingness to turn away and to consciously deceive, and the capacity to delight in oppression and cruelty. We are each and all of us tainted by the blood that soaks our soil.But the people of Great Britain have granted the world a gift whose power stands in permanent opposition to our most appalling proclivities as iniduals and societies. That gift is the political expression of the sanctification of the word — freedom in speech, imagination and thought: freedom to engage in the very process that builds and rebuilds habitable order itself from the chaos that eternally surrounds us. And that freedom is expressed in many ways, small and great, in the British Isles: in the wit of its people, in the effectiveness of its institutions, in the beauty of its art and literature, in the political and psychological presumptions that guide private discourse and public conception and action. And that is most particularly why I love Great Britain. And that is why, people of that realm (and not only of that realm), you should love her too, despite her sins, with your eyes lifted upward, your hope to the future, and the word of truth and faith on your tongues.I love your country.More from News\u0026#39Ministry of Fear\u0026#39 fails to unnerve Tory vaccine passport rebelsMen caught wolf whistling or bothering women should be prosecuted, police toldUK demands changes to Northern Ireland Protocol so businesses can get Covid supportJK Rowling ‘erased’ from Fantastic Beasts trailer in wake of more transphobia accusationsThe Tory grassroots will never forgive BorisPharmacies told they cannot have extra rapid Covid tests, even though entire cities have run outMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"omicron less severe covid delta variant two vaccine jabs give","story":"Britain\u0027s omicron wave may be no worse than a flu pandemic, an expert has said, as the first major study into the new variant suggests it is less severe than delta.The first real-world study looking at 78,000 omicron cases in South Africa found the risk of hospitalisation is 29 per cent lower compared with the Wuhan strain, and 23 per cent lower than delta, with vaccines holding up well.Far fewer people have also needed intensive care from omicron, with just five per cent of cases admitted to ICU compared to 22 per cent of delta patients, the study shows.Professor Robert Dingwall, a government Covid adviser, from Nottingham Trent University, said it was clear from the South African data that panic was unjustified. Speaking in a personal capacity, Prof Dingwall said: “The omicron situation seems to be increasingly absurd. There is obviously a lot of snobbery about South African science and medicine but their top people are as good as any you would find in a more universally developed country.“They clearly don’t feel that the elite panic over here is justified, even allowing for the demographic differences in vulnerability – which are probably more than cancelled by the higher vaccination rate. My gut feeling is that omicron is very much like the sort of flu pandemic we planned for – a lot of sickness absence from work in a short period, which will create difficulties for public services and economic activity, but not of such a severity as to be a big problem for the NHS and the funeral business.”He offered his assessment as it emerged the Liberal Democrats leader, Labour shadow chancellor, Labour shadow transport secretary and Labour shadow education secretary have all tested positive for the virus.Daily reported cases rose to 59,610, an increase of 12.1 per cent in the past week. However, the number of tests carried out has risen 12.4 per cent in the same period, and the percentage of people testing positive is relatively stable at around 10 per cent. The data from South Africa, which was compiled by Discovery Health, its largest private health insurer, and the South Africa Medical Research Council (SAMRC), found that although there were high numbers of breakthrough infections in people who had been vaccinated, cases appeared to be less severe, and this was backed up by anecdotal evidence from doctors on the ground.They found that effectiveness against infection dropped from 80 per cent to 33 per cent but offered 70 per cent protection against hospital admissions, and this was maintained across age groups and chronic conditions. At the time of the study there had been no deaths.Professor Glenda Geray, of SAMRC, said: “It’s very heartening to see these results and release that vaccine effectiveness is still greater than 50 per cent. So it’s encouraging and again – the booster strategy may also mitigate the reduction in vaccine effectiveness.“I think it’s too early for us to make that call but we can say that prior infection and vaccination are affecting the reduction of admission and serious illness. And we’re seeing a shorter duration in hospitalisation.“People who have been vaccinated are staying in hospital just 2.4 days.”The study also showed that the odds of reinfection were lower than during delta, suggesting that people who had a delta infection may be better protected.The researchers said that although excess natural deaths had increased in South Africa in recent weeks, they were still significantly lower than during previous waves. Ryan Noach, chief executive of Discovery Health, said: “You can see clearly that in omicron, the adult population has a 29 per cent lower risk of admission.If you look at the proportion of patients admitted to high care in ICU for severe illness, across the first three waves, the proportion of patients in high care and ICU collectively goes up to 35 per cent, whereas in this omicron period, it is only about 13 per cent.“The data is correlating with the anecdotal feedback. At this point, there is hope the severity is lower. Excess natural deaths are significantly lower than in previous waves despite the rapid growth in infections.”At the science and technology select committee, Kate Bingham, who led the Government’s vaccine programme, said the data from South Africa were encouraging. “It may be omicron is a more mild disease.

However, the dean’s supporters claim that this loophole is being “exploited” in a bid to remove him.The mental incapacitation clause was added in a redraft of the college\u0027s statute in 2011, but a bylaw dating from August 2021 enabled other members of the governing body - not just the dean - to initiate action on medical grounds.One supporter, who is close to the case and who spoke on condition of anonymity, said: “Everyone in Oxford knows what this is about. A few people on the Christ Church governing body are determined to get rid of their dean at any cost.“They are frustrated because the Charity Commission is not prepared to let them spend vast amounts on a trumped-up tribunal. So now they are trying to declare that he is mad. I can assure you that Martyn Percy is not mad.“Anyone who has been to one of his recent lectures or read his recent book will know that he has one of the sharpest minds in academia.”The college has admitted that to date it has spent more than £1million in legal and PR costs in its 2019 attempt to oust the dean. However, the final figure is expected to be far higher.According to the summons document, Prof Lindsay Judson, the senior ex-censor and philosophy tutor, has “considered the matter very carefully and having taken legal and medical advice”, has concluded that “the dean’s condition or any mental or physical quality affecting him is such as substantially to interfere with the performance of his duties”.As a result, he is “obliged to consider the removal of the dean” in accordance with college statutes, and that “the dean’s removal on medical grounds should be considered and therefore that the case should be forwarded to a medical board”.Prof Judson, who signed off the summons, has been involved in previous proceedings regarding the dean. However, the document states that the professor “does not believe that he has a conflict of interest” in any part of the process.It also sets out that a special meeting of the governing body will be convened to consider the matter regarding the dean, and that one of its members - who “shall have some experience of the mental or physical incapacity apparently affecting” him - will be nominated to sit on a board.The governing body will also get to decide upon the two medically-qualified people to act as chairmen of the board.In contrast, the dean will only be allowed to nominate one person to sit on this board to decide whether or not he is mentally incapacitated. However, if he fails to nominate someone “reasonably expeditiously”, Prof Judson will nominate someone for him.The second ongoing tribunal is the latest effort to force out the dean, and follows an alleged incident of sexual harassment in Christ Church Cathedral in October.Thames Valley Police said it had conducted a thorough investigation into the matter at the time, adding: Our investigation has now concluded and the matter has been filed pending further information coming to light.However, the college set up its own internal probe into the incident and is now preparing to use it as the basis to remove him from his post.Allies of the dean claimed it is certainly not a safeguarding issue but part of a long-running persecution of him by other senior dons which has become a vendetta .When approached for comment, a spokesperson for the college said that there were “serious inaccuracies” in the claims. However, they refused to clarify what the inaccuracies were.The spokesperson added: “You will understand that we have a duty of care to the dean as we do with all staff and students at Christ Church, and so we are unable to make any comment on what is a sensitive HR matter.”More from News\u0026#39Ministry of Fear\u0026#39 fails to unnerve Tory vaccine passport rebelsMen caught wolf whistling or bothering women should be prosecuted, police toldUK demands changes to Northern Ireland Protocol so businesses can get Covid supportJK Rowling ‘erased’ from Fantastic Beasts trailer in wake of more transphobia accusationsThe Tory grassroots will never forgive BorisPharmacies told they cannot have extra rapid Covid tests, even though entire cities have run outMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"pharmacies told cannot have extra rapid covid tests even though","story":"NHS Test and Trace has told pharmacies that it cannot deliver any extra rapid Covid tests, despite entire cities running out by lunchtime on Tuesday, The  can reveal.During an emergency meeting on Tuesday, officials claimed it was “not possible logistically” to increase supplies to pharmacies beyond a single carton per day.Health leaders were even told that orders would be “paused temporarily” in some regions, despite Downing Street’s claim that millions of the Chinese-made kits are in warehouses across the country.During the meeting, healthcare bosses pleaded with the Government to stop directing people to pharmacies for the tests after Boris Johnson insisted there were “ample supplies in the shops”. Staff were being “abused” by frustrated customers unable to test themselves for the omicron variant, the officials heard.Sajid Javid, the Health Secretary, has advised anyone planning to mix with friends and family to take a lateral flow test beforehand to avoid catching or spreading the omicron variant. Senior Tories said the Government’s failure to quickly distribute rapid tests would lead many people to fear they cannot “socialise safely” and “inevitably cancel their plans over Christmas”. The Government website again suspended home deliveries of rapid devices, despite new rules requiring double-jabbed contacts of Covid cases to test themselves for a week.A  analysis of the NHS website found that there were also no tests available at pharmacies within 30 miles of multiple postcodes in England by lunchtime on Tuesday, including entire cities such as Bath, Bristol and Wolverhampton. Some shops began selling single boxes for around £20, as customers complained the free tests were nowhere to be found.Alastair Buxton, director of NHS Services at Pharmaceutical Negotiating Services Committee, which represents all 11,200 pharmacies in England, said officials had refused to lift a cap on daily deliveries of a single carton of 60 to 80 boxes of tests.“We have sought to increase the number of cartons of tests that all pharmacies can order but have been told this is simply not possible, logistically,” said Mr Buxton.“We have also asked the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) not to direct more and more people to pharmacies, in light of the challenges that pharmacies are currently facing.”Care home bosses said the shortage of available tests had already forced visitors to stay away from their loved ones, and threatened to leave vulnerable elderly people on their own for the festive period.Nadra Ahmed, chairman of the National Care Association, said: “Some providers are telling us that they haven’t been able to get hold of the tests through the Government site. “Soon we will have to prioritise our remaining tests for our staff, and stop giving them to visitors. That will mean a lot of elderly and vulnerable people spending Christmas without seeing their loved ones.”There were also problems with PCR tests with the government website saying there were none available in Hertfordshire, Suffolk, Berkshire, the Isle of Wight, Middlesex, Bristol and Mendip.Ministers have claimed there is no shortage of the tests, with millions of the Chinese-made kits lying in warehouses across the country.Amazon has been brought in to help boost deliveries alongside the Royal Mail. A Downing Street spokesman said 230,000 boxes were sent out through the website on Monday before the slots ran out. From 8pm Saturday to 8pm Sunday, the figure was around 370,000. Ministers are hoping capacity will increase over the course of the week, the spokesman added.Mark Harper MP, former chief whip and the chairman of the Covid Recovery Group of backbenchers, said: “Given ministers’ focus on encouraging people to use lateral flow tests to ensure they are able to socialise safely, it’s essential that ministers ensure supplies of tests are available when and where people need them.“A failure to do so might lead to people inevitably cancelling their plans over Christmas, which is not an outcome anyone wants to see.”Mr Harper suggested that supplies were running dry because the Government caused “panic” with its “language about emergencies”. He said “calmness” was now needed.Dominic Raab, the Deputy Prime Minister, insisted the issue with ordering lateral flow tests from the Government website was not due to a lack of the tests.“The problem isn\u0027t supply and volume, the problem is the allocation and distribution, or the delivery, of it,” he told the BBC.“We know that in relation to the online system there were some challenges and that\u0027s partly because of the proportion they\u0027ve got each day.“We\u0027re making sure that however people may wish to order them and procure them, we\u0027re ramping up not just the capacity ... but the ability to distribute and to deliver.”A UKHSA spokesman said: “We are working with pharmacies to respond to this unprecedented demand for lateral flow tests. “We have processes in place to increase orders as requested by inidual pharmacies and there is no shortage of lateral flow tests.”More from News\u0026#39Ministry of Fear\u0026#39 fails to unnerve Tory vaccine passport rebelsMen caught wolf whistling or bothering women should be prosecuted, police toldUK demands changes to Northern Ireland Protocol so businesses can get Covid supportJK Rowling ‘erased’ from Fantastic Beasts trailer in wake of more transphobia accusationsThe Tory grassroots will never forgive BorisTory Covid rebels deal hammer blow to Boris Johnson\u0026#39s authorityMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"at last tories face up","story":"At last Tories face up to fact charlatan Johnson is unfit to lead a great countryCharlatan Boris Johnsons power is clearly seeping away after tonights revolt by almost  Tory MPs - the writing is clearly on the wall for the worst Prime Minister this side of the Second World WarBoris Johnson is the worst Prime Minister this side of the Second World War Image: Getty ImagesopinionByVoice of the Mirror:,  Dec | commentsBoris Johnson is haemorrhaging authority after a record, thumping rebellion by almost  Conservative MPs.

Evenbooster jabs are found to be effective against Omicron, they projected a wave of infection which could lead to a peak of more than , daily hospital admissions.MPs are due to vote on Plan B restrictions in the Commons later, with Boris Johnson facing a major Tory revolt over plans for Covid passports for nightclubs and large events. It comes after Mr Johnson warned his Cabinet “a huge spike of Omicron was coming” and said a model claiming , people got infected with the iant yesterday was “valid”. Chief Medical Officer Professor Chris Whitty also reportedly told the Cabinet that pubs, shops and restaurants could be forced to shut in January due to staff shortages caused by Omicron. Dr Hopkins was grilled about the need for restrictions by the Commons Science and Technology Committee. Asked by Tory Committee chair Greg Clark on the exit strategy from Covid curbs, she said: This is our fourth time going into something like this.The waves last a period of time and the more the restrictions are effective, then the smaller the peak, and therefore you can reduce andle to normal. She said boosting the population was likely to reduce hospitalisations - and limit the strain on the NHS.Asked when restrictions could be lted based on the modelling so far, she said: So I think thatthe modelling that the London School has done [is right], I would expect that there is going to be needing some level of restrictions in place for the next four to eight weeks.” It came as Downing Street today refused again to rule out bringing in new restrictions before Christmas. Whitehall officials have reportedly been drawing up tighter curbs for England - that could include limiting pubs and restaurants to outdoor dining. They could even be forced to shut their doors entirelyit means people can see their families at Christmas. The PM’s spokesman insisted Plan B measures - which stop short of restrictions on pubs - “were balanced and proportionate”. But he refused to rule out further restrictions, calling them speculation and hypothetical”, and saying only that there weren’t “plans” to bring them in.  Asked about reports furlough could be brought backpubs have to shut, he replied: “I’m not going to get into hypotheticals - no plans.” And he refused to rule out bringing in restrictions while MPs are on their Christmas break. The spokesman said: “What we are saying is we want to introduce the measures as set out in Plan B, which will help reduce transmission whilst we get more boosters in arms, which is the biggest single action we can take. “As I’ve said on a number of occasions, we need to learn more about this iant on things like severity before we decide what,any, action is required in the future.” He added: “Obviously we will always want to ensure Parliament will have its say, should there be any requirements to make changes. “In extremis, as the public would expect, we have the ability in the interests of public health to make changes.” Askedchanges could be made while MPs are on recess he replied: “It would depend on the circumstances.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Coronavirus\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

It shows  people crowded together - in blatant breach of lockdown rules - in a medium-sized room in the party’s Westminster HQ.Some of the group are shown wearing paper hats while one is sporting a House of Commons Christmas jumper.The event, organised by top Tory Shaun Bailey ’s mayoral campaign, took place on December  last year when London was in Tier .After he was approached by the Mirror tonight, Mr Bailey dramatically quit as chair of the London Assembly’s police and crime committee.  The image also shows several guests - including billionaire Tory donor Nick Candy - raising glasses of wine while a catered buffet features prominently. One of the revellers was a senior figure on Boris Johnsonaposs leadership election campaign. It emerged last week that Tory staff danced and drank wine late into the night and revellers damaged a door at what was described as a “raucous” event.  At the time, the capital was in Tier  restrictions which banned any social mixing between households indoors.The party took place the day before the No  festive quiz, where Boris Johnson was pictured as quizmaster, and four days ahead of the Downing Street Christmas bash.Hours before the party then health secretary Matt Hancock announced that the capital would move into tougher Tier  restrictions. Tory insiders suggested tonight that party chairman Oliver Dowden was appalled by the photograph of the festive event. The Conservatives have said that “formal disciplinary action” had been taken against four CCHQ staff seconded to the campaign. A spokesman said: “Senior CCHQ staff became aware of an unauthorised social gathering in the basement of [CCHQ] organised by the Bailey campaign on the evening of th December. “Formal disciplinary action was taken against the four CCHQ staff who were seconded to the Bailey campaign.”  Scotland Yard has until now refused to investigate the Christmas gatherings citing a lack of evidence. Labour deputy leader Angela Rayner said: “This is damning new evidence of a party, with a buffet, drinks, Christmas attire and absolutely no social distancing held at Conservative Party HQ.“Shaun Bailey is an elected official that is clearly breaking Covid regulations in this photo and encouraging the same of his staff. “Whilst everyone  was making sacrices to keep their community safe, the chair of the Police and Crime committee in the Greater London Authority was partying. “His position as chair was untenable and he knew that.” Mr Bailey, who does not drink alcohol, is said to have left the party early in the evening, shortly after the picture was taken. A Shaun Bailey campaign spokesperson said: “On the evening of  December , at the end of the working day, the campaign hosted a post-work event to thank campaign staff for their efforts over the course of they year. “This was a serious error of judgement and we fully accept that gathering like this as that time was wrong and apologise unreservedly”. A spokesperson for Mr Candy said: “Nick Candy attended the office of the Shaun Bailey campaign for an end of year review on  December . He gave a short thank you speech to the team and spent some time with Shaun Bailey to discuss campaign matters before leaving shortly afterwards.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Scotland YardConservative PartyGreater London AuthorityShaun BaileyBoris JohnsonCrimePoliticsCoronavirusDowning Street Christmas PartyChristmas partyTory Government\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

In a statement, the Department of Health and Social Caresaid the -minute wait time is likely to cause more harm than it averts. It said: The Chief Medical Officersof the UK and lead Deputy Chief Medical Officersfor vaccines have considered whether, in the light of the very considerable need to speed up vaccination and boosting in response to Omicron iant, the -minute wait for some mRNA Covid- vaccines should be suspended.  Their view, having considered the views of the Covid- Vaccine Benefit-Risk Expert Working Group , NHS planners and others is that with the low rates of anaphylaxis, in the context of the considerable need for people to be boosted or vaccinated, the -minute wait after a vaccination with mRNA vaccine will cause more harm than it can avert because it will signicantly reduce the number of people who can be vaccinated over a short period of time.The -minute wait should therefore be suspended for first, second and homologous or heterologous boost vaccinations with mRNA vaccine given the current situation, with this operationalised in line with the needs in each of the four nations.  It comes as Boris Johnson accepted a shock model suggesting , people were infected with Omicron yesterday and warned ministers a huge spike is coming. There have been long queues at walk-in vaccine centres as people rush to get their booster jabs before Christmas, while there have also been virtual queues as people try to access the booking system via the NHS website. The DHSC statement added: The CMOs recognise that this will lead to a marginal increase in risk for a very small number of people, but substantially fewer than would be harmed by a slower vaccine rollout in the current public health emergency leading to some citizens not getting boosted or vaccinated prior to exposure to Omicron.This includes a consideration that any prior vaccination and particularly boosting is likely to lessen the likelihood of severe disease arising from Omicron iant infection.  The Prime Minister held a virtual Cabinet meeting for the first time in months in light of the increasing number of Covid cases. Chief Medical Officer Professor Chris Whitty told ministers to expect a signicant increase in hospitalisations as cases rise, but it was too early to say how severe Omicron was, No said. Prof Whitty warned people could have to be turned away from hospitals by mid-January as a Covid wave engulfs hospital staff.  The UK Health Security Agencyhas estimated that the new iant was infecting , people a day as of yesterday. The shock figure is much higher than the recorded cases, which officials say is due to the speed at which the strain spreads and the delay in cases being picked up in official tests. Itaposs understood the , figure is only the mid range of modelling - so it could be even higher. With cases doubling every two to three days, it could theoretically lead to a million infections a day by next week.

No double meaning to Secret Santa this time, then.However, in one important way, this festive season is so far considerably worse than last, because back then we pretty much knew where we stood. It was going to be terrible – the end.This year, the present no one wanted: a massive heap of uncertainty. Oh Omicron, you shouldn’t have.It’s yet another twist on the Corona-coaster. Today is December ... crunch time. If you get infected from now on, your -day isolation will mean no Christmas for you. And perhaps a ripple effect of scrambled plans for othersyou are were meant to be hosting. So what to do  Or rather, what not to  Because while there will be some who no longer pay attention to a word that comes out of the Prime Minister’s mouth regarding restrictions, I believe they will be the minority. We can all see where they’re coming from, relate to their fury, but the reason I wear a mask is not because Boris Johnson told me to. It’s because it’s clearly necessary. One of the jigsaw pieces that will mean this is over faster, and we can start to put ourselves back together again. Most people want to do – will do – the right thing. The problem at the moment is that it’s very dficult to know what that is.Should we be going to our office Christmas parties while we’re working from home  Attending football matches, and other big, potentially superspreading sporting events like the World Darts Championship at Alexandra Palace  Popping round to the neighbours for mince pies  Having drinks with friends  Going to carol services, or even our kids’ nativity plays  In fact, should we be sending our children to school at all, seeing as there are outbreaks in most of them now  Omicron’s timing is perfect for messing our lives up as much as possible – close enough to Christmas to put an enormous question mark of doom over it, but not so early that the experts working round the clock know enough to make a final judgement. Make no mistake – we are very much on our own here. We’re going to have to work out the rules for ourselves. These rules will, presumably, y between us, just as our approaches to Covid have throughout the pandemic, from one extreme to another the cautious to the caution-to-the-wind-ers, and everyone  on the spectrum in-between. Now you have to hope your thinking matches up with anyone you were planning to see, and also try not to worry about the implications of mixing with people whose strategies have opposed yours up until now. Will you only spend Christmas with people who’ve had their booster  Insist on aclause that it must have been two weeks ago, so it’s kicked in  Make negative tests a condition of entry Maybe you’re tempted to admit defeat and cancel the whole thing, focus on having a great one next year instead… just like we did last year.The bitter reality is that we desperately need this Christmas to be exactly what it now cannot be – simple, peaceful, normal .Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON CoronavirusCoronavirus vaccineBoris JohnsonOmicron iantChristmasChristmas DayChristmas partyTory Government\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Thomas Kielinger, , is explaining why he thinks many Europeans regret Brexit. “It’s about the UK’s soft power,” says the Polish-born German who lives in London. “The language, pop culture, music, history, Shakespeare. That’s the predominant reason why Germans are so unhappy about Brexit, because they love Britain sometimes more than Brexiteers love Britain.” To join, see mirror europetalks  Entrepreneur and Brexiteer Saadia Baber, , of High Wycombe, Bucks, disagrees. “Just because I’m not in the EU, I am still part of Europe. We should be proud of the common human values we have.” The chat, hosted by the Goethe Institut in London, was screened to thousands of people across  countries. We discussed topics such as homelessness, EU migrants, sovereignty, empty shelves, flag-waving, imperialism and busking. Fortunately, nobody stormed off the seat and sent us all flying. And towards the end, even vehemently opposed Brexiteers and Remainers found a little common ground.“A lot of us have described ourselves as patriotic and loving our country,” said -year-old Labour councillor Jon-Conor Lyons, from Manchester.“I certainly want to believe in our country and I love Britain. I identy as a Manc, a Briton and a European.” View the full -minute video of the conversation on Vimeo Gosia Cabaj said the UK leaving the EU might have benefited Europe in one way, as it convinced many of her fellow Poles to stay in. Thomas said: “Now you are out of the EU, you only have yourself to blamethings don’t succeed.” Ada Pratt, a retired nursing sister from Rochdale who voted Leave, concluded with: “I think in general, everyone should stop blaming everybody  and talk to one another.” Ada, Jon-Conor, Saadia and Gosia were joined on Seat # by academic Ananya Jahanara Kabir, , Cambridge student Jovan Nepaul, , hotel worker Gisella Sobarasua, , from Nottingham, The New European journalist John Kampfner, and Express political editor David Maddox.  The debate was hosted by the Mirror and the Goethe Institut’s Katharina von Ruckteschell-Katte and screened in a live broadcast from Warsaw, Madrid, Berlin and London to celebrate this year’s Europe Talks. Over the last few weeks, , people, including , from the UK have been matched with people from dferent European countries for a videocall chat. Here are some of the people who met, and how they got on. Michael Bailey and Joan Willson When Brexiteer grandma Joan Willson met Michael Bailey - a former British citizen now living in Austria - the conversation quickly turned to Covid jabs and migration. Speaking at home in Camarthen, west Wales, Joan, , says: “You’re in the luckier spot in Austria – here in Wales, it is a total, utter disaster. We can’t see a doctor and I had a nightmare to get my booster.” Michael, , a translator, says: “I got my two jabs within five weeks of each other and I was literally able to walk in to get my booster.” He asks: “Would it worry youI said I am an immigrant in Austria ”  Joan, who lived in South Africa with her late husband, says: “I have no problem with that, we migrated to South Africa for a better le. We voted for the Conservatives because they had a promise that they would control immigration, but they haven’t. We don’t have jobs for our young people.” Michael says he “begs to dfer” and has helped an Afghan man who “has been through hell”. Angela Gash and Semra Gyokche When Angela Gash, , met Semra Gyokche, , an accountant living in Kardzhali, Bulgaria, she was pleased by Semra’s liberal attitudes. Accountant Angela, from Highbury, North London, said: “The general feeling we have been given about Eastern Europeans is that they can be homophobic and racist.  “I was so happy to see your responses.” Semra, who has gay friends, says, “Everyone is entitled to express themselves as they wish.” Angela went on: “% of us do want to be part of Europe. When we found out we were leaving Europe, I cried.” Semra agrees, adding. “When I came to the UK for a holiday, a lady said to us, ‘we don’t want the Romanians and Bulgarians here.” “I am so sorry you experienced that,” says Angela. Rich O’Mara and Maybritt Langewand Lockdown, the environment and languages were talking points when Rich O’Mara, , chatted to German student Maybritt Langewand, . Living in Wilmslow, Cheshire, with his we and kids, pilot Rich has been to Germany about  times but has struggled to learn the native tongue. He is due to make his first flight in two years and Madrid-based Maybritt has also been hit by the lockdown. The multi-linguist reveals: “University continued online but my mum suffered because we live off tourism. “I worry about our environment”. Rich says: “To be able to fly across Europe for £ is just wrong. There should be a minimum price that reflects its carbon cost.” Maybritt adds: “If you just raise the price, fewer people will use it, but you just exclude people who can’t pay.” Maria Hearl and Sevda Pumova Retired headteacher and vicar Maria Hearl has had pen pals since she was a teenager and jumped at the chance to update the tradition. When she joined a videocall with Sevda Pumova, an accountant, from Pleven, Bulgaria, their conversation came easily. Now they plan to keep in touch with fortnightly Zoom calls. Maria, who lives with her husband in Tiverton, Devon, loves travelling and when she reveals she’s visited Bulgaria, Sevda is impressed. The keen linguist says: “I’ve stayed not very far from where she lives and I’ve got a few phrases in Bulgarian. “The day we left Europe was the worst day of my le.” Sevda, , adds: “I love talking to Maria, she is very opinionated on most things. On most of it we found we have the same position.” Eddy Canfor-Dumas and Sigrid Korner Le after Brexit was the major topic of conversation when Brit Eddy Canfor-Duman got together with Sigrid Korner, , a university lecturer from Frankfurt, Germany, “There is a growing regret, people were lied to,” Eddy says. “There were two Leave campaigns. Farage and co, he appealed to a xenophobic, Little Britain. Then there was the libertarian side that talked about democracy and trade deals.” The -year-old writer from near Watford, adds: “There’s going to be huge buyers’ remorse.” “We were disappointed,” says Sigrid. “We were hoping until the last moment you would remain.” How both countries welcome migrants is another discussion with Sigrid feeling it’s positive although the “German reserve” means the people don’t mingle and stay in their own communities. Eddy adds: “My experience of Germany has been that it’s a much more tolerant society than Britain.” The pair agree to stay in touch.

Josh Asbury, nine, started suffering with fatigue and a lack of appetite after being infected with coronavirus in September.At a visit to his local GP surgery, a physician told parents Andy, , and Heather, , he was likely experiencing after affects of the virus and sent him home. Josh then started complaining of back ache just under his left shoulder blade and a visit to the GP showed air pockets in his lungs and he was sent for a scan. But the schoolboyaposs health quickly deteriorated and he was rushed to hospital by ambulance when he began struggling for breath last month. Doctors at Birmingham Childrenaposs Hospital found he had a collapsed lung and while they were operating they discovered an unusual growth. Tests revealed he had T-lymphoblastic leukemia lymphoma and he was immediately started on an aggressive course of chemotherapy. Dad Andy, of Evesham, Worcs., said: I was just extremely shocked.  Itaposs hard to explain as a parent when you are told you son might have cancer. We got the official diagnosis after two days and weirdly, it was a weight off our shoulders knowing what he had got an there was a plan in place. He had gone into surgery for a collapsed lung and doctors noticed something that didnapost look right. I went off to pick his younger brother up from nursery and then got a call asking us to come back. We thought he was just recovering from his lung surgery but there was a respiratory oncology doctor and a few nurses in the meeting room - we knew it wasnapost good news. It was a massive shock for everybody, even the doctors. Josh started chemotherapy on November  and treatment is expected to last three and a half years.  Residential care manager Andy and Heather, a teaching assistant, believeit wasnapost for Covid then Jackaposs cancer may be never have been discovered. Andy added: We wonapost ever know for sureit was Covid that sped up his diagnosis but some people are saying in a way Covid saved his le. He had a collapsed lung did that happen because of Covid  We just donapost know butit wasnapost for this virus then the cancer may not have been found. The mass on his chest was quite big, it was cm. It doesnapost sound big but when it is on your chest and on your airway, it is quite some size. Luckily, it has started to shrink and has responded to treatment quite well - itaposs now  per cent of what it was. But in  weeks we have gone from having a very fit and healthy boy who would normally be playing football every weekend to one who is very tired and fatigued. Normally he doesnapost sit still, he is always out and about, playing with friends. He never stops. He is very tired and fatigued. I think it is playing with his mental health too - he canapost do the things he would like to do like play football every Saturday. He loves school, at the minute he canapost attend school. The weekend after chemotherapy are always dficult days for him - he was quite sick yesterday. Heaposs just not himself at all. The first six months are weekly chemotherapy, then monthly chemotherapy through medicine and tablets. Seeing the end date of  for chemotherapy is tough to see and leukaemia in boys is always much dficult - it can hide in dferent places. We have shared care with Birmingham and Worcestershire Royal Hospital - they have both been amazing. While battling cancer, Josh has continued to think of other and has used his own pocket money to buy Birmingham Children Hospital badges for his classmates and teachers at Badsey First School. Andy added: He has just been very brave and taken it all on board, although I am not sure how much of it he understands. We have all been very open with him about everything that is going on. Some days he is very sad and down and he just wants to go out with friends. He asks aposwhy me  Why canapost I go out and play apos We do get the occasional smile from him but it takes a lot more now. With restrictions in place, Andy says only one parent can stay in hospital alongside Josh - while the other nominated parent can stay for two hours. Andy said: Itaposs been hard. Heather has spent weeks in hospital and I am trying to keep le as normal as possible for his brother, Jack, who is three-years-old. He struggled with that. Due to visiting restrictions I didnapost see my we for about three and a half weeks. Heather could have come home but she wanted to be there for Josh at all times. We have tried to keep everything normal for Jack, taking him to nursery, and have dinner at home, but he knew Josh was poorly. Now Josh is home it feels similar to the first lockdown. We donapost go out too much and donapost invite people in. It is a massive change. With the family going through such dficult times, Joshaposs aunt, Victoria Jinks, decided to launch a GoFundMe so that Josh could go on holiday once treatment is complete. So far, the fundraiser has received £,. Andy said: It is really crazy. Josh is a huge animal lover so Iaposm sure we will spend it on something animal-related. He has mentioned going to Australia to see the Kangaroos. But it is Joshaposs money so we will wait until he has finished his treatment and then he can decide what he wants to do.Anyone wishing to donate to Joshaposs cause can do so here.Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Childrens HospitalHospitalsLeukaemiaCoronavirusCancer\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Martin Gilbert hit out after travelling on the packed service after his Avanti train from Rugby to Liverpool Lime Street had been cancelled.The -year-old shared footage of the service after having to catch a West Midlands train and change at Crewe, the Liverpool Echo reports.Retired train driver Martin was shocked when he boarded the connection as it was extremely crowded, and many passengers were not wearing masks - despite new restrictions coming in. The video shows that the carriage was full, with all of the seats taken and passengers standing in the aisles. Many people can be seen not wearing a face covering, which are now mandatory on public transport unless people are exempt. West Midlands Trains bosses have described the images of people without masks as disappointing. Martin told the Echo the service from Crewe was very busy due to the Liverpool FC match at Anfield against Aston Villa on Saturday and due to cancellations. He claims despite the train being full, it still stopped at every station from Crewe to Lime Street and people still tried squeezing on the train, with many not wearing masks. Martin said: It was like a Japanese rush hour train where you had to push people on and they were still stopping at all the stations going to Liverpool and people were trying to get on, it was unbelievable. People couldnapost get on and they were squeezing to get on the train and people werenapost wearing masks thataposs the thing. The retired train driver said the journey was so uncomfortable due to it being full and many people not adhering to face covering rules.  He added: Weaposre in an age of covid where we are trying to self distance and it was so uncomfortable. It was like a covid express train and people were still trying to get on the train, even at the next station at Acton Bridge and further along the line. Face masks had already been made compulsory in environments such as shops and public transport on November .On Friday, December , Boris Johnson made this a requirement in more venues.The UK Covid- threat level also increased to Level  due to the spread of the Omicron covid iant. This means transmission of covid is high or rising exponentially. In an address to the nation on Sunday night, the Prime Minister urged everyone eligible to get boosted now, as the Omicron strain of the virus spreads in the UK. He claimed everybody aged  and over will have the chance to get their booster before the New Year, bringing the previous target of boosting all adults by the end of January forward by an entire month. Speaking on Sunday night, he also urged people to not make the mistake of thinking Omicron canapost hurt you. The PM added: At this point our scientists cannot sayit is any less severe, and eventhat were true a wave of Omicron... could lead to many deaths. A spokesperson for West Midlands Trains said: “Face coverings are once again, mandatory on all public transport, unless you have an exemption. It is disappointing when those who can choose not to wear a face covering which serves to protect everyone on the train.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Public transportCoronavirus\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

When you get older, your scribbles as a child hold a lot of sentimentality - and one doting dad found the perfect way to preserve them. James Dickinson, , decided to have the drawings inked onto his leg - in order to immortalise it forever. He visited the tattoo studio Northside Tattooz, in Newcastle Upon Tyne armed with a carefully chosen selection of drawings - and artist Kara Chambers artfully brought it to le. He chose a drawing of Ariel, from The Little Mermaid, drawn by niece Evelyn, seven, followed by a pic of The Incredible Hulk, done by Nephew Oliver, five, and Lord Voldermort, of Harry Potter fame, by his own son Ashlan, seven.Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here Tattoo artist James, who runs Tattoos at Pins and Needles, Newcastle, said: “There were three children who did the drawings. The Little Mermaid one was done by my niece a few years ago which I’ve been saying all that time I wanted to get tattooed. “My nephew did the Hulk one and my son did the Voldemort one this year because he wanted to put one of his drawings up in my tattoo booth amongst my drawings for the customers so they could see it. It just seemed a better idea than getting names they are s**t hot little drawings they’ve done, and I thought that theyaposd make for a badass tattoo. “I felt really good at the sitting. Me and Kara are friends and I trusted her completely to put her artistic spin onto the drawings the kids have done. She is an insanely talented artist, and I gave her free rein to do what she wanted with the background. “I couldn’t have got a better person to do it I knew she would smash out the park, but she went way beyond that. “People’s reactions are between utter disbelief and can’t believe she translated it that well into a tattoo. Kara got the colours so bang on and made it look like the true kidsapos drawings came to le on my leg. “All the kids love it. They don’t fully understand that it’s permanent at their age.

Almost all of us will be tucking into a selection box of choccies this festive season, and while every family have their favourite brand, the big four remain the same - Heroes, Quality Street, Roses, and Celebrations. But for those of us old enough to remember the ious chocolates that used to be in each of the selections, chomping on the newer line-ups just doesn’t feel the same. Whether it’s the white chocolate Dream bars that used to be in Heroes boxes, the coffee cremes from Roses, or my personal favourite, the Galaxy truffles that were removed from Celebrations – we all have that one flavour we just can’t get our hands on anymore. Surrey Live has compiled a list of all  flavours of chocolate that have been removed from the big four selection boxes over the years – but which one will you be missing the most this Christmas Quality Street Tins of Quality Street have been around since , and with an impressive -year history, it’s unsurprising the chocolates included in the box have changed.

The British Medical AssociationChair, Dr Chaand Nagpaul, on Monday responded to the Government’s announcement that everyone in England over the age of  would receive a booster jab by the end of December.“Despite describing the current situation as an ‘emergency’ with a ‘tidal wave’ of infections on the horizon, the Government’s response relying entirely on the vaccine booster programme is missing the wider measures required to control the spread of Omicron,” Dr Nagpaul said. “The booster jab is an essential weapon in the fight against Omicron, and doctors in particular GPs and their teams when supported will be doing everything they can to create capacity to rise to this challenge to protect the nation at this time of urgent need.” But the doctor went on to explain that such measures included protecting millions of people who would not be eligible for the booster programme by the end of December.His call for action comes as the UK Health Security Agencyyesterday said the Omicron iant is causing an estimated , new infections per day. The staggering figure raises questions about whether there will be a need for fresh restrictions, with Boris Johnson refusing three times to rule out doing so before Christmas. Online bookings for over-s open on Tuesday, while - year-olds will be able to book their booster jabs from Wednesday. However, Dr Nagpaul said it was estimated that  in  people would not be eligible for a booster by the end of December, because they will either currently be unvaccinated, or somewhere in the process of having the first two doses. “Most are younger people, who are often the most socially mobile and most likely to inadvertently spread Covid, he said. Dr Nagpaul said the signicant number of Brits that would not be due their booster for months into the new year was one of the key reasons as to why we needed additional protections over and above the vaccination programme.  The doctor said “robust infection control measures” were needed in the community, especially where people mix in indoor settings. Eight measures proposed with the aim of slowing the spread of Omicron included mandatory wearing of face masks to be extended to all hospitality settings, unless eating or drinking, as well as reintroducing two-metre social distancing rules in all indoor public settings. Dr Nagpaul, on behalf of the BMA, also proposed lateral flow tests are used in a more widespread sense before social mixing in all settings.This suggestion was made by the BMA just hours before the news broke that Coronavirus lateral flow tests had run outagain for the second day in a row.On Tuesday morning a new message on the gov.uk website said ,  and  did not have access to any more tests - as well as none being available for home deliveries. Dr Nagpaul said lateral flow tests should be “the norm” and the expectation for entry to all hospitality venues, regardless of vaccination status. The BMA recommendations also included limiting large indoor gatherings that risk accelerating the spread of the virus, and introducing legal requirements on ventilation in indoor public and educational settings. FFP masks were recommended, in particular for those who were clinically vulnerable, and the reintroduction of infection control measures was recommended in healthcare settings, including FFP masks where healthcare workers are seeing patients suspected or actual cases. Finally, the BMA recommendations said in addition to the Government ensuring enforcement and adherence of these measures, financial support should be made available to businesses that would be adversely impacted by their implementation.  “The BMA is calling for the Government to rethink its policy on vaccine passports based on being double vaccinated,” Dr Nagpaul said. “Omicron has shted the goalposts with studies showing you need the booster to be sufficiently protected against this new iant.”Dr Nagpaul said the NHS was severely understaffed, which meant that delivering a mass booster programme as well as treating surges in infections while maintaining normal services, appointments and treatments was “potentially impossible”.“Government must face the reality of that,” he said. “General practice in particular is facing signicant workforce shortages, meaning GPs and their teams cannot do everything for everyone all at the same time.” There are signicant backlog pressures within the NHS and large volumes of urgent unmet need that simply cannot be delayed. We are discussing with the Government and NHSEI how we can ensure patients get the care they need now and in the coming months.” Finally, Dr Nagpaul called on the Government to “be honest” with the public about the impact of this new wave of infection on current healthcare services. “This must not result in hardworking doctors being blamed, scapegoated, or subject to abuse for the reduction in access to routine services in hospital and general practice,” he said. “This is not about introducing lockdown restrictions, but about safeguarding the NHS whilst maintaining a ing society in a safe and responsible manner in the context of an exceptionally transmissible new iant.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON British Medical AssociationNHSHospitalsCoronavirus\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The Omicron iant today becoming the dominant iant in London, and the government has introduced a raft of new measures in an attempt to curb the spread of the iant, including introducing daily testing for everyone who has come into contact with a positive case.The first UK cases of Omicron were only confirmed on November  and the speed of its spread has alarmed ministers and prompted a dramatic acceleration of the booster jab programme. Got a story  Email webnews@mirror  The UK Health Security Agency has previously projected that Omicron could become the dominant iant across the country by the middle of the month. So far one person is confirmed to have died from the Omicron iant - but their age or vaccination status isnapost known.The ZOE Covid app, which logs submissions from millions of users across the UK, has begun to hint at the iantaposs ability to evade vaccine-induced antibodies, the Express reports.Tim Spector, Professor of Genetic Epidemiology at King’s College London, who heads up the ZOE Covid study app, explained the symptoms being reported in those double or triple jabbed. A regular ZOE user entertained a th birthday party gathering with  guests, he told Good Morning Britain. All of them had taken lateral flow tests prior to the gathering. On Sunday they were informed that one of the guests - who happened to be a teacher - had tested positive and the following week  out of  had fallen ill in some way.  They were subsequently informed by NHS test and trace that it was Omicron or probable Omicron and they were waiting to get the genetic sequencing confirmations. According to the professor, the symptoms they reported were pretty mild.Quite a few of them had nausea, slight temperature, sore throats and headaches, he said.Although nobody was bad enough to need a doctor or go to hospital, all had been double and triple vaccinated, added Prof Spector. The fact that none of the cases required medical assistance indicates that the vaccines clearly reduced the severity of the illness, he noted. It now appears the current wave will result in a far higher peak amid warnings that Omicron cases could reach as high as one million a day. NHS England have scrapped the -minute wait for patients after theyaposve have their Pfizer Covid jabbed to speed up the booster programme.They have done away with the quarter-of-an-hour sit-down so more doses can be administered.  The isolation rules have also changed, with those who have come into contact with a positive case expected to do a daily lateral flow test. But todayaposs stats arrive after it emerged no PCR Covid test slots are left in areas of England today.Hertfordshire, Suffolk, the Isle of Wight, Bristol, and Mendip currently have no PCR tests - the gold standard of coronavirus tests - available to the general public at walk-in and drive-in test sites.The governments booking site previously said there are none available at every region in England while some slots are still available at sites in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. The site has since been updated with most areas having slots available again.Meanwhile, a decision on whether to vaccinate children as young as five could come in the next  days, the head of the UKaposs vaccine advisory group has said.Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON CoronavirusOmicron iant\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The bathroom of the Hardysapos three-bedroom house has been locked off since the start of November, when waves of poo and sewer waste started bursting up through the toilet into their property. In addition to the sewage, the home is infested with rodents that gnaw through their kitchen cupboards and also poo everywhere. Concerned dad Sam, , says his young children, aged between one and nine, are becoming chronically ill with sickness and diarrhoea. He is also anxious about his -week pregnant partner Rachel, and the health of his unborn seventh child. Mum Rachel says the family havenapost been able to shower or bathe for six weeks. She said the council promised a fix on Friday, but that nothing was resolved and my kids have to without a wash even longer. The council has since said it has visited the property and it was awaiting confirmation the drain had been unblocked. Rachel told The Sun : They just donapost care about us, they see us as scum, but we are desperate.My kids deserve better and shouldnapost have to live like this, and Sam and I constantly feel stressed and depressed. With no other options, the couple have had to fill up a small bath, which is designed for babies, with a kettle in order to wash the kids and themselves. For four hours yesterday, they plunged their bare hands into the drain to unblock it, because a maintenance worker failed to do so, they claim. When itaposs time to wash in the tiny makesht bath, Rachel lays blankets on the kitchen floor, but says the family shouldnapost have to do so in the modern age. A nine-year-old should not be washing in a baby bath. This is , not , she adds. Sam claims the council are refusing to help the family, and heaposs had enough of dealing with them.Sam, from Southsea in Portsmouth, Hampshire, said: My kids shouldnapost have to live like this.The sewage is squirting out from the downstairs toilet all over the floor. Every time we use the shower or flush the toilet upstairs, the toilet downstairs will start filling up and sewage will start spewing over and coming out of dferent pipes. Sam says there is an outdoor drain thataposs also blocked and leaking sewage. On top of having to constantly clear the home and garden of fecal matter and toilet roll, the home is also infested with mice. Every single night the couple wake up to find the mice have plundered the kitchen, and nibbled through the cupboards and shelves. Sam claims the council hasnapost lted a finger to help despite the issue continuing for nearly two months. He believes itaposs because he owes the council £, which heaposs steadily repaying, after a benefit change. And he claims the council have told him that they will help once he repays his outstanding debt. The couple got social services, their midwe, and the kidaposs school to write to the council, but they havenapost done anything except asking for their money.  The horric living conditions have left the couple suffering with depression and anxiety as they feel trapped and hopeless. They claim the kids, aged one, three, four, five, six and nine, are visiting the doctors often with conditions they link to the situation. In a desperate attempt to find out whataposs wrong with them, they even phone  because we were so worried. But  told them itaposs unlikely it will be the mice and sewage. A spokesperson for Portsmouth City Council told The Mirror: Council officers attended the property on Wednesday last week and an order was raised for a drain to be unblocked on Friday.  We are waiting for confirmation that the drain was unblocked. We will also be helping the tenants clear the front and rear gardens, treat for mice and carry out any other repairs that are required. In a separate statement shared to The Sun, the council said they are not withholding any services from the family and have made several visits to the home. They claimed to have taken appropriate action, and that they werenapost notied about sewage at the property. The council added that a housing officer will be in touch with tenants and visit to investigate the situation.

She was still giving her baby milk at  months old.  “I telephoned social services, and I was with Frankie and Star when social services rang her to tell her they were coming to see her in an hour. I thought it was a bit stupid, as it was like ringing a criminal and telling them they are going to come round and arrest them in an hour. “Frankie spent the whole hour cleaning and tidying the house, we were at her mum Yvonne’s and getting Star all nicely sorted, covering up bruises. “In the end it was two police officers that arrived, not social workers. I was holding Star and they spoke to Frankie. I think social services tried to see Frankie again but she was not at home. “I later got a telephone call from social services telling me they are closing the case because Star is ‘safe in the hands of her mother. “I honestly feel quite gutted about the jury’s verdict on Frankie, I thought she should have been found guilty of manslaughter. I’m happy that Star has got some justice and really happy Savannah was found guilty of murder. But social services should have done more.” Hollie said she felt “really angry” and that “social services need to step up more” adding: “I’m just really gutted because I think changes really need to be made becausethey took my referral seriously, potentially Star wouldn’t be gone.” In February Frankie and Brockhill split and Star went to live with her great grandparents until the end of April because her mum was ‘struggling’. On May th, Frankie’s grandmother Anita Smith referred her granddaughter to social services after another relative told her Brockhill had been ‘slam choking’ Star. Together with her partner David Fawcett, the great grandmother looked after Star for ten weeks when Frankie couldn’t cope. Frankie managed to persuade them her grandmother’s report was ‘malicious’ because she was in a same-sex relationship with a ‘gypsy’. She then banned her grandmother from seeing Star and social services closed the case without informing Anita. In June Alicia Szepler, Smith’s sister and Star’s aunt, sends photographs of bruises to the police and speaks to officers. On June st, Star’s student father, Jordan Hobson, also made a referral to social services after he was sent a photo of his daughter’s bruised face. Police again visited their home and saw the markings on the baby’s head. This was the third referral.  Police, along with a social services representative, took Frankie and Star to Bradford Royal Infirmary that day, but she was seen by a doctor with only four months’ experience in child safely who saw the injuries in isolation and accepted the excuses that the toddler had bumped into a coffee table knob and hurt her leg playing with a puppy. On June rd Rachel Whiteley, a friend of Frankie’s mother, made a social services referral after observing her behaviour at a family barbecue. But  days later social services closed the case. On September nd, Frank Smith, Star’s paternal great-grandfather, made a social services referral after seeing a video of bruises on the infant’s face. Social services visited Frankie but were told she was in Scotland. On an unannounced visit next day, when Frankie was present with Brockhill, social workers observed the flat was clean, tidy and warm. They found a faint bruise to Star’s cheek and a bruise on her right shin. Star was unsteady on her feet and walked into a sofa while social services were present. Frankie said Star had fallen down the stairs. Social services closed the case on September th after the social worker concluded the referral was malicious.  Although the final referral was closed on th September, social services were still in contact with Frankie Smith right up until the day of Star’s death. Smith was due to meet the social worker on September nd, the day Star was murdered, but the meeting was put off for three days. The social worker sent a text to Smith to say: “Thanks for letting me know, we will do Friday at .am.”  Robbie Moore, Tory MP for Keighley and Ilkley, has called for the resignation of Susan Hinchclfe and the council’s chief executive Kersten England in the light of the Star Hobson case. He said: “Bradford Council bosses should hang their heads in shame. I have no confidence children’s services will ever be fit for purpose under its current leadership. “I am afraid it is my view that Council Leader Susan Hinchclfe and Chief Executive Kersten England must resign.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON MurderSocial servicesSocial workersCrimeDomestic violenceStar HobsonChild abuse\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Riley Gregersen, nine, was a typical young boy who loved playing football with his friends, but alarm bells began to be rung when he began to struggle with with his writing. Teachers attributed it to mental health problems, but when his terried parents took him to doctors they suggested it could be down to stress or even a trapped nerve. Within weeks, his arm began to shake uncontrollably meaning he couldnapost even feed himself. Got a story  Email webnew@mirror  Blood tests didnapost show anything concerning, but Riley was rushed to hospital after suffering a seizure during an after school club. His parents Gemma and Scott were given the devastating news that their son had an aggressive brain tumour called glioblastoma multorme . Due to where the tumour was, surgeons could only remove around % and the surgery was highly dangerous. His family raised funds for treatment in Germany but tragically the cancer spread to his spine and he was admitted to a hospice where he died on August . Now facing her first Christmas without Riley, the family have bravely spoken out in a bid to warn parents to be aware of the symptoms of brain tumours in children.  Gemma, , from Stourbridge, West Mids., said: Riley loved everything about Christmas and I have so many special memories to cherish. Every year he would sit with the Smyths Toys catalogue and tell me everything he wanted. He loved to pick out presents and write cards for his friends too he was such a kind and generous boy. Iaposll never forget the huge smile on his face when I would take his photo in front of our Christmas tree, it was the best thing ever. Riley always wanted to help people. After he died, so many people told me about how caring he was. Rileyaposs health initially went down hill just before Christmas  when he struggled to hold his pen at school and Gemma took him to their GP. Gemma, who is no longer with Scott, said: They said his symptoms were stress-related, or possibly a trapped nerve. We were sent away and told to come back in a few weeksapos time for a blood test,he was no better, which we did. Rileyaposs teachers also noticed his tremor was causing him to struggle to write and they contacted Gemma to say they were worried about his mental health.  Gemma, an admin assistant, added: I assured them that Riley had a happy home le and no reason to be feeling anxious or stressed. When the results from the blood tests came back, they didnapost reveal anything of concern, so Riley was referred for an aposurgentapos MRI scan but the appointment didnapost come through before he suffered the seizure on  January. Rileyaposs prognosis remained stark, so Gemma and Scott began researching alternative treatment options overseas. They found a private clinic in Germany which made peptide vaccines which could extend Rileyaposs le at a cost of £,. Despite a fundraising drive, Riley became too ill and in May doctors delivered the heartbreaking news that the cancer had spread. Gemma said: Things had been going so well when, in May, Riley started complaining of numbness in his legs and he had balance issues.  He was having problems going to the toilet, even though he was drinking a lot. I called for an ambulance and they took us into Birmingham Childrenaposs Hospital. They did another MRI scan and when got the results, my world fell apart.The tumour had spread and four new tumours had appeared on his spine. There was very little they could do.Riley had more palliative radiotherapy but after that, there were no other treatments available. The German clinic sent Rileyaposs vaccines to the UK, as he was unable to travel, but Gemma couldnapost find anyone in the country willing to administer the vaccine because it was not certied by the NHS.She said: It was completely shattering. At .pm on  August, my precious boy died in my arms. Even though I knew it was coming, it was an absolute shock and just so hard to comprehend.One thing I am pleased to do this Christmas is to share our story to help raise awareness, in the hope that I can help to make a dference, in Rileyaposs name.Brain tumours kill more children and adults under the age of  than any other cancer in the UK.

Specialists treating the woman at Addenbrookeaposs Hospital in Cambridge, had told a judge that le-support treatment should end, despite her familyaposs insistence she should be given more time. The patient, described only as AH in court papers, has not been publicly named to protect her privacy. Mrs Justice Theis has now ruled that le-support treatment can end, and that the woman can be allowed to die, after reconsidering arguments.  Last week, she examined up-to-date evidence at a hearing in the Court of Protection, where issues relating to people who lack the mental capacity to make decisions are considered, over two days in London. Another judge had originally considered the case at a hearing in the Court of Protection in August. Mr Justice Hayden also concluded that le-support treatment should end and ruled that the woman should be allowed to die. The womanaposs adult children challenged his ruling in the Court of Appeal. Appeal judges upheld their challenge and said the case should be reheard - Mrs Justice Theis then oversaw a second Court of Protection trial.  Relatives told Mrs Justice Theis that in the past four months they had seen a bubblier person and someone who was more alert and aware.But specialists treating her said she had deteriorated since August.The news comes as the UK faces a new challenge in dealing with the Omicron iant, and as new rules for testing come into force. Anyone who has come into contact with a Covid- case must now use a lateral flow test for seven days instead of isolating - although they are not available on the government website. The government insisted on Monday that there was no shortage of kits as aposample suppliesapos exist it shops. Yet on Tuesday morning a new message on the gov.uk website said ,  and  did not have access to any more tests - as well as none being available for home deliveries. Boris Johnson reiterated that home test kits were available at pharmacies when he was challenged over the message on the website.He said: They can get those tests, we do have a ready supply of lateral flow tests. If you canapost get one online for any reason, then there are ample supplies in the shops. But what I think,I may say so, what that also shows is that people are doing the sensible thing, and getting tests as well.On Monday, the UK Health Security Agency said that due to exceptionally high demand, ordering lateral flow tests on gov.uk has been temporarily suspended to fulfil existing orders. It also was revealed today that there are no PCR Covid test slots left available anywhere across England.The government website says there are no PCR tests - the gold standard of coronavirus tests - available to the general public at walk-in and drive-in test sites across the country.The booking site said there are none available at every region in England while some slots are still available at sites in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. PCR test kits which are posted to peopleaposs homes, usually arriving the following day, are available, the website claims. The public are being advised to try again laterthey cannot get a test. Tests will not be available through helplines, the website added.

The mum had nodded to doctors to give consent to deliver Hope after medics told her they might have to deliver the baby early, although Laura said she has no recollection of this whatsoever,Manchester Evening News reports .I opened my eyes to see Hope on the bed with me, but I couldnapost move any part of my body, the -year-old said. All I could do was shake and nod my head. Laura, a teaching assistant, arrived at hospital struggling to breathe after being diagnosed with Covid at the beginning of the school summer holidays. Her condition deteriorated so much that she was sedated for an emergency C-section at  weeks and then put into a coma. It was only when Laura finally came round at the end of September - much to the relief of family and friends - that she realised her precious girl had arrived. Lauraaposs partner John Leece has been taking Hope for daily visits to see her mum in Trafford General, where sheaposs been undergoing intensive rehabilitation, including learning how to walk again. But after finally being allowed toto her home in Tyldesley, Wigan, sheaposs now been reunited with her family, including three-year-old son William and step-children Josh and Lexi. Family and friends, including her parents Lynn and Bill, were there to greet her as she arrived on Monday morning to a house decorated with balloons and aposwelcome homeapos posters. Iaposm so pleased to be home, said Laura, who had gestational diabetes throughout her pregnancy. The physiotherapist brought me home and John was there waiting for me with the kids. William was so excited he was shouting aposmummy, mummyapos and trying to get in the car.Itaposs been nearly five months since Laura was last at home, before she was initially treated at the Royal Bolton and later transferred to Wythenshawe Hospital, where she spent  days of her coma on an ECMO machine - the highest level of le support. John, , said he had aposevery faithapos that sheaposd have the strength to pull through. Iaposm ecstatic to have her back after all this time, he said. Itaposs been tough but weaposve had people helping us out and theyaposre all good kids so thataposs made it easier. The worst day was when they rang and said they needed to do an emergency C-section and then after that they said they needed to get her on one of the ECMO machines or  she could die. She met all the criteria, it was just a case of waiting to seethey had a bed. Once she was there we knew she was in the best place and I had every faith sheaposd pull through because sheaposd been fit and well before it. He added: I always had an inkling she would be coming home, just because of the person she is. She had her kids to come home for and a lot to fight for. After coming round from her coma, having had tracheostomy and feeding tubes fitted, it was two weeks before Laura was even able to speak and sheaposs since had to learn how to do the most basic things all over again. The muscles in her legs had deteriorated over the weeks and it was only at the beginning of December when she managed to walk again - firstly making her way down the hospital corridor with a frame and then holding the hand of her three-year-old son William. Lauraaposs physiotherapy will now continue at home and sheaposs been given ious support aids to help her around the house. For now sheaposll have a bed downstairs, but sheaposs already been tackling the stairs herself. I said to John when I got home that I just wanted to try them, she said. I did manage to get to the top but when I got there I needed to sit down and I needed help getting back up. Itaposll take some time but Iaposll get there. After a takeaway pizza night to celebrate her homecoming, the family are now looking forward to having a happy settled Christmas at home. Laura hopes toto her job at Tyldesley Primary School in September, when son William will also be starting there. And sheaposs been inundated with messages of support from parents and staff who canapost wait to have her back.

But what do they like to watch  Well, from the Duchess of Cambridge to Prince Harry and the Queen, we reveal some of their favourite shows...Downton Abbey Period drama Downton Abbey attracted millions of fans during its six seasons - and one of those is reportedly the Queen. According to the , Her Majesty is a huge fan of the show, even though she loves to point out any of its historical inaccuracies.Brian Hoey, the author of At Home With The Queen, told the publication about a previous conversation with a member of staff at Buckingham Palace. He said: “We were talking about Trooping the Colour and how the Queen always noticesanything is not quite right, such as one young officer she spotted wearing his medals in the wrong order not long ago. “Apparently she is exactly the same when she is watching the television. She loves watching Downton Abbey and pointing out things they have got wrong, partly because she is familiar with Highclere Castle, where it is filmed. She used to stay there as a guest of the Carnarvon family. Game of Thrones During an appearance on BBC Radio , Prince William and Kate revealed they are massive fans of box sets - and one of their favourite shows is Game of Thrones. And while on a trip to Germany, the couple met Tom Wlaschiha, who plays Jaqen H’ghar in the series, who claims they tried to press him for spoilers. He said: They said they really liked Game of Thrones and have watched every series. They wanted spoilers but I said I couldnapost tell them. Iaposm surprised they have time to watch such a long running series. Strictly Come Dancing  Strictly Come Dancing is a Saturday staple on the winter nights leading up to Christmas.And the hit BBC show can count on at least three royals fans - including Kate.At an event with presenter Claudia Winkleman and judge Shirley Ballas, William revealed: I have watched the show [Strictly] a couple of times.Catherine is a huge fan and my mother-in-law loves it.Meanwhile, the other two royal devotees of the show are Sophie Wessex and Lady Louise Windsor. They were spotted in the Strictly ballroom during the live shows in , cheering on then contestants including Faye Tozer and Stacey Dooley.According to Strictly host Tess Daly, Louise and Sophieaposs trip to watch the show was all part of a special birthday treat for Louise for her th birthday.Speaking to Hello!, Tess explained: It was lovely to have them there, we are very fortunate we have a few fans in the royal household… They did absolutely [get a backstage tour].Lady Louise was celebrating turning  and she said it was a treat to come and visit the show. Sheaposs a big fan, herself and her mother. They enjoyed all the action from the front row and they had a great night. It was great to welcome them. Line of Duty Police drama Line of Duty had fans gripped to the screen during its sixth series earlier this year.And of them was said to be the Queen herself, who became an avid watcher during lockdown at Windsor Castle. Her Majesty is said to have chatted about the ins and outs of AC-aposs mission to eradicate aposbent coppersapos with master of the household Vice-Admiral Sir Tony Johnstone-Burt, The Sunday Times reported.A royal source told The Sunday Times: “The Queen was very into Line of Duty and enjoyed discussing the plotlines with Tony.” Meanwhile, another royal fan is Sophie Wessex, who said she guessed who the elusive aposHapos was before it was revealed on screen. In an interview with Radio  Live, he said: I was really disappointed in myself for having guessed it. Because I was, yes... I kept on thinking ‘It can’t be, it can’t be him but it’s got to be. There isn’t any other choice. There is no-one  that it could be’. Jeopardy  Since leaving the UK for the United States, it seems Prince Harry has developed a love of a long-running American gameshow - Jeopardy.During a chat with James Corden on the Late, Late Show, Harry revealed that the show is part of his nightly routine with Meghan Markle. He revealed that after putting son Archie to bed, Meg might cook a meal, might order a takeaway, go upstairs, sit in bed, turn the TV on, watch some Jeopardy, maybe a little bit of Netflix.Fireman SamFireman Sam has been a kids classic TV show for more than  years - and one avid watcher was Prince George.His dad William revealed in  that George loved the show and remarked: Fireman Sam has taken an awful lot of interest.

All of us work full-time and give up our free time so when you add onto that on top of sorting out the mess and the pressures we all have at this time of year it was annoying.  Weaposve never had anything like this happen before, thataposs why we had to have a serious meeting about health and safety and volunteers being put at risk. One of the volunteers was there with her six-year-old child and the child unfortunately also ended up with a bit of egg on them.Following the incident, Okehampton Round Table published a post on Facebook to find out the identity of the culprits.James said: Quite a few people named the boys who were involved and we put out a post asking the parents to call us stating the Santa runs would be stopped until we received assurance it would not be repeated. We are very grateful for the support we received from the community, the neighbourhood policing team who rang us up and also the parents of the children involved who were embarrassed and quite annoyed with their children. But in the spirit of Christmas what we have decided to do is ask the children to apologise to Santa and the Roundtable volunteers, which they have done, and they offered to clean the sleigh. We had already done it, but they have put right their actions and they have been taught every action has a consequence and that a few minutes of fun for them can really ruin a community event. Although we had the support of the police we have dealt with it ourselves and have not gone down that avenue, again in the spirit of Christmas. As we were able to establish it was a one-off we are carrying on as usual so no children have missed out on seeing Santa. He added: Hopefully everyone is back on the good list again! The Okehampton Round Table Santa Sleigh raises vital money for local community projects such as buying Christmas presents for children whose families use its food bank, creating a sensory garden at Okehampton College and erecting a willow arch at St James Primary School.

Kraish Symes, an -year-old from Bradford, left a career as a store clerk to make the move into a job in public transport. Now, the teen spends his days transporting hundreds of people around the roads of West Yorkshire, and says he has “not looked back since”. After passing his bus-license exam in November, Kraish got to work job-hunting and quickly landed a role with regional operator Transdev. While he recognises itaposs a huge responsibility keeping people safe on the roads each day, Kraish said he’s loving it. “Every day is dferent, and the best part of it is making someone’s day with a smile or a quick chat when they get on my bus,” he said.  “I’m enjoying every single minute, he said. Kraish made the decision to change careers after working in retail for several years. He said: “I’d worked in a discount store for almost two years when I decided to make this change into bus driving, and I’ve never looked back since. “I enjoy driving, plus the customer service skills I learned behind the till are helping me now to look after people on my bus. “I’m usually on the Otley Dash route – we’re the local bus in and around Otley and already I’m getting to know my regular customers every day. One of his favourite parts of the job, Kraish said, was meeting local people. “The people I meet are all happy and friendly and I’m just glad to be here for them, he said. “This is the job I always wanted to do.” Kraish learnt his skills behind the wheel from driving instructor Barry Dean, a brilliant instructor he has nothing but praise for. “I’d have qualied even sooner, but we had to wait three times longer than usual to get my licenses and test date set up through the DVSA.” Kraish said Barry had helped him make it to where he is today.

It makes me happy to talk about it.”  Josh, from Wakefield, West Yorks, says this by writing slowly on his iPad. His words are then spoken by a talker device. Josh’s ­disabilities and learning dficulties include severe epilepsy and a neurological condition that is undiagnosed which impacts his muscles. It means he can communicate very little verbally and must be fed through a tube into his stomach. His mobility is also impacted, and he relies on wheelchairs, walking frames and sticks.  A team at Great Ormond Street Hospital in London are trying to find an official diagnosis and ­explanation for his condition.Mum Joanne Kendall contacted Make-A-Wish UK, which is being supported by this year’s Mirror Christmas Appeal, at a time when Josh’s health was particularly bad.Because his wishes were meeting Santa and flying on a plane, the charity arranged for the trip to Disneyland Paris for him and his younger siblings Charles, Nicole and Danielle. Joanne said: “He loves Christmas and Santa, the magic of it, the lights.  “It was an amazing trip, we still feel the ripples of it. It’s still such a talking point for him, he talks about it to new friends and shows photos, it’s a way of engaging. “His eyes when he met Santa… And when Santa waved to Josh, wow. He was overwhelmed.

But for some children the festive season will be very dferent. Across the country there are more than , young people who are critically ill. Many will be spending what should be a special time of the year in hospital. Others will have to have treatment, scans or blood tests. With your help we can give them a Christmas that they will always remember. This year’s Mirror Christmas Appeal is raising funds for Make-A-Wish UK that helps seriously ill young people make their dreams come true.It could be they want to meet their hero or heroine or feed an animal at the zoo or travel to see Santa in Lapland. The money raised could help Joshua, six, who has severe epilepsy, achieve his wish of a bedroom makeover or Summer, also six, who has acute leukaemia and dreams of a bouncy castle. Each year Make-A-Wish helps hundreds of critically ill children achieve their letime’s ambition. But to make a wish come true takes an army of volunteers, supporters and donors. That’s why every penny you donate could make a dference. Granting a wish can transform a child’s le. It gives them something to look forward to. For others it provides a special memory which makes the treatment they need more bearable.It can also help their parents who, despite doing everything they can for their sick child, feel it is not enough. Jason Suckley, Make-A-Wish UK chief executive, said: “I met the family of a boy who was recovering from brain surgery. “His grandmother told me how dficult it had been for her to watch her daughter struggle with the challenges of her son’s condition.But while they were enjoying his wish together, her daughter turned to her and said, ‘There is still magic in this world isn’t there mum ’ . “That’s just one instance that illustrates how the power of a wish lies in sharing positive memories with loved ones. “Every donation from Mirror readers will help us create those memories – bringing joy to ill children and their families during the darkest of times.” Josh has since thrived, achieving GCSEs and his bronze Duke of Edinburgh award. He is now at college learning vocational and le skills. Josh is involved in STARboard, Make-A-Wish UK’s youth ­advisory group. He attends remotely using iRobot and his talker device. Josh said: “I like to help more children have a wish.” Joanne added: “In the pandemic he spent a year and a half in his room because he is vulnerable. Joining STARboard, he could meet other young people. He’s even chaired two meetings.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON The Walt Disney CompanyGreat Ormond Street HospitalFather ChristmasLearning dficultiesTheme parksDisneyland ParisMirror Christmas appealXmas Appeal \" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Mark Goodram, , and Jon-Ross Watson, , made national news in  after hitting the jackpot from the £ scratch card.However, Camelot, the lottery operator, refused to hand over the winnings when officials learned the debit cad used to buy the scratch card did not belong to either of the men. The pair were accused of buying five scratchcards, including the jackpot winner, without the consent of the credit cardholder.The lottery louts both denied three counts of fraud but changed their pleas to guilty as their trial at Bolton Crown Court was due to start.  The penniless pair had travelled to London from Bolton in April  to go begging, with Goodram having written a strangeraposs debit card details on his hand. He keyed in the numbers at Waitrose in Clapham, South London when buying lottery scratch cards and went on a bender in the capital. They shared pictures of themselves boozing over four days in celebration of winning the prize, but their joy was short-lived.  However, Camelot grew suspicious when Goodram phoned to collect the money but told them that he did not have a bank account where they could pay his winnings, despite using debit card details to buy the winning card. Recorder Sarah Johnston sentenced Goodram to  months in prison and Watson to  months. She told the pair today: You must have thought all your Christmases had come at once. Your offending is rooted in greed and a total lack of respect for the property of others.

Hope Kedziorski, who is just -months-old, was diagnosed with a rare blood cancer called myelodysplasia in October last year.Since then the brave toddler has endured a series of bone marrow ops and received blood transfusions and chemotherapy. The youngster also contracted sepsis.But as she sat at home beneath the fairy lights, wearing her bright red festive jumper alongside her cuddly toy reindeer, her proud mum Kirstie Wilkie, , said: “This Christmas is going to be extra special.”  Together with Hope’s dad Tomasz Kedziorski, , she spent months at her daughter’s hospital bedside. She said: “This summer has been beyond tough as we have watched our little girl battle this cruel disease. “But despite being poorly, Hope took it in her stride and she was still happy all of the time.” The couple had been alerted by a rash on their baby daughter’s neck. Kirstie said: “The rash was on her neck for four weeks until she underwent further blood tests which set off alarm bells as her platelets were low. “She had a bone marrow biopsy which revealed she had blood cancer.” But because of her tender age chemotherapy could not start immediately. “The side effects of chemotherapy can be le-threatening and for babies so young this risk is even higher which is why we had to wait until April.  “We spent every day by her side in the hospital and we went home for a week here and there. “The scariest moment was when she had sepsis as her oxygen levels dramatically dropped. “The whole summer was terrying but Hope continued to amaze us. “She had a total of six bone marrow biopsies and three central lines fitted and removed. The Mirror is committed to more hopeful news. We recognise the news agenda can sometimes feel overwhelmingly negative.And while itaposs our job to keep you informed and hold those in power to account, we are making a commitment to also report more hopeful news. We will celebrate the people, places and movements that are bringing good into the world and, more than that, we will dig beneath the surface of important issues with the aim of finding hope.We will be firm in our convictions - but always fair-minded.

Because we believe you deserve it. #mirrormorehopefulFollow on Twitter @mirrormorehope And follow Mirror More Hopeful on Facebook “And  blood and platelet transfusions yet she would still get up every day with a smile on her face and play. “Our end goal was to ring that bell as we knew the nightmare would finally be over.” Hope, who has Down’s syndrome, was finally able to ring the bell at the Royal Hospital for Children and Young People in Edinburgh in October. And now the family from South Queensferry, Scotland, are looking forward to a fabulous Christmas. Kirsty, an HR advisor, added: “Last Christmas was tainted because we knew it wasn’t long until she was going to start treatment. “We were apprehensive and scared in case we were going to lose our little girl to cancer or the side effects of chemotherapy. “We are in a much better place this year. She has beaten her cancer and we have a nice future to look forward to.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Mirror More HopefulHospitalsCancerBabies\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Shaylee Bush, , and husband Mykel, , were overjoyed at the birth of Haisley, after suffering a miscarriage. And they were very much still getting to grips with being first time parents when they fell pregnant just six weeks later. They found out when Haisley was just three months old, and weeks later discovered shocked Shaylee was carrying twins. The stay at home mum gave birth to twins Harlow and Oaklyn just under  months after sheaposd had her daughter. Shaylee, from Saint Georges, Utah, in US, said: We were over the moon when Haisley arrived into our lives, and, as soon as it was safe to do so, we just started having sex again.It didnapost take long before I was getting all the tell tale signs of pregnancy, and  weeks after giving birth to Haisley we realised I was pregnant again.At  weeks we were told it was twins and we couldnapost believe it. To go from the heartbreak of a miscarriage to the sheer joy of bringing three beautul girls into the world in less than a year was quite something. Me and my husband just kept the faith and now we have the family we always dreamed of. Haisley, now three, was born at  weeks in November  and gave birth to twins Harlow and Oaklyn, now two, in October . For a month every year her daughters will all be the same age, but Haisley will be a grade above the twins when they eventually start school. In total, Shaylee was pregnant for almost  months straight with only a six-week gap in between. This has taken its toll on her body and she is waiting for an operation to repair her abdominal muscles.  At times it was hard - especially the last few months with the twins, she said. The dferent feeling of having two babies grow inside of you in comparison to one is really quite extreme. My body had no chance to recover after my first pregnancy, and not only that, it then had to carry twice as much weight. Itaposs amazing now to focus on the mum part of motherhood and not the pregnancy part. Iaposm in need of an operation to repair my stomach as my muscles stretched so much there is now a -inch gap between my abs which needs to be sewn together. But it was all worth it in the end and Iaposm so excited for what the future holds for me and my family.

Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here The woman wrote on the video: “My boyfriend found out why my mum’s dishwasher wasn’t working.” And in the clip, her boyfriend says: “He’s right there, do you see him  Look at them all, there’s a ton of them in here.” The video quickly went viral and has almost  million views – and many of the , commenters have been left horried by the clip.  One person wrote: “I would actually drop dead right then and thereI saw this.” While another said: “Ma’am a for sale sign would be in my front yard right then and there.” And a third scared commenter posted: “Time to just move and leave everything behind.” But others thought the furry creatures were “cute”, with several joking they were just trying to help fix the machine. Someone said: “They’re trying to fix it. And for free as well! Damn, be grateful.” As someone  wrote: “Wait, you guys didn’t know that the way dishwashers work is that the rats come and eat the food off the dishes and then clean them ” And another added: “They just want to help clean the dishes, stop bullying them.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON ViralTikTokUmm what \" data-immediate\"data-immediate\" to FREE email alerts with news to brighten your daySubscribeInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Harry Styles recently charged £ for a crew neck jumper on the front that simply just says ‘pleasing’ on the front - the name of his new skincare and nail nish business. Fans had the option to buy the jumper on pre-salethey had previously ordered someone from the newly founded brand, but even then the website still crashed and people were struggling to buy one. I was one of these people in the queue to get the jumper, I was just finishing my college lesson when they went on sale and immediately it was a mad rush to buy it. There is a need to have it and to be one of those first fans wearing the jumper that has been spoken about so much on Twitter, it’s almost asthe hype is worth the money. Personally, I must have spent thousands over the years on a range of One Directionmerchandise ranging from a Louis Tomlinson cardboard cut out to a Harry Styles watermelon-shaped water bottle inspired by his song Watermelon Sugar.  As the price of merchandise is so expensive, I used to ask for it along with concert tickets for my birthday or Christmas presents. But now as I have a job, I buy it myself and because I have no bills or rent to pay, it allows me to just go and purchase the merchandise - sometimes without even thinking about it. When it was One Direction’s -year anniversary, I even made a cake to celebrate . As I’m now  it’s not like I’m still seven, the age I became a fan, I think the reason I’m still this much of a fan is because I enjoy the music and the band as a whole and that’s why I still collect the merchandise - no matter the cost. Whilst some artists have ‘cheaper’ merch, Billie Eillish’s merchandise would be considered a bit too pricey in my opinion - she charges around £ for a hoodie and £ for a pair of limited edition rhinestone jogging bottoms. There are other options to buying the over-priced merchandise though, small businesses on Etsy make alternative versions of merchandise and within five minutes of a Google search you can find copies of almost every artists’ merch.  While some people prefer to buy the ‘unofficial’ merch because it is simply a cheaper option, others prefer to buy their merchandise to support the artist. Erin Memmott, a Taylor Swt fan said: “I buy Taylor’s merch to support her career and art, especially during the pandemic as she’s released four albums.  “Particularly for Folklore and Evermore which were made entirely in isolation, she released them with no thought of profits - she just wanted to provide some escapism for her fans. “I think it’s really cool to wear a shirt with your favourite lyrics on and know that you’re giving back to the artist who puts so much thought and care into their music. “I also obviously love the designs and enjoy expanding my collection.” And as many people including myself are willing to pay the expensive price of merchandise for their favourite artists, it seems like the price will keep going up.

While her approach may seem petty - she flocked to Reddit to ask for advice and explained how she had ended up in that situation. After hearing more about the unusual situation, many people sided with her - and urged her to fight any penalties. She explained: I have the sort of name that has several common shortened versions - think Samantha Sammy Sam. Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here And my entire le, people have insisted on being too familiar and shortening it against my wishes. I only ever introduce myself as ‘Samantha’, sign off all my emails as Samantha, and insist on it when people ask what I prefer. I think Sammy is too young-sounding for me, and growing up I knew another Sam who was a real piece of work, so I hate being called by that name. But much to her disappointment, her fellow workers always shorten her name - despite her repeatedly correcting them. I’ve only won the battle with one person, who took the hint after I started calling him Jonathan instead of his preferred Jon, she added. He askedhe was in trouble since only his mother calls him Jonathan, and I told him that I thought we were playing a game of getting each other’s names wrong… He now calls me the right name, so success! But things turned sour recently after she fell out with a manger who insists on calling her aposSamapos despite her obvious attempts to correct him. So she came up with a simple way to get back at him - but it has landed her in hot water. The woman wrote: His name is Richard, so I’ve been casually calling him Dick all week. It’s a valid shortened version of his name. And when he’s objected, I’ve reminded him that I’m Samantha and not Sam. I had such high hopes for progress… but instead I’ve earned myself a meeting with HR.Asking for advice on what to do next, lots of Redditors advised her to stick to her guns. One commented: Be factual and concise with your story to HR. Ask why itaposs OK for him to shorten your name, but you canapost shorten his. Take all emotions out of it. My guess is heaposs spun this to where youaposre calling him A dick, and not just calling him Dick. Another wrote: If you drop in the words: ‘toxic workspace’ ‘calling me inappropriate names in a manner calculated to annoy’ and ‘hostile work environment’ while you explain your point of view, I predict you will have a more favourable outcome. But others disagreed, with one adding: I have a similar problem with people shortening my name but I would never be dumb enough to call a manager in my company “Dick” no matterit is a legitimate nickname from way back when. Choosing an insult-related version of his name was deliberately provocative. You know exactly what you called him, as your half-hearted defence of ‘it’s a valid shortened version of his name’ proves. Protesting a bit too much there, commented one person.

The magical world weaved by J.K. Rowling still has an impact today - with fans flocking to Watford to see the film sets for real. Meanwhile, thousands of children are currently engrossed in the ongoing at Hogwarts, as their parents read to them at bedtime. Butthere was a ranking of top fans - mum Tracey Nicol-Lewis, , would probably come out on top. The super-fan not only owns the worldaposs largest collection of Harry Potter memorabilia - but even had a Wizarding World-themed wedding. She owns a staggering , wizarding items - including wands, special edition books, LEGO sets and artwork. Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here Tracey first watched aposHarry Potter and the Philosopheraposs Stoneapos in , after the birth of her son and fell in love with the magical world. It wasnapost long before she acquired her first Harry Potter collectable - a chocolate frog from her local corner shop. Since then her collection has grown and now takes over a full three rooms of her house. Tracey loves the franchise so much she even had a Harry Potter-themed wedding last year when she married her husband Martin, . She wore a wedding dress in the Gryffindor red and gold, adorned with the Deathly Hallows symbols. Meanwhile, her bouquet included torn-up pages of a damaged edition of the Goblet of Fire, and her shoes painted with Dobby the elf. Her devoted friends even attended dressed in the robes of their Hogwarts House. The mum credits J.K Rowlingaposs writing with helping her cope with the death of her first husband Simon Nicol-Lewis, who passed away in . He had pre-ordered aposHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fireapos for her - and it arrived weeks after he died.  Tracey, from Mid Glamorgan, Wales, said: I think aposoh thataposs it I wonapost get any moreapos, and I go to the shop and something always falls in my basket! I love looking and rearranging my collection - it’s my happy place. Harry Potter is a magical world that you can use to escape into, and that is what I did. Because I had my son in , and them having the baby in the film and all the magic, it was like having it alongside me.  Harry Potter got me through a really tough time because when I started collecting the last present I had off my first husband was a book of Harry Potter before he passed away. Thataposs why I think the collection got so mad. Little by little, the odd eBay bid and trades with friends grew her collection, and Tracey hit her first  items in about . Her hoard now includes special editions of the books and their spin-offs, and at least  action figures Her largest item is her cardboard book display for aposHarry Potter and the Cursed Childapos which stands at five feet tall.  Sheaposs never had her collection valued but she estimates she spends on average £ every month on new items. The mum-of-one said: Everything I like in my collection is just amazing, I love it. They have memories attached to them as well because I can remember the bits from the films or the books. Tracey also enjoys Harry Potter cosplay and attends events to meet other fanatics while dressed in her clobber.  She says that her favourite items change over time, but her currents are her collection of  wands. But when she met her now-husband Martin, he wasnapost immediately a fan of her hobby. She said: He knew about my collection so it was accept it or run! First of all I said I like Harry Potter and I collect Harry Potter, and he was kind of shocked when he came around and saw the collection. But in my last house he decorated it red and yellow because of Gryffindor and he put up shelves for me and made it more Harry Potter. Martin is amazing, he puts up with my collection and even buys me things for it. The family moved to a larger property in  to accommodate the collection, and now have three rooms dedicated to it.  Tracey said: We need a lot of work doing on the house so I canapost have any more at the moment - but Iaposm working on it! Iaposve had people say they want me to open the house and start a B and B! Tracey and Martin married after four years together in  and enjoyed a lavish Potter-themed ceremony in Discovery Cove in Orlando, Florida, USA. The wedding cake was topped with a golden snitch and magic wand, as well as the words aposMartin found a keeperapos, referring to the Quidditch position. Her Gryffindor-inspired wedding dress and shoes were made for her by her friends in the Harry Potter community. She said: I wanted a dress I could have for my wedding but could wear to other occasions. Martin let me pick what I wanted so the tunes going in and when you came out were Harry Potter. My friends in Florida were there in robes. While security guard Martin doesnapost share her passion for the Wizarding World, it was his idea to count her collection for Guinness World Records. Together they took a picture of every single item in her collection, and also had to video the counting process - which took at least five hours. She had a whopping , items when it was measured by Guinness World Records in April. But since then, the aposPotterheadapos says sheaposs acquired at least , more. I still canapost believe that I have much in my collection, said the housewe. When itaposs all around your room and you see it every day, itaposs only when someone comes in and sees it and theyaposre like aposoh thataposs a lot!apos Iaposm looking for the bits I want to complete from missing sets, but then other things seem to pop out and I buy them instead. In April this year, she received the happy news that she had not one, but two records - as she had both the worldaposs largest Harry Potter and Wizarding World collections. The Wizarding World encompasses the aposFantastic Beastsapos spin-off movie series along with the Potter universe. She broke the previous record, also held by a Welsh superfan, by , items. I didn’t think I had enough, she admitted. I was over the moon, I couldn’t believe I had two Guinness World Records. Her dream is to one day meet author JK Rowling in person and thank her for how her series changed her le. Tracey said: Be your own person, don’t follow everyone , follow your dreams.

The pair entered their big day on a huge circular swing with fireworks, but something holding the podium snapped and twisted it so they were chucked to the floor.The couple plunged ft from the metal cage to the floor where their shocked guests looked up in horror.Thankfully they only sustained minor injuries and could carry on with the ceremony  minutes later in Raipur, Chhattisgar, on Monday.Event managers Joe, who organised the ceremony, apologised for the blunder.  An employee said the accident took place during the coupleaposs Sangeet ceremony, a night of celebration where guests and family are invited to dance and sing a few days before the wedding itself. The employee blamed the botched entrance on technical issues. He added: No one suffered injuries in the incident. The bride and the groom are safe.” The company will make sure similar incidents donapost happen again, he added.  The video was widely shared on social media, where users likened the overkill entrance to a circus show. One said: “I donapost know why show off needs nowadays in marriages. Nowadays Marriages should be done under supervision of stunt masters... doctors...” Another added: “Empathise with the couple, but on a serious note whataposs the need of that acrobatic stuff.” One US bride had a similarly disastrous wedding day, when she fainted on her groom before her bridal gown was defecated on by a baby nephew - all while she was vomiting.Hollee Lynnea-Kolenda Darnell, , who is from the US city of Minneapolis, Minnesota, got hitched recently to new hubby, Jackson, at a ceremony in Florida.Though the day started well, a sudden bout of sickness caused her to swoon into her concerned hubbyaposs arms during their vows.Her worried sweetheart can be heard asking whether she is okay as she comes back around. Hollee - dressed in a flowing, white bridal gown - shakes her head and stumbles over to the edge of the gazebo, and vomits over the side.

Eitan Shaken, , miraculously survived more than  hours after injuring himself on the Ojo del Albina glacier near Ushuaia in Southern Argentina. He was found suffering from hypothermia and was rescued when he managed to use his mobile phone to tell of his accident and a local rescuer saw it and raised the alarm, according to local reports.Eitan shared the video, recorded minutes after the accident and in which he asks rescuers to contact his mother on Instagram. His caption read: Those who know me know that I donapost like to philosophize on social networks but this time, unfortunately, I have no choice but to write a little more. Last Wednesday I went for a walk in Ushuaia and fell about  metres. I waited for rescue for a day, disconnected, without taking food or water and also with my pelvis and elbow broken. When they found me I was on the verge of death from hypothermia.  Eitan was taken to hospital, where he was treated for fractures to his pelvis and one of his arms. He said: I donapost understand how I didnapost die. Video online shows him having apparently given up hope at being rescued, with his face bloodied, recording a video in which he asks rescuers in English to contact his mother. Eitan said: When they found me I was on the verge of death from hypothermia.  Other footage shared online shows him being put in a helicopter on a stretcher. Firefighter Federico De La Torre said Eitan was lucky because at the time of the accident, the day was very beautul and the night was not cold compared to how it usually is. Eitan thanked his rescuers on social media and praised the medical personnel who are still treating him at the Ushuaia Regional Hospital. Eitan said: I left Israel when I finished my military service. There I decided to go around the world, particularly South America. In fact, my dream was to visit Antarctica and Ushuaia, from where I had read a lot of books. But a few days after arriving in Argentina I suffered the accident that I thought would end everything. He added: Itaposs always fun to rediscover how good the human race is. Iaposm not proud of what happened to me, but Iaposm glad it ended up that way. After I got sick with cancer a few years ago, dealing with death up close for the second time in my le is not an easy thing. Take care of yourself and be responsible. A piece of advice for all travellers: Fly on your trip, but try not to fly off your trip. The film  Hours is about adventurer Aron Ralston who becomes trapped when a boulder falls on his arm. Over five days, he makes the agonising decision to cut his arm off to free himself.

I can understand that this must be absolutely hellish.“In the short term we need to do something immediately about trying to discourage people from parking in inappropriate places and I’m more than happy to take that forward to the community action teamwith the police.“I think in the medium term we need to be trying to encourage people, when there are peak times, to not park there but to park down in the town.”Also at this week’s meeting was Emma Guy from Enduro World Series , who formerly worked as project coordinator for the Tweed Valley Tourism Bid..removeShe said: “I’m well aware of this issue and some of us [from Tweed Valley Tourism Bid] did try and tackle it on the ground about a year and a half ago with putting signs up near the Cauld.“So around the event at the beginning of October we had shuttles so people wouldn’t park in these hotspots, we cordoned off areas, we spoke to the golf club and we had marshals in place to police any bad behaviour, so tat worked quite well.“Our kind of feeling is that this is an ongoing problem and it does need solutions, there needs to be some kind of visitor infrastructure investment and certainly in my role with the Tourism Bid we were pushing really hard for that.“From an EWS point of view, with regard to events, we worked quite hard to manage that problem because we know how disruptive and how unpleasant that can be.“In my role with EWS we would support and put our weight behind any proposals to the council to SOSEto try and alleviate this.”Tweeddale East councillor Shona Haslam, of the Conservatives, added: “In terms of the long term [solution] obviously we’ve got £ million coming into mountain biking infrastructure into Innerleithen and £ million for a town the size of Innerleithen is pretty signicant.“So, we’ve got the Mountain Biking Innovation Centre that is moving forward in the background, obviously there’s a lot of commercial stuff in there that we’re not allowed to talk about, and there is the bike park as well.

Nothing about school le post-fire post during COVID seems as rewarding or real as it once did but, be in no doubt, the young people celebrated here today are every bit as worthy of celebration and congratulations as their predecessors and perhaps even more so given all they have had to overcome and deal with to win the prizes we celebrate in this article.Perhaps you can take heart that this year’s Peebles High School prize giving offers something more permanent than fleeting moments of adulation and applause. It offers an article than can be cherished for years to come as a reminder of how our young people triumphed against the odds.

Well done.And well done too to our higher journalism class and their teacher, Ms Ness, for the hard work that brings you this celebration of our fantastic young people.

The winner of the Maigret Cup this year is Thomas Neville. Thomas has won this award through his success studying Spanish and French at Higher level. The class was fortunate enough to interview Thomas regarding the award and asked him how he felt to have won this. He said: “I’m really impressed with myself, obviously the award for overall linguist is really prestigious, and I’m really chuffed with myself as there is obviously a lot of languages at this school so to have won the best overall award for languages is something that I’m really proud of.”By Harry NessAmy Brown: Outstanding Musical ContributionOn November  the class interviewed former Peebles High School student Amy Brown to discuss her achievement of the Outstanding Musical Contribution Award. This is presented in recognition of the huge commitment made to the extra curricular le of the school and is awarded to a pupil who have been a source of inspiration to their fellow musicians throughout their time at Peebles. She was delighted to have won, even though she only took music for enjoyment and went on to express her disappointment at not being able to perform fully last year. She graciously stated that she was glad pupils are “able to get back to that now and other people are enjoying it”. While Amy is not pursuing music further , she explained that “it’s not something I want to stop doing… It was probably one of my favourite subjects, probably the one I was most relaxed aboutthat makes sense. It was always a nice environment to be in and I think that helped me enjoy it a lot more”. Amy then admitted at the risk of sounding “cliché”, that the music department concerts were the highlight of her years at the school. At the end of the interview, she imparted some very wise advice for younger years. She said: “Have more confidence in yourself, don’t care as much about what other people think.”By Madeleine HubertChristopher O’Hare: George OB Thomson Memorial CupThis award was created by professor George Thompson, who taught in the English department at Peebles High School. He devoted large parts of his research to the study of pupils with additional needs and was always adamant that they should be integrated into the “le and work of the whole school”. The council of Tweeddale wanted to celebrate the late professor George Thompson by awarding this memorial quaich to the most creative and enterprising entry from pupils with additional needs for a project devised by the school in conjunction with the society. When the class interviewed Christopher he said he felt “brilliant and honoured” to receive this award. He told us that one teacher that improved Christopher’s school le was Mr Travis, from the technology department. Christopher described him as a “funny guy” and “nice person”, who he says is happy to help whenever. He added that design and manufacture was his favourite subject as it enabled him to unleash his creativity. Not only is Christopher creative, but funny too, and when asked what his act in a school talent show would be he replied: “I like to make people laugh and feel happy”. Finally, Christopher was asked what he wishes to do in the future. Filled with energy, he stated that he would like to join the army. The skills and qualities which Christopher has shown in order to gain this award will help him achieve his future plans. The school wishes Christopher all the best, and know he will do well in the world which anxiously awaits his talent, kindness and phenomenal humour.By Keeley RippinBen Rorison: George OB Thomson Memorial Cup, and Balfour Medal This year’s worthy prize winner of the Balfour Medal and the George OB Thomson cup is Ben Rorison. Both prizes are awarded to an inidual with a positive presence and creative outlook within their community and school le. This was an area in which Ben excelled. When asked how he felt about receiving both awards Ben stated that he was “shocked and delighted to have been picked”. Ben also mentioned that his favourite subject was music and that he wanted to pursue this by becoming a music teacher for those with additional needs. When asked what his favourite memory was at Peebles High, Ben said is was helping first year pupils and helping around the school as a prefect, just showing how deserving of this prize Ben is. The positive impact that Ben had on the school will stay with those students he helped and the teachers he worked with. The school has no doubt that Ben will continue to be a role model and inspiration to all who are fortunate enough to work with him.By Olivia ThornburrowAbbie Sorrell: Geoffrey Simpson Award for Head PrefectOne winner of the Geoffrey Simpson award is ex-head girl Abbie Sorrell. The class’ first question regarded the important issue of who her favourite teacher was. She replied: “I don’t really do favourites, butI had to choose it would be Lesley Johnson. Chemistry used to be one of my weaker subjects , however I learned to love it and always looked forward to her classes”. However, she may have been won over in another way as she finishes her reply with “cake days were always a firm favourite of mine too”.Abbie was asked what her favourite memory of Peebles High School was and she responded enthusiastically “the German exchange trip”. She added: “I went as a member of the choir and loved meeting like-minded people and embracing a dferent culture. Not to mention the infamous Loch Lomond song which was always a favourite of mine.”When asked about her future plans, Abbie replied: “Wow, thinking about the future seems so daunting, however I hope that my uni degree will allow me to work in a hospital environment where I can help people. I also love the idea of travel and going on adventures to make some memories.”The class asked Abbie to reflect on and offer advice to her first year self, and she responded with “the list is long… the main thing I’d say is not to be so hard on myself and to accept that set backs are important for learning just as much as success”. Carrying on the theme of advice Abbie was asked what she would say to this year’s head team and she told them to “embrace everything because the year will be over before you know it. Therefore, just make the most of every opportunity and most of all enjoy yourself and have fun working with your peers”.By Rosie DykesEuan Macrae: Geoffrey Simpson Award for Head PrefectEuan Macrae was awarded the prestigious Geoffrey Simpson Award for his efforts as head boy. Euan had to show certain skills such as leadership and teamwork in order to effectively guide the school. In an interview with Euan, who is now studying Medicine at University, he highlighted how the school fire and COVID had affected his work ethic during his final few years in school, and how this has impacted the lives of not only himself but also his year group going into exams and beyond. He explained that “we’d never sat proper higher exams which would have set us up for the bigger exams that we were going to have to sit further down the line so the damage from that is probably still lasting”. The class asked Euan who his hero was, he very honestly answered with his grandfather, saying that he had always looked up to him due to his intelligence and bravery. When asked who his favourite teacher was at school, Euan passionately discussed how Miss Dunlop, who taught history, influenced his high school experience as “she had the entire class focused on what she was saying and she never even had to raise her voice. I soon realised that learning could be actually so much fun as well as informative”.By Louise RussellRachel McManus: Tweed Reads PrizeCampbell Hunter was a much-loved member of the Peebles community. He made fantastic contributions to the Tweed Reads organisation and thrived under the leadership role. He was kind, compassionate and showed a real love of encouraging the younger generations to explore and enjoy reading. Campbell worked tirelessly alongside the other members of Tweed Reads and valued the importance of learning, community and service. Campbell was such an important part of the community, and his astounding contribution to Tweed Reads only proved how far he was set to go outside of school.The Tweed Reads prize is named after Campbell Hunter, not just to honour his memory but to honour everything he stood for and his contributions to the Tweed Reads club. The prize is awarded to the few who epitomise Campbell’s wonderful leadership qualities and share his values of learning and community. The Campbell Hunter prize for  goes to Rachel McManus who consistently worked creatively within the confines of COVID regulations and was always relentlessly positive.When the class asked Rachel about the prize itself and how she felt to have won it, she described Campbell as “a huge part of Tweed Reads in his last few years of high school and had a real passion for helping young children in the community develop their reading skills and form a love for reading”. Rachel says she feels “honoured to have won the Campbell Hunter prize through Tweed Reads” and she hopes to continue her involvement with the organisation in coming years.When asked in an interview how the fire and pandemic affected her work ethic within school she replied it had “a massive impact on students”. She then went on to congratulate the school saying it has “worked hard to ensure that pupils were still able to have a good amount of teaching with being online and there was always support available should anyone have needed it”. Rachel closed her answer by admitting that “it was hard to concentrate on work at home, so you really had to push yourself to stay motivated and keep on top of the workload”.Rachel was asked how she felt the award carried on Campbell’s legacy. She responded saying that it demonstrates all of the commitment he put into Tweed Reads and his caring nature over his home community.She added: “In my sixth year of high school I heard many stories of Campbell from Tweed Reads leaders who had worked alongside him. They always said how much commitment he had to the charity and how much he cared about truly representing the ethos of the charity so therefore I feel that the Campbell Hunter prize is a true legacy of all the hard work and dedication that he put into the charity.”By Rosie Dykes"},{"url":null,"title":"laws-implications-e-scooters","story":"POLICE in the Scottish Borders are warning anyone planning to purchase an e-scooter this Christmas to make sure they know the laws and implications beforehand.Using an e-scooter in a public place in Scotland is illegal.This includes roads, pavements, parks, town centres and promenades.

The ball rebounded as far as Foden and the England midfielder expertly guided it into the net.That strike brought up City’s impressive landmark under Guardiola but they were in no mood for stopping there.Another followed just five minutes later after a De Bruyne shot was deflected for a corner. Leeds half-cleared the Belgian’s cross from the set-piece but Mahrez sent a curling ball back into the box and Grealish headed past Meslier.Out of nothing, Leeds had a penalty appeal for handball against Oleksandr Zinchenko checked by VAR but nothing was given and normal service soon resumed.vw,vw,px, px\"Pep Guardiola liked what he saw against Leeds De Bruyne, back to his best after a recent spell out with Covid-, had an effort saved by Meslier but then made no mistake as he raced onto a Rodri ball to thump in the third on  minutes.He fizzed another shot over soon after and Foden also shot narrowly wide.City’s fourth came four minutes into the second half when Mahrez’s shot was deflected in off Junior Firpo.Leeds threatened briefly and Stuart Dallas hit the post but substitute Ilkay Gundogan was inches away from adding another for City as he volleyed wide and Foden was denied by an offside flag.The fth came soon after in emphatic fashion from De Bruyne as the midfielder unleashed a ferocious drive from outside the box that flew into the roof of the net.𝗥𝗢𝗖𝗞𝗘𝗧𝗠𝗔𝗡 🚀#MCILEE| @ManCitypic VevAzGCAA— Premier LeagueDecember , Stones made it - following a corner, tucking home at the second attempt after Meslier had saved a Laporte header and Stones’ initial effort on the rebound.Substitute Ake wrapped up the scoring with a powerful header from a corner  minutes from time..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: Manchester City hammer Leeds - to pass  goals under Pep Guardiola"},{"url":null,"title":"conor-gallagher-needs-playing-regular-football---patrick-vieira","story":"Patrick Vieira believes Conor Gallagher’s loan spell with Crystal Palace has been “win-win” for all parties involved so far but stressed the importance of the midfielder continuing to play regularly.The -year-old has scored six goals and made three assists for the Eagles since joining on a season-long loan from Cha in the summer.Gallagher’s form earned him an England debut last month while the Blues’ own injury issues in midfield has resulted in speculation boss Thomas Tuchel could recall the academy graduate.But Palace manager Vieira said: “I think at his age what is important is to play week in, week out.“You are making a career not just based on your talents, but you are making a career based on the decisions you are making.“I believe there were so many clubs around him and he made the right decision because he is playing, he is playing well and I think he is surrounded by people in this football club who look after him really well, that give him the confidence to express himself.“I think it is a win-win.

The more he will play, the better he will be. This is a position where there is competitiveness and this is what is good.“The competitiveness we have in midfield should bring out the best in each one of them, so that will be good for the team.“I was and I am really pleased with the game Will played and now what is important for him is to maintain that performance and be even better.”.push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: Conor Gallagher needs to be playing regular football  u Patrick Vieira"},{"url":null,"title":"mikel-arteta-says-commitment-passion-represent-arsenal","story":"Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta insists no player is bigger than the club after Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang was stood down as skipper following a “disciplinary breach”.The forward was dropped ahead of Saturday’s win over Southampton and also left out of contention for the visit of West Ham on Wednesday night.Arsenal’s statement confirming the decision said the club expected “all our players, particularly our captain, to work to the rules and standards we have all set and agreed”.Aubameyang was disciplined after reportedly ing late from a trip abroad to visit his ill mother.It is not Aubameyang’s first transgression, having previously been dropped to the bench for March’s north London derby against Tottenham after what was described as a breach of the club’s pre-match protocol.Arteta admitted it was a dficult experience having to take action against Aubameyang, whose double strike helped win the  FA Cup final against Cha at Wembley.The Spaniard knows all too well the values expected of an Arsenal captain, having worn the armband himself as a player from  to  under Arsene Wenger.for further information.\" srcset\"https:image.assets.pressassociation.io v image production fdccfcbcYudGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjMNTgOTM ..jpg w w, https:image.assets.pressassociation.io v image production fdccfcbcYudGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjMNTgOTM ..jpg w w, https:image.assets.pressassociation.io v image production fdccfcbcYudGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNjMNTgOTM ..jpg w w\" sizes\" vw,vw,px, px\"Mikel Arteta, centre, lted the FA Cup as Arsenal captain “The decision that we have taken as a club is very clear – it is because we believe that he has failed to be committed at the level that we all expect and agreed, as simple as that,” Arteta said.“What I expect from any person in this football club, that is representing this badge, is passion and that he gives absolutely  per cent, that he puts the club in front of any personal interests and is able to do anything to fulfil the badge we have on the chest.“Apart from that, you can listen to iniduals and you can understand dferent cultures, but that commitment and passion has to be there.

to shorter placements –  and some have opted out of studying in Britain altogether, according to the Universities UK .If there are fewer exchange students in Britain due to the visa system, then opportunities for outbound visits for UK-based students could be lost, it says.UUK, which represents  universities, is calling on the Government to extend the time that short-term exchange students are permitted to stay in the UK on visitor visas from six months to one academic year.Maintaining or increasing the numbers of students coming to the UK on exchange will be “crucial” to the success of the Turing Scheme – the post-Brexit replacement for the Erasmus exchange programme, UUK has said.Exchange students staying for less than six months can use a standard visitor visa, but students staying longer need a student visa which universities say have strict language requirements and high costs.Research by UUK suggests that, on average, , EU students a year – or a third of all exchange students coming to the UK – are “at risk of reducing theof their exchange, or not coming at all”.A move to extend theof the visitor visa for students to one academic year would increase the benefits to the UK economy and create the conditions for the success of the Turing Scheme, UUK said.Vivienne Stern, director of UUK International, said: “International students who come to the UK on short-term exchanges are important to the UK for a number of reasons.“Like full degree students, they add to the ersity on our campuses and contribute to our economy by spending money on goods and services while they are here, but they also create opportunities for UK students.“Exchange students open up places in other universities around the world for our students to spend time studying abroad.

He started juggling with knives and balancing on one leg while standing on a giant ball!He was playing with our senses, he knew exactly how to build suspense and stretch our belief in what we thought was possible. You could hear the silenced hush of awe in the audience watching his performance.Awe is something we all need on a regular basis. In fact,you look at the science, it has a huge impact on our ability to think, investigate, make discoveries and inventions.It stimulates our curiosity and makes us feel more connected, for example to nature, to our community, to history or whatever small wonders we experience every day.John Muir often talked about being awestricken by the natural wonders he experienced. They often overwhelmed his senses and this fed his passion to protect the landscape he revered, resulting in the formation of the national parks in the USA.But his sense of awe enthralled him as a child, as he explored the shore and fields around his home town of Dunbar.That’s the thing our sense of awe is not confined to grand sights. There are everyday wonders we encounter, and pausing for a moment to feel that sense of being “awe-stricken” has such a huge impact on our well-being.Scientists will tell you awe will transform your mind, make you feel humble and more empathetic. It’s an uplting spiritual experience, and I don’t mean religious, although awe is an important part of all religions.But you don’t have to be religious to be spiritual. And I think being able to feel amazed by the things around us is a spiritual way of being.And at Christmas-time especially, I often feel the ironic contradiction of a celebration that has at its heart a powerful spiritual message, but which has been hijacked to promote the needs of mass consumerism.The pressure to buy at this time can hit hard, especially when paying the bills and putting food on the table is a daily concern for so many. Poverty’s cold fingers are creeping into our homes as we try to keep warm. Yet, especiallywe have children, we want our family to feel included and blessed at this time. Who doesn’t How hard it is to resist the powerful messages thrown at us that fulfilment and happiness can be bought with the latest updated stuff you buy in shops that the phone you got last year is old now, you need a new one those shoes have the wrong label, you just have to have this because everyone  does. The list could be endless.Unfortunately, you can’t buy a sense of awe in the shops. No, wait, actually it’s fortunate! If it was something you had to buy then they’d commody it, overprice it and, once you’d bought it, tell you it was now obsolete and you needed a new version!It’s going to be an especially hard Christmas for so many of us this year, for so many dferent reasons, including financial ones.I get overwhelmed by it so often, and I often feel guilt that I’m not spending enough on gts, even though in my heart I know it’s not the cost that ultimately matters but the thought. The consumerist message is so powerful and universal that it’s dficult to opt out.But this is where cultivating our sense of awe can be so uplting, at a time when we feel so much pressure. What really makes us happy is relationships, not stuff. A thoughtful gt is part of that of course, but the awe is in the thought put into it.I think feeling a sense of awe is closely linked to being able to truly appreciate what we have and can experience.That includes the gts of kindness and generosity of people, as much as the blazing sunset or frost covered spider’s web we saw a few days ago. Kindness is a gt, like the tolerant and friendly smile a stranger gave me the other day as he waited patiently in his car as I tried to fix my child’s seatbelt.My son noticed it too: “That was a nice man.”Thankfully, kindness isn’t something you have to buy either it’s free and is not just for Christmas."},{"url":null,"title":"sarah-boyack-msp-impressed-musselburghs-first-step-project","story":"She met project manager Tina Pollock and First Step chairperson Katherine Sangster to discuss the work it does in the community.The Labour politician enjoyed a tour of First Step’s base on Galt Avenue, Musselburgh, during which she spoke to its grans’ group, staff and children.Miss Pollock later said: “Myself and our chairperson, Katherine Sangster, were delighted to welcome Sarah to the First Step project so she could see first-hand the positive impact the project is making on children and their parents in Musselburgh.“Sarah was impressed with the iety of services that we offer and how we were a leline for families during the Covid- pandemic.”Ms Boyack said: “It was inspiring to visit the First Step Project and hear about the support they have been able to deliver families throughout Covid-.“It’s clearly a service rooted in Musselburgh and is community led.“It’s a model of the sort of project that supports children and their parents, delivering positive change through early intervention, but it was also good to hear from the grans’ group about how the project has been there for them too.”First Step is a community project for families with young children.It is an independent voluntary organisation funded by East Lothian Council and other funding bodies.It was set up in  by a group of local parents who wanted somewhere safe and comfortable where they could meet and their children could play.The continued involvement of families and the local community in all aspects of First Step is said to have been key to its success.The project has developed its services to meet local needs, while continuing to be managed by a community-led management committee and employing a staff team to support local families.First Step provides: parenting support, inidually and in groups nursery provision for children aged one to four and funded eligible two-year-olds funded places for three and four-year-olds groups and courses for parents outreach and family support counselling dedicated support for young parents a grandparents’ group and a dedicated family room."},{"url":null,"title":"longniddry-lit-christmas","story":"The tree, funded by the Wemyss and March Estates, was planted outside the village’s Royal British Legion.

year, opting instead to spend the £ it would cost to dress a living Christmas tree next winter – “like every other town in East Lothian” – leaving the town without a tree this year.However, following a backlash by locals criticising the group’s failure to light up the town, the community group confirmed that a temporary tree would indeed be installed at Coronation Gardens later this week.Historically, a Christmas tree has been displayed at the war memorial however, due to ongoing refurbishment at Civic Square, the space cannot be decorated this year.Additionally, permanent lights – which the community council arranged to have installed on two trees in the town – have suffered delays due to Storm Arwen, but the group “remains hopeful this will be resolved soon”.An online statement by the group said: “The community council has become aware of a series of provocative posts on other local social media pages about the town’s Christmas lights.“The current community council was only formed in October, following public elections in September.“The previous committee took the decision in  not to pay out the usual £ for a temporary Christmas tree and put that money towards a living Christmas tree and towards permanently dressing with lights some mature living deciduous trees in the town.“The cost for tree-dressing is in the region of £, per tree.“Two trees were dressed for us by independent contractors in late autumn but are still awaiting connection to nearby lampposts by East Lothian Council electricians.“This is work the previous CC executive team valiantly attempted to have put in place for several months prior to their departure and the new CC executive team are still chasing for completion.”Following a review of the  lights for lampposts – currently stored away – a member discovered that many were in an unsuitable condition for display.The lights cost the team more than £, when purchased several years ago.Additionally, brackets and sockets to hang the lights are missing from lampposts.The statement added: “A decision was taken to trust that East Lothian Council would be good to its word for the - Christmas season and connect up the two new trees, allowing us to invest this money in dressing more permanent deciduous trees next year.”Fiona O’Donnell, ward councillor, said: “I am pleased that there will be some Christmas lights in Prestonpans this year.“I know that the community were keen to see this happen after such a dficult year.“Going forward, I want to work with the community council to explore how we make sure that there will be Christmas lights in future years.“We can learn from the example of the gala committee, who work all year round to make the Prestonpans Gala a real highlight of the year.“The exchanges on social media have been helpfulin explaining what is involved and how other communities arrange for lights in their area.“I think there is an understanding that having Christmas lights in the town will need volunteers fromthe local community.“Panners always step up when their community needs them and I am confident that we can work together to build on what we have this year and make it even better in future years.”The community council added: “It’s worth remembering that the members are unpaid volunteers.“Like those iniduals posting nonsense, we have jobs, lives, hobbies, family and other things to be getting on with too.“Like everyone who lives in the town, young or old, recent arrival or th-generation Panner, we all want to create a beautul, peaceful and happy town for us all to live, work and grow old in.”A number of Facebook users responded to the statement, with one stating: “Folk are going to voice their opinions as there has been no communication to inform the community

Can we control it even after this big gathering, that’s the question.“Will it lead to a spike, will it lead to a wave, will actually the mitigation measures have been enough “I know they thought a lot about making sure people were fully vaccinated, people were testing, it’s a really tricky one because obviously this is the worst timing ever during a pandemic but at the same time I listened to those people who work in climate and they are saying now is the time,not now we have an existential threat to humanity.”Scottish Government advisor Professor Linda Bauld also said holding a mass event while the virus is circulating was “risky”.Each person attending COP had to show proof of a negative coronavirus test and people were also asked to provide information about their vaccination status as part of the accreditation process.More than  police officers also had to be taken off duty during the climate summit amid a Covid outbreak scare.: Glasgow has lowest virus rate in Scotland despite COP spike fearsSince October , there have been  Covid cases across Scotland of people who reported attending or supporting a COP-related event, which could include the summit itself, as well as workshops, seminars, protests or marches.While the seven-day incidence rate of infection in Scotland began to increase during the COP summit, from  cases per , on November  to  cases per , on November , this increase was primarily driven by rising cases among children between  and  years old. In the final week of COP, case rates rose in the adult population aged -to--years-old also, but stabilised and started to decline in the two weeks after COP alongside the rates amongst the younger age groups.Throughout the summit, the seven-day incidence rate of diagnosed infection in NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde remained the lowest of the mainland Scottish NHS Boards.The report stated: “Data available to PHS from enhanced and routine COVID- surveillance does not indicate a direct COP contribution to the increase in Covid- infections nationwide during the summit and there is no evidence of any connection between Omicron cases and COP. With infections falling in the two weeks following the end of the summit, it is likely that COP has had little impact on Covid- epidemiology in Scotland.”Dr Nick Phin, Director of Public Health Science and Medical Director, PHS said: “Today’s report reinforces preliminary findings that COP concluded successfully without any signicant public health risks being identied. Additionally, investigations using available data show no evidence of any connection between Omicron cases and participation in COP.“These findings will be important in informing the surveillance response for any future large scale events where Covid- remains a threat to health.“On behalf of PHS, I extend our thanks and gratitude to all those involved in the tremendous effort that has allowed for the safe and successful delivery of this event during the pandemic.”"},{"url":null,"title":"scots-band-teams-wallace-gromit-creators-christmas-special","story":"A SCOTTISH band has teamed up with the makers of Wallace and Gromit and Shaun the Sheep on their first-ever Christmas musical.Robin Robin, Aardman’s animated family movie has just been released on Netflix in time for the festive season and features songs and music written by Wigtown duo, The Bookshop Band.Husband and we Beth Porter and Ben Please, who live in Scotland’s Book Town, not only composed and performed the music and songs but also coached the film’s stars Gillian Anderson, Richard E Grant and -year-old Bronte Carmichael.The -minute animated short from Aardman, a four-time Academy Award winning animation studio in conjunction with Netflix, tells the tale of a small bird with a big heart. Raised by a family of burglar mice, Robinsets out on a big adventure to steal a Christmas sandwich so they can all enjoy a real festive feast. Along the way she encounters a curmudgeonly magpiewho is an obsessive collector of shiny stuff and faces mortal danger from the villainous Catwho fancies Robin and friends as her own lunch.Beth Porter said: “We’ve worked on short animations before, but this is by far the biggest project of its kind we have ever taken on – and it’s been great.“One of the wonderful things is that music we composed and recorded here in Wigtown is now going to be part of millions of people’s Christmas entertainment all over the world.”The Bookshop Band, who are well-known for the literature-related songs they write and perform, sometimes accompanied by famous authors, were involved with the Robin Robin project right from its start over two years ago.They gave each character its own musical identity - Robin’s appearances are accompanied by a recorder, the cat by a baritone ukulele and bass clarinet and the magpie’s theme is a muted jazz trumpet. There’s even a nod to the music of previous Aardman projects, like Wallace  Gromit, with the frequent use of a brass band in the background.Much of what audiences will be listening to is pure Bookshop Band, though the duo brought in additional musicians for some parts and even a full choir for the finale.Coaching sessions with the cast were important as they had been selected for the character of their speaking voices rather than because of any background as singers.Porter added: “They were all really down-to-earth and friendly. When we met Gillian, she greeted us with a nice little elbow bump. I don’t think she realised it was a singing part, but we coached her. Her cat voice was a mixture of Margaret Thatcher at her most haughty and a husky feline growl.“I was really impressed with the way Richard went through his songs and made them sound just amazing. He really went for it and threw himself into the character of the grumpy magpie with a house full of stolen treasures that the clumsy Robin keeps knocking over. Gillian and Richard are actors rather than trained singers, but they pulled it off really well and were really fun to work with.”Her husband and musical partner, Ben, is the older brother of one of the film’s directors, Mikey Please, and this is their tenth professional collaboration. Previous work includes Mikey’s  BAFTA winning short The Eagleman Stag for which Ben composed and performed the music.Despite being most closely associated with music, Ben has a deep understanding of movies having spent a decade as an environmental documentary maker in East Africa and continuing to work as a cinematographer.When the brothers were growing up in Bath, they often worked on projects together and Ben recalls how his brother’s talent for model-making, that is a key part of his love of animation, began to show at an early age.Ben Please said: “When I was about  and he was six we were making models and mine were much better. About two years later things had changed and even though he was four years younger, when we made models, his were way ahead.”In recent years their professional collaborations have broadened to involve Beth as another musical talent and, from the movie-making side, Dan Ojari, co-director of Robin Robin.Please added: “Mikey has an excellent appreciation of music, so he knows what we do and whether it’s right for a project, and we know exactly the sort of thing that he will like.”Mikey Please said: “Because we know each other really well, and also have a strong working relationship, we were able to develop the music alongside the story, from the point we pitched it to the point it was made.”At times, the songs were written in advance of the story and scenes were written around the music, rather than the other way round. “It was not the usual thing where you do a scene and then give it to musicians to score. The two processes went hand-in-hand,” added Mikey Please.•Robin Robin is available on Netflix for the Christmas season – see the main trailer at https:www.youtube watch vKhykVEvJ"},{"url":null,"title":"nicola-sturgeon-said-today---omicron-christmas-measures-announced","story":"It marked the first ministers third announcement in seven days, having given briefings both last Tuesday and Friday on the developing Omicron situation in Scotland. And its not the last we will see of Scotlands leader today, with a televised address expected later this evening. The Scottish government announced on Sunday that their booster vaccine programme would be extended, aiming to offer all adults over  the third jab before the new year. Three jabs is thought to be more effective in preventing serious illness against Omicron, pushing the governments of the four nations to make ambitious targets for administering boosters. Today, Nicola Sturgeon offered further details on this rollout, as well as announcing new measures to try and curb the spread of Covid over the festive season. Heres what we learned from Nicola Sturgeons Covid update today...Nicola Sturgeon is urging Scots to limit socialising to a maximum of three households at a time. However, this measure is only advised and therefore not required by law. The first minister said: \"We are not banning or restricting household mixing in law as before.

although guidelines will be issued later this week.Ms Sturgeon said the Scottish Government had wanted to go further but is hampered by a lack of Treasury funding to compensate businesses. She said: \"Because the UK government is at this stage not proposing any further protections - a position I do not agree with - there is no funding generated to compensate businesses for any protections we think are necessary and wish to put in place.\"That is not acceptable in current circumstances and, with the Welsh and Northern Irish governments, we are pressing for a fairer approach that takes account of our devolved responsibilities for protecting public health.\"Around £ million from Scotland Government funds will be used to help support hospitality, food and culture businesses adversely affected by todays guidance and previous advice on deferring works Christmas parties, said Ms Sturgeon.From tomorrow people aged  to  will also be able to book Covid booster appointments through the online portal. However, Ms Sturgeon said the Scottish Government does not expect all adults to receive a booster over the next two weeks but was \"aiming to get as close to % uptake as possible\" by the end of December. Preliminary evidence suggests that being doubly vaccinated offers far less protection against symptomatic Covid infections caused by Omicron than Delta - around -% after  weeks - but that this rises to % with a booster. It comes as early real world data from South Africa indicates that people who had received two doses of the Pfizer Covid vaccine appeared were % less likely to have been hospitalised with Omicron.The study released by South Africas largest private health insurance administrator, Discovery Health, was based on , suspected cases of the new iant up to December , after it had become the dominant strain.This compares with % efficacy against hospital admission during South Africas outbreak of the Delta iant.The protection was maintained across age groups and in the face of a range of chronic illnesses, said Ryan Noach, the chief executive officer of Discovery Health.The study also found that hospital-admission risk with Omicron appeared to be % lower for the general adult population, compared with South Africa’s first wave of Covid cases in mid- caused by the original Wuhan strain.It is believed that the build-up of immunity in the population through vaccines and prior infection could explain this reduction in hospitalisations compared to the first wave as - while evidence suggests Omicron is more capable of causing reinfections and has reduced vaccine efficacy against infection - protection against more severe illness remains stronger.Around % or more of South Africas population has been exposed to Covid at some stage during the past  months, with a quarter also fully vaccinated.Glenda Gray, president of the South African Medical Research Council, said: “We don’t know how omicron is going to evolve in countries with low vaccination or prior infection rates.”The researchers cautioned that the extremely high transmissibility of the virus meant that the countrys hospitals could still be overwhelmed by Covid admissions due to the sheer number of people becoming infected, a percentage of whom would require treatment.It is also unclear how the virus will play out in a much older popular such as the UKs, which has three times as many people over  compared to South Africa.Shabir Mahdi of the University of the Witwatersrand, who has led vaccine trials South Africa, said: “The evolution of the Omicron iant is coming at a very dferent stage of the pandemic.“That is important to keep at the back of our minds when we see what is unfolding in South Africa and what we might see in other settings, which might have a very dferent epidemiology.\"He added: “In the South African much of the immunity that currently exists is largely because of the prior infection that has taken place during the first three waves.”Prof Mahdi added scientists are “simply unable to make a meaningful head to head comparison\" in the virulence of Omicron compared to previous Covid strains at this stage due to the impact of increased immunity, saying: “[That is] imply because of the underpinning of immunity that currently exists which is dferent to what existed in the past, and that immunity is going to bring about some change in the clinical course of the infection, including the likelihood of infection progressing to severe disease.”"},{"url":null,"title":"green-scotland-cop26-climate-investigation-full","story":"Our subscribers will get exclusive access as we look to answer the pressing questions in Scotlands climate crisis fight.As the COP conference looms on the horizon, we will leave no stone unturned in a bid to stimulate discussion and debate on this crucial topic.Find out more about our exclusive £ for two months offer here. From the hundreds of sites and big-name companies that broke environmental rules, to the most polluted streets in Scotland, readers can expect ground-breaking exclusives, in-depth analysis, and interactive content – as well as regular live videos, giving you the chance to speak directly with the award-winning reporters behind the stories.Here, you can find every article published in the week-long investigation so far -

It would almost be better to have a regulation and a furlough scheme.#Sharing doubts over what number of people and what premises they attended actually constituted a #party#, he added: #Given that it#s best according to the authorities to avoid party situations then from a business point of view, we need support.#We need some clarity followed by some support.#The BID chairman#s comments came as leaders of all four UK nations are set to meet to discuss the rising levels of the new Omicron iant of COVID-.

We are well underway with our vaccination boosters and aim to have all booster vaccines administered by the middle of January with all appointment letters out before Christmas.#From tomorrowall household contacts of confirmed cases, Omicron or not, need to isolate for  days regardless of vaccination status or a negative PCR result.

As such, it is urging people to defer such parties at this time.In a statement issued this evening, Dr Nick Phin, Public Health Scotland#s director of public health science and medical director, said: “There is much that we still need to learn about Omicron, but early evidence suggests that this new COVID iant is much more transmissible.#The impact of this transmissibility has been seen in recent weeks, with a number of Omicron outbreaks linked to parties.“We still need to learn more about the severity of disease caused by Omicron and the effectiveness of vaccines, but there are important things that we can do to help protect ourselves and our families now. To help minimise the further spread of COVID-, and Omicron in particular, I would strongly urge people to defer their Christmas parties to another time.“I appreciate that everyone is keen to celebrate this festive season, particularly after the pressures of the last twenty months, but by postponing some plans we can all do our bit to protect ourselves and our loved ones.”Public Health Scotland has also issued a reminder of the other measures we can all take to continue to keep safe over the festive period:copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

It was a new record for the competition, eclipsing the previous fastest mark of  games by Jurgen Klopp’s Liverpool.️⃣️⃣️⃣ @premierleague goals under @PepTeam 💫🔵 - ⚪️ #ManCity pic iQlkxJBog— Manchester CityDecember , More importantly for Guardiola, it was a seventh successive victory that extended City’s lead at the top of the table to four points, applying pressure to rivals Liverpool and Cha ahead of their games on Thursday.City were as ruthless as the scoreline suggests, completely overpowering Leeds in all departments.Guardiola had warned that Leeds’ high-tempo style would need to be countered and City did this by tearing into the visitors from the outset.With Rodri producing one of his best performances in a City shirt, a rampaging display reminiscent of Yaya Toure, the hosts attacked at will and with great fluidity.The tone was set as Grealish powered through the defence to test Illan Meslier in the opening minutes and, from then to the end, City were absolutely relentless.Guardiola had also predicted the game would be far dferent from Saturday’s hard-earned - win over a defensive-minded Wolves and so it proved as City racked up the chances with remarkable frequency. vw,vw,px, px\"Phil Foden, left, opens the scoring Leeds had a let-off as the in-form Bernardo Silva put a gilt-edged chance wide but the reprieve was short-lived as Foden opened the scoring on eight minutes.Rodri powered into the box after combining with Foden but Meslier managed to block. The ball rebounded as far as Foden and the England midfielder expertly guided it into the net.That strike brought up City’s impressive landmark under Guardiola but they were in no mood for stopping there.Another followed just five minutes later after a De Bruyne shot was deflected for a corner. Leeds half-cleared the Belgian’s cross from the set-piece but Mahrez sent a curling ball back into the box and Grealish headed past Meslier.Out of nothing, Leeds had a penalty appeal for handball against Oleksandr Zinchenko checked by VAR but nothing was given and normal service soon resumed. vw,vw,px, px\"Pep Guardiola liked what he saw against Leeds De Bruyne, back to his best after a recent spell out with Covid-, had an effort saved by Meslier but then made no mistake as he raced onto a Rodri ball to thump in the third on  minutes.He fizzed another shot over soon after and Foden also shot narrowly wide.City’s fourth came four minutes into the second half when Mahrez’s shot was deflected in off Junior Firpo.Leeds threatened briefly and Stuart Dallas hit the post but substitute Ilkay Gundogan was inches away from adding another for City as he volleyed wide and Foden was denied by an offside flag.The fth came soon after in emphatic fashion from De Bruyne as the midfielder unleashed a ferocious drive from outside the box that flew into the roof of the net.𝗥𝗢𝗖𝗞𝗘𝗧𝗠𝗔𝗡 🚀#MCILEE | @ManCity pic VevAzGCAA— Premier LeagueDecember , Stones made it - following a corner, tucking home at the second attempt after Meslier had saved a Laporte header and Stones’ initial effort on the rebound.Substitute Ake wrapped up the scoring with a powerful header from a corner  minutes from time.We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

It is good for us to have a player like that because he is a talented young player and on the other side, he made the right decision coming to us because we are delivering everything that he was hoping.“Now what is important is to maintain those performances he is having to allow him to go to a dferent level.”A brace in Sunday’s - win over Everton made Gallagher the outright top goalscorer at Palace this term and he will aim to build on that against Southampton at Selhurst Park on Wednesday.This is his joint-best scoring season after he found the net on six occasions during the - campaign while on loan in the Sky Bet Championship with Charlton and Swansea, and boss Vieira compared him to a Cha great during Tuesday’s press conference.“Conor has this passion for the game when he is on the field like a Ray Parlour, but I would say he has maybe the quality finishing of a Frank Lampard,” the Eagles manager added.“It is a manager’s dream to have a player like Conor because when he is on the field, he will give everything.“He is focused, concentrated and will always give his best. This is something that for me is really important.”Before his weekend double, Gallagher had gone four games without a goal, which coincided with partner-in-chief James McArthur suffering a hamstring injury.Since McArthur’s absence, Vieira has tried numerous dferent combinations in midfield and Will Hughes got the nod to good effect on Sunday.In Hughes’ first start in seven months, the ex-Watford player impressed at the base of the Eagles’ midfield trio.Vieira said: “I think there is more to come from Will. The more he will play, the better he will be. This is a position where there is competitiveness and this is what is good.“The competitiveness we have in midfield should bring out the best in each one of them, so that will be good for the team.“I was and I am really pleased with the game Will played and now what is important for him is to maintain that performance and be even better.”We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

Against Wolves he lacked rhythm but it is not easy to come back .“In these type of games, that are a bit more open and they put a lot of players in front, Kevin is the best.“We are really pleased he is coming back because we need him. He struggled at the start of the season but hopefully now he can maintain this rhythm longer.”City tore into Leeds from the outset and opened the scoring through Phil Foden after just eight minutes.

We dropped five points against Leeds last season and it was the same guys today, apart from Jack.“It was a good game but the stadium was phenomenal. It was sold out and the players felt it. Thank you so much.”Leeds boss Marcelo Bielsa pulled no punches as he bemoaned his side’s worst display since he took charge of the club in .The Argentinian said: “This is the worst performance in the four years.

We played Man United, they had outbreak. We wanted guidance over would it be fair on Villawe had symptomatic players around us ”He continued: “I am not saying all our players are symptomatic and have Covid because some are injured.“Grantdid his shoulder on Saturday and Ozan Kabak went down, so we have injured players, but we probably need a magic number telling us how many is enough.” vw,vw,px, px\"Ozan Kabak, right, goes down injured against Aston Villa Smith conceded he had “no idea”there was a specic amount of cases which saw a fixture called off, but the PA news agency understands there is no official threshold for the number of positive cases that would cause a game to be postponed.Rival bosses at Brentford and Arsenal in Thomas Frank and Mikel Arteta made similar calls for clarity earlier this week while the Premier League has brought in daily lateral flow testing for top-flight clubs and PCR testing will increase to twice a week.The Canaries boss had to delay naming his starting XI for the clash with Villa and another injury during the loss saw Sam Byram make his first appearance in close to two years following repeated hamstring problems, with a trip to West Ham on Saturday up next.“What we don’t want to be doing is taking risks going into games where there is an opportunity for it to be passed around during a game,” Smith added.“I don’t know . I will find out over the next  hours from the medical staff about our cases. I have seen new Premier League protocols where we are tested every day. The heat is on, not just across football but across the country.“I would normally name the team the day before and could have eight playerswho would be in the first team. Then the fact Ozan goes down and Sam Byram makes his first appearance in two years, we are down to the bare bones. I don’t want to make that excuse but there are reasons why we were off it.” vw,vw,px, px\"Steven Gerrard, right, celebrates Villa’s win Smith’s successor Steven Gerrard was delighted to watch his new team secure a fourth win from six matches since he took over in November.“The plan was to try and finish the game early and try to find the second goal earlier,” Gerrard insisted.“Whilst it is - you are always worried there could be one incident and that could be damaging but our performance certainly deserved a strong away win.“The week has been challenging, losing staff and players and having to cancel thesession on Sunday, but I thought first half we were outstanding.”We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

offered a third jab in the race against the spread of the Omicron iant.The country’s top medic has urged people to “please, get boosted now” in a sombre television advert, as the rollout extends to everyone aged  and above.It came as new restrictions were approved in Parliament on Tuesday evening, including the requirement to wear face coverings at more indoor spaces in England, and the introduction of NHS Covid passes for access to nightclubs and large venues.With almost  Conservative MPs voting against the mandatory passes measure, Boris Johnson suffered the largest rebellion of his premiership in the Commons.“Boosters give you the best possible protection against the virus and should signicantly reduce your risk of serious illness and hospitalisation.”Professor Chris Whitty, @CMO_England, on why you should Get Boosted Now.⬇️https:t.co nXkGchYa pic TetRXkqZ— UK Prime MinisterDecember , But the majority backing for the new rules was welcomed by NHS Providers chief executive Chris Hopson, who said they “should help slow the spread of the virus and help ease pressure on the NHS as we head into what is set is to be our most dficult ever winter”.Earlier, the Prime Minister had thanked NHS workers for their “incredible efforts” and called for their help in delivering the “biggest, fastest vaccination drive this country has ever seen”.In the letter, published on Twitter, Mr Johnson acknowledged that while healthcare staff are “tired and weary”, they know “how critical it is that we get Britain boosted, and fast”.In an advert which aired on ITV on Tuesday evening, England’s chief medical officer Professor Chris Whitty said every adult “needs” to get a booster jab in the face of the “highly infectious” iant.He told viewers: “Boosters give you the best possible protection against the virus and should signicantly reduce your risk of serious illness and hospitalisation.”\" data-title\"Coronavirus – Tue Dec , \" data--holder\"PA Wire\" data--notice\"PA Wire PA

to all over s on Wednesday, and while people are eligible for a booster three months after their second vaccine they can book after two months.It marks the NHS meeting its objective to offer every eligible adult a chance to book a booster before the New Year.Prof Whitty had already warned the Cabinet of a “signicant increase in hospitalisations” from Omicron, and Mr Johnson told ministers to expect a “huge spike” in infections.The stark messages came as almost , new Covid- cases were reported, the highest total since January , driven by the surge in the highly-transmissible iant.Prof Whitty also said it is “too early to say how severe” the strain is after suggestions from South Africa that it could be relatively mild.And the World Health Organisation’s director-general Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus warned people they underestimate coronavirus at their peril, as he voiced concerns the Omicron iant is being dismissed by some as “mild”.Health Secretary Sajid Javid has told MPs that evenit did turn out to be less severe than the Delta iant, the fact it was so easily spread meant “it still has the potential to overwhelm the NHS”.Downing Street did not reject a suggestion that new Omicron cases could hit a million per day next week based on a “valid” estimate from the UK Health Security Agency that daily infections are currently around ,.In Scotland, people have been urged to limit their mixing by socialising with only up to two other households indoors either side of Christmas.Meanwhile in Northern Ireland, politicians also backed mandatory Covid certication regulations for patrons wishing to access nightclubs, pubs, restaurants and other licensed premises.In Wales, the public was told to prepare for more restrictions in the coming weeks, but the nation’s health minister insisted politicians do not want to “cancel Christmas”.From am on Wednesday, hotel quarantine for travellers arriving in England is abandoned, with all  countries on the red list removed because the spread of Omicron in the UK was deemed to mean the measure to prevent cases being imported was less effective.We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community

Without inbound students, we risk losing opportunities for outbound visits.“That’s why we want government to make sure that the visa system works for incoming exchange students. We think this is really importantwe want to make the Government’s newly launched Turing Scheme a success.”Maggie Wootton, study abroad operations manager at the University of Birmingham, said: “Incoming students are an integral part of international exchange programmes, unlocking study and work experiences for UK-based students at universities worldwide.“Success of the Turing Scheme depends on the availability of global placements for our students, meaning it is essential for the UK to be seen as an attractive destination of study.”Iona Murdoch, president of the Erasmus Student Network UK, said: “The current six-month period in place means students from lower socioeconomic backgrounds struggle to go abroad for long mobility opportunities and are unable to afford the upfront costs of the alternative visa types, therefore limiting their own opportunities to study abroad and limiting the contributions they bring.“Longer visas will allow students more time to settle in and will have more time to contribute, engage and volunteer for the local community to benefit themselves as well as society more directly.”A Government spokesman said: “Turing Scheme placements are not conditional on international exchange students travelling to the UK.“We have over , UK students taking up le-changing work and study placements in this academic year alone, in over  countries around the globe.”We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

This is a very signicant blow for him.”Other measures under the Government’s Plan B also cleared the Commons, including to drop the requirement to isolate and instead do daily Covid tests for those fully vaccinated people who are contacts of a positive Covid case.MPs also approved mandatory vaccinations for NHS and social care staff by April  and the requirement to wear face coverings to more indoor spaces in England – including museums and galleries.Some  Conservatives also voted against the mandatory vaccination plans.The size of the rebellion against the Covid passes came as a surprise after the PM had personally intervened to try and talk around rebels earlier in the evening by delivering a speech at the  Committee of backbench MPs.Sir Charles Walker, the vice-chairman of the committee, said the rebellion was a “cry of pain” by the party.He told BBC News: “This was just a bridge too far. I think they were putting a marker down. It was a cry of pain from the Conservative Party.“Heis in a very, very, very dficult position. There has been a strong view in within the Conservative Party that vaccine passports do not work and is not something many colleagues wanted to see introduced.“This is a very, very specic line being drawn in the sand now and I think the Prime Minister and his team need to listen.”The message from MPs comes as many are still angry over the revelations of alleged parties and gatherings held in Downing Street and where during lockdown restrictions, as well as longer held resentment about the Government’s handling of the standards row involving former MP Owen Paterson which led to Thursday’s by-election.On Tuesday night, a photograph emerged in the Daily Mirror of a previously reported party held by Tory mayoral candidate Shaun Bailey’s campaign team on December  last year.Mr Bailey quit the London Assembly’s Police and Crime Committee ahead of the publication of the photograph.While the Mirror also reported No  staff who stayed in Downing Street to take part in a Christmas quiz on December  were told to “go out the back” after the event.Cabinet Secretary Simon Case has been asked to investigate, and could report back as early as this week. vw,vw,px, px\"Cabinet Secretary Simon Case A Government spokesperson said: “Given there is an ongoing review, it would be inappropriate to comment while that is ongoing.”But the Liberal Democrats, who say they are now “neck and neck” with the Tories in the North Shropshire poll, said the ious scandals would hit the party – which previously enjoyed a nearly , majority in the seat – at the ballot box.Liberal Democrat health spokesperson Daisy Cooper said: “From No  to Tory HQ, the slew of rule-breaking revelations show that Boris Johnson has set a very low bar for standards within his party and his presence in Downing Street is eroding public trust.“This Thursday, voters in North Shropshire have the chance to tell him the party is over.”We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

RETIREMENT “Obviously, when retirement and lockdown came into play I had a lot more time on my hands so I sat down at the laptop to fiddle about and to write these wee stories.“As I started, this thing just took on a le of its own and became something completely dferent which was kind of a surprise to me, but a very pleasant surprise, as I really enjoyed writing it.”And I really enjoyed reading it, this simple tale of a hard-working father and his two sons making their way in the world.But the real stars of the book are the pigeons to whom Frankie cleverly lends human traits, such as the ability to talk - characters like Proud Boy, Warhorse and Bootsy.And, of course, Princess Sofia, who we come to learn resembles Frankie’s own mother.The trials and tribulations of the loft in attempting to win the biggest prizes in the sport resemble the struggles faced by Frankie’s family in an era when times were tough.But this isn’t a depressing tale rather, it is an uplting story of how families and, by extension, close-knit communities bandied together to overcome adversity. With a healthy dose of pigeon racing nostalgia thrown in for good measure.“Whilst some of the pigeon names and details have been changed the book is based on true le events,” continues Frankie.“It was never my intention to get the book published, I only started writing it as something to give the grandkids. “I really dont care about the business side of things – its just nice that people can read about my father.“I suppose people are quite surprised about the book but there’s more interest there than anything which is great.“Depending on the feedback who knows, there might even be a second one.”‘The Penzance Smash,’ published by Austin McAuley is out now."},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1639151440354.jpg--covid_19___fri_10th_december_figures.jpg?1639151440000\n","title":"wwwballymenaguardiancouknews20211210newscovid 19 fri 10th december figures","story":"The NI Department of Health dashboard shows two further coronavirus related deaths and  new positive test results.

Credit: Peter MorrisonDecember   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailWhile it may seem a dramatic move by the Education Minister to call an end to the body which was initially formed to regulate the teaching professions in Northern Ireland, that the council will cease going forward will not come as a surprise.In the end, the Department had given the council numerous chances to put its house in order, but had simply run out of patience.Read MoreFailings: Schools north and south ‘suffering from a chronic lack of investment’Established in  by the EducationOrder, the premise seemed simple enough. Establish a register of teachers in Northern Ireland, oversee the regulation of the profession by providing advice on training, career development and performance management of teachers and oversee the standard of conduct, all to be funded by teacher subscriptions.It was to be run by professionals, for professionals, but in recent years has been anything but professional. Riddled with dys and bullying, leaving it unable to operate effectively, its chief executive himself told Stormont’s Education Committee in March that he was fearful in the short term over the Council’s ability to operate effectively.That month Education Minister Peter Weir set up a review after Chief Executive Sam Gallaher, who had been in the post since , painted a bleak picture of the Council he inherited, admitting that, in his opinion, some of the  members were only there to bring the organisation down.They have succeeded, but were helped as the body’s powers have been undermined by signicant gaps in legislation. It could only become involved in cases of gross misconduct and had no say on any other disciplinary matters which remained the remit of schools.Built to govern, but not given the remit to do so.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up Thirteen members have resigned since . Allegations of bullying have been re, along with an inability to take decisions. In March, Mr Gallaher was unable to say there is no risk to children over the inability to adequately discipline teachers.There had been “a level of harassment” he admitted.But the complaints and allegations kept on coming, the infighting becoming an embarrassment to the profession and something more akin to the primary school playground.Twice the organisation was placed in special measures by the Department of Education, but having to oversee the body that was supposed to oversee became intolerable. The only thing members could agree on was that it just wasn’t working.Issues were compounded in August when it emerged the Council had fallen well behind in the registration of newly qualied teachers — almost  were left waiting for approval.In October Mr Gallaher wrote to the organisation’s council to inform them he would be standing down from his position in April .Broken beyond repair, the only sensible action was to rip it up and start again, but what replaces the Council must have the legal ability to govern, remove teachers who should not be teaching and give the profession the dignity it needs.Related topicsDepartment of HealthPeter WeirMore On Department of Health PremiumWells ‘banned’ from Stormont canteen under passport rulesCancellations and drop in trade leading to a ‘catastrophic impact# on hospitality sector, warns industry chiefWhat happens next : Potential threat of Omicron means jabs are as important as everSwann praises ‘herculean efforts’ amid plans to roll-out Covid booster jab to younger age groupsNew Lodge people denied easy access to walk-in testing: SFMost ReadNI Assembly backs mandatory Covid certication laws – How did your MLA vote £k PPE pack sold by NI sweets firm to NHS fetches £ in auctionLoyalist graffiti claiming ‘war is needed’ appears in NewtownardsHow, when and where to get your Covid- booster jab in Northern Ireland this weekArmagh teen was nearly swept to her death as she saved her father and boy from drowning in riverTop VideosPlayVideo: Funeral for -year-old Aaron Webb killed in Glenavy crash PlayBoris Johnson sets accelerated new year booster target in face of Omicron ‘tidal wave’PlayWatch: A beer one hundred years in makingLatest EducationAvoid last year’s chaos and act now, union tells Education Minister McIlveen over Omicron fearsFailings: Schools north and south ‘suffering from a chronic lack of investment’Northern Ireland’s General Teaching Council to be dissolved immediately due to ‘systemic failures’I fear for my friends under Taliban, says Tyrone man behind teacher training for Afghan girlsLevelling up: A plan that could help transform NI so that everyone could reap benefitsLatestPM’s leadership questioned as key North Shropshire by-election loomsBooster rollout ramps up as top medic says all adults need the jabClubs need to know ‘magic number’ of cases for Covid call-offs – Dean SmithKevin De Bruyne is ‘the best’ in these games – Pep GuardiolaJudge delays case against Michigan school suspect’s parents,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The DUP was opposed and voted against it following the Stormont debate.During Monday’s sitting, the party’s Jim Wells said “what I’m going to say is going to be controversial”.He told the assembly that as far as he was aware he was only one of two members who was not vaccinated.“It does not make me someone who should be discriminated against, or shunned in public.”The South Down MLA repeated his objections to taking the current vaccines on offer in NI.Mr Wells said he was not anti-vaccine but would want to be at the door of the vaccine clinic the day that there is a vaccine I can take as he expressed personal concerns about those on offer in the UK.His party colleague DUP MLA Paul Frew said bringing in vaccine passports amounted to “coercion and discrimination”.Here’s how each MLA voted:Dr Steve Aiken AYEMr Andy Allen AYEMr Jim Allister NOMs Caoimhe Archibald AYEMs Kellie Armstrong AYEMs Clare Bailey AYEMrs Rosemary Barton AYEMr Doug Beattie MC AYEMr Roy Beggs AYEMr John Blair AYEMr Cathal Boylan AYEMr Maurice Bradley NOMs Paula Bradley NOMs Sinéad Bradley AYEMs Paula Bradshaw AYEMs Nicola Brogan AYEMr Keith Buchanan NOMr Thomas Buchanan NOMr Jonathan Buckley NOMs Joanne Bunting NOMr Robbie Butler AYEMrs Pam Cameron NOMr Gerry Carroll ABSTAINEDMr Pat Catney AYEMr Alan Chambers AYEMr Trevor Clarke NOMr Pádraig Delargy AYEMr Stewart Dickson AYEMs Linda Dillon AYEMrs Diane Dodds NOMs Jemma Dolan AYEMr Stephen Dunne NOMr Mark Durkan AYEMr Alex Easton NOMs Sinéad Ennis AYEMrs Deborah Erskine NOMs Ciara Ferguson AYEMs Órlaithí Flynn AYEMr Paul Frew NOMr Colm Gildernew AYEMs Deirdre Hargey AYEMr Harry Harvey NOMr David Hilditch NOMr William Humphrey NOMs Cara Hunter AYEMr William Irwin NOMr Declan Kearney AYEMrs Dolores Kelly AYEMr Gerry Kelly AYEMs Liz Kimmins AYEMrs Naomi Long AYEMr Trevor Lunn AYEMr Chris Lyttle AYEMr Declan McAleer AYEMr Daniel McCrossan AYEMr Patsy McGlone AYEMr Colin McGrath AYEMr Philip McGuigan AYEMr Maolíosa McHugh AYEMs Sinead McLaughlin AYEMr Justin McNulty AYEMs Nichola Mallon AYEMr Andrew Muir AYEMs Áine Murphy AYEMr Conor Murphy AYEMr Mike Nesbitt AYEMr Robin Newton NOMs Carál Ní Chuilín AYEMr John O#Dowd AYEMrs Michelle O#Neill AYEMr Matthew O#Toole AYEMiss Aisling Reilly AYEMr George Robinson NOMs Emma Rogan AYEMr Pat Sheehan AYEMs Emma Sheerin AYEMr Christopher Stalford NOMr John Stewart AYEMr Mervyn Storey NOMs Claire Sugden AYEMr Robin Swann AYEMr Peter Weir NOMr Jim Wells NOMiss Rachel Woods AYEMost ReadNI Assembly backs mandatory Covid certication laws – How did your MLA vote £k PPE pack sold by NI sweets firm to NHS fetches £ in auctionLoyalist graffiti claiming ‘war is needed’ appears in NewtownardsHow, when and where to get your Covid- booster jab in Northern Ireland this weekArmagh teen was nearly swept to her death as she saved her father and boy from drowning in riverTop VideosPlayVideo: Funeral for -year-old Aaron Webb killed in Glenavy crash PlayBoris Johnson sets accelerated new year booster target in face of Omicron ‘tidal wave’PlayWatch: A beer one hundred years in makingLatest CoronavirusMapping coronavirus in Northern Ireland: Covid cases by location and the seven-day rolling averageAvoid last year’s chaos and act now, union tells Education Minister McIlveen over Omicron fearsCancellations and drop in trade leading to a ‘catastrophic impact# on hospitality sector, warns industry chiefSwann rails at First Minister for U-turn on Covid passportsStormont debate on contentious Covid vaccine passports suspended amid legal concernsLatestPM’s leadership questioned as key North Shropshire by-election loomsBooster rollout ramps up as top medic says all adults need the jabClubs need to know ‘magic number’ of cases for Covid call-offs – Dean SmithKevin De Bruyne is ‘the best’ in these games – Pep GuardiolaJudge delays case against Michigan school suspect’s parents,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

as top medic says all adults need the jab","story":"All adults across England can book a booster jab  FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueAll adults across England can book a booster jab By PA ReporterDecember   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailThe NHS is ramping up its mammoth booster effort even further as all adults across England are offered a third jab in the race against the spread of the Omicron iant.The country’s top medic has urged people to “please, get boosted now” in a sombre television advert, as the rollout extends to everyone aged  and above.It came as new restrictions were approved in Parliament on Tuesday evening, including the requirement to wear face coverings at more indoor spaces in England, and the introduction of NHS Covid passes for access to nightclubs and large venues.With almost  Conservative MPs voting against the mandatory passes measure, Boris Johnson suffered the largest rebellion of his premiership in the Commons.“Boosters give you the best possible protection against the virus and should signicantly reduce your risk of serious illness and hospitalisation.” Professor Chris Whitty, @CMO_England, on why you should Get Boosted Now.⬇️https:t.co nXkGchYa pic TetRXkqZ— UK Prime MinisterDecember , But the majority backing for the new rules was welcomed by NHS Providers chief executive Chris Hopson, who said they “should help slow the spread of the virus and help ease pressure on the NHS as we head into what is set is to be our most dficult ever winter”.Earlier, the Prime Minister had thanked NHS workers for their “incredible efforts” and called for their help in delivering the “biggest, fastest vaccination drive this country has ever seen”.In the letter, published on Twitter, Mr Johnson acknowledged that while healthcare staff are “tired and weary”, they know “how critical it is that we get Britain boosted, and fast”.In an advert which aired on ITV on Tuesday evening, England’s chief medical officer Professor Chris Whitty said every adult “needs” to get a booster jab in the face of the “highly infectious” iant.He told viewers: “Boosters give you the best possible protection against the virus and should signicantly reduce your risk of serious illness and hospitalisation.”\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk cc .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_abb-aa-e-bc-dddaba_embedded

FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueAll adults in England can now take up the offer of a coronavirus booster vaccine The NHS national booking system opened up to all over s on Wednesday, and while people are eligible for a booster three months after their second vaccine they can book after two months.It marks the NHS meeting its objective to offer every eligible adult a chance to book a booster before the New Year.Prof Whitty had already warned the Cabinet of a “signicant increase in hospitalisations” from Omicron, and Mr Johnson told ministers to expect a “huge spike” in infections.The stark messages came as almost , new Covid- cases were reported, the highest total since January , driven by the surge in the highly-transmissible iant.Prof Whitty also said it is “too early to say how severe” the strain is after suggestions from South Africa that it could be relatively mild.And the World Health Organisation’s director-general Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus warned people they underestimate coronavirus at their peril, as he voiced concerns the Omicron iant is being dismissed by some as “mild”.Health Secretary Sajid Javid has told MPs that evenit did turn out to be less severe than the Delta iant, the fact it was so easily spread meant “it still has the potential to overwhelm the NHS”.Downing Street did not reject a suggestion that new Omicron cases could hit a million per day next week based on a “valid” estimate from the UK Health Security Agency that daily infections are currently around ,.In Scotland, people have been urged to limit their mixing by socialising with only up to two other households indoors either side of Christmas.Meanwhile in Northern Ireland, politicians also backed mandatory Covid certication regulations for patrons wishing to access nightclubs, pubs, restaurants and other licensed premises.In Wales, the public was told to prepare for more restrictions in the coming weeks, but the nation’s health minister insisted politicians do not want to “cancel Christmas”.From am on Wednesday, hotel quarantine for travellers arriving in England is abandoned, with all  countries on the red list removed because the spread of Omicron in the UK was deemed to mean the measure to prevent cases being imported was less effective.

This is a very signicant blow for him.”Other measures under the Government’s Plan B also cleared the Commons, including to drop the requirement to isolate and instead do daily Covid tests for those fully vaccinated people who are contacts of a positive Covid case.MPs also approved mandatory vaccinations for NHS and social care staff by April  and the requirement to wear face coverings to more indoor spaces in England – including museums and galleries.Some  Conservatives also voted against the mandatory vaccination plans.The size of the rebellion against the Covid passes came as a surprise after the PM had personally intervened to try and talk around rebels earlier in the evening by delivering a speech at the  Committee of backbench MPs.Sir Charles Walker, the vice-chairman of the committee, said the rebellion was a “cry of pain” by the party.He told BBC News: “This was just a bridge too far. I think they were putting a marker down. It was a cry of pain from the Conservative Party.“Heis in a very, very, very dficult position. There has been a strong view in within the Conservative Party that vaccine passports do not work and is not something many colleagues wanted to see introduced.“This is a very, very specic line being drawn in the sand now and I think the Prime Minister and his team need to listen.”It was a cry of pain from the Conservative PartySir Charles WalkerThe message from MPs comes as many are still angry over the revelations of alleged parties and gatherings held in Downing Street and where during lockdown restrictions, as well as longer held resentment about the Government’s handling of the standards row involving former MP Owen Paterson which led to Thursday’s by-election.On Tuesday night, a photograph emerged in the Daily Mirror of a previously reported party held by Tory mayoral candidate Shaun Bailey’s campaign team on December  last year.Mr Bailey quit the London Assembly’s Police and Crime Committee ahead of the publication of the photograph.While the Mirror also reported No  staff who stayed in Downing Street to take part in a Christmas quiz on December  were told to “go out the back” after the event.Cabinet Secretary Simon Case has been asked to investigate, and could report back as early as this week.\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk adf .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_c---d-_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk adf .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_c---d-_embedded w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeClose\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk adf .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_c---d-_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk adf .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_c---d-_embedded w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"Cabinet Secretary Simon Case PA FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueCabinet Secretary Simon Case A Government spokesperson said: “Given there is an ongoing review, it would be inappropriate to comment while that is ongoing.”But the Liberal Democrats, who say they are now “neck and neck” with the Tories in the North Shropshire poll, said the ious scandals would hit the party – which previously enjoyed a nearly , majority in the seat – at the ballot box.Liberal Democrat health spokesperson Daisy Cooper said: “From No  to Tory HQ, the slew of rule-breaking revelations show that Boris Johnson has set a very low bar for standards within his party and his presence in Downing Street is eroding public trust.“This Thursday, voters in North Shropshire have the chance to tell him the party is over.” Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletter Receive todays headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.

Reporter: Staff Reporter Dec   addthis, Lynch’s, the local family retailer which operates a number of Spar and Eurospar stores and supermarkets, have opened their third local supermarket bringing their total store number to eight across the North West and Mid Ulster. googletag.cmd.push Lynch’s Eurospar, Greysteel is the third outlet from the retailer to open under the popular Eurospar brand and has allowed management to more than double the number of jobs available, now employing  locally. Acquiring what was previously a Centra store on the site, company director Paul Lynch says the community needed a larger format supermarket brand that would not only bring a host of fresh and local produce and ranges, but would be convenient and complemented with services vital to the local area. Paul said: “We have invested around pound, to bring our supermarket experience to the Greysteel area and are so proud to open the doors. “We have more than doubled the size of the space which allows optimum navigation throughout the aisles, where shoppers will find an increased iety and range of fresh and local foods including our own meat offering and pre-packed ranges. “Importantly, we have continued the on-site partnership with Nicholl Fuels to offer locals a -hour fuel service with pre-pay pumps and we have  parking spaces to allow shoppers to conveniently load their cars safely.” The team has also retained important services including the Post Office, ATM, Lotto and PayPoint and added even more amenities and initiatives to bring value and choice to the area. The deli now serves an extended range of hot and cold food to go alongside Barista Bar coffee and Spar bakery, and shoppers can take advantage of the many deals available including the current  Deals of Christmas campaign which drops the price of big name items and festive essentials every week in the lead up to Christmas. Paul continued: “Eurospar also price matches over a thousand branded products to Tesco each week, so paired with our consistent schedule of value deals, we’re bringing a huge amount of savings for shoppers.” As is the Lynch and Eurospar ethos, the team in-store will implement outreach initiatives with the local community, sponsoring and supporting local clubs and organisations, while also fundraising for charity partner Cancer Fund for Children. Paddy Doody, sales and marketing director at Henderson Group, which owns the Eurospar brand in Northern Ireland added: “We now have  Eurospar supermarkets in Northern Ireland, each one bringing a wealth of convenience in a large format supermarket to their areas. “The Lynch’s are experienced independent retailers and know how to engage with their local communities, with an incredibly high bar set for customer service. “Its fantastic to see the Eurospar brand thriving under our independent retailers and we wish Lynch’s the best of luck with their new business.” The new supermarket in Greysteel joins Lynch’s portfolio of stores including Eurospars in the Skeoge area of Derry and Draperstown in Magherafelt, plus Spars in Dungiven, Claudy, Newbuildings and Trench Road in Co Derry, and Clonoe in Coalisland.  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About gallery from Walshs \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true _.jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About gallery from Walshs  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

Mayor of Derry, Alderman Grahame Warke and Bishops Donal McKeown and Brian Forster feature in the emotional film produced as a tribute to the pandemic. The film tells the story of the restrictions placed on families and friends, who never really got an opportunity to say goodbye to loved ones.  The film featues very sensitive and emotional tribute paid to a loved one who passed away by the recital of the poem Goodbye by Thornhill pupil, Tieghan Doherty, at the end of the film.  Joseph McCarthy, the writer, director and producer of Grief, thanked everyone involved in the production of the film and Derry and Strabane District Council and Derry Credit Union for supporting it.  He added: “Paddy Simpson, from Brunswick Moviebowl who screened the film and was very supportive of Grief, deserves a special word of thanks, as do Charles Bradley and Joe Parke from Bradley and McLaughlin Undertakers, Bishop Forster, Bishop McKeown and Mayor Warke.” The film can be viewed on YouTube by means of several links on Black North Productions’ Facebook page and has had over  views in less than a week. Next up for the local film company will be their anti-bullying film, Summary Justice, which deals with the ongoing issue of bullying in schools and will involve local pupils, parents, several teachers and the principal of Saint Saviours College, where most of the action takes place.   *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About gallery from Walshs \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true _.jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About gallery from Walshs  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

Now, more than  years on, Marie-Claire revisited the project to see how Irish identity has changed. The book contains the personal reflections of  contributors from a iety of sectors, backgrounds and viewpoints on their identity and what it means to them to ‘be Irish, The contributions come from the ranks of the famous and not so famous, people at the centre of things and people at the margins, people who live in Ireland and those who live abroad, the Irish and not-Irish-but-interested. Contributors include Lisa McGee, playwright and writer of Derry GirlsDr Teresa Lambe, co-inventor of the Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine General Martin Dempsey, former chair- person of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in the US Mervyn Gibson, Grand Secretary of the Grand Orange Lodge of Ireland Merlin Holland, Oscar Wilde’s only grandchild well-known broad- caster Eamonn HolmesNorthern Irish jockeyAP McCoy singer- songwriter Ryan McMullan Irish Olympian, Sonia O’Sullivan and many more. Speaking on the book and her decision to edit it now, Marie-Claire said: “Having both lived and travelled outside Ireland, I became aware of how strong the sense of identity was amongst the Irish. I was also conscious that change was sweeping across the Island of Ireland and I was curious to discover just how robust or fluid Irish identity was during this time of profound change.” “Above all, the reflections in the book show that there are many ways of being Irish.

Bookings will open December  as the large centre opens due to growing concerns over the Omricon iant. You can still receive vaccinations from your GP and local pharmacists. People will be encouraged to use the booking system as the number of walk-ins that can be accommodated will be limited. Visit the Western Trustwebsite as of December  for updates on booking info:westerntrust.hscni.net western-trust-covid--information-updates covid--vaccination-programme  Alternatively you can book at a local participating chemist or pharmacy for first, second or booster vaccines. The Western Trust has issued an appeal to staff to help in the escalated operation as vaccinators. The Trust stated in a post: “The Chief Medical Officers have agreed that the COVID- Booster Programme should be accelerated to help deal with the Omicron Variant. We are therefore once again asking for your help and are calling all those staff who previously worked in our vaccination programme back to assist over the next three weeks. This includes Vaccinators, Administrators and Support Services staff. Our Chief Executive and Corporate Management Team have agreed that staff will be released back to support the vaccine programme, unless there are exceptional circumstances. We appreciate how important leave is and we will try to protect any leave already booked, but would appreciate any flexibility that staff may be able to give. The announcement comes as SDLP Councillor, Brian Tierney, encouraged people across Derry to get their Covid- booster vaccine. Councillor Tierney said: “I would encourage everyone who is eligible to get their Covid- booster vaccine as soon as possible to protect themselves and those around them. With the renewed threat the Omicron iant is posing to our society, we need to do everything we can to increase our defences to the virus. I would also urge anyone yet to receive their first and second doses to take this opportunity to get vaccinated. “There will be a number of places throughout the Western Trust area where people can get their booster vaccine, including the Foyle Arena and Omagh Leisure Complex from Wednesday. Booster vaccinations can also be provided by your GP and local community pharmacy. People are being encouraged to book their appointment from Wednesday, but limited walk-ins will also be available. “Following the current Covid- guidelines, including getting vaccinated, using Covid certication, practising social distancing and washing our hands is the most effective way of keeping each other safe and preventing the need for further restrictions. Nobody wants to see another lockdown, particularly so close to Christmas, and we all need to pull together, get vaccinated and help each other through this dficult period.”  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About gallery from Walshs \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true _.jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About gallery from Walshs  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

Bookings will open December  as the large centre opens due to growing concerns over the Omricon iant. You can still receive vaccinations from your GP and local pharmacists. People will be encouraged to use the booking system as the number of walk-ins that can be accommodated will be limited. Visit the Western Trustwebsite as of December  for updates on booking info:westerntrust.hscni.net western-trust-covid--information-updates covid--vaccination-programme  Alternatively you can book at a local participating chemist or pharmacy for first, second or booster vaccines. The Western Trust has issued an appeal to staff to help in the escalated operation as vaccinators. The Trust stated in a post: “The Chief Medical Officers have agreed that the COVID- Booster Programme should be accelerated to help deal with the Omicron Variant. We are therefore once again asking for your help and are calling all those staff who previously worked in our vaccination programme back to assist over the next three weeks. This includes Vaccinators, Administrators and Support Services staff. Our Chief Executive and Corporate Management Team have agreed that staff will be released back to support the vaccine programme, unless there are exceptional circumstances. We appreciate how important leave is and we will try to protect any leave already booked, but would appreciate any flexibility that staff may be able to give. The announcement comes as SDLP Councillor, Brian Tierney, encouraged people across Derry to get their Covid- booster vaccine. Councillor Tierney said: “I would encourage everyone who is eligible to get their Covid- booster vaccine as soon as possible to protect themselves and those around them. With the renewed threat the Omicron iant is posing to our society, we need to do everything we can to increase our defences to the virus. I would also urge anyone yet to receive their first and second doses to take this opportunity to get vaccinated. “There will be a number of places throughout the Western Trust area where people can get their booster vaccine, including the Foyle Arena and Omagh Leisure Complex from Wednesday. Booster vaccinations can also be provided by your GP and local community pharmacy. People are being encouraged to book their appointment from Wednesday, but limited walk-ins will also be available. “Following the current Covid- guidelines, including getting vaccinated, using Covid certication, practising social distancing and washing our hands is the most effective way of keeping each other safe and preventing the need for further restrictions. Nobody wants to see another lockdown, particularly so close to Christmas, and we all need to pull together, get vaccinated and help each other through this dficult period.”  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About gallery from Walshs \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true _.jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About gallery from Walshs  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

Paacutedraig Delargy said: “We need to see major investment to improve rails services and connections in the North West of this island. “Linking up all rail services on an all-island basis presents huge opportunities to grow the economy and create jobs, particularly along the Western Corridor linking Derry to Sligo and Galway and delivering a faster train service to the capital in Dublin. “This would help unlock Derry’s potential, promote regional equality and connect us to the rest of this island with major benefits for workers and commuters. “Alongside this, delivering first-class public transport and investing in our rail lines can help tackle the climate emergency and reduce carbon emissions. That should be the focus of transport ministers, North and South. I would encourage people to take part in the consultation. The deadline to take part in this consultation is Friday, January .

Paacutedraig Delargy said: “We need to see major investment to improve rails services and connections in the North West of this island. “Linking up all rail services on an all-island basis presents huge opportunities to grow the economy and create jobs, particularly along the Western Corridor linking Derry to Sligo and Galway and delivering a faster train service to the capital in Dublin. “This would help unlock Derry’s potential, promote regional equality and connect us to the rest of this island with major benefits for workers and commuters. “Alongside this, delivering first-class public transport and investing in our rail lines can help tackle the climate emergency and reduce carbon emissions. That should be the focus of transport ministers, North and South. I would encourage people to take part in the consultation. The deadline to take part in this consultation is Friday, January .

Its clothing perfectly suited to the GAA fan looking for something slightly dferent, without club crests and sponsor logos.Fergal, along with his twin brother Fergal and friend Paul Hughes – Chairman of Derrytresk– is happy with how their brand has progressed. Originally, they had planned to launch for Christmas, but a change saw them get the ball rolling in April, in time for the twins th birthday celebrations.“It gave us something to focus on and one of the jumpers has  on the back, to signy the year we were born,” Fergal told the County Derry Post.There was always an interest in designing and a clothing brand was never far from his thoughts. During his playing days, hed never be far away when new kits were being deigned. A retro jersey released as part of Slaughtneils gear range had his fingerprints on it.“We are from a farming background, it is not the sort of thing youd associate us with...getting into fashion,” Fergal jokes.“But, its always something we have been interested in. I just think a lot of the GAA gear is based on playing members and wanted to do something dferent to appeal to our non-playing members as much as players.“A lot of it will carry club badges and sponsor logos, whereas not everybody wants to wear that kind of product to go to games.”Still playing for the clubs recreational team, he coaches the U footballers and hurlers. There is a pride in pulling into Emmet Park and seeing the Gael Foacutersa range, across dferent ages and colours. Interchangeable caps. Beanies. Shorts. Sweatshirts. T-Shirts. Half-zips. From black to white and green to mango, there is something for everyone. “I am not necessarily going to pull on my club gear, but I still want to pull on something that will associate you with the GAA,” he explains of their brands unique selling point.The name – Gael Foacutersa #WeAllBelong – was spun out of that inkling he had all those years ago.“I always had it in my head, thatI ever did start up a brand, that Gael Force would be the name I would go with,” Fergal explains.“We wanted to keep the Irish slant on it as well. It is very important to the club and community.”And so, Gael Foacutersa – True Gael – was born. After some scribbling with the lettering, the logo eventually came to le by accident. “The plan was to launch it on the lead up to Christmas”, Fergal adds. “Then we thought, the idea is there and well get something out there. Me and Francis, it was our th birthday in April, wed give ourselves a date to work to, to have the product launched.“We are very thankful for the support we have got from everybody. You now notice now the orders coming in, even from other counties, so it definitely seems to be going the right way.”Nestled deep within the brand is the importance of knowing that the game is much more than being part of the squad and taking to the field. It is about identity. A sense of belonging and inclusivity. Being part of a community of like-minded people with a mutual love for traditions and heritage.“So much of our young children and adult lives have become about the constant need to train, to diet, to play, to watch, to support, to belong but ultimately to win,” Gael Foacutersa outline in the story on their website.“Gael Foacutersa is about getting away from these pressures and the responsibilities of the game.We want to take it back to the basics. It’s about the enjoyment of it all and putting smiles on peoples faces.“The Gael Foacutersa range offers high-quality, comfortable and eye-catching men’s and ladies leisurewear. It aims to reinforce the customer’s sense of identity. To be more than just about the game. It’s about being part of something bigger.” googletag.cmd.push For the full range, check out their website: www.gaelforsa.ie  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About gallery from Walshs \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true _.jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About gallery from Walshs  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

The SDLP published their energy costs action plan last week and Mr Durkan called for a payment of up to pound, to be extended to all households in receipt of Universal Credit. The payment would help families top up their gas cards and fill their oil tanks so that they would be able to heat their homes over the winter without worrying about how to pay for it. Mr Durkan said: “Given the steep rise in energy bills over the last few months there are families across the North struggling to heat their homes this winter. “In the absence of any action from the Joint First Ministers or Minister Hargey to mitigate the situation the SDLP has produced a number of proposals in our energy costs action plan to try and help people through this very dficult period. “While energy bills are increasing by hundreds of pounds a year, Universal Credit claimants, who are already struggling to get by, have seen their payments cruelly cut by pound a week by the Tory government and waved through by Sinn Feacutein. “These people were barely able to cover their bills before the recent price hikes and I cannot see how they will able to meet these massive costs. “In an attempt to help the people who really need it I’m calling for the winter fuel payment, a modest payment of up to pound, to be extended to all households in receipt of Universal Credit. “This money will allow families to top up their gas cards and fill their oil tanks to get them through this winter, then we can focus on tackling the long-term issues around fuel poverty. “I’m also calling on the Department for Communities to work with the Department for Health to explore how families with children with disabilities can be supported to cope with rising energy costs. “It’s disgraceful that we are already in the grip of winter and no plan has been forthcoming to help low income families deal with these mounting issues. “I will continue lobbying Minister Hargey and doing all I can to secure immediate support for the people who need it most.”   *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About gallery from Walshs \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true _.jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About gallery from Walshs  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

The Mayor was promoting a shop local drive for ChristmasReporter: Matthew Leslie Dec Email: matthew.leslie@iconicnews.ie  addthis, Mayor Graham Warke has urged Derrys festive shoppers to shop local this Christmas during his whistle-stop tour of businesses and shops throughout the city. googletag.cmd.push Last week the Mayor visited a number of retail outlets and shops to find out how local traders are finding the Christmas shopping season. As part of his tour, the Mayor visited businesses in the heart of the city centre, including the Craft Village and in the Waterside. He also visited businesses in the outskirts of town at Maydown and in Eglinton and later in the week spent time with traders in Strabane. This past  months have been an extremely challenging time for local businesses, and Derry City  Strabane District Council is keen to inspire confidence among the public by encouraging them to shop local. The Council has been working closely with the business community throughout the pandemic, delivering a range of support from bespoke advice to essential grant aid. Mayor Warke said: “Local businesses have worked tirelessly throughout the pandemic. “Now during the busiest shopping period of the year, it’s vitally important that we support these local traders as much as possible. “These independently owned businesses are what makes our City and District unique and I was delighted to see the products and wares they have on offer, particularly for Christmas gts. I would encourage the public, as much as possible, to spend local this year.” Business Development Officer with Derry City and Strabane District Council, Tara Nicholas, reiterated the Mayor’s comments adding: “Mayor Warke has heard first-hand from traders about the dficulties they have been facing throughout the pandemic. “They have also shared with the us the sense of ‘community spirit and support’ they have been receiving from their customers. “We have a great opportunity to help our home-grown, independent businesses here flourish. “Deciding to shop local really makes a huge dference to our local traders and we shouldn’t underestimate how impactful even our small spends can be. “Our independent stores and shops employ so many local staff and by supporting them, we are making a great choice in terms of supporting ourselves.” Find out more about the campaign at:shoplocalderrystrabane   *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About gallery from Walshs \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true _.jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About gallery from Walshs  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

The Mayor was promoting a shop local drive for ChristmasReporter: Matthew Leslie Dec Email: matthew.leslie@iconicnews.ie  addthis, Mayor Graham Warke has urged Derrys festive shoppers to shop local this Christmas during his whistle-stop tour of businesses and shops throughout the city. googletag.cmd.push Last week the Mayor visited a number of retail outlets and shops to find out how local traders are finding the Christmas shopping season. As part of his tour, the Mayor visited businesses in the heart of the city centre, including the Craft Village and in the Waterside. He also visited businesses in the outskirts of town at Maydown and in Eglinton and later in the week spent time with traders in Strabane. This past  months have been an extremely challenging time for local businesses, and Derry City  Strabane District Council is keen to inspire confidence among the public by encouraging them to shop local. The Council has been working closely with the business community throughout the pandemic, delivering a range of support from bespoke advice to essential grant aid. Mayor Warke said: “Local businesses have worked tirelessly throughout the pandemic. “Now during the busiest shopping period of the year, it’s vitally important that we support these local traders as much as possible. “These independently owned businesses are what makes our City and District unique and I was delighted to see the products and wares they have on offer, particularly for Christmas gts. I would encourage the public, as much as possible, to spend local this year.” Business Development Officer with Derry City and Strabane District Council, Tara Nicholas, reiterated the Mayor’s comments adding: “Mayor Warke has heard first-hand from traders about the dficulties they have been facing throughout the pandemic. “They have also shared with the us the sense of ‘community spirit and support’ they have been receiving from their customers. “We have a great opportunity to help our home-grown, independent businesses here flourish. “Deciding to shop local really makes a huge dference to our local traders and we shouldn’t underestimate how impactful even our small spends can be. “Our independent stores and shops employ so many local staff and by supporting them, we are making a great choice in terms of supporting ourselves.” Find out more about the campaign at:shoplocalderrystrabane   *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About gallery from Walshs \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true _.jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About gallery from Walshs  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

Cllr Harkin said the city of Derry should be proud of the workers for standing firm and stated that industrial action could easily have been avoided by the two employers. And Cllr Harkin expressed his hopes that both employers can learn from this dispute and move on and not to victimise employees who are UNITE trade union members for the action they were forced to take. He said: “We commend Derry dockers for staying strong and winning their demands following strike action. They should be proud of what they achieved. Everyone in the city should be proud of the dockers victory. “By staying united and braving freezing weather on the picket line, UNITE members at Burke Shipping Services and Foyle Port made gains on pay parity and a wage increase. “This was a strike that should never have been necessary. The demands made by workers were very modest but employer intransigence gave them no option but to take action. “The attempt to portray workers negatively by employers raises serious questions about public accountability when Council support is sought to become a Free Port. “It also raises questions about Derry City and Strabane Councillors having paid positions as part of the Foyle Port Commission. “People Before Profit activists were on the picket line everyday of the strike and we successfully put forward a motion winning the Council to take a clear-cut position in support of the strike and trade union demands. “We will be demanding the Council make clear there should be no victimisation of workers and the trade union following the end of the dispute. “Dockers and other workers have been told throughout the pandemic that they play a critical role as key, frontline and essential workers. “Trade unions are now demanding this is translated into improved wages and conditions for workers across all sectors. “That employers and the Stormont Executive arent automatically backing these demands points up the problem of an economy catering to elites where the gap between the least well-off and those at the top has skyrocketed. “Workers across Derry, across the North and across Ireland should take confidence and example from the resilience of Foyle Port dockers. “This is what will need to happenwe are to ensure health workers, Council workers, Education support workers and all others begin to be treated with dignity, respect and more economic equality. “No one should be told they should wait for better days - this is the time to use solidarity and action to challenge poverty pay.” UNITE General Secretary, Sharon Graham, added: “This is a tremendous win for our members. “Having endured freezing cold and driving rain on long days on picket lines, the workers stood ready to escalate their strike action but their determination led to both employers making offers which met their demands in full. “This is a good news story for workers everywhere in Northern Ireland and shows that there is a power in our union. “It confirms yet again that when our members fight in unity for their jobs, pay and conditions they can win.”  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About gallery from Walshs \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true _.jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About gallery from Walshs  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

People are being encouraged to book their appointment from Wednesday, but limited walk-ins will also be available. “Following the current Covid- guidelines, including getting vaccinated, using Covid certication, practicing social distancing and washing our hands is the most effective way of keeping each other safe and preventing the need for further restrictions. “Nobody wants to see another lockdown, particularly so close to Christmas and we all need to pull together, get vaccinated and help each other through this dficult period.”   *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About gallery from Walshs \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true _.jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About gallery from Walshs  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

At a media briefing, he stated there were inherent internal contradictions in the bans and said, Weve seen these before where you ban flights except for your own citizens. Is it that some passport holders will have the virus and some wont  Does the virus read your passport  Does the virus know your nationality or where youre legally resident  Our concern here is that we apply public health principles, not political principles to selecting measures that are used to control the spread of disease. He made the comments in the wake of tightening border restrictions across dozens of countries in response to the Omicron iant. WHO Director-General, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, also called on countries to take rational and proportional risk-reduction measures. He said, Blanket travel bans will not prevent the international spread of Omicron and they place a heavy burden on lives and livelihoods. Dr Ryan suggested other ways to manage risk: There are ways that you can de-risk travel in terms of having increased testing, more testing before departure, more testing on arrival, quarantine until negative testing. There is a whole series of things that can be done that will manage the risk of importation of disease or even exporting disease to another country which fall short of blanket bans. The idea that you can put a hermetic seal on most countries is just frankly not possible. We all know that, weve seen that happen before. And certainly there has to be consistency. If [the bans] are being applied, they have to be consistent.  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About gallery from Walshs \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true _.jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About gallery from Walshs  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

They also provide underage hurling via St Patricks, an amalgamation with their parish neighbours St Colms Drum.When Derry won the All-Ireland title in , the countys most successful era, Richard Ferris was part of the winning formula and scored a goal in their opening round against Down that season. Joe Irwin won an Ulster medal with the county and Eunan Rafferty was also on Derry teams in that era.The clubs recent underage development work has provided Michael Mullan to Derrys Ulster minor winning team of , with Tiarnaacuten McHugh, Dara and Ruairi Rafferty part of the group who repeated the feat two seasons later on their way to the All-Ireland Final.Current senior captain Tiarnaacuten Woods has represented Derry at minor and U level, with McHugh and Ruairi Rafferty – who have played senior hurling with Kevin Lynchs – having also played the wee ball game for the county.On the camogie field, Una Rafferty and Aoe Kelly have represented Derry at minor and U level respectively. It has all comeas a result of the work being done at the club.“It is great to have Richard Ferris back involved again,” Shane adds. “He has set up a winter programme in place for the players in first to fth year , with the older players getting looked after under the senior  with their strength and conditioning.”The current senior group has benefited from the influx of youth as they have one eye on the Derry IFC Quarter-Finals later this month.McGonigle paid tribute to those who have sat on club committees down through the years and it has been bolstered with new blood coming on board in recent years to help with the clubs progression. Another great development has been an influx in new coaches coming forward at primary school level. Every bit helps. Like many other clubs across Ireland, Drumsurn reaches deeper into the locality. They are more than just GAA. Its a social hub that knits everyone together, regardless of age. It offers an identity.On top of their day to day club activities and s. Fitness classes, male and female, are a valuable facet of the club, while they also host Irish dancing and bowls.The club has also recently formed a mental health committee and have put in place a full winter program to complement this initiative. There are also plans for Irish language classes. There is never a dull moment. The clubs heart beats strong.“We as a club are very community focused,” Shane stresses. “In the past year we have brought the Action Cancer big bus for two days and also provided a defibrillator in a cabinet for our communitys use.”Since moving to their current premises, Billy Doran Park, in , they have added a training pitch and a club gym.The Club Committee set out a three-phase ground development plan in . The first phase of a new kitchen plus internal and external toilet blocks was completed in  with the changing rooms refurbished in .Phase , currently going through planning, includes a walking track, new floodlights and ball-wall. It all leads into Phase , a floodlit G pitch.“Our proposed ground developments are going to cost in excess of pound,,” McGonigle points out. “For a club of less than  members, this is a massive undertaking.”Drumsurn have set themselves a target of having phases two and three complete for their Centenary Year in .“Unfortunately, as with many other aspects of le, Covid has put a stop to conventional fundraising activities for the moment,” Shane outlines. “So we decided to set up Drumsurn GAC Competitions as a way of raising some much needed funds.” For more information and details on how to enter Drumsurns competition, visit www.drumsurngaccompetitions    *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About gallery from Walshs \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true _.jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About gallery from Walshs  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

Pic by Inpho Photography.Reporter: Daragh Ó Conchúir Dec Email: sport@derrypost  addthis, All-Ireland senior camogie semi-final Slaughtneil - googletag.cmd.push Oulart-the-Ballagh- First-half goals from Wexford legends Uacutena Leacy and Ursual Jacob and eight points from play by the Kehoe twins, Shelley and Stacey, ended Slaughtneil’s bid for a fth consecutive AIB All-Ireland senior club camogie final appearance, as  champions Oulart-The Ballagh held the former three-in-a-row victors at arm’sin the second half to prevail at Donaghmore Ashbourne by - to -. Oulart have another giant to slay in next Saturday’s decider at Nowlan Park as titleholders Sarsfields lie in wait following their - to - victory over Drom  Inch yesterday. On this evidence, they look more than capable of doing so, their wealth of experience and scoring power capable of accounting for any outfit on a going day, with apart from the aforementioned, the likes of skipper and another ex-Model County hero Mary Leacy, Ciara Storey, Anais Curran and Aideen Brennan all involved. A ruthless first-half showing with the wind laid the groundwork for the victors, as it forced their Derry opponents to discard their tried and trusted system of restriction. This meant that even as they had the elements in the second half, more gaps existed than they would normally allow and they were capitalised upon by Oulart. Given the final margin, the opening nine minutes were hugely signicant, at the end of which the red and blacks led by - to -. After Shauna Sinnott pointed almost from the throw-in, Stacey Kehoe and Jacob slotted a pair apiece before Uacutena Leacy planted just the latest in a career of major goals, making no mistake after Shelley Kehoe drew the cover with a run through the middle. Former Offaly star Tina Bradley, who gave birth to her first child earlier this year, slotted a couple of minors for Slaughtneill as they steadied the ship and added a third after winning a free from which Louise Dougan converted to leave it - to - at the first water break.

Cliodhna Niacute Mhianaacutein reduced the margin to a goal but catastrophe struck when following Shelley Kehoe’s point, Jacob’s free from m was deflected unfortunately by Dougan beyond Jolene Bradley to put seven between them once more. That margin had grown to ten by the interval and the Robert Emmets never looked like reeling it in from - to -. They tried valiantly, as you would expect however, Therese Mallon goaling in the first minute of the second half after a block by Ceacuteat McEldowney of Katie Gallagher’s attempted clearance. Orla McNeill followed quickly with a point but the Oulart riposte was notable, Uacutena Leacy, Shauna Sinnott and Shelley Kehoe firing the last three points of the third quarter to make it - to -. They only had to avoid a collapse from that juncture and with such experience in their ranks, that was never going to happen. *Full coverage in Tuesdays County Derry Post.

I am contacted about cleansing issues on a daily basis and while working with council staff a solution is found, butrobust processes and procedures were in place, this should be routinely completed and no major issues should arise.Cllr Sharvin says he is also keen to see greater attention on cleaning play parks, explaining that currently there is no formal process to do so and operates on adhoc basis.ldquoGiven the increase of use play parks during Covid and the councilrsquos objective to increase healthy living in our communities, itrsquos vitality important that we clean and maintain our play parks on a regular basis. Council officials have agreed to replace surface safety tiles at our play parks and I hope this programme will continue to be rolled out, he said.Cllr Sharvin said that following the recent workshop, council officers are to compile a report which will be discussed by councillors..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29November2021-ADMakeItLocal.jpg","title":"District’s battering from Storm Barra  ","story":"DOWN District was pummelled by Storm Barra yesterday with gale force winds and driving rain coinciding with a spring high tide to wreak havoc.Thunder and lightning was added into the heady weather mix with the storm conditions bringing down a number of trees along the coastline.

pop royalty and real-le royalty, George Lowdenrsquos guitars are known to be the best in the world.The Prince of Wales recently made known his knowledge of and fascination with Georgersquos guitars and Ed Sheeran reportedly likes to keep one handy in nearly every room of his house.With Niall Horan of One Direction and Dubliner singer songwriter Dermot Kennedy becoming the latest owners of the bespoke guitars, Georgersquos company, Lowden Guitars, has just announced its latest collaboration with Sheeran.To celebrate the release of his most recent album, Sheeran has teamed up with George, who founded the firm in , to design and create a signature guitar worthy of music royalty.The Sheeran by Lowden Equals Edition guitar will also be available to the public to purchase, with a limited edition run of , available through Lowdenrsquos global dealer network.Itrsquos the second joint project with Sheeran, following on from their range of more affordable guitars.The latest achievement comes in the wake of George recently meeting the Prince of Wales at a Windsor Castle reception to mark Lowden Guitars winning the  Queenrsquos Awards for Enterprise.He also launched a new range of limited edition guitars to mark his th birthday over the summer which features specications chosen by George.Itrsquos all a far cry from when the renowned luthier first began to hand-make guitars for his own use.He could never have known that his determination to make the best guitar would see his name travel around the world and be spoken of by royalty.ldquoTherersquos quite a lot of things that have happened that I never could have imagined. When I started out, I had no formal training in the manufacture of guitars, explained George.ldquoIn a way, that gave me the confidence to take some risks, innovate and produce an instrument that has a completely unique voicing.He found the Prince of Wales to be very interested in the guitarsrsquo manufacture and may have even suggested a new development.ldquoWe had a great chat and he asked quite a lot of questions about the wood, all kinds and how we found it, said George.ldquoHe was also very interested in dieback ash, asking aboutit would be a very good way to use the trees as a lot have perished due to this disease.ldquoIt wouldnrsquot be the best toned wood you could find but Irsquove been thinking more about that since and wondering whether we could use it for guitar necks or not so we might do a little experiment to seeit works.From creating coveted instruments for top Irish and UK guitarists in the know, Lowden Guitars have become an international sales success mdash hence the Queenrsquos Award.George explained: ldquoThe company is far bigger than I ever envisaged. In some ways itrsquos good but I never tried to expand the company and get the kind of growth we have enjoyed.

However, the Magpies led by four on referee Niall Cullenrsquos short whistle.Ramor came out after the break and pressed high, and were rewarded with three scores in the first five minutes.Kilcoo didnrsquot panic and upped the ante immediately with two Paul Devlin frees settling things. Jerome Johnston and Eugene Branagan kept the scoreboard ticking and on the th minute the brilliant Ceilum Doherty found the net after great approach play by Dylan Ward.From here to the end, Kilcoo kept playing with that high tempo and the game was put beyond the Virginia men with six minutes remaining when man of the match Jerome Johnston found the net once again.Both sides emptied their benches as the game petered out, as the Down men came away with an impressive win.Mickey Moran and his management team will take great heart from many aspects of their teamrsquos performance and will know only too well it will take this and morethey are to win against the Derry champions and reach back-to-back Ulster finals.Kilcoo assistant manager Conleith Gilligan expressed mixed emotions as the local side look ahead to the semi-final stage.ldquoThere was definitely some nice passages of play and, look, we were able to play the game at our own pace and as the competition goes on that wonrsquot be allowed to happen, he said.ldquoOnce we got our legs moving, up to the first water-break we did very well. It was just that second quarter where we were on top but we didnrsquot take enough chances that would have put the game to bed and we allowed Ramor to live in the game right up to half-time.He added: ldquoWe didnrsquot need to be the best in the country tonight, we just needed to be better than Ramor and I think we were.Kilcoo: N Kane, N Branagan, R McEvoy , A Branagan, M Rooney, Anthony Morgan , E Branagan , D Ward , Aaron Morgan, C Doherty , J Johnston , S Johnston , C Laverty, R Johnston, P Devlin .Subs used: A Branagan, T Fettes, M Hynes, C Rooney and J Clarke.Ramor United: L Brady D Bartley, B OrsquoConnell, E Somerville A OrsquoConnell, Jack Brady, M Magee, L Caffrey, E Maguire B Smith, S Cadden, C MaguireJames Brady , A Cole, S McEvoy .Subs used: G Mannion, K Maguire, P McNamee , J Bradley and L Lynch.Referee: Niall Cullen ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29November2021-ADMakeItLocal.jpg","title":"New £65m Lidl supermarket in Carryduff gets green light  ","story":"THE green light has been given for the multi-million pound regeneration of the Carryduff shopping centre which could create  new jobs.The ambitious plan designed to transform the Church Road site mdash which includes a new pound.m Lidl store mdash was approved by Lisburn and Castlereagh Councilrsquos Planning Committee on Monday.Lidl submitted its new store planning application earlier this year and hopes to open the , square metre facility, creating  new jobs and parking spaces for  vehicles, by the middle of next year.In addition to the Lidl store, an additional , square metres of floorspace is available for other retailers at the expansive centre site.The new store opening is a major part of the shopping centrersquos regeneration, which has lain derelict for more than four years, with the planning application proposing the demolition of the existing buildings and the erection of three retail units, cafe, bookmakers, drive through cafe, landscaping and associated site works.Parking provision for disabled drivers is included in the development proposal alongside dedicated spaces for parents and children. Four dedicated spaces for electrical vehicles are also included.Itrsquos understood that in addition to the  jobs in the new Lidl store, a further  will be created across the other proposed retail units, with  jobs created during construction and development.Council planners are recommending to members that the application be approved with  conditions including its full construction within a five-year period.In papers submitted ahead of Mondayrsquos planning meeting, planners said they were recommending approval as the proposed retail use is considered to comply with the local development plan.They say that when the buildings are constructed, they will not adversely impact on the character of the area or have a detrimental impact on the amenity of existing residents in properties adjoining the site.ldquoAppropriate provision is made to meet the needs of cyclists and adequate facilities are made for shower and changing facilities as required for such a major employment-generating development, the papers point out.A spokesperson for Lidl said the poundm store would reflect the retailerrsquos concept design, boasting a sales floor, a shopping environment withspacious, wide aisles, long tills, restrooms and baby-changing facilities, as well as a bakery offering and staff facilities.ldquoOur ambitious plans to complement the site with additional retail and leisure units represent an investment of more than pound million into the area and the support of more than  jobs, he said.ldquoWersquore proud to be part of the centrersquos signicant regeneration and bring a new future of growth to the locality whilst honouring the sitersquos historical connections to the community.The spokesman added: ldquoWe hope to receive planning permission for the site and look forward to opening the brand new, state-of-the-art Lidl store early next year, bringing shoppers even more choice of quality products at unbeatable value.Carryduff shopping centre was a prime retail destination for many years, but since the closure of its flagship Supervalu store in , it struggled to attract an anchor tenant that would drive its growth.The formal planning application by Lidl follows an extensive local consultation of the plans undertaken in February which was positively received by local representatives and the wider community.Lidl acquired the . acre Carryduff shopping centre site in August last year as part of the retailerrsquos plans to expand its store presence across the region to more than  stores by the end of the decade..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29November2021-ADMakeItLocal.jpg","title":"Newcastle harbour development plans  ","story":"THE redevelopment of the former generator house at Newcastle harbour has the potential to act as a catalyst to secure additional investment.Thatrsquos the assertion of Mournes councillor Willie Clarke whose comment came after Monday eveningrsquos annual meeting of the Newcastle Harbour Heritage Association.He congratulated the grouprsquos chairman Campbell Miller and the committee members on the ldquofantastic positive contribution they have made in improving the harbour over the past year.Cllr Clarke said the two main items discussed at the annual meeting included the refurbishment of the former generator house as a community hub and the provision of a new boarding pontoon that would allow disabled people to board vessels, something which he said is long overdue.The business case for the new floating pontoon recently passed through Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos Enterprise, Regeneration and Tourism Committee.Cllr Clarke explained the vision for the generator house includes the provision of showers, toilets, and changing facilities for water-based recreation, alongside a meeting room for the community and harbour users.He said the business case was submitted to the local authority and approved through the so-called community transfer process.ldquoIt is essential that this building is refurbished for the local community which will be a catalyst in the development of the harbour, suggested Cllr Clarke.ldquoIn addition, it offers an excellent opportunity for the local council and the harbour community to develop a partnership to create a community hub for the area. I will be facilitating meetings with council officials to progress this vital community asset as quickly as possible.Cllr Clarke said there was no doubt that with an ldquoambitious and focused vision for the future, the harbour area could become a unique attraction, meeting the needs of not just the local community, but also become an exciting destination for those who visit Newcastle..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29November2021-ADMakeItLocal.jpg","title":"Red High hurlers through to final  ","story":"THE first half of this Danske Bank Mageean Cup semi-final was brilliant to watchthere were any neutrals around.If you were a supporter of either St Patrickrsquos or St Louisrsquo, it was nail-biting, edge-of-the-seat drama played at a blistering pace with top class scoring at each end.That half finished - to - in favour of the Ballymena side.For the Red High management of Darren Swail, Sean Paul Gibson and Danny Toner, the entertainment factor had to be sacriced to get the result they needed.Bringing Oisin Coulter back as extra cover in defence curtailed the damage that Ballymenarsquos two Loughgiel inside forwards had done in the opening half, but it also meant that the Red Highrsquos attack would struggle to retain ball to keep the scoreboard running.Jack McCloskey had scored - in the first half and Roacutenaacuten McCollam -. McCollam fired over another point in the th minute and pointed a free at the very end while trying to it in on the Downpatrick area to poach a late goal.McCloskey didnrsquot score in the second half and being out of general play resulted in his normally reliable free-taking also taking a hit.At the other end the outnumbered Downpatrick forwards had to survive on scraps as well but they could always rely on their free-takers.Goalkeeper Pearse Smyth landed two points from inside his own half, while Tom McGrattan converted three frees and landed a point from play as well.McGrattan was the star of the game and he capped a brilliant inidual performance with two late plays that effectively took his team into the final.With the game in the balance at - each in the rd minute, McGrattan jinked his way along the sideline under the stand to win himself a free.It was an acute angle, but the Portaferry clubman arrowed the sliotar between the uprights.Then less than a minute later he played a beautul cross-field pass into the path of mid-fielder Finn Turpin, who stepped inside the defender and hit the roof of the net from  metres out.St Patrickrsquos were through to their first ever Danske Bank Mageean Cup final where they will play St Patrickrsquos Maghera at the Dub Arena on Friday week, December .But back again to that breath-taking first half.After five minutes, the teams had each scored three points. By the tenth minute, Jack McCloskey had cut through the Red High cover and shot to the net off the base of the right hand post.Within three minutes Downpatrick were a point up. McGrattan went around the left side of the Ballymena defence at full pace to rle to the roof of the net for one of the best goals that you will see at any level.Aodhan McGarry responded by pointing from a side-line and the water-break broke the action at - each.McGarry started the second quarter scoring with a fine point but a run of three successive scores from Finn Turpin, McGrattan and Oisin Coulter edged the Red High ahead again.However, three frees from Jack McCloskey and a point from Ronan McCollam put Ballymena in the lead by - to - at half-time.By the second water break Downpatrick were - to - ahead, mainly through frees and St Louisrsquo were now looking for scores from distance.The next  minutes went scoreless. In hindsight Ballymena snatched at a couple of scoring chances that might have put pressure on the eventual winners who pumped a lot of ball in high on the north Antrim defence with no .Eventually sub Tom McFerran brought the teams level and McCollam from the left wing gave St Louisrsquo the lead. The gauntlet had been thrown down for the Red High.Oisin Coulter landed a much-needed Downpatrick point in reply and they held firm until Tom McGrattan delivered the match-winning scores.It is scant consolation for Ballymena that they played their part in a fine display of schoolsrsquo hurling, but a number of players stood out including Daire McMullan, Connor Dickson and Dara Martin in defence and McCollam and McCloskey in attack until tempered by Downpatrickrsquos packed back line.Defence was ultimately the winning of the game, but they would not have got across the line without Turpin, Oisin Coulter and especially the mercurial Tom McGrattan.As a hurling disciple of the great Bro Charles in the s, I was a proud man leaving the Dub on Friday evening.For the generations of hurlers who climbed to the top of the hill on Saul Street each morning over the past  or  years, winning a Mageean was just not on the radar.This team is only  minutes from achieving what for us was the impossible.St Patrickrsquos: P Smyth - frees, J Ruddy, R OrsquoNeill, D Coulter, S Mageean, D Mallon, C Lenaghan, T Connolly -, F Turpin -, M Dorrian -, A Connolly, T McGrattan - , O Coulter -, R McGrath, S McCarthy.Subs: F MacManus for A Connolly , LMcCabe for S McCarthy , F Casey for R McGrath ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29November2021-ADMakeItLocal.jpg","title":"Road officials set to carry out survey at Ballynahinch school  ","story":"PLANS by roads officials to carry out a survey on the main road outside Ballynahinch Primary School have been welcomed by Strangford MLA Peter Weir.The work will be carried out to assess the potential for a new pedestrian crossing and while pleased that the survey is to take place, Mr Weir is disappointed that there are no current plans to also introduce a temporary mph speed limit at the Dromore Road as part of a province-wide Department for Infrastructure initiative.Mr Weir mdash who has met with school principal Mr Michael Moore mdash said the safety of children who have to cross the busy road was of paramount importance and a real issue of concern for parents and residents.The former Education Minister said he was ldquodisappointed that the school had not been included in the Roads Departmentrsquos part-time mph speed limit scheme.ldquoI believe that the Department needs to give a clear commitment that Ballynahinch Primary School will be included in the next roll-out of the scheme, said Mr Weir.ldquoThe Dromore Road is busy and is also a bus route.

Jimmyrsquos  is scheduled to take place on Sunday, March , and it is anticipated that interest will be high especially given that the Seeley Cup sold out well in advance.The Joe Seeley offers a flat and fast course starting on the Ormeau Embankment in Belfast with two and a bit laps through the Ormeau Park.For those watching or racing it was a sharp cold day, but miraculously the heavy rain and high winds that preceded the .pm start died down just in time to let the runners have a fair crack at a good performance.At the pointy end there were small clusters of runners who made a break early on in the first lap and then a lead group of five formed as they headed out for the second lap. The huddle of five then broke apart in the last K as they hurtled towards the finish line in break neck speed.Overall winner Owen Everardonly edged for glory in the last two strides as right to the mat it was not clear who would breach the tape first.His time of . was two seconds ahead of Matthew Neill , who was one second ahead of third-placed Eskander Turki . The top  competitors were all sub  minutes for K, which is fast by any means.East Down ACrsquos Neil McCartan, who prefers shorter distances and would choose track over road running, finished in a commendable .. This is not a personal best time, but given that this is his first serious attempt at a K in three years he will be more than satisfied.

Many runners set sub  minutes for K as a good base goal, but he smashed that and some.He was even more delighted to discover that he was the quickest junior athlete on the day by well over a minute. As mentioned this race stood as the NI  Ulster Championship, so he gains that title as well as a Seeley Cup age group win.A great achievement.It was actually a hat trick as he also snatched bragging rights in the Murray family as his dad Dee and mum Janine were also racing on the day.Dee was next home for EDAC in a very respectable ..

Good work by all three.Cross-countryThe Robinson brothers, Oliver and Alex, ended off their  cross-country season with a trip to the Uneven Age Group All Irelands Cross Country in Gowran, Kilkenny, on Sunday.The sun shone all day but the temperature stayed low with the ground remaining icy in parts. Alex had gained his Ulster U- team place by coming sixth at the Ulster  NI race in Donegal a few weeks previously, so he had set his expectations high.His race was ,m around a very twisty course through long grass, all of which made it more technical than previous races.The start of any cross-country race is hectic with lots of jostling and this was no exception.Alex was pulled back when the gun went off and then had to contend with some fallers so he never really got into his stride.He was disappointed to place th out of a field of  runners, but deserves huge credit for his commitment over the last few months.Alexrsquos older brother, Oliver, was running for the Down team in the U- race.

In my opinion, such an appointment is crucial and could benefit the town and the business community a great deal.ldquoThe night time economy is one area that needs to be improved not only in Downpatrick but where, but rapid progress this in the current Covid climate may not be possible.ldquoHowever, there is no reason why ideas to regenerate our night time economy cannot be discussed now to lay plans for the future, he continued.Cllr Curran said every high street is dferent, with many people keen to see them become vibrant shopping hubs at the heart of local communities, explaining that the work of the Stormont task force could not be more timely.He added: ldquoAnything that can be done to increase footfall in our town centres in the future will be more than welcome.The call for evidence document is available at https:www.executiveoffice-ni.gov.uk consultations call-evidence-high-street-task-force, while responses to the call for evidence can be made to highstreet@communities-ni.gov.uk..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/13285466.jpg","title":"news","story":"As a subscriber, you are shown % lessThose ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local servicesThese adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Clockwise from top left, David Lloyd George Austen Chamberlain, F.E.Smith, , Winston Churchill, Robert Barton, Michael Collins, Arthur GrfithLock it up carefully”, David Lloyd George said to his mistress and secretary, Frances Stevenson, in her room at  Downing Street, as he handed her the British copy of the historic Anglo-Irish Treaty just before  am on  December .Under its terms the Union of Great Britain and Ireland, as created by Pitt the Younger  years earlier, came to an end. Only the six counties of the newly formed Northern Ireland were to be permitted to remain within the United Kingdom. Their devolved Parliament, which had been opened by King George V the previous June , was given the power to vote them out of the all-Ireland settlement, based on dominion status, which the Treaty embodied.   \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.The document that was locked away in Downing Street bore the signatures of four members of the British delegation who had negotiated it. They formed a column headed by Lloyd George himself the others, drawn from his Liberal  Unionist coalition cabinet, were Austen Chamberlain, F.E.Smith, Lord Birkenhead , and Winston Churchill.Another column listed the signatures of three of their Irish counterparts, headed by Arthur Grfith, the founder of Sinn Fein in , and followed by the charismatic Michael Collins, the chief organiser of the IRA’s terrorist campaign against Britain, waged from  until July  when a truce was agreed between the two sides. The third Irish signatory, Robert Barton, a Unionist landowner turned Republican and an intimate friend of Collins, was the Sinn Fein delegation’s economic adviser. Never before had British and Irish representatives put their names to a formal agreement of this kind as complete equals. After the signing, which took place at . am, the two sides shook hands for the first time. Trust had replaced the deep suspicion with which they had first regarded each other. Irish leaders, who a few months earlier had been denounced as rebels and murderers, had come to enjoy the respect of the British delegation. Michael Collins had undergone an astonishing transformation from terrorist leader to statesman, gaining the admiration of two prominent members of the British team, Churchill and Birkenhead.Final agreement on the terms of the treaty had been reached in two intense negotiating sessions in the Cabinet Room at No , which ended two months of wrangling. The first session, which lasted over five hours, began at pm on December . Lloyd George employed all his formidable political skills to secure a breakthrough in all but one of the key areas that had hitherto defied resolution.The Irish gained the full fiscal and financial autonomy they craved. The British got what they wanted on defence: the use “in time of war or of strained relations with a foreign power [of] such harbour and other facilities as the British government may require”, combined with the permanent retention of what came to be known as the Treaty Ports , major strategic assets which Neville Chamberlainwas to abandon in a further Anglo-Irish Treaty in  to Churchill’s fury. Since the start of negotiations in October, the words of an oath of allegiance which Irish elected representatives would in future be required to swear had been through endless drafts. It was at last settled with a suitably convoluted rigmarole to spare the Irish republican conscience as much strain as possible: “I will be faithful to His Majesty King George V, his Heirs and Successors by law, in virtue of the common citizenship of Ireland and Great Britain, and her adherence to and membership of the group of nations forming the British Commonwealth of Nations.” This was the first time on which the customary reference to Empire was dropped from an official document.There remained just one make-or-break issue: Northern Ireland, with its devolved powers over local matters entrusted to it by Westminster earlier in . Sinn Fein were determined to get it into their independent state. Lloyd George was happy to give them all the help he could. In November, he had piled pressure on Sir James Craig, the Northern Ireland prime minister. In letters and conversations he tried, with all his accustomed craftiness, to get Craig to accept that he had a patriotic duty to remove the last barrier to peace in Ireland by joining a sovereign all-Ireland Parliament in place of Westminster, while retaining all the devolved powers that Westminster had provided.The Unionist members of the British delegation did not demur. Not for the last time, Ulster Unionists found that they could not rely on their English Unionist allies in high places . Austen Chamberlain said that separate arrangements for six of the nine Ulster counties were “illogical and indefensible”. He thought “the greatest moral pressure” should be put on Northern Ireland to bring it into a settlement that was “vital to the Empire”. His party chairman, Sir George Younger , believed “Ulster should take some risks and forget some of the past arguments against unity in Ireland”.These Unionist calls for compromisewere made against the background of a sustained press campaign, led by The Times, criticising Ulster Unionists for their intransigence. “Ulster blocks the way to peace” was the newspapers’ regular refrain. Craig described it as “ a press campaign against Ulster without parallel in the history of Great Britain.”But the Northern Ireland premier was unmoved. He told Lloyd George that a single parliament for Ireland was “precisely what Ulster has for many years resisted by all the means at her disposal”.Lloyd George tried another tack in November, concentrating his cunning this time on the leader of the Irish delegation, Arthur Grfith. Here he had much greater success than in his attempts to manoeuvre Craig into an all-Ireland parliament. At a private meeting with Grfith on November , he got the leader of the Irish delegation to give a personal written pledge that,Northern Ireland refused to accept an all-Ireland settlement, it would remain under the British Parliament, “but in this case, it would be necessary to revise the boundary of Northern Ireland. This might be done by a Boundary Commission ... to make the boundary conform as closely as possible to the wishes of the people.” What went unrecorded in the paper was the clear impression given by Lloyd George that Northern Ireland would lose so much territory that it could not survive as a separate entity and a united independent Ireland would as a result come into existence.During the course of the long afternoon session in Downing Street on December , Lloyd George reminded Grfith of what they had agreed.Proof was needed. A frantic search was made of the prime minister’s wardrobe, and “eventually an insignicant pocket cast up an envelope and a piece of paper.” On the strength of this written undertaking to establish a Boundary Commission whichwould undermine Northern Ireland, the leader of the Irish delegation agreed to sign the Treaty himself, but said that he could not commit his colleagues.At this, Lloyd George assumed a magnicently melodramatic air. He had told Craig in Belfast to expect news of the outcome of the discussions in Downing Street the following day. That could of course have been done by telephone, but Lloyd George now conjured up an elaborate plan to send the news in writing to Belfast in an attempt to force a decision out of the other two Irish delegates.“Here are the alternative letters which I have prepared, one enclosing Articles of Agreement reached by His Majesty’s Government and yourselves, and the other saying that the Sinn Fein representatives refuse to come within the Empire. If I send this letter it is war, and war within three days. Which letter am I to send  Whichever letter you choose travels by special train to Holyhead, and by destroyer to Belfast. The train is waiting with steam up at Euston ... to reach Sir James in time we must know your answer by ten p.m tonight. You can have until then, but no longer, to decide whether you will give peace or war to your country.”With these impassioned words ringing in their ears, the Irish delegates ed to their Knightsbridge hotel for anguished discussions amongst themselves, but promised to be back in Downing Street by the pm deadline. In fact, it was nearly .pm when they ed.Nothing more was heard about the special train waiting at Euston. Grfith announced calmly, “Prime Minister, the Delegation is willing to sign the agreements, but there are a few points of drafting which perhaps it would be convenientI mentioned at once.” The most important concerned the Boundary Commission redrafting increasedthe likelihood that Northern Ireland would collapse. At Iam on December , an agreed text was handed to the Downing Street typists.In England, reaction to the treaty was ecstatic. The Times led the way: “These are fitting peace terms to mark the close of an age of discontent and distrust, and the beginning of a new era of happiness and mutual understanding.” In Ireland, discontent intensied and took a new form: the long quarrel with Britain was replaced by distrust and ision within Sinn Fein, which led to a bitter civil war the following year. In Northern Ireland, IRA terrorism increased, generating sectarian stre in  parts of Belfast came to resemble the battlefields of the First World War. The Boundary Commission recommended only minor changes, and its report was shelved. Englishmen looked away. “The country”, said Austen Chamberlain, “wants peace and is tired of Ireland and Ulster.” English politicians hoped they would never have to think seriously about Irish affairs again. For nearly  years they had their wish — which meant that that they were fatally handicapped by ignorance when the Ulster crisis of  erupted.l BIBLIOGRAPHY—D.G.Boyce, Englishmen and Irish Troubles: British Public Opinion and the Making of Irish Policy -and “ How to Settle the Irish Question: Lloyd George and Ireland -” in A.J.P.

They say that the beach is a sand and shingle beach and has a reputation for being one of the cleanest in the region. There is a coastal walk, chance to go fishing, surfing and views of Tusker Rock.For those owners who may not yet have ventured to the beach with their pups or are concerned about behaviour while at the beach, Wood Green’s dog behaviour and training specialist, Wendy Kruger, has provided some tips to prepare your dog for the beach.• Ensure your dog’s microchip and collar tag details are up to date – just in case.• Get used to checking ground surface temperatures before you take your dog out, as dry sand can be too hot for dogs’ paws on sunny days. To check the ground temperature, place the back of your hand on the ground. If its too hot to hold comfortably for five seconds, it’s too hot for dogs’ paws..remove• Practise basic, reward-based training when out and about to help your dog to maintain focus and engagement on walks.• Recall is also an area that needs particular attention. Evenyour dog has a great recall at home, its not something that can be guaranteed in unfamiliar environments with exciting new distractions. Games with toys are a fantastic way to help your dog engage with you when there are other distractions around. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityPollsters Yougov surveyed a sample of people from Wales and the rest of Britain, asking them whether they would support or oppose banning people who have not been vaccinated against coronavirus from visiting public places.Such places would include events and non-essential shops, Yougov suggested.The poll comes as some countries attempt to ramp up vaccination rates by either threatening new restrictions or making jabs mandatory.Political leaders in the UK have downplayed the prospects of such restrictions being introduced, but other European nations have already begun taking steps to curb freedoms for unvaccinated citizens.The Yougov poll found that in the Wales and Midlands area, nearly two-thirds of peoplesaid they would either strongly support, or tend to support, banning unvaccinated people from non-essential public places.Just one in four peoplesaid they would oppose such restrictions on the unvaccinated.The regional results largely match the total response from Wales, England and Scotland, which showed  per cent would support a ban and  per cent would oppose it.MORE ON CORONAVIRUS:Yougov uses sampling data to measure public attitudes to current events and issues. In this case, some , people across Britain, including  in the Wales and Midlands region, responded to the survey. While the sample cannot give a  per cent accurate record of public opinion, it does provide a helpful indicator of which way the wind is blowing when it comes to any future Covid policies on vaccinations and restrictions.A few days ago, Germany announced it would be reimposing some restrictions across the nation, as well as bringing in tough new measures aimed specically at unvaccinated people..removeMany leisure and entertainment venues will only be accessible for people who have either been vaccinated or who have recently recovered from Covid, and the German parliament will also consider a general vaccine mandate which,passed, could come into force as soon as February next year.The nation follows neighbouring Austria, which last month brought in lockdown-style rules for people who have not been vaccinated. Around  per cent of people in Austria have been fully vaccinated – one of the lowest rates in western Europe.By comparison, some  per cent of people in the UK have been given both jabs, and booster vaccines have already been administered to . per cent of those people who are currently eligible.Asked on Fridayvaccines could ever be made mandatory for the general public in the UK, a spokesman for Downing Street told reporters: \"We’ve set out our policy on this and we’ve said it’s not something that we would look to introduce.\"And earlier this week, Wales health minister Eluned Morgan said such rules were \"not something the Welsh Government has considered\".While health is devolved in Wales, policies regarding vaccines have remained largely the same across the four UK nations, led by common advice from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation .However, England has taken the additional step of making vaccines mandatory for health and social care workers – a measure which hasnt been introduced here in Wales. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communitySpeaking on BBC Radio Wales this morning, Dr Frank Atherton said: “It is the worst time of year to be considering this, but I think we just have to look at population mixing.“It is almost inevitable that we may have to consider what measures to reduce population mixing are needed at this point in time but that is for ministers to discuss and I will be providing advice on that.”Dr Atherton spoke after he and the other three chief medical officers in the UK agreed to raise the UK Covid alert level yesterday to level four. This does not change the current restrictions in place in Wales, which currently remains at alert level zero.Dr Atherton also said that the initial peak of the omicron iant was predicted to be around January or February - but rates are rising quicker than expected.“When I first heard about omicron, I thought it would be a problem in January and February. With these transmission rates we are far more likely to see a problem running into the Christmas period and then into early January. So that is why we felt the need to raise the alert level,” he said.He also highlighted things that people in Wales can do to help minimise the spread.He said: “It is unpalatable at this time of year to say this, but we need to think about contacts we are having because we know that this virus loves to transmit from person to person and we cannot afford to have large gatherings at this time of year because it will bring community transmission that we are fearful of.”He also highlighted the importance of the boosters and having the booster when people are called for. “We are seeing quite signicant numbers of people have been contacting the NHS to say they have got an appointment for their booster but are going to delay it and asking for another appointment,” he said..removeMORE NEWS:“That implies people aren’t prioritising it and that is natural when it is Christmas time and people are thinking about other things.\"What we are now saying is you cannot think about anything more important than getting your booster because we know that the vaccine effectiveness is reduced a bit but the protection with booster shots against serious harm is still about  per cent and so the best thing, we can do for ourselves, and our loved ones is to get your booster shots when you are eligible.”Dr Atherton explained that, although the Welsh Government had set a target of offering everyone in Wales aged  and over a booster jab by the end of January, they are working through to bring this forward. He said how there has been work over the weekend to increase this rollout and this could include walk-in clinics, extra vaccination clinics and more volunteers to allow for more vaccines to be administered quicker.He also advised that the rollout will prioritise the elderly and vulnerable first and that everyone over  should have received their invitation for a booster shot. Those who have not should contact their health board. Everyone  over the age of  should wait until they are contacted.He also confirmed that those who are housebound will be able to receive their boosters and that GPs have been given more money to prioritise these. Anyone over  who has not received and invite should contact the relevant health board.Dr Atherton said that, although there are only  cases of the omicron iant in Wales, he expects community transmission is on the rise as seen across the UK and in other nations. It was confirmed this morning by health minister Eluned Morgan that one person in Wales was in hospital with the omicron iant.Dr Atherton said: “It is inevitable as community transmission rises, two weeks later there will be a rise in people needing hospital treatment and needing oxygen and ITU treatment. And two weeks later sadly, a rise in deaths.”He added that decisions around introducing more restrictions were up to the ministers. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityAndrew RT Davies, Senedd Member for South Wales Central, is supporting the campaign to save Bute Cottage Nursery School.The Vale of Glamorgan Council plans to merge the nursery with Evenlode Primary School – which leads campaigners to believe that the site, which has extensive outdoor areas with many teaching and learning provisions including a chicken coop, summer house, sand pit, pirate ship and another outdoor house, could close for good.Campaigners – more than , have signed a petition against the merger – also feel that the nursery will lose its name, identity and independent governance. Currently with the independent governance, children lead their own learning with support from their experienced nursery teachers.The plans would change the lowest age of pupils at Evenlode from four years old to three, and would add  part-time nursery places to the primary school. Bute Cottage would be discontinued, and staff and pupils would transfer to the primary school by September next year.Laura Windeatt, who launched the petition, said: “This proposal is the start of a slippery slope, starting with Bute Cottage losing its name and identity and ending with its closure and the loss of an environment we should all be determined to preserve.“The loss of Bute Cottage would be signicant to the Vale’s community and felt deeply by the generations of ‘Buties’ across the years, not to mention the future generations who would miss out on such an enriching and inspiring start to their education.“On paper, a single site may at first glance seem practical, especially at such a good, reputable school as Evenlode, but those who know Bute Cottage know that losing it would be a travesty. Bute Cottage is a gem in the heart of the Vale of Glamorgan — one that we should vehemently protect.”MORE NEWS:Mr Davies said: “I do not want to see the merging of Bute Cottage and Evenlode but,that were to happen, it would be even more devastating to see the Bute Lane site close.“It’s important that the Vale Council puts this issue to bed and categorically rules out closing the Bute Lane site of the Bute Cottage Nursery. The facilities at Bute Lane are superb, and perfectly facilitate the pupil-led learning that is implemented at Bute Cottage.“The staff and governors at Bute Cottage have developed a unique identity and learning experience for their pupils.“Their pupil-led learning philosophy is something that should be protected and not lost in a merger with another school with dferent values.The Vale of Glamorgan Council is currently working on going through the consultation responses ready for the full cabinet to make a decision.https:www.change.org p vale-of-glamorgan-council-save-bute-cottage-nursery-schoolGet involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThe Western Gateway is billed as a counterpoint to the Northern Powerhouse, attracting major government funding for huge region-wide infrastructure schemes.Including Cardf, Swansea, Newport, Bristol, Bath and Swindon, the Western Gateway group has now set out its priorities for next year.These include tidal energy—which could mean a barrage built across the Severn estuary—as well as enhancing the Great Western mainline railway, and boosting the regional economy.Cardf council leader Huw Thomas sits on the board of the Western Gateway and is its political lead on tidal energy. He said tidal energy in the Severn estuary could provide as much as seven per cent of the total energy needed across the UK.He said: “The UK government has so far refused to support a scheme due to a perceived requirement for high levels of public investment and concerns over the environmental impact on designated areas in the Severn estuary.“However, the changing landscape of the climate emergency, energy insecurity, rising costs, and rapid technological improvements indicate that many of these policy, cost and environmental barriers may no longer be as signicant. We want to find out what could be done to harness this incredible energy resource.”In October the group revealed it was setting up a new commission to explore building a barrage across the estuary, as well as exploring other options for tidal energy. A barrage had previously been looked at in depth about a decade ago but ultimately dropped as it was seen as too expensive and harmful to the environment.Regional groups such as the Western Gateway, and the more established Northern Powerhouse, are considered key in attracting huge levels of investment needed for major infrastructure projects, like improving the railways, as well as foreign direct investment..removeSpending per person on infrastructure construction is about  per cent higher in the Northern Powerhouse than across the Western Gateway region, Cllr Thomas said, without including the benefits from HS.He added: “HS represents a signicant improvement in connectivity across other parts of the country, putting the Western Gateway at risk of becoming worse off. South Wales and the west of England have not enjoyed the levels of rail enhancement investment experienced where in the UK over the past  years.“This underinvestment has led to relatively less attractive services, attracting fewer passengers, and leading to higher subsidies compared to the rest of the UK.“HS will put Cardf and south Wales at a signicant disadvantage.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThe Western Gateway is billed as a counterpoint to the Northern Powerhouse, attracting major government funding for huge region-wide infrastructure schemes.Including Cardf, Swansea, Newport, Bristol, Bath and Swindon, the Western Gateway group has now set out its priorities for next year.These include tidal energy—which could mean a barrage built across the Severn estuary—as well as enhancing the Great Western mainline railway, and boosting the regional economy.Cardf council leader Huw Thomas sits on the board of the Western Gateway and is its political lead on tidal energy. He said tidal energy in the Severn estuary could provide as much as seven per cent of the total energy needed across the UK.He said: “The UK government has so far refused to support a scheme due to a perceived requirement for high levels of public investment and concerns over the environmental impact on designated areas in the Severn estuary.“However, the changing landscape of the climate emergency, energy insecurity, rising costs, and rapid technological improvements indicate that many of these policy, cost and environmental barriers may no longer be as signicant. We want to find out what could be done to harness this incredible energy resource.”In October the group revealed it was setting up a new commission to explore building a barrage across the estuary, as well as exploring other options for tidal energy. A barrage had previously been looked at in depth about a decade ago but ultimately dropped as it was seen as too expensive and harmful to the environment.Regional groups such as the Western Gateway, and the more established Northern Powerhouse, are considered key in attracting huge levels of investment needed for major infrastructure projects, like improving the railways, as well as foreign direct investment..removeSpending per person on infrastructure construction is about  per cent higher in the Northern Powerhouse than across the Western Gateway region, Cllr Thomas said, without including the benefits from HS.He added: “HS represents a signicant improvement in connectivity across other parts of the country, putting the Western Gateway at risk of becoming worse off. South Wales and the west of England have not enjoyed the levels of rail enhancement investment experienced where in the UK over the past  years.“This underinvestment has led to relatively less attractive services, attracting fewer passengers, and leading to higher subsidies compared to the rest of the UK.“HS will put Cardf and south Wales at a signicant disadvantage. While the UK economy is predicted to receive a £ billion benefit from HS, south Wales’s GDP will lose an estimated £ million per year. There are similar negative impacts for the southwest of England, with Bristol losing £ million per year, and Gloucester, Bath and northeast Somerset another £ million annually.”To counter this, the Western Gateway is seeking investment for a range of railway upgrades.

It was a new record for the competition, eclipsing the previous fastest mark of  games by Jurgen Klopp’s Liverpool.️⃣️⃣️⃣ @premierleague goals under @PepTeam 💫🔵 - ⚪️ #ManCity pic iQlkxJBog— Manchester CityDecember , More importantly for Guardiola, it was a seventh successive victory that extended City’s lead at the top of the table to four points, applying pressure to rivals Liverpool and Cha ahead of their games on Thursday.City were as ruthless as the scoreline suggests, completely overpowering Leeds in all departments.Guardiola had warned that Leeds’ high-tempo style would need to be countered and City did this by tearing into the visitors from the outset.With Rodri producing one of his best performances in a City shirt, a rampaging display reminiscent of Yaya Toure, the hosts attacked at will and with great fluidity.The tone was set as Grealish powered through the defence to test Illan Meslier in the opening minutes and, from then to the end, City were absolutely relentless.Guardiola had also predicted the game would be far dferent from Saturday’s hard-earned - win over a defensive-minded Wolves and so it proved as City racked up the chances with remarkable frequency. vw,vw,px, px\"Phil Foden, left, opens the scoring Leeds had a let-off as the in-form Bernardo Silva put a gilt-edged chance wide but the reprieve was short-lived as Foden opened the scoring on eight minutes..removeRodri powered into the box after combining with Foden but Meslier managed to block. The ball rebounded as far as Foden and the England midfielder expertly guided it into the net.That strike brought up City’s impressive landmark under Guardiola but they were in no mood for stopping there.Another followed just five minutes later after a De Bruyne shot was deflected for a corner. Leeds half-cleared the Belgian’s cross from the set-piece but Mahrez sent a curling ball back into the box and Grealish headed past Meslier.Out of nothing, Leeds had a penalty appeal for handball against Oleksandr Zinchenko checked by VAR but nothing was given and normal service soon resumed. vw,vw,px, px\"Pep Guardiola liked what he saw against Leeds De Bruyne, back to his best after a recent spell out with Covid-, had an effort saved by Meslier but then made no mistake as he raced onto a Rodri ball to thump in the third on  minutes.He fizzed another shot over soon after and Foden also shot narrowly wide.City’s fourth came four minutes into the second half when Mahrez’s shot was deflected in off Junior Firpo.Leeds threatened briefly and Stuart Dallas hit the post but substitute Ilkay Gundogan was inches away from adding another for City as he volleyed wide and Foden was denied by an offside flag.The fth came soon after in emphatic fashion from De Bruyne as the midfielder unleashed a ferocious drive from outside the box that flew into the roof of the net.𝗥𝗢𝗖𝗞𝗘𝗧𝗠𝗔𝗡 🚀#MCILEE | @ManCity pic VevAzGCAA— Premier LeagueDecember , Stones made it - following a corner, tucking home at the second attempt after Meslier had saved a Laporte header and Stones’ initial effort on the rebound.Substitute Ake wrapped up the scoring with a powerful header from a corner  minutes from time..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: Manchester City hammer Leeds - to pass  goals under Pep Guardiola article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

It is good for us to have a player like that because he is a talented young player and on the other side, he made the right decision coming to us because we are delivering everything that he was hoping.“Now what is important is to maintain those performances he is having to allow him to go to a dferent level.”A brace in Sunday’s - win over Everton made Gallagher the outright top goalscorer at Palace this term and he will aim to build on that against Southampton at Selhurst Park on Wednesday.This is his joint-best scoring season after he found the net on six occasions during the - campaign while on loan in the Sky Bet Championship with Charlton and Swansea, and boss Vieira compared him to a Cha great during Tuesday’s press conference.“Conor has this passion for the game when he is on the field like a Ray Parlour, but I would say he has maybe the quality finishing of a Frank Lampard,” the Eagles manager added.“It is a manager’s dream to have a player like Conor because when he is on the field, he will give everything..remove“He is focused, concentrated and will always give his best. This is something that for me is really important.”Before his weekend double, Gallagher had gone four games without a goal, which coincided with partner-in-chief James McArthur suffering a hamstring injury.Since McArthur’s absence, Vieira has tried numerous dferent combinations in midfield and Will Hughes got the nod to good effect on Sunday.In Hughes’ first start in seven months, the ex-Watford player impressed at the base of the Eagles’ midfield trio.Vieira said: “I think there is more to come from Will. The more he will play, the better he will be. This is a position where there is competitiveness and this is what is good.“The competitiveness we have in midfield should bring out the best in each one of them, so that will be good for the team.“I was and I am really pleased with the game Will played and now what is important for him is to maintain that performance and be even better.”.push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: Conor Gallagher needs to be playing regular football  u Patrick Vieira article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThe PM will be hoping the dissatisfaction among his MPs – which saw nearly  backbenchers defy the party whip to vote against the Government on Tuesday – is not felt more widely, as the Conservatives battle to keep the seat of North Shropshire in a key by-election on Thursday.It comes after nearly a third of his MPs voted against the introduction of mandatory Covid passes in nightclubs and large venues, with many saying they were unhappy about the way Mr Johnson was leading the country and his party.Sir Geoffrey Clton-Brown, treasurer of the  Committee, said that a leadership challenge has “got to be on the cards” for Mr Johnson in the new yearhe did not change the way he worked with his MPs.While former Tory chief whip and leading rebel Mark Harper said: “You either listen and you respond and you do things dferently or you ignore what you have been told and you plough on regardless and then this will happen over and over again.”Some  MPs voted against regulations to make Covid passes – also known as vaccine passports – mandatory in some venues, with fines for establishments that refused or those who faked the documentation.This included  Conservatives, according to the ision list, but Tory MP Steve Baker said he believed there were two more votes against – which had not been reported in the list – bringing the total to  Conservative rebels, plus two tellers for the noes.In recent months, ision lists have been updated to include names not initially published. vw,vw,px, px\"Labour Party leader Sir Keir Starmer speaks to the media The measures still passed, as Labour had supported the Government in the vote.But Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said: “The Prime Minister needs to take a long, hard look at himself and ask himself whether he has the authority to take this country through the pandemic. This is a very signicant blow for him.”.removeOther measures under the Government’s Plan B also cleared the Commons, including to drop the requirement to isolate and instead do daily Covid tests for those fully vaccinated people who are contacts of a positive Covid case.MPs also approved mandatory vaccinations for NHS and social care staff by April  and the requirement to wear face coverings to more indoor spaces in England – including museums and galleries.Some  Conservatives also voted against the mandatory vaccination plans.The size of the rebellion against the Covid passes came as a surprise after the PM had personally intervened to try and talk around rebels earlier in the evening by delivering a speech at the  Committee of backbench MPs.Sir Charles Walker, the vice-chairman of the committee, said the rebellion was a “cry of pain” by the party.He told BBC News: “This was just a bridge too far. I think they were putting a marker down. It was a cry of pain from the Conservative Party.“Heis in a very, very, very dficult position. There has been a strong view in within the Conservative Party that vaccine passports do not work and is not something many colleagues wanted to see introduced.“This is a very, very specic line being drawn in the sand now and I think the Prime Minister and his team need to listen.”The message from MPs comes as many are still angry over the revelations of alleged parties and gatherings held in Downing Street and where during lockdown restrictions, as well as longer held resentment about the Government’s handling of the standards row involving former MP Owen Paterson which led to Thursday’s by-election.On Tuesday night, a photograph emerged in the Daily Mirror of a previously reported party held by Tory mayoral candidate Shaun Bailey’s campaign team on December  last year.Mr Bailey quit the London Assembly’s Police and Crime Committee ahead of the publication of the photograph.While the Mirror also reported No  staff who stayed in Downing Street to take part in a Christmas quiz on December  were told to “go out the back” after the event.Cabinet Secretary Simon Case has been asked to investigate, and could report back as early as this week. vw,vw,px, px\"Cabinet Secretary Simon Case A Government spokesperson said: “Given there is an ongoing review, it would be inappropriate to comment while that is ongoing.”But the Liberal Democrats, who say they are now “neck and neck” with the Tories in the North Shropshire poll, said the ious scandals would hit the party – which previously enjoyed a nearly , majority in the seat – at the ballot box.Liberal Democrat health spokesperson Daisy Cooper said: “From No  to Tory HQ, the slew of rule-breaking revelations show that Boris Johnson has set a very low bar for standards within his party and his presence in Downing Street is eroding public trust.“This Thursday, voters in North Shropshire have the chance to tell him the party is over.”.push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: PM us leadership questioned as key North Shropshire by-election looms article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

Feeding, grooming, behavioural training, healthcare requirements, and an abundance of love and care are all signicant considerations before getting a pet.USPCA Chief Executive Brendan MullanUSPCA Chief Executive, Brendan Mullan, said, “For the USPCA this is unfortunately something we come up against each year, as there is a seasonal demand for young animals such as puppies or kittens. Under no circumstances should a pet be taken in on a whim or as a surprise – these decisions, rooted in impulse, are unfortunately the actions that can cause animals to sufferthey do not receive the care they need.“We encourage the public not to get a pet in haste ahead of Christmas and instead give careful consideration to what responsible pet ownership involves andthey can fulfil their pet’s needs. Pets have such a wonderful impact on our lives through love and companionship, so it’s only right that we ensure we can reciprocate that, giving them a happy and healthy le.“If, after much research, you decide a pet is the right choice for you, the USPCA is urging the public to be vigilant against illegal breeders. Unfortunately, there will be iniduals ready to take advantage of people wishing to get a pup. Illegal breeders are motivated by one thing and one thing only – greed – they have no concerns for the welfare of your potential pup.“The conditions in which these pups are raised are appalling, from overbred bitches, used and abused for profit, to the cramped and disease-ridden enclosures. No matter the temptation, please do not engage with these iniduals. The message is out there, but we now need the public to take heed – we all have a vital role to play in helping end this horric practice, otherwise it will remain a vicious cycle of cruelty and suffering.”Very often legitimate breeders will closely assess your suitability to the puppy’s requirements. The USPCA has also highlighted how illegal breeders are taking advantage of the Covid- pandemic to avoid thorough checks of pups and the environment they were reared in. To protect yourself from the callous actions of such iniduals, consider the following: Rehome a pet from the USPCA or local animal rescue instead Always see a puppy with its mother and litter Don’t buy a pet from a car boot, the back of a van or a market stall Never agree to the suggestion of a ‘helpful’ meeting point Askthe person is a registered commercial breeder,so record the number from the Local Authority Registration document Enquire about the pup’s health status including worming and parasites, inoculations etc Get veriable veterinary confirmation Obtain a proper receipt.Northern IrelandUSPCAPets  \"       \"  ]]Most PopularDrink driver apprehended in Ballyclare...NewsMen praised by PSNI for saving ‘floating and unresponsive’ w...NewsPolice warn over ‘morning after’...NewsPortadown killer Garfield Beattie has jail sentence, for sen...NewsMissing: Police searching for four-year-old Malachi McCready...NewsMost Popular                       This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us on    ExploreNewsSportWhats OnLestyleYour Northern IrelandRecommendedMore from Northern Ireland WorldAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadNewspaper ArchiveUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessArchiveSubscribeEventsPlace your AdReaders Charter \" fill\"#ea\"  ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-kTUwUJ sc-dqBHgY ciFbrr\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyModern Slavery Statement       \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"    News\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      NewsCoronavirusTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsHealthBusinessEducationEnvironmentPeopleRead ThisFootball\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      FootballIrish League FootballSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      SportMotorcyclingIce HockeyOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      LestyleFood and DrinkTravelHomes and GardensCarsFamilyRetroOpinionYour NI\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Your NI​Antrim and NewtownabbeyArmagh Banbridge and CraigavonBelfastCauseway Coast and GlensLondonderry Derry City and StrabaneLisburn and CastlereaghMid and East AntrimMid UlsterFermanagh and OmaghNewry Mourne and DownArds and North DownMust ReadContact usAdvertise My BusinessFollow us      "},{"url":null,"title":"red bay rnlis hazel on call for the first time this christmas ","story":"Dog found with bleeding feet as Portadown man pleads guilty of animal welfare offences   Masked men armed with a hammer break into Larne homeNewsCoronavirusTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsHealthBusinessEducationPeopleEnvironmentRead ThisFootballIrish League FootballSportMotorcyclingIce HockeyOther SportWhats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyleFood and DrinkTravelHomes and GardensCars FamilyYour NIRetroOpinionAdvertise My BusinessNewsPeopleRed Bay RNLI’s Hazel on call for the first time this ChristmasA Glasgow native, who moved to Cushendall three and a half years ago and has since joined the leboat crew at Red Bay RNLI, is preparing to drop everything this Christmasher pager sounds and there is an emergency at sea.By Una CulkinMonday, th December , : pm  \"       \"  As the charity launches its Christmas appeal, Hazel Imrie who runs a hardware store in the town, is urging people across Antrim – home to stations at Red Bay, Portrush and Larne - to help her fellow crew and the thousands of other volunteer crews carrying pagers over the festivities, to continue their lesaving work.“I joined the crew at Red Bay in February  just before Covid hit,” Hazel explained, “so unfortunately with the pandemic and restrictions, my training was disjointed, and it wasn’t until this year that I could focus on completing my assessments.“I have always had an interest in the work of the RNLI and I knew when I moved here with my partner who is from Cushendall, that I wanted to get involved because I could see how integral the service is to a coastal community. I wanted to give something back to the community that I was living in.”Red Bay RNLI crew member Hazel ImrieWith no prior maritime, sailing or boating experience, Hazel fully immersed herself into the rigorous training involved in becoming a crew member.“I have valued the support of an experienced team and I have learned so much from others. Everyone has been so welcoming, and the training has been hands on, practical and a really enjoyable experience.”Now as Hazel prepares for her pager to sound, she says there is a mixture of emotions involved ahead of her first call out: “I am excited but there is also anticipation and concern because you are going into the unknown, but I am also reassured because I know when that call does come, everyone  who turns up is experienced and will support me.”Like Hazel, thousands of volunteer crew members around Ireland and the UK, sign up to save every one from drowning – it has been the charity’s mission since .This Christmas many will leave their loved ones behind to answer the call, each time hoping to reunite another family, and see those in trouble on the water safely ed. Over the past decade, RNLI leboats have launched over , times during the festive period. But these rescues would not be possible without donations from the RNLI’s generous supporters, helping to fund the essential kit, training and equipment needed by leboat crews all year round.Hazel said: “This is my first Christmas on call and I know even over the festive period, our lesavers are ready to drop everything and rush to the aid of someone in trouble on the water. At this time of year, the weather can be at its worst and lives can be on the line.“We know that every time our crews go out they hope for a good outcome, but sadly this sometimes isn’t the case. We hope that theappeal will show people how tough it can be, but also that with their help we can get so much closer to our goal of saving every one.”GlasgowPortrushAntrimLarne  \"       \"  ]]Most PopularDrink driver apprehended in Ballyclare...NewsMen praised by PSNI for saving ‘floating and unresponsive’ w...NewsPolice warn over ‘morning after’...NewsPortadown killer Garfield Beattie has jail sentence, for sen...NewsMissing: Police searching for four-year-old Malachi McCready...NewsMost Popular                       This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us on    ExploreNewsSportWhats OnLestyleYour Northern IrelandRecommendedMore from Northern Ireland WorldAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadNewspaper ArchiveUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessArchiveSubscribeEventsPlace your AdReaders Charter \" fill\"#ea\"  ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-kTUwUJ sc-dqBHgY ciFbrr\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyModern Slavery Statement       \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"    News\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      NewsCoronavirusTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsHealthBusinessEducationEnvironmentPeopleRead ThisFootball\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      FootballIrish League FootballSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      SportMotorcyclingIce HockeyOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      LestyleFood and DrinkTravelHomes and GardensCarsFamilyRetroOpinionYour NI\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Your NI​Antrim and NewtownabbeyArmagh Banbridge and CraigavonBelfastCauseway Coast and GlensLondonderry Derry City and StrabaneLisburn and CastlereaghMid and East AntrimMid UlsterFermanagh and OmaghNewry Mourne and DownArds and North DownMust ReadContact usAdvertise My BusinessFollow us      "},{"url":null,"title":"welcome to ni world a new website built on decades of great weekly newspaper journalism ","story":"Man with Larne address is accused of sex offences   Boy dies after road collision near GlenavyNewsCoronavirusTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsHealthBusinessEducationPeopleEnvironmentRead ThisFootballIrish League FootballSportMotorcyclingIce HockeyOther SportWhats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyleFood and DrinkTravelHomes and GardensCars FamilyYour NIRetroOpinionAdvertise My BusinessNewsPeopleWelcome to NI World - a new website built on decades of great weekly newspaper journalismToday sees a new era for our titles with the launch of a new website that brings you all the great content from our local journalists with some great new features.By Valerie Martin, NI World EditorThursday, th December , : pm  \"       \"  Welcome to NI World As well as local news, views and issues about the towns and villages that matter to you, we will also be bringing you issues and information from across the region we all call home.

The consultation with key stakeholders will run for a period of  weeks.”The issue first arose inFebruary  when the council received a request from Abbeyville Residents’ Association for five Irish language street signs which was turned down after councillors voted in favour of a policy retaining street signs in English only proposed by Glengormley DUP councillor Alderman Phillip Brett and seconded by Glengormley Ulster Unionist councillor Ald Mark Cisgrove.Ald Brett stressed the importance of the council having a policy on the issue so thatthere were future requests, these could be dealt with “smoothly”.Ald Cosgrove said that given the facts and figures presented to members over the number of Irish language speakers in the borough, the request would be “preposterous” and street signs would look like a “dog’s dinner”.According to the  census,.% of residents in Antrim and Newtownabbey had some knowledge of Irish. In , it was reported that  people in Antrim and Newtownabbey spoke Irish as a main language.However, in September , the council was forced to do a u-turn after being challenged in the High Court by a resident who sought a judicial review over a “deeply held concern that the policy adopted by the local authority was unlawful”. Read hereThe borough councilinsisted that its policy was “not a ban in any way on the Irish language” and a new, “more detailed policy would be drafted for the council to consider”.Commenting on last week’s decision, SDLP group leader Councillor Roisin Lynch said: “I was disappointed that councillors decided to support this deeply restrictive policy. It is a shameless and deliberate attempt to slow down and stymy efforts for dual language signage.“There can be little doubt that this onerous policy is designed to obstruct efforts to progress the visibility of Gaeilge in our local communities. I am particularly disappointed that Alliance Party councillors backed a policy designed to restrict the growth of the language.“It is of vital importance that the Irish language is given the visibility it deserves and that anyone who wishes to see bilingual signage in their area has access to a fair and transparent process. This is a slap in the face to those in our communities, including myself, who know that we need to break down barriers to the visibility of the the Irish language, not create new ones.”Antrim and Newtownabbey Mayor Councillor Billy Webb commented: “This is not an Irish language policy. This is a multi-lingual policy. We are a erse community.“The policy is going out to consultation. We were looking for one third of residents of a street to instigate an application and then  per cent plus one in the actual vote. That is a normal and true democratic process. The DUP was looking for two-thirds.”Michelle Weir, Local Democracy Reporter--A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this article.
