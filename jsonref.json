Prince Harry and Meghan Markle released this photograph to mark their engagement. They will marry in Windsor on May 19, 2018Who is Meghan Markle?Meghan was born Rachel Meghan Markle on August 4, 1981, in Los Angeles to Doria Loyce Ragland, a social worker and yoga instructor, and Thomas Markle Sr, an Emmy Award-winning lighting director, who currently lives in Mexico.Meghan\u0027s parents orced when she was six years old and she has two older half-siblings on her father\u0027s side, Thomas Markle Jr and Samantha Grant. After growing up in Hollywood, Meghan graduated from Northwestern University in 2003 with a double major in theatre and international studies.At the start of her acting career, she worked as a freelance calligrapher to support herself but soon gained small roles in shows such as General Hospital, Century City, The War at Home and CSI:NY.Meghan is also well known for her stint as a \u0027briefcase girl\u0027 on the US version of the game show, Deal or No Deal.She started dating actor and producer Trevor Engelson in 2004. They  married in Jamaica in 2011 and orced after two years in 2013.          Meghan Markle will join the royal family when she marries Prince Harry in spring of this year          Meghan is fast becoming a trendsetter, so far opting for a look that is more laid back than her soon-to-be sister-in-law Kate Middleton\u0027sWhat is Meghan Markle\u0027s net worth?Meghan  net worth is currently at $5 million (£3.7m), according to Celebrity Net Worth.This is  half of Kate Middleton\u0027s $10 million (£7.4m) and is insignificant compared to her future husband Prince Harry\u0027s net worth of $40 million (£29.6m).How did Meghan Markle make her money?As Rachel Zane on Suits, Meghan  was making more than $50,000 (£37,000) for each episode and her annual salary totalled $450,000 (£333,000). This figure includes $80,000 (£59,300) worth of sponsorship and endorsement opportunities.In 2010 she was also paid $187,000 (£138,000) for appearing in the film Remember Me and $171,429 (£127,000) for The Candidate.Despite being rich, Meghan rented a three-bedroom, two-bathroom home in Toronto\u0027s Seaton Village while she was filming Suits, thought to cost around $1,770 (£1312) a month.Meghan  also leased an Audi SUV worth around $54,000 (£40,000), acting as a brand ambassador for the brand, but she ended her lease early and used a chauffeur for the end of her job on Suits.          Meghan Markle\u0027s Instagram account documented her travels before being shut down in 2017As Meghan Markle is a US citizen, sharing Prince Harry\u0027s royal wealth could become problematic, especially as it is not known whether she will take dual nationality. Alongside this, if Meghan were to receive any royal money, she would have to pay income tax to the United States\u0027 Internal Revenue Service (IRS).Royal expert Marlene Koenig revealed that if she remains a US citizen after marriage and has investments in the US, like a retirement plan, for example, she would have to pay tax.\u0027This is even on money earned outside the United States. If she receives money from her husband or his family, and that\u0027s considered income, she would have to pay income tax on that\u0027, Koenig said.If Meghan has more than $300,000 (£222,000) worth of assets in a tax year, she will have to file a Form 8938 documenting these assets, which would then include previously undisclosed details of the royal family\u0027s estate.This situation is very likely because of Meghan\u0027s current net worth of $5 million (£3.7m).

It then sat on the kitchen counter in the Toronto house — a material reminder that her home was no longer in Los Angeles.’          Meghan was married to film producer Trevor for two years who gave her a small role in the film Remember MeIt is an image far removed from what we have seen thus far of the royal bride-to-be — a sweet-natured and compassionate woman who can barely believe her good fortune at becoming engaged to a prince.Doubtless there is a measure of truth in this.However, in his book, to be published this month, renowned royal biographer Andrew Morton portrays the 36-year-old actress in a very different light, suggesting a far more complex — and possibly calculating — character.Though Morton describes it as ‘an old-fashioned story of a local girl makes good’, he shows how Meghan has harboured dreams of becoming a princess since she was a teenager. Her ambition is to ‘become Diana 2.0’, according to her closest school friend.          Meghan is set to marry Prince Harry on May 19 after they began a romance in 2016In extracts published this weekend, the author also presents Meghan’s capacity for ruthlessness, describing how she has expunged people she once held dear from her life as she set about elevating her social and professional status.Morton’s depiction of Meghan builds on my own portrayal of her in an exclusive Daily Mail series last year, and draws on many of the same sources. However, the author who made his name in 1992 with Diana: Her True Story, which exposed her shockingly dysfunctional marriage to Charles, takes the extraordinary narrative further.It begins with Meghan’s own dysfunctional upbringing, which did much to shape her character. Her father, Thomas, was a leading Hollywood lighting director in his mid-30s when he met her mother, Doria, who was 12 years his junior and temping in his studio as a make-up artist. They married and were overjoyed when, a year later, Meghan was born, in August 1981.But their happiness was fleeting. As Morton recounts, they lived in a predominantly white suburb where neighbours would mistake her black mother for the nanny or nursemaid. On top of this bigotry, Thomas worked 80 or 90 hours a week, leaving his young wife to care alone for Meghan and her step-siblings, Thomas Junior and Yvonne (who later took the name Samantha) — her husband’s teenage children by his first marriage.With baby Meghan the apple of her father’s eye, her half-sister resented her from the outset. And while she was upstairs in her crib, Thomas Jnr, then 15, admitted to Morton that he would smoke cannabis downstairs with his friends.Matters came to a head when his father caught them passing round a joint. To get them out of the house, he dreamt up a grotesque ruse. After changing Meghan’s nappy, he fetched a spoon from the kitchen and pretended to eat from it, Morton writes.In fact, he had filled a clean nappy with chocolate pudding, but his son’s friends were duly repulsed and never returned. By the time Meghan was two years old, Doria had had enough and moved out, though four years would pass before her parents orced. As they shared custody of her, Meghan was shunted between them.          The royal bride-to-be during her time as a \u0027briefcase girl\u0027 on Deal or No DealAccording to one of her teachers, this caused Meghan difficulties — ‘one parent over here, one over there, neither of them particularly fond of each other’.However, according to a school-friend, mediating between the warring factions taught Meghan how to control her emotions.At two, her had parents enrolled her in the Little Red School House, an exclusive creche for stars’ children, where she began performing in plays. At one of her early performances, a girl with tangled blonde hair, jam-jar glasses and an awkward manner was in the chorus line. Today, Scarlett Johansson is the world’s highest paid actress.Yet Meghan’s early introduction to showbusiness also had disquieting overtones. At nine, her father, who was then working on the raunchy comedy Married With Children, would pick her up from school then take her to the set with him.There, she sat quietly in a corner, watching the enactment of scenes possibly too candid for a little girl’s eyes, involving semi-nudity and risqué sexual jokes. As Meghan said pointedly later: ‘It was a very perverse place to grow up. I went to Catholic school.’Around this time, in 1990, her father had a stroke of luck, although it quickly turned sour.      Last autumn, when their engagement was imminent and a meeting with the Queen at Buckingham Palace beckoned, Morgan writes revealingly, Meghan prepared for the occasion by making secret excursions to the Rose Tree Cottage — ‘a little slice of England in LA’, where she practiced sipping tea.It was to be the biggest moment of her life — and Meghan was determined to rehearse her part to perfection."},{"url":"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5568047/Melrose-forced-promise-not-sell-GKNs-crucial-aerospace-division.html","title":"Melrose could be forced to promise not to sell GKN\u0027s crucial aerospace division","story":"    Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson expressed ‘serious’ reservations over sensitive contracts held by GKNThe firm’s aerospace ision, which once made Spitfires, makes components for F-35 jets and Typhoon aircraft.

As a direct result, murders there have fallen by 87 per cent since the 1980s. In 1990, 2,245 people were killed last year the figure was 286.Of course, there are many cities in the US which have not succeeded in cutting the homicide rate, and overall Britain remains a much safer country than America. Nevertheless, the spate of murders in London in recent weeks is a shameful milestone – and we need an urgent debate about the contributory factors.Metropolitan Police Commissioner Cressida Dick said interactions between iniduals and gang members on social media were helping to inflame minor disagreements and grudges until, all too often, they ended in stabbings or shootings. I am sure she is right.However, there is another major factor behind the surge in deaths which is staring us in the face.Between 2010 and 2014, knife crime was going down. In that time, reported offences involving a knife or sharp instrument across England and Wales fell from 32,900 to 26,000.          Cressida Dick said interactions between iniduals and gang members on social media were helping to inflame minor disagreementsThen, in April 2014, Theresa May, then Home Secretary, made a speech in which she ordered police to observe new rules on stop and search. She had been moved, she said, by figures which showed people from a black or other ethnic minority background were seven times more likely to be stopped and searched and she ordered police to reduce the number of stop and searches which did not result in an arrest.In future, she said, an officer would use stop and search powers only if he or she believed a crime ‘will’ take place rather than when they believed it ‘may’ take place.The new rules had a dramatic effect. In 201314, there were 904,038 stop and searches. In 201617, that number fell to 303,845.But, as stop and searches were curtailed, a worrying – if largely predictable – thing happened.London murder rate is HIGHER than New York\u0027s for the first...Share this articleFrom 2014, the rate of knife crime began to rise again for the first time since 2010. By 2017, the number of knife offences across the UK had risen to 34,700. There was, of course, some truth in what Theresa May said.The black community did undoubtedly feel they were being singled out – guilty of ‘walking while black’. For law-abiding iniduals who felt they were being targeted, it was an upsetting, humiliating and unsettling experience.And when people are treated unjustly, it is counter-productive in the fight against crime. Officers will always find it difficult to win the co-operation of a community that feels under siege.However, there is also evidence to suggest Mrs May could have been exaggerating the problem.          In April 2014, Theresa May, then Home Secretary, made a speech in which she ordered police to observe new rules on stop and searchLast week, Alasdair Palmer, her speechwriter at the Home Office, revealed that officials had commissioned – but then ‘forgotten about’ – a study from Wolverhampton University which found that while it was true a disproportionate number of black people were being stopped and searched, it wasn’t true to say they were being targeted. There were simply more black people out on the streets in areas where knife crime was a problem.None of this changes the simple fact that if we are going to stop young men killing each other, we have to take knives off the street.The best solution is to find a way of searching for knives which is not hostile and which does not leave people feeling they have been singled out. Miss Dick has spoken previously of the benefits of police body cameras.For the black community, the recording of interactions serves as reassurance that officers will not abuse their powers. For police, it provides a ready source of evidence when their integrity is called into question.A more radical solution would be to make searches a routine procedure. No-one feels they have been singled out by being made to walk through an airport scanner, for example, because everyone has to do it.When my son was in Beijing last year he sent me a video of himself heading down into the city metro system where everyone had to walk through a scanner.Perhaps something similar could work here.Whatever the police do now, it is clear that scaling back stop and search has been a dreadful mistake. They need to make getting knives off the streets a priority – and that means, one way or another, increasing the number of people being searched.More police on the streets might help, too. It worked in New York.In Britain, the number of police officers has tumbled from 143,734 in 2010 to 123,142 now.New York doesn’t have a hugely greater number of police officers than London – 40,000 against London’s 32,000 (the cities are a similar size), but when I visited New York the police were certainly a more visual presence on the streets.It is an approach we would do well to adopt in London."},{"url":"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5568361/Pupils-UK-young-four-suffering-depression.html","title":"Pupils in UK as young as four are suffering from depression","story":"    Infants as young as four are suffering from symptoms of depression and anxiety, a shocking survey revealed (file photo)Mental health among teenagers has been the subject of concern for years amid the rise of social media and a growing obsession with celebrities’ lives.However, the NASUWT teaching union research suggests that problems such as depression are developing at ever younger ages.
