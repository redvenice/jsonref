creative ways people have been marking the Global Marijuana March.The celebration of all things cannabis has seen festivities taking place across the world on Saturday.The Global Marijuana March, which normally occurs on the first weekend in May, serves as a call to legalise cannabis.Chants of ‘legalise don’t demonise’ were among those heard on Saturday as enthusiasts came together to celebrate the drug.This is not how you’re supposed to eat pineapples (Picture: EPA)Photos from across the globe show how people marked the big day.Some smoked out of gas masks, others chose pieces of fruit, and some used their bodies as art to promote the legalisation of cannabis as a recreational drug.Legalisation is not something that is expected to happen in the UK any time soon.In response to an online petition calling for its use to be decriminalised, the Home Office said: ‘There is a substantial body of scientific and medical evidence to show that controlled drugs, such as cannabis, are harmful and can damage people’s mental and physical health, and our wider communities.People also held a mass meet up in Montevideo, Uruguay (Picture: Getty)‘The evidence from the Government’s independent experts, the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs (‘ACMD’), is that the use of cannabis is a “significant public health issue and can unquestionably cause harm to iniduals and society”.‘The ACMD’s most recent advice on cannabis is set out in its 2008 report.More than 100 naked people given private tour of art gallery‘The legalisation of cannabis would send the wrong message to the vast majority of people who do not take drugs, especially young and vulnerable people, with the potential grave risk of increased misuse of drugs.‘It would not eliminate the crime committed by the illicit trade, nor would it address the harms associated with drug dependence and the misery this can cause to families and

Perry, 46, had his leg amputated after an infected spider bite gave him sepsis (Picture: SWNS)A dad-of-two had to have his leg amputated after he was bitten by a false widow spider.Andy Perry, 46, said the pain was so severe that he considered chopping it off himself with a chainsaw before surgeons agreed to operate.The former landscaper is believed to be the first person in Britain to lose a leg from a spider bite.He fell ill with severe back pain just 48 hours after carrying out a fencing job in Thorpe Astley, Leicestershire.The pain became so bad that he had to be rushed to hospital suffering from sepsis and kidney failure.He required emergency care, was placed on an IV drip and remained at Leicester Royal Infirmary for a week.He had to have his swollen leg amputated (Picture: SWNS) Andy considered amputating his own leg with a chainsaw (Picture: SWNS)Andy’s beg was badly infected (Picture: SWNS)Over the next few weeks the infection subsided but he was left with lymphedema – a painful and debilitating swelling of the leg, which left his skin falling off.After numerous appointments with specialists Andy opted for an elective amputation above his right knee, which was carried out in March.Andy, of Huncote, who lives with his police officer wife Christine, 39, said: ‘I was doing a quote for a job in 2015 and I was coming home at lunchtime to look after the kids because my wife was on shift.‘But within a couple of hours I started feeling really poorly.‘I rang the missus to see if she could come home but she couldn’t and the next I know I got a massive ache in the small of my back.Andy is fundraising to make his garden accessible to him with his wheelchair (Picture: SWNS)‘I went to bed when she got back, pretty much for the whole weekend and I was throwing up.‘I was seen by a doctor in the Royal Leicester Infirmary Triage and he said there was no chance of me going home.‘I put on a IV antibiotic and almost died because of the sepsis.’The doctor in charge deemed the bite to be from the false widow spider, as its bite has similar effects that Andy was experiencing.‘The puncture marks were just above the sock line because I used to wear socks and boots,’ Andy said.‘The only thing we can think of is that I literally just brushed past it and its had a quick bite as I’ve gone past.Andy’s leg just before it was amputated (Picture: SWNS) A false widow spider (Picture: PA)Andy said he found it hard to get treatment because the lymphedema meant it was a live infection and surgeons didn’t want to operate on it.‘Eventually I had to threaten my GP with cutting my own leg off with a blade from a chainsaw because I was getting so desperate,’ he said.‘The leg was cut off on March 13 of this year, it should’ve been healed by now but I got a secondary infection so I was back in surgery on April 27.‘I’ve now got a vacuum dressing on me which pulls all of the gulp out of the leg and takes it away.‘The plan is to rehabilitate the leg, get a prosthetic and get back to work for this year or next.Nine-year-old chess genius facing deportation from Britain‘We’ve been living off my wife’s salary – I have got zero income because of this bite.’Andy is now hoping to get help to make his garden more wheelchair-friendly so he can play with his children Thomas, 8, and George, 5.‘I know it is a long shot but I’m hoping to raise donations of materials and then I’m hoping to find friends and tradesmen willing to help out by doing the work, a kind of Ground Force, DIY SOS thing, on a local basis.’The UK has seen a rise in false widow spiders in the past four years, believed to be caused by an increase in temperatures.The false widow spider is usually harmless and is not deadly, but can deliver a similar bite to its cousin the black widow, which can kill within hours.MORE: Amputee model is proudly showing off her leg to inspire others to embrace their looksMORE: Mother of shooting victim makes emotional appeal to end street

Byworth for )Masturbation Month is upon us, which means two things.One, you have an excuse to masturbate as much as you please.Two, we’re going to be chatting about masturbation for the rest of May.Out of pure nosiness and the desire to get rid of our collective awkwardness around talking about masturbation (loads of us are doing it. There’s no shame in a self-love sesh), we asked a bunch of people their masturbation routines.Do they light ten candles and play Enya in the background? Are they more of the ‘bash it out quickly in the loos’ type?Turns out there’s a real range in the preparation people put into their wank seshes.All names have been changed for reasons of privacy.‘I masturbate at least six times on weekdays, eight or more on weekends. I usually plan my day around it.‘Twice in the morning (first thing when I wake up and then in the shower), twice at work when I go for “toilet breaks”, and at least twice in the evenings.‘I have a wardrobe with costumes I like to wear depending on the fetish porn I’m watching. It’s the reason I live alone because I need the privacy.’‘I only do it when in alone in my flat so it’s normally on a midweek day off, in the afternoon is my fave time.‘I close the curtains, lock my cat in another room (otherwise he hears the vibrations and triess to attack, not cool). Normally I just watch porn on my phone and use a vibrator of some variety.’‘At least five times a day. You sometimes hit the wall at three, but you need to power through.‘Firstly I light a few candles, cinnamon really gets me going.‘Once I’m tumescent, I take off all my clothes looking directly into a mirror, never taking my eyes off my helmet. At this point I am ready.‘I squat down in front of the mirror and beat away at myself.’‘No real routine. Usually in bed or sometimes if a day off in the shower, depending on how i was feeling. Just ’til it feels like a natural end.’‘I stupidly signed a 12 month contract on a flat with my (at the time) girlfriend. We ended within a couple of months.‘So my routine is quickly, before the ex gets back, using my phone for porn.’‘I try not to do the same thing every time because I read this terrifying article about how doing the same thing every time can make you unable to come any other way.’‘Sometimes they’re planned treats. My ‘dessert’ after dinner, the ceremonial way to see in and out the weekend, it’s Wednesday, etc.‘Sometimes they’re not planned at all and I’ve just accidentally seen half a tit on a commercial ad or suddenly remembered Michaela Strachan.‘I’d say I feel closest to God after I’ve ejaculated thrice in a week, so I present my case to a human woman and then see myself past the goalposts.‘Porn helps, and I normally stick to the big guns before it’s show time IF I’m choking the chicken from a laptop. That said, I require very little set-up and have actually laid the foundations for a very mobile operation.‘I live in a house-share at the moment, so I need to have some wits about me. If it’s quiet, I’ll play music to drown out the faps – but then I guess it’s a red flag to be playing early-2000s R\u0026ampB 25 minutes after I’ve said goodnight.‘I have no go-to porn category. I’d never watch the same video twice but I like picking from the Russian roulette of the first homepage carousel and playing with the cards you’re dealt with.’‘I do it because the stimulation from my bullet isn’t something you can get from toy-less sex and it feels amazing, but don’t do it often because I prefer sex in general and my boyfriend and I live together so I don’t feel like I need to all that often.‘Setup would be checking there’s no danger of being interrupted, lying on or in my bed and usually have low lighting but close my eyes anyway.‘Tend to mostly or fully undress before starting but depends how long I’m dedicating to it and whether I’ve just showered or I’m fitting it in during the day.’‘I dim the lights, get out some lavender oil to set the mood, I insert the biggest butt plug I have into my anal cavity and stroke my meat wagon with passion.’‘Probably once a fortnight? Maybe more? So not often, but I find that I usually do it more when I’m due on my period.‘Sometimes I feel like I need to watch porn to get myself going, as it were, sometimes I don’t need to, it depends.‘I can usually have multiple orgasms and be done within 30 to 45 mins.‘I don’t use ‘tools’ much anymore. I haven’t got a vibrator and (I’m back living at home) and I found the bullet too noisy and it was making me paranoid so I just use my fingers instead.’‘Daily before, weekly now #womaninmylife is here.‘Sometimes I use the old fashioned method of using my imagination, but recently I’ve actually got into watching porn.‘I have a vibrator which I hardly use anymore. I prefer the natural method.’‘Depending on how the day unfolds, it will either be before or after work. However, there have been a few occasions which the stress of the day has taken its toll, leaving me with no other option but to have a little time of pleasure to myself – not ideal in a public cubical.‘Let’s discuss the set up at home – a little more pleasant! Firstly I set the scene with candles and sweet soul music playing softly. Then, I bring out my partner in crime – the dildo. The rest is history.’‘As a guy I normally get morning wood when I wake up. So, I would masturbate before starting my day.In the middle of the day I would do it again if say, I was bored or need a break from doing work.‘Lastly, after a long day if I couldn’t get to sleep I would masturbate again and pray this puts me to sleep. Which not to mention is another benefit: It puts to you to sleep!‘In terms of set up, the perfect timing for me is if no one is in the house or everyone is occupied in another room. I would make sure my webcams or other cameras are blocked or stored away since somehow the government may be spying on me while I have my Me Time, as well as close my curtains since other people can see me from other buildings.‘I guess I can do it anywhere in my house as long as I’m closed off from society for a while.‘For timing, I masturbate if or when I feel like doing it. Of course, it has to be in a private area and if there is even time for it. If not, I can wait until I get home.’‘No routine really. Mostly when in bed. Sometimes with porn, sometimes just when feeling turned on.’‘I’m a very routine driven person, so I stick to a schedule of once every other day.‘My routine is pretty simple. I usually go to Pornhub and find some decent videos on there. It can take anything from a few minutes to over half an hour depending on my mood andor quality of the video.’‘No real set up or routine – typically will be when chilling on the sofa watching TV or in bed before sleep.‘Some mental stimulus can help, but never really need visual aids.’‘I don’t masturbate often, so when I do it’s an event. I’m talking a long bath, fresh sheets, silky underwear.‘I struggle to find decent porn that isn’t just jackhammering and giant penises, so usually watch lesbian stuff or anything with domination. I start off with my hands and then use a vibrator on my clit.‘My room has to be tidy because otherwise I get distracted, and I play music out loud and use headphones for the porn. I’ll only do it when no one’s home because otherwise I get so worried about keeping quiet that I can’t come.’‘For porn I use Tumblr, which is probably the best system I’ve ever seen for that sort of thing since everything is linked together.‘For schedule it’s at least once in the morning in bed…I wake up before my kids do at six (since I have them every other week). There’s no music or candles.‘If it’s at night and I don’t have the kids then sometimes I’ll hit up Literotica.‘My porn “type” tends towards BDSM but that can cover pretty large genres really. Variety is the spice of life!‘And I always have some.sort of lube to use since I’m not a savage.’‘It all depends on how busy I am that week or how often I see my boyfriend. If I have a day off with nothing to do I can crack out a few in a day, but sometimes it’ll only be once or twice a week.‘If there’s no one in my flat, I’ll use a toy (they’re noisy buggers) and watch porn or read something online, and make my room look nice so i’m not distracted – make a real thing of it.‘If my housemates are in or it’s just a quickie, it can be as simple as laying down and getting the job done.’‘In a house full of people it usually happens in the toilet but if they’re all out, then I can go for it in peace. Sometimes I use sex chatlines.’‘I don’t have a routine anymore, I generally just smash it out if I remember.‘If I feel like watching some porn, then it’ll most likely be threesomelesbian.’‘No set-up. I go rogue.’MORE: Why I don’t masturbateMORE: Masturbation Month: 9 ways to upgrade your orgasmMORE: Straight women explain what sex feels like when you have a vagina"},{"url":"https://metrouk2.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/sec_10646663.jpg?quality=80\u0026amp;strip=all","title":"much fun people may bank holiday","story":"Find someone who looks at you like Fat Jack looks at this Mini Cooper (Picture: NB Press Limited)This bank holiday has been a beautiful one, with record sunny temperatures.So how have you been celebrating?Probably not as enthusiastically as these people, who hit the town very hard last night.One man was pictured making love to a Mini Cooper, while a woman dressed as a cowgirlFresian cow hybrid strode down the street wielding fire torches in each hand.Suddenly our cocktail in the sunshine seems a bit tame.But be ready for the group photo (Picture: NB Press Ltd)As well as showing clear affection for vehicles, people out last night were also enamoured with their fast food.One man was pictured cradling his takeaway box like a newborn child as he sat barefoot in the road.Or here (Picture: NB Press Ltd)Some of those pictured were from the local Young Farmers branch, while others were enjoying stag and hen dos.Of course there were others just celebrating May Day.It all got a bit much for some people (Picture: NB Press Ltd)Some looked like they might be struggling when they woke up this morning.At least they’ll have the memories though.

But what is Martin Lewis’s net worth?Who is Martin Lewis?Born Martin Steven Lewis on May 9, 1972 in Withington, Manchester, he is an English financial journalist and founder of the website MoneySavingExpert.com.He lost his mother in a car accident at a young age and later in life, went on to become a patron of the children’s bereavement charity Grief Encounter as well as an advocate for life insurance.Martin studied government and law at the London School of Economics and went on to complete a postgraduate course in broadcast journalism in Cardiff.His first job was at a financial communications consultancy, the Brunswick Group in London and later, became a producer for the BBC Business Unit working on BBC Radio Five Live business programmes.Martin was also an editor of BBC Radio 4’s Today programme and then moved to Sky’s Simply Money where he formed his Money Saving Expert persona.After the collapse of Simply Money, he wrote for the Deal of the Week column in the Sunday Express and was then granted slots on Channel 5’s Open House with Gloria Hunniford.Martin returned to BBC for a short while before presenting a daytime television series on ITV in 2005 called Make Me Rich as well as Channel Five show It Pays to Watch.He then presented money saving programmes on Good Morning Britain and Lorraine and now appears on This Morning, The Wright Stuff and began presenting The Martin Lewis Money Show.Martin Lewis is married to former 5 News weather presenter Lara Lewington in May 31, 2009 and the couple had a daughter in November 2012.          Money Saving Expert Martin Lewis pictured with his Order of the British Empire (OBE) medal alongside his wife Lara Lewington at an Investiture ceremony in February 2015 at Buckingham PalaceMartin Lewis on Question TimeMoney Saving Expert Martin Lewis was applauded by Question Time viewers after he slammed Labour Party MP Chi Onwurah over student finance claims.He accused politicians of dissuading young people from attending university by referring to the fee payments as student ‘debt’ and said that an entire generation had been ‘mis-educated’.He said: \u0027It is an abomination, you should all hold your heads in shame... It\u0027s an increased form of taxation when you leave but is not framed as a debt, it shouldn\u0027t be called a debt, it\u0027s a graduate contribution system so don\u0027t even go there.\u0027Martin explained that the price of attending university was irrelevant and the repayments are based on salary, which means that those who earn a lot after completing their studies, will naturally have to pay back more.Ms Onwurah, MP for Newcastle upon Tyne Central said: \u0027If somebody, and particularly somebody from a working class background, if somebody has 57,000 in debt,\u0027 but Martin interrupted her to say: ‘Don\u0027t tell them! Politicians do this all the time. You can\u0027t make political points.\u0027You put off young people from underprivileged backgrounds from going to university with a fear of debt by framing it as a debt when you know it doesn\u0027t work like that.\u0027Politicians need to take responsibility. Your political football that you and all the parties have used student finance to be has mis-educated a generation about how student finance works and it is an abomination, you should all hold your heads in shame because there are people from poor backgrounds on television - I saw a programme two weeks ago - saying I can\u0027t afford to go to university.\u0027Well, you know what, it is expensive, it\u0027s an increased form of taxation when you leave but is not framed as a debt, it shouldn\u0027t be called a debt, it\u0027s a graduate contribution system so don\u0027t even go there.\u0027Ms Onwurah responded: \u0027It is really, really important to recognise that tuition fees are an obstacle for students going into university. It\u0027s psychological but a lot of the world is psychological. How things are perceived is what informs people\u0027s choice.\u0027You can argue to re-educate, or you can argue, as we have done, to abolish tuition fees.\u0027Martin Lewis suing FacebookIn April 2018, Money Saving Expert founder Martin Lewis revealed that he is in the process of suing Facebook for publishing dozens of adverts using his image to promote scams.He said that the social media platform had used his name to ‘rip off vulnerable people’. He continued: \u0027I feel sick each time I hear of another victim being conned because of trust they wrongly thought they were placing in me.‘I believe politicians have totally missed the impact of social media companies on real people and their pockets. It is about time they took this seriously.’Martin went on to say that Facebook founder Mark Zuckerburg ‘pretends to be an honest and campaigning man but his company is a facilitator of criminal scammers … They have known about these scam adverts for years, and they are still happy to roll around in their dirty money.’Facebook has been accused of publishing more than 50 fake Martin Lewis adverts, with the majority promoting schemes trading in Bitcoin, which Martin claimed were actually binary trading firms.Binary trading is a risky form of gambling on the stock market that sees most investors lose money.The Financial Conduct Authority has said almost 100 firms are illegally offering such investments to UK consumers and warned of online firms that take money, place no bets for customers then break contact.Martin has asked Facebook to remove the adverts multiple times but they are left up for days or weeks before being taken down and then reappear days later.A Facebook spokesman said: ‘We do not allow adverts which are misleading or false on Facebook and have explained to Martin Lewis he should report any adverts that infringe his rights and they will be removed.’Martin Lewis net worthMartin Lewis’s net worth has accumulated to approximately £73 million, according to Wealtholino.In 2012, BBC News reported that Martin sold MoneySavingExpert.com for up to £87 million.Marvel character searches on Pornhub surged before Avengers: Infinity War releaseJennifer Aniston joins Brad Pitt and others in objecting to The Weinstein Company saleGrey\u0027s Anatomy preview hints at Sarah Drew and Jessica Capshaw\u0027s leavingCinco de Mayo: How to celebrate in style Who is Matthew Lawrence?

The mast was broken, the sails in shreds and the boat itself flooded with water.The British towns where VEG has almost vanished... and why...We had to tell our children Daddy could die on Everest... we...Share this articleWhat followed was a story of good fortune, rare courage, and redemption. For more than 40 days, with her boat crippled, equipment smashed and heart broken, 23-year-old Tami somehow endured the elements threatening to annihilate her and then conquered them – and she did so thanks to the guiding spirit of her dead fiancé, whose insistent voice, day by day, had urged her on to a seemingly impossible survival.That voice, she says, brought her back from the brink, helping her navigate with just a sextant and the stars above her head.Now her ordeal and the extraordinary memoir that followed have been made into a big-budget Hollywood film, Adrift, set for release in June, and featuring British actor Sam Claflin as Richard and Shailene Woodley as Tami.Both are rising stars – Sam appeared in the film adaptation of Jojo Moyes’ novel Me Before You, while US actress Shailene played a teenage cancer patient in The Fault In Our Stars – and Adrift looks set to be this summer’s cinematic hit.Yet even the big-screen treatment could hardly be more dramatic than the true 1,500-mile solo epic that Tami describes in Red Sky In Mourning: A True Story of Love, Loss And Survival At Sea, which will be re-published next month as Adrift.It was September 1983 when the two young sailors embarked on what they imagined to be a routine delivery for the Hazana’s British owners, Peter and Christine Compton.At 34, Richard was more than a decade older than his young American lover, but with his his lapis lazuli eyes, golden hair and ‘exotic’ English accent, he meant everything to her. They had already spent a year and a half together on the Pacific, delivering and mending boats.True, the distance involved in this new mission was vast, yet the pair had few concerns, as Tami later recalled in a series of moving interviews: ‘I’d been sailing blue water for four years. Together we had 50,000 miles of ocean-sailing under our belts. We hugged, laughed, made love and relaxed into 20 days of paradise.’          The couple set off on the 4,000 mile trip on board the Hazana across the Pacific OceanA disastrous reality was less than two weeks away, in the shape of tropical storm Raymond, which ‘tore out of the blue’, hit hurricane force then held its peak intensity for two catastrophic days.It was Richard who spotted a monster wave approaching the Hazana and ordered Tami below deck while he secured himself with a safety harness and tried to keep the vessel afloat.Moments later she heard him scream ‘Oh my God!’ and her world was thrust into darkness.Tossed like a cork on the raging ocean, the yacht had flipped end over end. It was 27 hours before she regained consciousness to an eerie silence and utter devastation. The cabin was half-filled with water, everything inside it smashed or scattered on the floor.Scrambling out onto the deck she looked desperately for Richard but found only wreckage. The boat was all-but destroyed: masts were broken off and the waterlogged sails floated uselessly in the water.Richard’s safety line dangled ominously off the boat. Tami shouted his name over and over again, but found only empty ocean. Richard was nowhere to be seen.

But scientists warned more vents would likely form and disgorge more lava.Hawaii Volcanoes National Park evacuated all visitors and non-emergency staff. The quakes triggered rock slides on park trails and crater walls. Narrow fissures appeared on the ground at a building overlooking the crater at Kilauea\u0027s summit.The University of Hawaii at Hilo and Hawaii Community College both closed campuses and a long stretch of Highway 130, one of the main arteries through Puna, was closed because of the threat of sulfuric gas.Leilani Estates, where lava was pushing through cracks in the earth, has about 1,700 residents and 770 homes.

The collapse caused magma to push more than 10 miles  downslope toward the populated southeast coastline.Residents have faced lava threats before.In 2014, lava burned a house and destroyed a cemetery near the town of Pahoa. Residents were worried it would cover the town\u0027s main road and cut off the community from the rest of the island, but the molten rock stalled.From 1990 through 1991, lava slowly overtook the town of Kalapana, burning homes and covering roads and gardens.Kilauea hasn\u0027t been the kind of volcano that shoots lava from its summit into the sky, causing widespread destruction. It tends to ooze lava from fissures in its sides, which often gives residents at least a few hours\u0027 warning before it reaches their property.In the uncertainty, however, some residents found comfort in the abiding beauty of the Big Island.

Authorities also ordered an evacuation of Lanipuna Gardens, a smaller, more rural subision directly to the east   In this photo released by U.S. Geological Survey, ash plume rises above the Puu Oo crater, on Hawaii\u0027s Kilaueaa Volcano Thursday, May 3, 2018 in Hawaii Volcanoes National Park\u0027There is quite a bit of magma in the system. It won\u0027t be just an hours-long eruption probably, but how long it will last will depend on whether the summit magma reservoir gets involved. And so we are watching that very, very closely,\u0027 Miklius said.After a week of earthquakes, authorities had warned residents to be prepared to evacuate because an eruption would give little warning.Henry Calio said the first sign that something might be wrong happened when cracks emerged in the driveway of his home in Leilani Estates. His wife, Stella, then received a call from an official who told them to get out immediately. They feared they might lose the house.\u0027This is our retirement dream,\u0027 Henry Calio said.  Kilauea\u0027s Puu Oo crater floor began to collapse Monday, triggering the earthquakes and pushing the lava into new underground chambers. The collapse caused magma to push more than 10 miles (16 kilometers) downslope toward the populated southeast coastline of the island Kilauea\u0027s Puu Oo crater floor began to collapse Monday, triggering the earthquakes and pushing the lava into new underground chambers. The collapse caused magma to push more than 10 miles (16 kilometers) downslope toward the populated southeast coastline of the island.The magma later crossed under Highway 130, which leads to a popular volcano access point. Authorities closed the area to visitors and ordered private tour companies to stop taking people into the region.Over the decades, most of Kilauea\u0027s activity has been nonexplosive, but a 1924 eruption spewed ash and 10-ton (9-metric ton) rocks into the sky and killed one person.A 1983 eruption resulted in lava fountains soaring over 1,500 feet (457 meters) into the sky.

The weekend I pasted floral-sprigged Laura Ashley wallpaper upside down.My first love lived in Brixton. My first grown-up dinner party was in Brixton. I’ve just remembered that I once woke to find someone had tried to jemmy open the front windows, and I was once hit about the head at the bus stop opposite Brixton Police Station. But even crime fails to stem my ardour.After the window incident, my late brother turned up unbidden, and slept every night on the floor to keep me and my sister safe.Or maybe I should travel even further back, before I left for London, and make sure I stayed firmly in the town where I was born: Chelmsford in Essex.My dad was born in a nearby village called Terling.

That ancient quince tree, whose fruit my mum turned into jam, is not only still alive, it has exploded into blossom!So the news last week that at least a million fewer people moved house between 2001 and 2011 compared with 1971 to 1981 is heartening. The change might be due to lack of social mobility and housing, or soaring stamp duty rather than not wanting to leave the location of your first kiss, but as someone who has moved house 14 times, that can only be a good thing.Like millions of baby-boomers I was seduced by TV shows such as Location, Location, Location (I actually hired Phil Spencer to find my farm in Somerset) and Grand Designs, and like many ambitious Londoners I thought moving to the country would be a breeze: just like staying in Babington House, but with no checkout time.But moving away from not just friends but the familiar – the florist that did your wedding and your mum’s funeral, the local art-house cinema where you snogged your future husband, even the basement kitchen where you found out he was cheating – is scary.Your past, like a tent caught in a gale, is ripped from its moorings, and disappears. Like many people, I moved house thinking, Ooh, once I’m there, in that dreamy location – I study new houses on Rightmove for hours, Google Earthing them, taking imaginary walks from the door and working out where my furniture will go – I will be happy.It never happens, because you take yourself with you.The most sorted person I know is my best friend. We met when we were 18, and she is still in the same townhouse off Mill Hill Broadway she lived in then. Her daughter was taken home there after she was born. Her mum still lives round the corner, and she sees her every day.Last time I stayed with her, we reminisced about seeing the first Star Wars when it opened on Leicester Square in 1977.I told her daughter, now 21, that her mum hasn’t changed a bit.

But even in London – now, more than ever, a Labour city – the Corbyn revolution is the dog that refused to bark.The party I have worked for all my life catastrophically failed to win targets such as Barnet, where voters, at least in part, turned away from Labour in droves because of the anti-Semitism furore. Outside London the picture was worse, with disastrous performances in Dudley, Derby and elsewhere. Election expert Professor Sir John Curtice pointed out there had actually been a swing to the Conservatives from Labour.Yet according to the leadership’s advance publicity, this was an election in which the Corbyn-supporting Momentum group was supposed to deliver grassroots campaigning and a seismic political breakthrough. How telling that one of Labour’s few success stories, in Plymouth, happened precisely because local activists insisted on running their own campaign and told Momentum to stay away.The lesson to be learned is simple and obvious: Corbyn’s project is leading the party away from victory.            Outside London the picture was worse, with disastrous performances in Dudley, Derby and elsewhereLabour moderates have remained dutifully silent since he unexpectedly won more than 40 per cent of the vote in last year’s General Election. But it’s becoming clear that Theresa May was denied the mandate she sought for a whole host of reasons, not because Corbyn is some sort of modern prophet.Last June some voted for Labour safe in the belief that Corbyn would not be Prime Minister, others because they believed it was their best chance of avoiding a hard Brexit. There were, certainly, some true believers. But it has become increasingly clear that Jeremy’s leadership is going nowhere.Where, for example, is his vision? He could have cauterised the damaging anti-Semitism scandal by exposing it for what it was: the loathsome views of a very small group of far-Left fanatics who joined the party only after he became leader, and expelling those responsible. Instead he has fudged and prevaricated.His policy on the most pressing matter of the day, Brexit, is so vague that even the Shadow Ministers press-ganged to explain it on television and radio tie themselves in knots.And the parliamentary successes Labour has enjoyed in recent months have come because of the hard work and political nous of politicians the Corbynistas hatefully profess to despise as ‘Red Tories’ – backbencher David Lammy shaming the Government over Windrush Margaret Hodge forcing the Government into a U-turn on Commonwealth tax havens Yvette Cooper holding Amber Rudd’s feet to the fire over the ‘hostile environment’ for immigrants, which resulted in her resignation. Keir Starmer and his team are the only reason Labour’s Brexit balancing act has lasted so long.We currently stand at a crossroads in British history, where if Tory hard-Brexit free marketeers have their way, workers’ protections could be shredded, countless jobs lost.This is precisely the moment where the Labour Party should be leading the national debate about our future, but all Corbyn and his acolyte John McDonnell have to offer are ideas that were promoted and rejected in the 1970s and 1980s. I’m not opposed to their ideas of social ownership of water and joint partnerships in rail. But these are not the policies of tomorrow. What does Corbyn’s Labour say to the millions who stand to lose their livelihoods to automation and outsourcing? How will it rejuvenate hollowed-out towns where shops are boarded up? What will it do about our deteriorating public spaces, where shared events and experiences should be enriching all our lives?What, after all, is the point of Labour as a party of principle if it doesn’t make a stand for the people it is elected to represent rather than peddle outmoded political dogma?I was part of a Labour ‘project’ that won three General Elections by appealing to people’s aspirations for a better future, not a return to the past. The lesson then, as now, is Labour can only be politically successful if it creates a clear agenda based on a positive alternative, rather than defining ourselves as being ‘anti’ everybody and everything.The parliamentary party – backbenchers, committee members and Select Committee chairmen – must pick up the cudgel and begin formulating ideas and policies. From among them, a leadership group must be formed from which a genuine alternative can emerge.It won’t be easy. I’ve seen the personal vitriol local activists endure from some Corbyn supporters. I’ve seen the threats of deselection from the likes of Unite’s Len McCluskey. I’ve seen how good Labour MPs are traduced and insulted, and admired the bravery of those who have been vilified for standing up to anti-Semitism.But it’s clear from the council election results that Corbynism is doomed to failure. Rebuilding a new, positive, Labour from the ground up is the only way forward. It’ll take time, which means there’s no time to lose.Whatever your views on Labour, our country and our democracy needs a proper, credible and electable alternative to challenge the Government. A renewed form of moderate New Labour needs to return.  "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/06/02/4BE615F300000578-0-image-m-19_1525568658997.jpg","title":"Photo series shows profiles men Tinder Bumble Happn sunsets backdrops","story":"The project explores human desire, self-perception, and the murky world of data-based love.In it, Middleton is asking the crucial question that bubbles under the surface of today\u0027s cyber-driven relationships: how much does a photo tell us? Who is this person, \u0027the swiped\u0027, who we see as nothing more than a beaming man with a setting sun?\u0027While using the widest search settings possible (on Tinder it was 100 miles max distance, age 18-55+, men) to browse through endless images of men, I noticed a formula for attraction, the most endearing trope of them all, the sunset,\u0027 Middleton told DailyMail.com.\u0027Each guy offered their own version of the same iconic sun. The relationship between the inidual, the sun, and how the two came together to attract the viewer, fascinated me. The project physicalized my overall feeling within today\u0027s culture of dating.\u0027Almost 50 million Americans have used online datings sites or apps, according to a recent survey by eHarmony.Of those, Pew Research found 66 per cent have gone on dates with people they met virtually - a huge leap up from 43 per cent in 2005.However, 33 per cent - approximately 16.5 million - go no further than swiping, messaging, and ultimately sidelining their matches.There are clear caveats. Even now that online dating is so ubiquitous and socially accepted, the chances of bagging a successful relationship remain slim - just 13 per cent of Tinder couples survive a month together.    For women, harassment is another deterrent to following through on a date: 57 per cent of women feel harassed online, including 39 per cent of Tinder users and 38 per cent of OkCupid users. But those factors aren\u0027t slowing down the industry\u0027s resounding boom which is rapidly transforming modern relationships.Taking stock of this dating revolution, Middleton was interested in the way the millions of singles used each app\u0027s strict visual format to sum themselves up.\u0027I\u0027m obsessed with the ways we represent ourselves to others,\u0027 Middleton explained.\u0027How do we curate the digital and physical world around us to represent a body others might desire? How do our choices create behaviors, both inidual and collective, that impact our everyday relations?\u0027Technological platforms, such as Tinder, Bumble, and Happn, offer a sensuality that lacks physicality. The desired body exists on the other end of a screen we touch. We feed ourselves the fantasy of partnering body in a warm sunset as we finger a flat surface and eat a bag of cheetos. Our body takes in an entirely separate reality from our mind and the disconnection causes a split of self.\u0027I believe this splitting has a micro affect on how we relate to each other in the physical world as the space for seeing and being seen has extended beyond our body\u0027s physicality and enabled new potentials for self-performance.\u0027I make work that questions this strange new relationship we have with ourselves and with others.\u0027  \u0027The video \u0027Guys with Sunsets\u0027 is the only interaction I have with these men,\u0027 Middleton said. \u0027It exemplifies the broken relationships we have with each other through our daily digital experiences.\u0027\u0027In the exhibition, a video is displayed in a small space that asks you to lie down and insert only your head. I wanted to cause a gesture that physically separates the head from the body, mentally taking you out of the world around you and into the one I have created for you.\u0027The installation emulates the experience of entering the connected world of our phones, while the sensations of our body in physical space pause and become a literal surface for those around us.\u0027The exhibition took place in the Tribeca neighborhood in Manhattan, New York, on March 24. In a choreography of images, set to Nina Simone\u0027s Either Way I Lose, Middleton playfully remarks on her personal feelings in the digital world of attraction.\u0027Searching for something real in an image-based system can be exhausting,\u0027 Middleton says.\u0027Mostly because our definition of real is continuously in flux.  People who visited the exhibition had to participate with the installation by laying down and sticking only their head in a small room (right) as the video played on loop  The installation (right) purposely detached participants from their body to emulate the artist\u0027s feeling of disconnection as she swiped for love with her body behind the confines of a screen\u0027As a member of this developing visual culture I find myself in a constant state of foreign and familiar. Both feelings happen simultaneously as I find difficulty in identifying the difference between the digital and physical worlds. \u0027The two worlds migrate closer to one another, within one another, on top of each other. Soon the sensation of difference will be gone and the rules of performance anew.\u0027Apps presented a new physicality of human desire. A longing funneled into a digital dating game. Their algorithms have presented a new data-based method for understanding relations and offer a distance between both the swiper and the swiped that turns another human into nothing more than an image of an idea.

Andy Perry is believed to be the first Brit to lose an entire leg from a spider bite, after he almost died when the creature sank its fangs into his ankleAfter numerous appointments with specialists Andy opted for an elective amputation above his right knee, which was carried out in March.He has now been left wheel-chair bound, unable to work or play with his children and needs daily treatment.Andy, of Huncote, Leicestershire, who lives with his police officer wife Christine, 39, said: \u0027I was doing a quote for a job in 2015 and I was coming home at lunchtime to look after the kids because my wife was on shift.\u0027But within a couple of hours I started feeling really poorly. I rang the missus to see if she could come home but she couldn\u0027t and the next I know I got a massive ache in the small of my back.\u0027That was pretty much me done then and Christine came back home when I called her again.          Mr Perry\u0027s leg is pictured three weeks before the amputation. He said the pain was so severe he considered sawing it off \u0027I went to bed when she got back, pretty much for the whole weekend and I was throwing up.\u0027Then on the Sunday morning it was a question of having to get over to the hospital as soon as I could.\u0027I was seen by a doctor in the Royal Leicester Infirmary Triage and he said there was no chance of me going home.\u0027Then he admitted me straight away, the ache in my back was the kidney\u0027s packing up from the infection and sepsis. I put on a IV anti-biotic and almost died because of the sepsis.\u0027US surgeons could save this little girl\u0027s leg... so why did...Woman, 26, has her right leg AMPUTATED after suffering a...Share this articleExperts believed the false widow spider was to blame after daily blood test when a phlebotomist noticed two puncture marks on Andy\u0027s ankle.The doctor in charge deemed the bite to be from the false widow spider - as its bite has similar effects that Andy was experiencing.\u0027It was the phlebotomist who did my daily blood test - he spotted these little puncture marks on my ankle,\u0027 he added.\u0027He said it looks like a spider bite, they then got the doctor in charge to have look and that\u0027s what they came to agreement on.          Mr Perry\u0027s leg is pictured following the amputation he was forced to undergo when the spider bit his ankle \u0027They came to a conclusion it was a false widow spider because it has a reputation of biting people.\u0027The puncture marks were just above the sock line because I used to wear socks and boots.\u0027The only thing we can think of is that I literally just brushed past it and its had a quick bite as I\u0027ve gone past.\u0027Apparently the bite of the false widow feels like a bee sting but I didn\u0027t feel a thing. The spiders are an awful lot more common than people think.\u0027After they sorted out the kidney function, things started improving and the sepsis was beaten by the anti-biotics.          Mr Perry (pictured before the bite with his son Tom) is believed to be the first Brit to have a leg amputated due to a false widow bite\u0027I\u0027ve had the district nurses coming around for the next three months changing the dressing on my leg every day.\u0027The lymphedema caused the leg to swell to the point where the skin split and fell off.\u0027That was all just a massive open weeping sores and blisters and just generally horribleness.\u0027And that was it, the leg was all but useless from that point, I spent a certain amount of time trying to get treatment.\u0027There just wasn\u0027t a surgeon nearby who wanted to touch it because of the lymphedema as it was a live infection.\u0027So without getting any treatment I just couldn\u0027t work - so I figured I would go down the route of elective amputation in a last desperate attempt to get back to work.          Andy had no idea he had been bitten by Britain\u0027s most venomous spider until he was rushed to hospital suffering from sepsis and kidney failure\u0027But again trying to find a doctor or surgeon to look at the amputation was hard.\u0027Eventually I had to threaten my GP with cutting my own leg off with a blade from a chainsaw because I was getting so desperate.\u0027Out of that I tried a guy in Coventry who climbed on board straight away as soon as he saw the leg.\u0027I spent 20 minutes talking to him, needed a second opinion and spoke to prosthetic people and as soon as that was done it was all agreed.\u0027The leg was cut of on March 13 of this year, it should\u0027ve been healed by now but I got a secondary infection so I was back in surgery on April 27.\u0027I\u0027ve now got a vacuum dressing on me which pulls all of the gulp out of the leg and takes it away.          The father-of-two has spoken of his horror after he fell seriously ill after being bitten by a false widow spider\u0027The plan is to rehabilitate the leg, get a prosthetic and get back to work for this year or next.\u0027I had been a landscaper for about five years prior to the bite and I had a good business going on but now its all gone.\u0027We\u0027ve been living off my wife\u0027s salary - I have got zero income because of this bite.\u0027Andy is now hoping to get help to fix up his garden so he can play with his children Thomas, 8, and George, 5.He added: \u0027They\u0027ve been brilliant, they\u0027ve taken it in their stride, we have explained every single thing about whats happened all the way along. I can\u0027t use the garden, I\u0027m just complete and utterly stuck\u0027I\u0027ve been looking for help with my new project which is sorting out his garden to make it more wheelchair friendly.

She said that what she really wants is for the president to resign           WHAT\u0027S THAT?: The president indicated Saturday that he couldn\u0027t hear reporters\u0027 questions over the roar of Marine One as he returned to the White House from an Ohio trip. He did not stop to chat with them about the Daniels hush-money paymentGiuliani claimed he\u0027s \u0027not really involved\u0027 in the Daniels case, despite making multiple television appearances to talk about it, and that he doesn\u0027t know and doesn\u0027t care when Trump first learned that Daniels wanted money to keep quiet about an affair she claims they had. The former New York City mayor was the person who made the bombshell claim that Trump reimbursed his former attorney, Michael Cohen, the $130,000 that Daniels received as a payoff. He said Sunday that he\u0027s still working out the facts of when exactly Trump knew what the $35,000-a-month retained he was paying Michael Cohen was funding after claiming days ago that it was sometime in April.\u0027It could have been recently, it could have been a while back. Those are the facts that we’re still working on,\u0027 Giuliani said. \u0027And that -- you know, may be in a little bit of dispute. This is more rumor than it is anything else.\u0027The facts of the matter are under dispute in no small part because of Giuliani\u0027s claims last week about what Trump knew and when he knew it.\u0027I don\u0027t think the president realized he paid him back for that specific thing until we made him aware of the paperwork,\u0027 Giuliani said Thursday.He told NBC News that Trump responded, \u0027Oh my goodness, I guess that\u0027s what it was for.\u0027  Trump personally distanced himself from his lawyer\u0027s statements on Friday, claiming that Giuliani had only just come aboard and was operating without all of the relevant information.\u0027When Rudy made the statement — Rudy is great — but Rudy had just started, and he wasn’t totally familiar with every — you know, with everything,\u0027 Trump said. \u0027And Rudy — we love Rudy, he’s a special guy.\u0027 Hours later, Giuliani released a statement that admitting that he had made incorrect statements.\u0027My references to timing were not describing my understanding of the President\u0027s knowledge, but instead, my understanding of these matters,\u0027 he offered.Giuliani also said his suggestion that Cohen paid off Daniels to boost Trump\u0027s election odds was wrong.   \u0027There is no campaign violation,\u0027 he said. \u0027The payment was made to resolve a personal and false allegation in order to protect the President\u0027s family. It would have been done in any event, whether he was a candidate or not.\u0027 Legal experts roundly rebuked Giuliani on Sunday for the bumbling performance. Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff, a former U.S. attorney, told CNN that Giuliani said things last week that were \u0027deeply hurtful of the president\u0027s case\u0027 that he did not obstruct justice when he fired former FBI Director James Comey, as well as other matters.Giuliani had previously blasted Avenatti and his client as \u0027stick-up artists\u0027 looking for a seven-figure payday.He told \u0027Fox \u0026amp Friends\u0027 that Avenatti had approached MSNBC with an idea for a legal program starring himself and remarked: \u0027The TV show he could get is – well, Ambulance Chaser.\u0027 Giuliani said in a Saturday evening appearance on Fox News that his star client ‘says he still loves me’ even though he inadvertently put him in legal jeopardy with a claim that the payment was made with the 2016 election in mind.He attempted to use that interview, and the one on ABC this morning, to narrow his role to the special counsel investigation into alleged collusion and obstruction of justice. Giuliani on Saturday caled called on Attorney General Jeff Sessions to end the Mueller investigation into alleged collusion with Russia.He also slammed the Justice Department for what he perceives as giving Hillary Clinton preferential treatment during her investigation - unlike Trump and his associates. The statements by Giuliani this week contradicted longstanding positions of Trump and the White House, who have claimed for weeks that the president had no knowledge of the payment.

Daniels, real name Stephanie Clifford, says she was paid $130,000 by Trump to keep quiet over their alleged affair during the presidential campaignGiuliani said the President was surprised when he learned what the money had been used for and approved Giuliani\u0027s decision to go public with the reimbursement, which he did while speaking to Sean Hannity on Fox News on Wednesday night.\u0027You\u0027re not going to see daylight between the president and me,\u0027 he told NBC. \u0027We\u0027re going to work hard to have a consistent strategy.\u0027Trump may now be vulnerable to criminal liability over undisclosed payments as well as possible violations of campaign finance laws.When asked if Trump was angry with him, Giuliani told The Washington Post on Friday: ‘He says he loves me.’Giuliani and Trump continue to have a strong relationship.It has been reported in the Post that the two men are still coordinating their legal strategy as Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation continues apace.Trump and Giuliani are planning strategy without bothering to consult or inform members of the White House communications team, the Post reported. Meanwhile, it was reported on Saturday that Trump knew about Cohen\u0027s hush money payment to Daniels several months before he denied any knowledge of it in April, according to two people familiar with the arrangement.          Michael Cohen, Trump\u0027s long-term private attorney, is being investigated for fraud and campaign finance breaches over the alleged payment to Daniels, it is understood          Mueller\u0027s team is understood to have raised the prospect of forcing Trump to answer questions in the Russia probe, though it is unclear how serious the threat wasThe insiders told The New York Times they were unsure exactly when Trump learned about the money transfer - intended to stop Daniels discussing their alleged affair - but he knew about it by the time he made his denial in April.Daniels, real name Stephanie Clifford, signed a nondisclosure agreement with Cohen several days before the presidential election. The porn star has now sued to have it made invalid because Trump never signed it himself. The lawsuit has now spiraled into questions about whether the payment made to secure Daniels\u0027 silence violated campaign laws, as could be the case if the money was sent with Trump\u0027s knowledge or to benefit his run for president.If this was the case then it should have been declared, according to legal experts. Cohen has insisted he paid the money out of his own pocket without the then candidate\u0027s knowledge. Trump, meanwhile, has denied the affair and insisted the agreement was organized by Cohen to prevent embarrassment to his family, not to help his presidential bid.Asked why Cohen had made the payment on Air Force One in April, he replied: \u0027You\u0027ll have to ask Michael Cohen.

It was then used for storing meteorological records and artists and school groups visited until it was turned into a private residence in the 1980s.The current owners bought it in 2004 and transformed it from the basic accommodation it had been over just the bottom two floors, into the stunning five-storey property it is now.It has 1,216 sq ft of accommodation with two bedrooms and two bathrooms on the ground and first floor and the kitchendiner and lounge on the second and third floors to take advantage of the views.On the fourth floor is the observation deck, which the estate agents describe as \u0027one of the most incredible rooms anywhere in Cornwall\u0027.          On the ground floor of the building there is a useful wet room with modern appliances, shower, loo, sink and modern tiling          There is also a camera obscura in the observatory deck, effectively turning the room into a pinhole camera and projecting the beautiful panoramic views onto a table          The comfortable lounge one floor below the observatory deck affords the inhabitants ample living space and yet more sumptuous viewsIt has windows on all eight walls offering a genuine 360-degree view across Falmouth, the surrounding countryside and coastline, including Falmouth Bay, and across to the Roseland Peninsula, with St Mawes and Pendennis Castles easily seen and lit at night.The room has an oak panelled vaulted roof space leading up to the camera obscura at the apex, which was constructed in the 1950s.It converts the whole room into a pinhole camera when the black-out blinds are drawn and it rotates, allowing the panoramic views to be projected as an image on a table in the observation deck.The owners have recently run the property as a holiday rental and are prepared to sell it with ongoing bookings and its website if the buyer wanted to continue this.All the furniture, linen, cutlery and crockery, light fittings, blinds and artwork are available by separate negotiation.Ian Lillicrap from Lillicrap Chilcott said: \u0027I\u0027ve been an estate agent in Cornwall for 39 years and I can honestly say it\u0027s the most unusual property I have ever dealt with.          The house also features a light and bright compact kitchen with 360 degree windows offering light from every angle around          The house only features two bedrooms in total but they are modern and bright throughout - with the house having been recently renovated          The house\u0027s floorplan shows the unusual layout in more detail - as it is split over five floors but only offers around 113 square meters in living space\u0027And the views from the upper floors and the top are the most spectacular I have ever seen.\u0027It\u0027s like being in a helicopter above Falmouth when you reach the top. It just completely takes your breath away.\u0027It\u0027s glazed on all sides so you get a 360-degree view over Falmouth and for miles surrounding.\u0027It is the sort of vista you just never see.\u0027It\u0027s a well-worn phrase but it truly is a once in a lifetime opportunity.\u0027The craftmanship in this property is spectacular.

The owners have the most incredible eye for detail.\u0027It\u0027s not huge so I don\u0027t think it will sell as a main home but it would be an absolutely prized second home for someone or it could be someone who wants to use it for lettings.\u0027I don\u0027t believe there is anything else resembling it in Cornwall.

But scientists warned more vents would likely form and disgorge more lava.Hawaii Volcanoes National Park evacuated all visitors and non-emergency staff. The quakes triggered rock slides on park trails and crater walls.

Activity picked up earlier this week, indicating a possible new lava outbreak.The crater floor began to collapse Monday, triggering earthquakes and pushing the lava into new underground chambers. The collapse caused magma to push more than 10 miles  downslope toward the populated southeast coastline.Residents have faced lava threats before.In 2014, lava burned a house and destroyed a cemetery near the town of Pahoa. Residents were worried it would cover the town\u0027s main road and cut off the community from the rest of the island, but the molten rock stalled.From 1990 through 1991, lava slowly overtook the town of Kalapana, burning homes and covering roads and gardens.Kilauea hasn\u0027t been the kind of volcano that shoots lava from its summit into the sky, causing widespread destruction. It tends to ooze lava from fissures in its sides, which often gives residents at least a few hours\u0027 warning before it reaches their property.In the uncertainty, however, some residents found comfort in the abiding beauty of the Big Island.

It won\u0027t be just an hours-long eruption probably, but how long it will last will depend on whether the summit magma reservoir gets involved. And so we are watching that very, very closely,\u0027 Miklius said.After a week of earthquakes, authorities had warned residents to be prepared to evacuate because an eruption would give little warning.Henry Calio said the first sign that something might be wrong happened when cracks emerged in the driveway of his home in Leilani Estates.

Kilauea\u0027s Puu Oo crater floor began to collapse Monday, triggering the earthquakes and pushing the lava into new underground chambers.

The collapse caused magma to push more than 10 miles (16 kilometers) downslope toward the populated southeast coastline of the island.The magma later crossed under Highway 130, which leads to a popular volcano access point.

The weekend I pasted floral-sprigged Laura Ashley wallpaper upside down.My first love lived in Brixton. My first grown-up dinner party was in Brixton. I’ve just remembered that I once woke to find someone had tried to jemmy open the front windows, and I was once hit about the head at the bus stop opposite Brixton Police Station. But even crime fails to stem my ardour.After the window incident, my late brother turned up unbidden, and slept every night on the floor to keep me and my sister safe.Or maybe I should travel even further back, before I left for London, and make sure I stayed firmly in the town where I was born: Chelmsford in Essex.My dad was born in a nearby village called Terling. I went back for a story not long ago. As I walked down the High Street – now pedestrianised, littered with artisanal street food stalls when in the 1970s there was only a Wimpy – I was reminded by the Odeon cinema (now a nightclub) of seeing The Towering Inferno with my friend Sarah: my love for Paul Newman surged afresh at the memory. Yikes!LIZ JONES\u0027S DIARY: In which love doesn¿t last but my woes doThe Mail on Sunday is crowned Sunday newspaper of the...Share this articleThe last time I stepped inside the department store (it used to be Bonds but is now Debenhams), my parents were still out there in the world, alive: cooking, weeding, trying to make my brothers get a haircut.I couldn’t help feeling that if I still lived there, my parents would be around me: that lawn my dad slaved over, it’s still green and the moles still rampant. That ancient quince tree, whose fruit my mum turned into jam, is not only still alive, it has exploded into blossom!So the news last week that at least a million fewer people moved house between 2001 and 2011 compared with 1971 to 1981 is heartening. The change might be due to lack of social mobility and housing, or soaring stamp duty rather than not wanting to leave the location of your first kiss, but as someone who has moved house 14 times, that can only be a good thing.Like millions of baby-boomers I was seduced by TV shows such as Location, Location, Location (I actually hired Phil Spencer to find my farm in Somerset) and Grand Designs, and like many ambitious Londoners I thought moving to the country would be a breeze: just like staying in Babington House, but with no checkout time.But moving away from not just friends but the familiar – the florist that did your wedding and your mum’s funeral, the local art-house cinema where you snogged your future husband, even the basement kitchen where you found out he was cheating – is scary.Your past, like a tent caught in a gale, is ripped from its moorings, and disappears. Like many people, I moved house thinking, Ooh, once I’m there, in that dreamy location – I study new houses on Rightmove for hours, Google Earthing them, taking imaginary walks from the door and working out where my furniture will go – I will be happy.It never happens, because you take yourself with you.The most sorted person I know is my best friend. We met when we were 18, and she is still in the same townhouse off Mill Hill Broadway she lived in then. Her daughter was taken home there after she was born. Her mum still lives round the corner, and she sees her every day.Last time I stayed with her, we reminisced about seeing the first Star Wars when it opened on Leicester Square in 1977.I told her daughter, now 21, that her mum hasn’t changed a bit. Her hair is the same. Her mannerisms. Her face. But, most importantly, her house."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/06/02/4BE643A900000578-0-image-a-23_1525569571366.jpg","title":"Dog appears frozen stiff vets examination table","story":"    In a clip shared by Arizona native Joshua Snelling, his dog can be seen completely frozen on a examination table          \u0027This is my dog at the vet, this is what he does... he\u0027s scared as hell,\u0027 Snelling can be heard saying in the video          Snelling, a railway engineer based out Phoenix, says that it\u0027s the \u0027weirdest thing\u0027 while his dog appears frozen in motion"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/06/01/4BD7D11400000578-5695503-Outside_London_the_picture_was_worse_with_disastrous_performance-m-4_1525567421425.jpg","title":"Now no doubt Corbyn got prayer says LORD BLUNKETT","story":"      Jeremy Corbyn and the Labour party missed an opportunity to seize key Conservative-held London boroughsCertainly they will never have a better opportunity. The internal Tory civil war over Brexit, the Windrush scandal and the breast-screening fiasco all resonate deeply in the capital. But even in London – now, more than ever, a Labour city – the Corbyn revolution is the dog that refused to bark.The party I have worked for all my life catastrophically failed to win targets such as Barnet, where voters, at least in part, turned away from Labour in droves because of the anti-Semitism furore. Outside London the picture was worse, with disastrous performances in Dudley, Derby and elsewhere. Election expert Professor Sir John Curtice pointed out there had actually been a swing to the Conservatives from Labour.Yet according to the leadership’s advance publicity, this was an election in which the Corbyn-supporting Momentum group was supposed to deliver grassroots campaigning and a seismic political breakthrough. How telling that one of Labour’s few success stories, in Plymouth, happened precisely because local activists insisted on running their own campaign and told Momentum to stay away.The lesson to be learned is simple and obvious: Corbyn’s project is leading the party away from victory.            Outside London the picture was worse, with disastrous performances in Dudley, Derby and elsewhereLabour moderates have remained dutifully silent since he unexpectedly won more than 40 per cent of the vote in last year’s General Election. But it’s becoming clear that Theresa May was denied the mandate she sought for a whole host of reasons, not because Corbyn is some sort of modern prophet.Last June some voted for Labour safe in the belief that Corbyn would not be Prime Minister, others because they believed it was their best chance of avoiding a hard Brexit. There were, certainly, some true believers. But it has become increasingly clear that Jeremy’s leadership is going nowhere.Where, for example, is his vision? He could have cauterised the damaging anti-Semitism scandal by exposing it for what it was: the loathsome views of a very small group of far-Left fanatics who joined the party only after he became leader, and expelling those responsible. Instead he has fudged and prevaricated.His policy on the most pressing matter of the day, Brexit, is so vague that even the Shadow Ministers press-ganged to explain it on television and radio tie themselves in knots.And the parliamentary successes Labour has enjoyed in recent months have come because of the hard work and political nous of politicians the Corbynistas hatefully profess to despise as ‘Red Tories’ – backbencher David Lammy shaming the Government over Windrush Margaret Hodge forcing the Government into a U-turn on Commonwealth tax havens Yvette Cooper holding Amber Rudd’s feet to the fire over the ‘hostile environment’ for immigrants, which resulted in her resignation. Keir Starmer and his team are the only reason Labour’s Brexit balancing act has lasted so long.We currently stand at a crossroads in British history, where if Tory hard-Brexit free marketeers have their way, workers’ protections could be shredded, countless jobs lost.This is precisely the moment where the Labour Party should be leading the national debate about our future, but all Corbyn and his acolyte John McDonnell have to offer are ideas that were promoted and rejected in the 1970s and 1980s. I’m not opposed to their ideas of social ownership of water and joint partnerships in rail. But these are not the policies of tomorrow. What does Corbyn’s Labour say to the millions who stand to lose their livelihoods to automation and outsourcing? How will it rejuvenate hollowed-out towns where shops are boarded up? What will it do about our deteriorating public spaces, where shared events and experiences should be enriching all our lives?What, after all, is the point of Labour as a party of principle if it doesn’t make a stand for the people it is elected to represent rather than peddle outmoded political dogma?I was part of a Labour ‘project’ that won three General Elections by appealing to people’s aspirations for a better future, not a return to the past. The lesson then, as now, is Labour can only be politically successful if it creates a clear agenda based on a positive alternative, rather than defining ourselves as being ‘anti’ everybody and everything.The parliamentary party – backbenchers, committee members and Select Committee chairmen – must pick up the cudgel and begin formulating ideas and policies. From among them, a leadership group must be formed from which a genuine alternative can emerge.It won’t be easy. I’ve seen the personal vitriol local activists endure from some Corbyn supporters. I’ve seen the threats of deselection from the likes of Unite’s Len McCluskey. I’ve seen how good Labour MPs are traduced and insulted, and admired the bravery of those who have been vilified for standing up to anti-Semitism.But it’s clear from the council election results that Corbynism is doomed to failure. Rebuilding a new, positive, Labour from the ground up is the only way forward. It’ll take time, which means there’s no time to lose.Whatever your views on Labour, our country and our democracy needs a proper, credible and electable alternative to challenge the Government. A renewed form of moderate New Labour needs to return.  "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/06/15/4BE5883B00000578-5696311-The_tour_at_the_contemporary_art_museum_was_attended_by_around_1-a-1_1525617711763.jpg","title":"Nudists descend Paris museum gallery city","story":"    The Palais de Tokyo museum in Paris opened its doors for the first time to nudist visitors on Saturday - giving them special visiting hours to tour an exhibit in a one-off naturist event          The tour at the contemporary art museum was attended by around 160 visitors - and sold out in under two days.

The black circles – obliterating the entire face of a farmer in North Dakota, the right eye of a woman in Arkansas, or resembling an eclipsed sun hanging in the sky over labourers in Maryland – were created when the negatives were censored in the 1930s by clipping them with a metal punch.Many of the 175,000 photographs in the Farm Security Association archive became defining images of the Great Depression, including Evans’s gaunt sharecropper families, Lange’s portraits of farm women with nothing left except willpower, and Arthur Rothstein’s Fleeing a Dust Storm, a surreal scene of a family fighting to keep their feet in the wind that has already ripped their farm buildings to shreds.However, thousands more images were censored, judged not to meet the strict criteria the photographers had been given for the type of images sought – a tricky brief to show the scale of the problem the association was trying to tackle, but without obliterating all hope. The negatives were mutilated – occasionally several holes were punched to prevent the image being used even in cropped form – but not completely destroyed. The censored and approved images all ended up archived in the Library of Congress, where they have recently been digitised. Nayia Yiakoumaki, the curator of Killed Negatives, spent weeks poring over thumbnail images to choose the 80 photographs in the exhibition. “They were so wonderful,” she said. “It was an almost impossible task, there were thousands I could have used.“I was astonished when I learned of the existence of the rejected negatives. These are photographers and images that I have studied and taught, but I had not realised that the images we know so well were only part of a much larger story.”The images all date from a pioneering project by the FSA, which in the 1930s sent photographers out into fields, homesteads, villages and small towns across America to record the farming communities being ground down by the Great Depression and the efforts being made by the FSA to help them.Although the images often appear as spontaneous photojournalism, the photographers were actually working to a very tight brief, and were given detailed information in advance about their subjects. The briefing note recorded that Steve Doty, of Tangipahoa Parish, whose mule had died and who received a temporary loan for fertiliser for his strawberry crop, had “built a one-room log hut for his family to live in. The cracks have been stuffed with newspapers. Two of his children are in school and the two youngest ones are at home.” A widow and eight children were left destitute when a man died of cerebral cancer after months getting lifts as a charity case for hospital treatment. The youngest child was under three, and 15-year-old Angelina had been left totally blind by typhoid. The 17-year-old daughter, Elizabeth, was the only one able to work, “being able to sew and do canning work very well”. In many cases the contrast between the immaculately turned out people and the shabby surroundings shows clearly that the photographer’s visit was expected and prepared for, but any images that looked too staged were rejected, as were those showing FSA officials.All the photographers sent back their rolls of film to the project director, Roy Stryker, an economist but a photographer himself, who had the approved images printed in his laboratories. Yiakoumaki can see why some images, slightly out of focus, poorly composed or showing the photographer reflected in a window, were rejected – but she can only guess at others. Did the striking black couple photographed by Walker Evans in New York look too smart, confident and urban? Was the group dancing in a circle, described by the photographer Carl Mydans as “healthy children in clean backyard”, just too healthy and too white? And the same photographer’s pair of black children, sitting in a litter-strewn yard in front of a decaying shack, “such is the front yard available to these two youngsters to play in”, too desperate and too black?“These photographs stand as beautiful images in their own right,” Yiakoumaki said, “but the intervention, the very act of destruction has made them into something more, objects which can be seen as works of contemporary art.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ef1f47ea20d70bf7c20eacd1e23c859586780fd8/0_147_4688_2812/master/4688.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6bd1899c14fe0628654ad6fc240f882a","title":"windrush portrait of a generation in pictures","story":"Next month marks the 70th anniversary of the arrival of Empire Windrush and the beginnings of Britain’s first Caribbean communities, now in the news following scandalous treatment by the Home Office.

The journey of the Saltwater people of the Gold Coast as documented by photographer David Kelly and narrated by Ben Allmon by Ben Allmon and David Kelly“A land bridge connected Minjerribah (Stradbroke Island) to Kombumerri country (Southport) and Goories also came in canoes to Minjerribah trading bunya for eugarie, amongst other things.” – History Life and Times of Robert Anderson, Gheebelum, Ngugi, MulgumpinReading this four years ago, I realised I knew nothing of the Indigenous history of my home on the Gold Coast – the land of the Saltwater people. I felt a responsibility to my young son to learn the story of the place we live, so that when he grew up I could teach it to him.But who was going to teach me? So I embarked on a voyage of discovery that carried me further than I ever expected, into a cultural story that is rarely offered to outsiders. What started as an attempt to educate myself became something far bigger – The Saltwater Story.Anderson’s account gave me an idea – why not make canoes and re-establish these ancient routes of connection? The Bundjalung, Yugambeh and Quandamooka were accomplished seafarers with complex maritime routes plied by bark and dugout canoe (gundal) – the former for short trips, the latter for longer voyages like the one described in Anderson’s book. The bark canoe in particular illustrates how to sustainably take what you need from your environment – the bark is removed but the tree remains alive and over time new bark grows. Very few still possess this knowledge – thanks to veteran paddler Mark Matthews I met Bundjalung canoemaker Kyle Slabb, who does. We quickly realised that this was more than just an opportunity for a whitefella to engage and educate himself – it was a chance to ensure cultural continuity in the next generation of Saltwater people. We decided to document the experience in a film, a book and an exhibit of David’s amazing photographs. As it happens, there was a suitable bark canoe tree in my backyard but the year was too dry to make a viable gundal. Nevertheless, Kyle’s demonstration of the crafting techniques to the younger generation was invaluable. We then made dugouts from hoop pine and paulownia the latter wood repels seawater, which prevents it from becoming waterlogged. Even when the temperature rose to 45 degrees, the young mob were interested in chipping in with (and away at) the canoe.We departed from the middle of Surfers Paradise on Australia Day weekend, surrounded by huge modern vessels and glittering towers. Maori, Dragonboaters and the general boating community joined us on the first leg in a wonderful flotilla – a celebration of all maritime histories in this country.Over the next three days and 70km through shark-infested waters we watched the young men grow into their roles, assume the mantle of leadership for the voyage. When we reached Dunwich (Goompi), a lot of the Quandamooka welcomed us. It was an emotional experience for many, especially as Robert Anderson himself, 88, was the elder who welcomed the paddlers … and with whom we exchanged bunya for eugarie. It had been 150 years since this journey had been made. There is talk now all along the Sea Eagle songline of canoe making, of connecting through the canoe over the saltwater again.So what will I tell my son? A story of connection – between the Saltwater people, between generations, between black and white, between land, sea and sky. A story of collaboration – whether it is made from bark or dugout, no one makes a canoe alone.A story of co-operation – paddlers working together to get to their destination, through rough seas and shark-infested waters.A story of continuance – of ancient knowledge held by just a few, of ensuring that tomorrow’s elders are brought along for the journey today. That is the Saltwater stories"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a7c266d14e2297b0c07fc37fde6de25f2f5a313d/0_588_7284_4371/master/7284.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=be37a347e693bbb3ed2ac30dcf3a043c","title":"may bank holiday sun heats up sales of paddling pools and garden gnomes","story":"Stores pack shelves for boom in sales of ice-cream, rosé wine, BBQ staples and garden ornamentsRetailers and garden centres have enjoyed a much-needed boost from what is set to be the hottest early May bank holiday on record, packing the shelves with ice-cream, barbecue food, paddling pools and plants as shoppers got their first real taste of summer.Sainsbury’s said: “This scorcher of a bank holiday is set to be the first proper barbecue weekend of the year. We’re predicting that our ice-cream, gin and Taste of Summer barbecue staples will be real sizzlers – not to mention suncream flying off the shelves as we all head outdoors to soak up the rays.”DIY retailer B\u0026ampQ said that each of its flagship stores is likely to sell well over 100 barbecues, 3,000 bags of compost, 6,000 bedding plants, 150 mowers and 125 fence panels over the weekend.“At this time of year especially, customers do respond to the weather. We tend to see a change in the type of projects they do,” said Steve Guy, B\u0026ampQ’s market director for outdoor. We look at the weather forecast for the next 14 days and make trading and stock decisions on a daily basis.”“It’s no surprise that herbs are the must-have plant of the season they’re fragrant, look great and are the perfect addition to summer BBQs for both drinks and dining,” said Lilidh Matthews, herb buyer at Wyevale Garden Centres. “They also thrive in small spaces, and are an increasingly popular addition for city balconies and kitchen windowsills alike.” Diane Wehrle, marketing and insights director at Springboard, said garden and DIY-related goods were likely to fare well because it was the first opportunity for keen gardeners to get out planting and tidying-up after weeks of poor weather.“Anything related to the garden is likely to do well after such a poor Easter. People will use the opportunity to get out and do work in the garden and in the home. And of course fashion should benefit as people will want to replenish their wardrobe as the first signs of spring and summer emerge.”Well-stocked smaller convenience stores were expected to be among the bank holiday winners, according to analysts at research firm Kantar Worldpanel.“Whenever the mercury rises people swiftly move away from traditional meals and start focusing on the barbecue,” said Fraser McKevitt, Kantar’s head of retail and consumer insight. “In the interests of maximising their exposure to the sunshine consumers are also much more likely to shop locally rather than travel longer distances to bigger stores, so the retailers who’ve stocked up on sausages and burgers in their convenience outlets should perform well this weekend.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/446013b2d2bbf76ae9a2a5a09551c502369b63b6/0_0_4163_2498/master/4163.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b11ab9017cb435a525978913a789e7d5","title":"colour guardian masthead opinion tabloid redesign","story":"A newspaper’s masthead is many things – flag, signature, capstone, brand and a thread through history. When the  of the Berliner format (12 September 2005 – 13 January 2018) was being refashioned into the  tabloid of today, intense attention was given to the masthead.Its award-winning typeface is bespoke, with the designers aiming to communicate “confidence and strength”. The editor-in-chief, Katharine Viner, told me she wanted “a masthead with capital letters to signify a serious intent. I felt the lowercase T and G didn’t quite fit the mood of these serious times.”Initial reader reaction was mixed: “At long last … the return of the capital T in The and the capital G in ” “the typeface and the two-line arrangement feel less authoritative, too much thick-thin contrast” “the masthead is not yet sufficiently distinctive to stand out on the newsstand”. One devoted reader confessed that she had taken to rearranging the papers at her local Waitrose to ensure that the  was properly displayed. The fondness expressed for the old masthead will make one of my predecessors smile. After the Berliner’s debut, Ian Mayes reported readers’ “anxieties” about the masthead had manifested “in the form of an accusation that the background colour – blue – made it appear that the  was waving a banner for the Tory party.”At first I too missed the lowercase, sans-serif white type on blue background, until it dawned that this flag combination, this visual branding, has been comprehensively appropriated by one of the great disruptors of our era, Facebook.Taking the new masthead on its own terms, I have come to admire it, especially because of the way the front page has been evolving with it, in both design and\u0026nbspcolour.To my eye, the two decks of type and the position chosen for the The above the letters of  create an elegant slope to a sort of summit atop the h. It aspires, like all serious journalism should. The e curls to greet the ascender of the d below it. The prominent serifs connect the refreshed  with long-serving mastheads from its almost 200-year past.The significance of the connection was driven home at a recent exhibition in the Design Museum of London which told the story of the latest  redesign. Among the old front pages, trial-and-error samplings and typographical details was a caption which quietly challenged anyone who thinks of media as linear: “… for the first time the look of the newspaper is being determined by its digital counterpart. Infographics, large images and a high-contrast typeface – features which are usually seen online – are now being used in the printed newspaper. These design decisions indicate that digital media is revolutionising the way that we consume information both on and off the screen.” Viner and the leader of the designers, Alex Breuer, pointed out to me that the two decks are necessary to make the whole page versatile. Placed together on the same level, the two words  can dominate the tabloid-size page and restrict layout options.A fine example of the flexibility that the chosen masthead offers was the front page on 18 April. It launched the collaboration among several journalism organisations to continue the investigations by Maltese reporter Daphne Caruana Galizia, murdered last year. In white type on a mournful black background, the masthead was a band about two-thirds down page one. Above were a large portrait of Daphne, a headline in black on yellow, and the start of a special report which continued inside the paper. Under the band, at the foot of page one, was another disclosure in the Windrush scandal, and a pointer to more on page two about the Cambridge AnalyticaFacebook data harvesting. This combination of powerful design and powerful journalism is to be savoured.Use of colour has increased visibility on newsstands since the period in January when the masthead was black on a white background, like most of the competition. Now, black masthead type on a light-blue background, in either a narrow or a deep band, regularly appears Mondays to Thursdays. White type on cherry red denotes Fridays. On Saturdays, when the paper has a lot of supplements to shout about, a deep band of magenta, or pink, or deep blue might form the background and the type will be white. An exception was 14 April, when the type was black on a yellow background.I favour this search for a vocabulary of colour in print. It is a successful feature of the ’s digital presences. But tastes differ, of course, and the colours have provoked criticism too – “garish” and “the Gawdy’un” are examples from readers.The salmon-pinkish tint of the Journal pages – praised for their content and design – is a problem for readers with visual impairment. Ian Mayes received the same message in 2005 as I have lately: “Readers with degrees of colour-blindness or poor sight urged caution in the use of text laid on tints, to ensure that enough tonal contrast remained for the text to be clearly legible.”The demographic of the newspaper audience leans older, as it were, and\u0026nbspthe\u0026nbspfeedback to this redesign indicates clearly that the issue is a matter of practical importance to many loyal  readers. I have asked the decision-makers to revisit it.• Paul Chadwick is the ’s readers’ editor"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1e796af77d49acc2154c412adb9c1d90cc22aa28/220_198_2937_1762/master/2937.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6760a068f5906fc8a554e8f0479781ff","title":"tories peak corbyn local election results","story":"The only certainty in contemporary politics is volatility. That is the fundamental lesson of the past six years – from the open, compassionate and pluralist spirit of the 2012 London Olympics, via the Tories’ surprise victory in 2015 and the nativist vote for Brexit in 2016, to Jeremy Corbyn’s unexpected surge in last year’s general election.The oscillation is bewildering, the runes unreadable. Which is why smarter Tories do not buy for a second the notion that we have reached “peak Corbyn” – a silly attempt to graft branding jargon on to nuanced psephological reality.Yes, Labour failed to take Barnet, Wandsworth and Westminster in last week’s local contests, and should be concerned about its failure to make much progress outside London. But the party denied the Tories control of Trafford, took Plymouth, and – according to the BBC – would be the largest party in the House of Commons if the results were replicated in a general election.What has been scotched (or should have been) is the no less silly myth of impregnable destiny that has gripped some parts of the Labour left since the Tories lost their majority. There is no direction to history, no teleology in a complex democracy. To say that Labour has a lot more to do to win – as Alastair Campbell and others did on Saturday – is not to reassert Blairite values, defend neoliberalism, or declare the Iraq war a roaring success. Least of all is it a “smear”. This is all about the hard grind of gaining power, the door-to-door trials that face any opposition if it is to become a government.William Hague has observed that the Tory party has two default positions: complacency and panic. It is fair to say that Conservatives are panicking a little less than they were a week ago. They have been reminded that Corbyn is a man rather than a shaman, that his path to No 10 is not mystically ordained. But, in private at least, they are uncertain what to do with this information, how to turn it into useful political action.Let us say that Theresa May does not fight the next general election as Tory leader, but aspires to remain in office until at least 29 March 2019, when Britain leaves the European Union. The most important question facing the party after her departure – more important than the identity of her successor – is the trajectory it chooses to follow when she is gone.You would need a heart of stone not to laugh at the decline of the movement formerly known as Nigel\u0026nbspFarage’s fan club. It is glorious that Ukip should now be self-identifying as the Black Death: the words of its general secretary. But the Tory party must at all costs avoid becoming the willing host to its contagion. The defining characteristic of the Ukip voter – past or present – is implacability. No Brexit will be hard enough, no immigration reform tough enough, no recoil from progress fierce enough to please them.It follows that a strategy designed to appease this tranche of the electorate is not only (in my view) terrible for the country but also (as a matter of fact) entirely pointless. If the post-May party becomes hostage to the spirit of Farage – and some say it already is – then it will lose the next general election, and deserve to do so.Ours is a deeply erse society, economically dependent upon immigration and culturally enriched by it. The Tory party has been wrestling with this fairly straightforward reality for more than 20 years now. What was once called “modernisation” is now in fairly obvious retreat: ask those affected by or – a much more numerous group – appalled at the Windrush scandal and the government’s handling of it.To win a majority again, the party has to persuade (for a start) young, urban, socially liberal and ethnic minority voters that it does not hate them. This is, to put it mildly, no easy task.Last week’s elections were a minor tremor alerting the political class to the tectonic uncertainty that still lies beneath. The Tories have been awakened from their fatalistic stupor and reminded they have a choice. What matters more, of course, is that the rest of us do too."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0ccc2ddf97bb2310ca4d2a57f67085a5484a9cda/0_0_5760_3840/master/5760.jpg?w=300\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=36fd30f8ee6be511a7e99ff2ee03f4e8","title":"nick offerman interview parks and recreation","story":"Best known for his role in the US sitcom, the actor talks about his love of tools, being a Londonphile, and his proposal to Megan MullallyNick Offerman is best known for his portrayal of libertarian local government worker Ron Swanson in the US sitcom Parks and Recreation.

When they asked me to do it, I leapt at the chance. The publishers sent me an early draft and I felt like a kid in a candy store. All these magical implements.When did your love of tools begin?My mom’s family ran a pig farm in rural Illinois, where they also grew corn and soya beans. There was a touch of Little House on the Prairie. My earliest memories are of my dad splitting firewood. As soon as we could swing an axe, he’d have me and my siblings out there. It was a carnival of tool use – gardening, repairing barns, maintaining machinery. I always looked up to my two uncles, who reminded me of Han Solo. They might not have had the newest, flashiest spaceship, but with their acumen and tools, they kept their particular Millennium Falcons running in top shape.Do you give your tools names?Not as a rule, although there are certain hammers and crowbars that I might call “the Persuader”. And there’s a newish tool called a powder-actuated nailgun which I’ve nicknamed “Boom Boom”.Do you think tools are back in fashion?I’m excited that we’re reawakening to our own handiness. It’s charismatic to be self-sufficient, to be able to mend our own bicycles. For decades, we’ve been taught to be sheep-like consumers. “The handle’s fallen off the toaster. Let’s throw it away and get a new one.” That’s not frugal living nor respectful of the planet’s resources. Using tools makes you a good citizen.You’re soon co-hosting a new NBC show with Amy Poehler. Tell us about it.It’s a crafting contest called Making It, starting in July. Crafters of all different disciplines compete in challenges to make things, while Amy and I clown around, tossing out as many painful puns as we can muster. I’m thrilled with . It’s good-hearted and optimistic, the sort of medicine the world could use right now. After you’ve spent the day shaking your fist at your Twitter feed or grinding your teeth at the political situation, you can switch on Making It. The comfort food of television.Sounds a bit like The Great British Bake Off…Funnily enough, that was one of our influences. The Bake Off’s warmth, camaraderie and joy in creativity was really inspiring to us.Amy Poehler was one of your Parks and Recreation co-stars. Do you stay in touch with the others?The whole cast just got together for a reunion dinner, which was wonderful. We still have a group text thread, which started when we were shooting and has never stopped. It’s like a great sports team or your college years, whatever your glory days were. In some ways, you’ll always miss it, but with maturity, you realise it can’t last for ever. We’re grateful we got to experience it for seven years but it came to a natural end and wrapped up at the right time.Devoted carnivore Ron Swanson became a hero for meat lovers. Do people assume that’s the real you?There are several areas in which people conflate me with Ron’s cartoon physicality. Sometimes in a restaurant, if the chef is a fan and hears I’m dining, they’ll add an inch-thick layer of bacon or send over an extra steak. At first, it was amazing. Who doesn’t love free meat? But my cardiologist pointed out that a real digestive system can’t eat like that. Or indeed drink scotch in Ron’s quantities and hope to lead a productive life.You’ve slimmed down in recent years anyway, right?I have. My Parks and Rec boss asked me to “stay beefy”, which is one of the best things you can hear from your employer. But as the show ended, the parts coming my way fell into a similar trope: “An ex-sportsman, 30lb past his prime, standing in his briefs, crying in the mirror.” I decided I’d like to live as long as possible and get a wider variety of roles, so I cleaned up my diet and trimmed down. Maybe now I’ll be cast as a thinner version of that depressed, gone-to-seed sportsman.Do you miss Ron’s trademark moustache?I love having a healthy faceful of whiskers. Facial hair is a boon for a character actor. In any given year, I can sport a full prospector’s beard, all the way down to clean-shaven. It’s another tool in my thespianic toolbox, as it were.You’re quite a Londonphile, aren’t you?London is our favourite city on the planet. Much like Fortnum \u0026amp Mason’s Beef Extract spread, it’s simply moreish. We love to go whenever we can, for myriad reasons: theatre, food, art and to learn manners from the people who invented them.You proposed to your wife Megan Mullally here, didn’t you?It was in Regent’s Park that I bent my knee and presented my hand-carved, walnut, heart-shaped ring box. Magically, the ducks on the water and birds in the air began to furiously copulate all around us. Something made the moment bigger than the two of us. It was fated by Mother Nature.Haven’t you and Megan co-written a marriage guide too?It’s called The Greatest Love Story Ever Told, out this fall. It’s a sincere memoir of our romance, but, as always, shot through with humour and lots of filthy references to what we do in the bedroom. Eighteen years into the relationship, I’m constantly grateful she continues tolerating me. When I wake up and look over at her, I still think: “You lucky bastard, you better be on your best behaviour today.”What else is in the pipeline?I have a film coming out in June called Hearts Beat Loud. It has a crackerjack cast and it’s the beautiful, touching, funny story of me and my daughter’s little rock band in Brooklyn. I’m proud of it. I’m hoping it will expand my repertoire to bearded man in briefs, holding a Les Paul custom guitar and crying in the mirror. • The Tool Book with a foreword by Nick Offerman is published by Dorling Kindersley (£20).

On lazy, hazy summer Sundays, stretches of the Sir John A Macdonald Parkway are closed to traffic and become a pedestrian haven. Why not join the dog walkers and bicyclists, in-line skaters and joggers alongside the beaches and rapids of the Ottawa river? You can paddle the rivers that frame the city – the Ottawa, Gatineau or Rideau – or enjoy the wildlife in urban parks or the much-loved Greenbelt, around 20,000 hectares (around 49,500 acres) of farms, forests and wetlands that surrounds the capital. In May, admire the rich colours of the Canadian Tulip Festival it’s the world’s largest, with over a million orange, red and yellow flowers.In winter, locals descend en masse to skate on Ottawa’s central Rideau canal. The world’s largest naturally frozen ice-skating route is home to a hardy crowd who chow down on Beavertails (that’s a pastry, not an animal’s tail), pull on cosy clothes and toques (wool hats), and glide along for nearly 5 miles (around 7.8 km). For three weekends in February, the Winterlude festival brings ice sculptures, foodie events and a children’s Snowflake Kingdom.Thanks to it’s historical significance, Ottawa is not short of imposing buildings. Admire the vaulting neo-gothic spires of Parliament Hill, the crystal tower of the National Gallery of Canada and, just across the river in the twin city of Gatineau, the Canadian Museum of History, the design of which is inspired by Canada’s topography.The Hill is also the centre point for Canada Day, Canada’s birthday celebrations every 1 July. Expect to find a stage showcasing Canadian musicians, followed by fireworks at night. Watch from the Hill or behind the Fairmont Château Laurier, the historic “castle”, opened as a grand hotel in 1912. Parliament’s central Peace Tower is perfect for a bird’s-eye panorama of the city visit on Wednesdays at noon in summer for free yoga sessions in front of parliament on the lawn. Keep your eyes peeled: you might just see prime minister Justin Trudeau and his wife Sophie Grégoire Trudeau joining in.There’s a vibrant restaurant scene in Ottowa. Explore the eclectic cuisine of Canadian Culinary Champion Marc Lepine, the only chef to win the Gold Medal Plates competition twice, at his restaurant Atelier or the innovative Middle Eastern fare of Walid El-Tawel at Fairouz.City neighbourhoods are equally exciting and eminently walkable. ByWard Market is arguably the most vibrant, with more than 120 places to eat and drink in a four-block-by-four-block patch that’s also home to a great selection of shops. Also try Westboro and the Glebe, where you’ll find Lansdowne, a complex with a year-round farmers’ market and a new stadium where you can catch sports events downtown. Ottawa’s museum and gallery scene reflects Canadians’ past and future hopes. Gatineau’s Canadian Museum of History’s Grand Hall with its towering totem poles captures the lasting presence of indigenous cultures, while the museum’s new Canadian History Hall presents the largest and most comprehensive exhibition about Canadian history ever created. In contrast, quirky Bytown Museum reveals the history of Ottawa . Here you can discover the military raison d’être of the Rideau canal – a Unesco world heritage site – as you learn about its construction after the British colony’s war of 1812 with the US.

The environmental fashion campaigner, who grew up in Italy, remembers hand washing her sweaters each summer, carefully storing them away, then unpacking them the following winter. She would wear them year after year so she had to look after them. This was before fast, disposable fashion she says, “We did it a different way.”These days, as the founder of Eco-Age, a brand consultancy firm that works with luxury fashion labels on improving their sustainability credentials, and as someone who makes frequent appearances on the red carpet alongside her Oscar-winning husband actor Colin Firth, she has an expanded wardrobe – yet it’s probably not as big as you may imagine. In 2010 Firth came up with the Green Carpet Challenge, using her visibility in front of the world’s media to wear only ethical, sustainable and repurposed fashion, and she’s often photographed repeatedly wearing the same gowns as part of her #30wears pledge.She was a long way from Hollywood’s red carpets last year when she travelled to Tasmania to meet some of Australia’s top merino wool growers and learn about the production of wool. Each year she travels to a different country to learn more about the global supply chain. “You can never replace the real experience of meeting people and seeing things with your own eyes.” Recently she’s visited Bangladesh to meet the garment factory workers and Brazil to meet the leather farmers threatening the Amazon leather.The trip to Tasmania was “facilitated” by Woolmark, the Australian company that promotes the use of merino wool around the world, and her experiences were captured in a short documentary Fashionscapes: Forever Tasmania She says she didn’t know what to expect. “You have images of huge herds of sheep overgrazing and intensively reared and then we ended up in this landscape.” Tasmanian farmers like Matt and Vanessa Dunbabin of Bangor farm, who farm merino sheep, prime beef and prime lamb, and Roderic O’Connor, who runs the wool farm Connorville met with her, and she says she found their careful approach to land conservation and sustainable wool production inspiringThe controversial practice of mulesing is a significant issue for the industry, with international wool buyers pushing farmers to phase it out, not least because of customer concerns. Firth asked the farmers about it, and on camera O’Connor says the industry is looking for solutions, through breeding and by using pain relief. For Firth it remains an ethical dilemma. “It’s not a nice practice but if it is done properly it saves the sheep’s life and a death from hell.”The industry is also seen as having a significant environmental impact thanks to pesticide use, greenhouse gas emissions and, in some cases, overgrazing. The washing, dyeing and treatment of wool can also have an impact. Yet the wool industry is pushing back, saying the life cycle assessment tools often used by the fashion industry don’t measure the full supply chain. Woolmark points out that wool is natural, renewable and biodegradable. Firth was convinced, saying that wool comes out on top when compared to the evils of synthetic fibres, which shed microplastics each time they are washed and are not biodegradable. “If you throw away a wool sweater, it composes in the ground very quickly, and it doesn’t waste microfibres when you wash it.”The day before our interview was the fifth anniversary of the Rana Plaza tragedy, when the collapse of the garment factories killed 1134 workers. Firth recently visited Bangladesh and she was disheartened to see how little has changed for the fast fashion industry. “There are new Bangladeshs every day,” she says. “Today all the big guys have just moved to Ethiopia to produce in a country where there is not even minimum wage so the story repeats itself in terms of the businesses and how they produce.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/75d1ebc99fa0eebca93e813c70e372bbed6766ed/0_0_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a1151eff6e6dc8953792193dfa402650","title":"lean on pete review andrew haigh modern american odyssey charlie plummer","story":"British director Andrew Haigh’s modern American odyssey sees Charlie Plummer excel as a teen fleeing grim realitiesA performance of remarkable depth, candour and vulnerability by rising star Charlie Plummer lies at the heart of this terrifically moving fourth feature film from British writer-director Andrew Haigh. Adapted from the 2010 novel by Willy Vlautin, Lean on Pete blends timeless American myths with pin-point portrayals of modern urban hardship, as its lonely teenage lead heads east from Oregon with a horse on its last hurrah. The travails are tough but there’s an unsentimental tenderness at the centre of Haigh’s movie – a melancholic counterpoint to the grim realities of life from which our young hero flees.Plummer plays Charley Thompson, a lanky 15-year-old (he lies about his age) who has moved home umpteen times with his single father, Ray (Travis Fimmel). With dreams of playing for the high-school football team blighted by a nomadic lifestyle, Charley has become a loner who has learned to fend for himself. Running past the Portland Meadows racetrack, he meets Steve Buscemi’s trainer, Del Montgomery, who offers him a few bucks to change a tyre and help with his horses. “Never let go of the rope,” Del tells Charley an instruction that seems to double as a diehard life lesson.A diffident yet attentive presence, Charley has a trusting nature and finds a kindred spirit in the eponymous quarter horse, a former short-sprint winner (“Don’t blink or you’ll miss it”). The endearingly named Lean on Pete is showing signs of age, and Del is getting ready to send him, euphemistically, “to Mexico”. “You can’t get attached to a horse,” says Bonnie (Chloë Sevigny), a jockey who has suffered her fair share of injuries, and who observes tellingly that “there’s only so many times you can fall down, right?” But when all hope seems lost, Charlie hits the trail with his one true friend, heading for Wyoming and searching for somewhere to call home.Vlautin’s novel has been described by critics as a distant descendant of Walter Farley’s The Black Stallion, with shades of Salinger and Steinbeck. There is a quote from the latter at the start of the novel that Haigh has clearly taken to heart. “It is true that we are weak and sick and ugly and quarrelsome,” Steinbeck wrote, “but if that is all we ever were, we would millenniums ago have disappeared from the face of the Earth.” Haigh paints sympathetic portraits of all the characters the good, the bad and the ugly. Ray may not be an ideal father, but there’s a tangible tenderness in the scenes with his son, and a sense of closeness that persists even during his frequent absences. Del is a world-weary chancer who dopes, exploits and then dumps his horses, yet there’s a gruff paternal affection in his advice to Charley to “do something else before there’s nothing else you can do”. Even Steve Zahn’s drunken drifter Silver has a child-like quality that is counterposed with a violent tinderbox temper.After the tight focus of Weekend and 45 Years (which the director described as “companion piece” pictures), Haigh widens his canvas as Charley heads into the desert, embarking upon an American odyssey to which Danish cinematographer Magnus Nordenhof Jønck responds with lyrical grandeur. While the narrative may be read as a coming-of-age story, there’s something more elemental in Charley’s search for a beloved aunt, who comes to represent his idealised yearning for a lost family life. Crucially, Charley remains at the centre of the picture, with the oblong 1.85 frame lending a human dimension to these expansive vistas, ensuring that we don’t get distracted by the scenery, or lose sight of the true focus of the story.Unsurprisingly, Lean on Pete is a film in which gestures are more important than words. Having declared in passing that “You won’t see me again in California”, Del shoots Charley a glance that speaks volumes about his shady past. As for Charley, he may have been schooled in Sam Shepard-style manly “truths” (“The best women have all been waitresses at some point,” Ray tells him between beers), but his voice has a lilting softness, which matches the expressiveness of his face. At times, there’s a touch of James Dean in Plummer’s plaintive delivery, along with echoes of Jon Voight’s marooned hustler in Midnight Cowboy. Having made a splash in Felix Thompson’s 2015 indie-pic King Jack, Plummer has proved a mercurial presence in films as erse as Oren Moverman’s The Dinner andmore recently Ridley Scott’s All the Money in the World. In Lean on Pete, this rising star proves his mettle in a role for which he is simply perfect."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3548f8c6b912c44b4159e95e4c62381a4111440a/889_0_3076_1846/master/3076.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1975fe95791901d78451eb66510e5dee","title":"arsenal burnley premier league match report","story":"Amid the choreography and pageantry that marked the big one in terms of Arsène Wenger’s farewell tour there could be a degree of relief at Arsenal. There is a pretty significant difference between finishing sixth and seventh in this season’s Premier League and, had Arsenal slumped here, it would have opened up the possibility that Burnley might pinch sixth spot from them.It would have meant Arsenal beginning next season under their new manager in the second qualifying round of the Europa League on 26 July while Burnley went straight into the group stage of Europe’s second-tier competition. Arsenal are scheduled to face Atlético Madrid on that date in a pre-season friendly in Singapore. They would have had to have cancelled their tour.Arsenal’s final two matches of the season are at Leicester City and Huddersfield Town and, given their dismal away form in 2018 – they have yet to pick up a point – there could be no guarantee of any rewards. Yet they spared themselves the potentially awkward situation with a comprehensive dismantling of Burnley, who played nothing more than a ceremonial role here.It says plenty about how far Arsenal have fallen under Wenger this season that the merits of coming in ahead of Burnley in sixth were even up for discussion. But this, at least, was a day in which everything went right, when the supporters could cheer Wenger to the rafters as he entered through a guard of honour and departed with a clutch of mementos, and the team clicked in fine style.There was even a 13-minute substitute’s cameo for Per Mertesacker, who will retire at the end of the season to take over as the head of the club’s academy, and it threatened to bring the house down. Petr Cech ran from his goal to embrace Mertesacker and the big German’s every touch was cheered.Stan Kroenke, the majority shareholder, was in attendance and he listened to songs in praise of Wenger throughout. For one sunny afternoon the angst of so much of the season could be forgotten. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang scored twice to take his tally for the club to eight in 12 appearances while Alexandre Lacazette, Sead Kolasinac and Alex Iwobi got the others.Arsenal took charge early on and the breakthrough goal owed everything to Lacazette’s vision and incision. He played a give-and-go with Iwobi, which allowed him to slice into the area, and his driven cross was made to measure for Aubameyang who poked home. It is clear that Aubameyang’s relationship with Lacazette and Henrikh Mkhitaryan will be key to the club in the post-Wenger era.The fourth member of the LMAO strike-force was absent and it had to be said that Mesut Özil’s back injury was the least surprising feature of the day. The World Cup is looming for the Germany maestro. It is unclear whether he will play against Leicester or Huddersfield.Lacazette was lively from the first whistle and he got his reward in first-half stoppage time. Iwobi played the pass before the assist and Héctor Bellerín did well to cut back his cross. Lacazette steered a volley inside Nick Pope’s near post.Arsenal had other flickers through the dangerous Mkhitaryan while they shouted loudly but in vain for a penalty when Kolasinac’s cross hit Matthew Lowton’s hand. Burnley lost Ashley Barnes to a shoulder injury on 20 minutes. The first half passed them by the second period even more so.Wenger omitted Shkodran Mustafi, Nacho Monreal and Aaron Ramsey from his starting line-up and there was another opportunity for the 20-year-old Greek centre-half, Konstantinos Mavropanos, who took no prisoners. Twice he cleaned out Barnes’s replacement, Sam Vokes, to the delight of the home crowd, who have missed a bit of Martin Keown-style violence in their team. After Mavropanos’s first challenge on Vokes the fans around the press box chanted Keown’s name. Keown, who was on punditry duty, smiled.Burnley are going on a European tour, as the travelling fans chanted, but they were AWOL here. Arsenal turned the screw after the interval. Jack Wilshere had lifted a good chance high when he rinsed Jack Cork to tee up Kolasinac while Iwobi smashed the fourth into the roof of the net after a one-two with Aubameyang and statuesque Burnley defending. Bellerín crossed for Aubameyang to score the fifth and Danny Welbeck almost added a sixth only to see a thunderous long-range shot rattle the crossbar."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/164fcb7c3d96340ed7827b4c6b7526440d62b65e/0_71_3424_2055/master/3424.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=71c31a992f87d5660957525f95f3fd0d","title":"chelsea liverpool premier league match report","story":"There have been plenty of occasions this season when Chelsea have appeared broken beyond repair. Their title defence fizzled out early but points had been frittered away before the onset of spring as the campaign degenerated into an apparently hopeless pursuit of Champions League qualification. But in the final week they have given themselves a chance and are on the top four’s shoulder once again.By defeating third-placed Liverpool here courtesy of Olivier Giroud’s first‑half goal, a header guided into the corner as the visitors switched off for Victor Moses’s cross, their chase is prolonged. All Antonio Conte and his players can do is ensure Huddersfield and Newcastle are beaten in the last five days and then pray , somehow, Tottenham Hotspur or the Champions League finalists slip up in their own appealing home fixtures.Success remains a long shot but, as Conte admitted, Chelsea would have considered such a target “impossible” only a month ago. Four wins on the trot have fired hope.The late rally is tinged with regret. Those horribly damaging defeats to Bournemouth and Watford spring to mind when reflecting on a turbulent season, but so might the flurry of draws at the turn of the year or, even, the wasteful 1-1 draw with West Ham only a month ago. When they lost at home to Spurs at the beginning of April, the chasm to fourth had gaped at eight points. “Now we are getting three points in every game and our opponents are dropping points,” Conte said. “Our future is not in our hands but we have to try to put pressure on the teams ahead of us.”Giroud’s goal, cushioned into the corner as he leapt between Virgil van Dijk and Dejan Lovren, and some feverish defending, secured this latest win. Thibaut Courtois was authoritative and imposing. Gary Cahill, rejuvenated over recent weeks, relished the scrap of it all with César Azpilicueta and the excellent Antonio Rüdiger flinging themselves into blocks and challenges at his side.Rüdiger had played with Mohamed Salah at Roma and was instrumental in blunting the footballer of the year. The Egyptian’s frustration saw him booked for a e over Cahill’s first‑half tackle. For once, he actually seemed rattled.Sadio Mané, in particular, and the substitute Dominic Solanke still threatened to restore parity, but Chelsea would not be breached. Their former academy player twice nodded over the bar near the end, straining but failing to keep his headers down. His time will come. “He’s a hard-working boy,” said Jürgen Klopp, who had clearly sensed the potential theatre of flinging the 20-year-old into the fray against his former club. “He will be fine in the future.”Klopp will be irritated his team’s final domestic game, against Brighton, may no longer be irrelevant given he would have preferred to rest personnel before the European Cup final in Kiev. Liverpool had required a result on the final day of last season, in a home game against relegated Middlesbrough, to qualify and may now have to repeat that trick.“That’s my life, always going to the last day,” Klopp said. “But I saw Brighton against Manchester United on Friday and they don’t look like an easy game. They were really good that day. But it’s football. If you want guarantees, do something different. The boys have shown me they will try and try and try.”His players certainly did not seem spent after their exertions in Rome in midweek and monopolised the ball for long periods, though they ran aground too often on the clutter in Chelsea’s penalty area. It only took them being marginally off their effervescent best to offer the home side their chance.Even Tiémoué Bakayoko, much maligned over his first season in this country, seemed to revel in the rearguard action, with the hosts’ counterattacks always carrying a considerable threat of their own. Eden Hazard, his shirt ripped and replaced, led the charge and was irrepressible until replaced by Willian late on.Giroud, so impressive since arriving from Arsenal in January, offered a focal point to exploit. No one can match the 29 headed goals he has scored since arriving in London from Montpellier almost six years ago. He has given his team hope once more."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a6fde70dfdc9a66369bd368e17810b584d24dbd8/0_247_2432_1459/master/2432.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c299bd4b0220364209a65a9362c01eb5","title":"liverpool jurgen klopp critical of mohamed saleh dive agaainst chelsea","story":"Jürgen Klopp has made clear his disapproval of the e from Mohamed Salah which led to the footballer of the year being booked as Liverpool succumbed to Chelsea, a result which has offered last season’s Premier League champions hope of infiltrating the top four.Salah was cautioned after going to ground at Gary Cahill’s first‑half challenge with the Egyptian, up against his former club, well marshalled by Antonio Rüdiger and enduring a third scoreless game in succession. “Yes I think it was a e, was it?” Klopp said. “Or he waited for the contact, I am not sure, so that is not what I want to see, that is not what he wants to do. But obviously it happened.“With all the other situations, he couldn’t get any foul any more. That is not right as well. It was always like this and you have to deal with that.”The forward, who has scored 41 goals this season, was up against a former team-mate at Roma in Rüdiger, with Klopp confident he will rediscover his scoring touch in time for the European Cup final against Real Madrid on 26\u0026nbspMay.“He has to be much better, he can do much better and he will score again, there is no doubt about that. There was no space for anything out there. He can play with no space actually, but not today. That is it, all good.”Chelsea’s victory hoisted Antonio Conte’s side to within three points of their third-placed opponents before the midweek visit of Huddersfield. If that game is won – and even if the fourth‑placed Tottenham prosper in their own fixture against Newcastle on Wednesday – the race for the top four will go to the final afternoon when Liverpool host Brighton and the London club travel to Tyneside. “And Newcastle is not a holiday trip, or at least it doesn’t sound like a holiday trip to me,” said Klopp, who declined to comment on suggestions in France that Liverpool are in talks with Lyon over their attacking midfielder Nabil Fekir.Conte said: “We must be pleased with our will to fight and desire to keep hope alive to take a place in the Champions League.

They had to work hard tonight but deserved at least a point for an excellent second-half performance with 10 men. Thanks for your company, goodnight.Zidane gives Valverde a friendly slap on the cheek. Both are smiling and seem happy with life. That was crtacking entertainment, and the upshot is that Barcelona should - should - go through the league season unbeaten.Peep peep! Barcelona’s long unbeaten run goes on after a lively draw against Real Madrid.90+3 min Paulinho wins a corner for Barcelona, which might be enough for them to see this game out.90+2 min Barcelona waste a bit of time with their last substitution. Luis Suarez is replaced by Paco Alcacer.90+1 min There will be four minutes of added time.90 min It’s all Real. Umtiti makes a vital interception from Modric’s cross. 89 min Suarez is down again after a strong but fair tackle. 86 min Suarez is down after a challenge with Ramos, but Real play on. Eventually the ball goes out of play, at which point there is a predictable row between players on both sides.84 min Marcelo’s dangerous cross towards Bale is headed behind by Jordi Alba. That leads to another corner, before which Real make their final substitution: Toni Kroos is replaced by Mateo Kovacic.82 min Moments later, Messi flips the ball around Casemiro and tries to blast it past Navas from a ridiculous angle. Navas was well positioned and beat it behind for a corner.82 min Ramos gives the ball to Messi, who manipulates the ball onto his left foot and curls just wide of the far post.81 min Vazquez cushions a cutback to Modric, who smacks the bouncing ball over the bar from 20 yards.80 min ... which is played short and worked infield for Vazquez, who mis-hit shot is kicked away by Pique.80 min Barcelona looked in control at 2-1 but now they are hanging on a little. Vazquez wins a corner down the right...79 min “Bale is just what United need,” says David Flynn. “A left-sided attacker who isn’t as good as he used to be. Perfect.”But he plays on the right.78 min “There are very few things more entertaining, and better for the soul, than a full-blooded Clasico,” says Matt Dony. “Good to see Bale being a bit nawty matches like this can bring it out of anyone. You never wish ill on people, but the thought of Ronaldo possibly missing the final does excite me. I mean, it’d be a shame for a big showpiece event, but, but...”77 min Bale finally gets a yellow card for a foul on Semedo. Marcelo is also booked for dissent. You can see why he wanted a penalty - replays show it was a clear foul by Jordi Alba, not Pique as I first thought.76 min The popular Marcelo goes over in the area after a risky tackle from Pique. The referee says no penalty. It might have been both a foul and a e, though it’s hard to be sure as we haven’t seen a replay yet.73 min “Aside from Spurs, I don’t see anyone in the Premier League who would Bale,” says Paul Moody. “What do you think?”If I was United’s manager I’d take him in a heartbeat. Chelsea too, depending on what happens there. Oh my goodness, that is a cracking equaliser from Gareth Bale! It came out of nothing. Benzema’s excellent off-the-ball run allowed Asensio to ease an angled pass towards the D, where Bale ran onto the ball and smacked a superb first-time curler into the corner.70 min Real played well before half-time but their second-half performance has been muck.69 min Barcelona are sitting on the edge of the area, waiting to win possession and hit Real on the counter attack. That approach almost leads to a third goal when Suarez flips a brilliant first-time pass on the turn that puts Messi through on goal from the halfway line. He scoots into the area and tries to cut a shot across Navas into the far corner. Navas gets down smartly to his left to push it behind for a corner.67 min Real bring on Lucas Vazquez for Nacho.66 min Benzema’s cross finds Asensio, who mishits a very difficult volley. Barcelona are in control of this game.65 min Real are starting to have more of the ball now, though there’s a lack of authority and belief in their attacking. Bale whacks a long-range shot against Umtiti and then appeals for a penalty after being eased off the ball by the same player. There was nothing in it.61 min Real are really missing Ronaldo. They haven’t got going at all since half-time.58 min Barcelona have been brilliant since half-time and almost make it 3-1 when Semedo’s low cross flashes right across the face of goal. Paulinho stretched to reach it and ended up clattering Navas.57 min A Barcelona substitution: Paulinho replaces the immortal Andres Iniesta, who hugs Lionel Messi and leaves the field to a kind of Mexican wave from the Barcelona fans. We’re not worthy.55 min Suarez has a goal disallowed for offside against Rakitic. It was a very tight decision but probably the correct one.Moments after Asensio shoots straight at ter Stegen, Messi gives Barcelona the lead with a brilliant goal on the counter-attack! He took a square pass from Suarez just inside the area, shimmied away from Ramos and Casemiro and curled a precise shot past Navas at the near post. I’m pretty sure there was a foul by Suarez on Varane in the build up, but I’m not sure either team have much business on the moral high ground tonight.50 min Ronaldo has a slight ankle sprain, according to the chaps on Sky Sports, so I’m sure he’ll be fine to play for Real Madrid in the Champions League final.47 min The popular Marcelo robs Iniesta, loafs towards the area and slices a shot over the bar from 20 yards. Barcelona are playing a tight 4-3-2 now, with Semedo at right-back.Both teams make a half-time substitution: Barcelona bring on Nelson Semedo for Philippe Coutinho, and Marco Asensio is on for the presumably injured Cristiano Ronaldo.Nacho and Pique have just had a row in the tunnel. I suspect this is going to be a very funny second half.“I don’t know about you, but having thoroughly enjoyed the Champions League semis, I’ve realised I need something other than pure goal-fests,” says Brad McMillan. “I’m happy to admit that the pettiness, childishness and lameness of some of the fouls, followed by exaggerated reactions that wouldn’t look out of place in an Eastenders argument from 1994, is hugely entertaining. The speed and brazenness with which Marcelo got up so quickly, after seeing the red card had been shown, was genuinely impressive. Maybe it’s the bank holiday feeling, but I’d rather be nowhere else than watching this at the moment.”There’s nothing like it for guilty pleasure. Two of the happiest hours of my so-called career were MBMing the PortugalNetherlands match at the 2006 World Cup.Chris Foley “What a half! Question, was Bale always a bit of a nasty player? He should be off.”Roy Mora “I want to see the clasico.”That was highly enjoyable, with two good goals and loads of aggro. Barcelona players surround the referee at half-time, before Iniesta tells them all to bugger off and show some respect. The second half should be extremely lively.It’s all going off now. Marcelo goes down off the ball and Sergi Roberto gets a straight red card. Pique applauds sarcastically. Replays show that Marcelo ran into Sergi Roberto, who slapped him about the person in response. It was definitely a slap rather than a punch, and to the body rather than the face, but the referee decided it was enough for a red card.45+1 min Bale, who should have been booked earlier, is even luckier to avoid a yellow card for studding Umtiti in the back of the leg. That was a weird tackle.45 min Messi is booked for administering a bit of vigilante justice to Ramos. 43 min Here we are. Suarez and Sergio Ramos are head to head over something or other. Suarez is foaming in all directions, suggesting Ramos elbowed him. The referee gives them both a yellow card.42 min A chance for Barcelona. Coutinho angles a nice through pass for Messi, who tries to dance around the outrushing Navas. He can’t quite get the ball out of his feet and Navas is able to palm it away on the stretch.40 min Kroos plays the ball out to the left for Benzema. He shuffles into the area, moves the ball away from Sergi Roberto and whips a cross shot a few yards wide of the far post.38 min More Real pressure. Marcelo dinks a deep cross beyond the far post, where Ronaldo monsters everyone out the way and loops a header onto the roof of the net. That was a really good effort.36 min Umtiti sprays Messi’s free-kick wide from six yards, though he was offside so it wouldn’t have counted.36 min Bale is lucky not to be booked for a hack at Iniesta, who lured him towards the ball and then whisked it away.34 min After a lethargic start, Real are playing excellently and should probably be ahead. Barcelona are having to play on the counter-attack."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5856f4e08293a52c6f59ed5bcab026615425099b/312_995_5624_3374/master/5624.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=472400abf7495f26ec498aa7cbb35b3a","title":"african express how bright textiles brought one london home to life","story":"Eva Sonaike’s Nigerian heritage inspires the vibrant colours and patterns at her family houseEva Sonaike’s journey to becoming a textile designer began when she realised she could no longer stand the bland character of the small flat she and her husband used to share. “I was on maternity leave and I felt the need to make it warm, welcoming and more ‘us’,” she says. Eva headed to London’s Petticoat Lane market and bought bolts of bright African wax fabrics to make into cushion covers, throws and curtains.“As a quick fix, it worked,” she says. “Of course, I now know that those materials aren’t right for upholstery – too flimsy, not colourfast and so on. But it made me see very clearly how vibrant fabrics can bring joy into a space.”Ten years later, Eva has moved on – both career-wise and to a new home. She’s designing full time, working from a studio in the garden of her 1930s house in north London, where she lives with her husband Kola Sonaike, a barrister, their son Lolu, aged 10, and daughter Lola, eight.“When we bought this house it was a typical semi and the downstairs rooms were fairly dark,” says Eva. The couple knocked through the ground floor rooms and extended it to create one large split-level space. “My wish list was simple: white walls, dark floors and lots of light,” says Eva. “I knew I was going to add colour and pattern. And I think that works best with a light, clean backdrop.”Inspiration for her fabric designs comes from the regular trips she has made to west Africa since she was a child. While Eva was born in Germany and lived there until moving to London in her 20s to work as a fashion editor, her heritage is Nigerian. “I grew up knowing that fabrics were held in high esteem in Yoruba culture,” she says. “Thickly woven aso oke cloth was once a form of currency and is still given as a special gift. Or the embroidery on clothing could hold meaning – it might ward off evil, bring wealth or attract a spouse. Fabrics were never just pieces of cloth . They always told some kind of story.”Eva still travels to Africa each year with her own family, trips that now provide the stories for her own designs. “When I’m there, I’m like a sponge,” she says. “I soak up visual stimuli, the scents and the atmosphere. I see patterns in everything, from architecture to nature.”The motifs she sketches are later scanned into Photoshop, where she refines them and adds colours. Eva points to her Ijoba cushion, featuring lush leaves arranged in a stylised 50s-feel pattern. “This one came about after a trip to Ghana for a wedding. Afterwards we took the children up into the mountains to visit an old botanical gardens,” she says. “Everyone said: ‘Don’t bother, it’s so run-down’ – but that just made me want to go even more. When we arrived, the place was shrouded in mist and it felt as if nature had been left to run wild. The gardens were teeming with life – plants unfurling and exploding into flower.”Another design, Ojo, was inspired by the tropical modernism-style walls and balconies of Lagos, reimagined by Eva into an elegant grid of golds and reds. “That post-colonial architecture is an everyday feature of Lagos life,” she says. “I wanted to bring out its beauty.” Other prints feature zebra stripes recast in neon shades, a softened version of batik and shapes inspired by Yoruba embroidery.In her home, Eva’s patterns are complemented by African artefacts that have been in her family since the 1960s and 1970s. “My father was an art historian, so he had a very good eye,” she says. Eva and Kola have added carved figures bought more recently in Lagos’s craft markets. “Look beyond rows of statues darkened with shoe polish and sanded to ‘age’ them and you’ll always find beautifully crafted objects,” she says.Other pieces in Eva’s home include German antiques, a table from north Africa (by way of a Fulham dealer) and high street buys from Habitat and Ikea. Eva also confesses to a bit of a HomeSense habit for vases and lamp bases. “My daughter used to do a gym class near a branch, which was fatal. Luckily, she’s just switched to a ballet class further away.”Back in the dining room, a painting by Damola Adepoju from Nike Art Gallery in Lagos reminds the couple of trips to the city, with its streets rammed with yellow buses. And in the living room, above the cushions depicting her own African-inspired designs, Eva has hung a photograph of a Sudanese girl by Eliot Elisofon. It was taken in 1947 for Life magazine. “It dates from a very different era,” she says. “But as a celebration of African culture and beauty, it still feels very relevant today.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9ebea6650a93cdd76c7cb9d7d9b6f3a06a3a12a5/495_511_4625_2775/master/4625.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1d70ae44cdfa44e546b135441abd78bb","title":"is is weird to write to say sorry to my ex three years on","story":"Do it! Says Mariella. Keep it simple, keep it brief, write it from the heartThe dilemma Three years ago, I split up with my girlfriend of seven years. I felt very unhappy and put it down to the relationship. She was devastated and wanted to resolve things. But by that stage I’d made my mind up. I’ve lived a quiet, celibate life since, which has given me time to reflect. It struck me that I’d been very selfish – after an initial romantic period where I pulled all manner of stunts to impress her, my effort as a boyfriend tapered down to the bare minimum. Secondly, I realised they had been the best days of my life. We went on amazing adventures which we probably wouldn’t have done otherwise, and had very different skills sets, which complemented each other. After we split up, I made little effort to maintain our friendship, maybe because I felt guilty. Now I’m ashamed of how I treated her and can’t forgive myself. I want to write and apologise, but it sounds weird and inappropriate. It’s hard to write without it sounding like a rapprochement, which it isn’t. Is writing such a letter an appropriate thing to do?Mariella replies Hell, yes! We should all be writing letters to our lovers, ex or otherwise whether it’s just to say hello, to expand on our feelings, because our behaviour has been less than exemplary, or perhaps, as in your case, to say thanks for a union that may be long over but in hindsight appears so much more precious than you realised at the time. There are few things more soul enhancing than knowing that you’ve had a positive impact on another person’s life, that you were appreciated and that whatever may have led to your parting, a residue of love remains scattered over the debris of the relationship.I’d argue we should be writing more missives of the tangible and non-electronic variety. Otherwise when we’re old and grey how will we know that anyone cared for us at all, or remember the names of those who have long since slipped from our lives, emotionally, geographically or permanently? Searching your inbox just isn’t the same as dragging a box from the loft and having your life leap out to meet you. I recently found a folder full of a jumble of past correspondence, covering old love letters and fractious disputes, baffling postcards of some importance at the time and notes from luminaries whose attention I briefly captured for one reason or another – and it proved an emotional couple of hours sifting through those faded but still legible scraps.A message to my hotel room in Morocco in the 1990s read like a title for a novel: “Mr Miss You from Rabat” had called, hurling me back to memories of Robert, the gentleman caller, who’d obviously challenged the translating abilities of the Mamounia operator with his note. On another sliver of near-translucent paper was the marriage proposal I received three decades ago via a switchboard operator at the Parker Meridien in New York who’d hastily typed it up and slipped it under my door with a squashed red rose! There were sexy letters from a lover that made me blush, extolling my “eyes as green as Eastleach water meadows” and a letter from my mother with her overview on the chronology of my peripatetic childhood. There was huge pleasure in revisiting those moments, the words belying the heft of the emotions they bore while the paper carried sensory messages from a past age.Communication today is functional, and deleted within seconds of receipt. Like the photographs that linger in devices that become obsolete faster than we can learn to use them, it seems that the next generation will have to trawl Facebook to take their trips down memory lane. It certainly lacks the romance of a battered box, but since Facebook seems to know more about us than we do ourselves it may nonetheless prove a riveting archive. What a sad loss though to be unable to sniff the leaf, puzzle over the smudges or feel your heart leap at the loop of familiar handwriting decades after it was last viewed. As a regular performer for the brilliantly conceived Letters Live project, I’ve had the pleasure of exposure to some of the finest letters ever written and whether they’re slapping you down, or building you up, they’re a much undervalued art form.So, your heart is in the right place and your compulsion a good one. I’m wondering if your reluctance to write and let her know it wasn’t her fault is because what you are secretly after is a rapprochement. If that’s the case I’m not in a position to judge whether it’s right or wrong, but it does slightly temper my enthusiasm. The greatest gift in the world is a letter that wants nothing but offers a loving thought, or apology, or simply a hello.Keep it simple is my advice don’t try to channel Shelley. If all you want is tell her you regret your behaviour and think of that period with fondness, do just that. Keep it brief, don’t overload the memories, write it from the heart and don’t go into detail about your current state of mind. This letter, if your description is an accurate one, is not about you. So don’t dally another moment, put pen to paper and get your sense of gratitude off your chest and into her heart.

The band’s name is also emblazoned on the back of struggling Stockport County FC’s Edgeley Park stadium and in front of the vintage Wurlitzer organ in this beautiful art deco cinema. In between, there have been two top five albums (including a No 1 with their eponymous debut) and gigs at Wembley Stadium with the Stone Roses, which would have been the stuff of dreams when they were rehearsing in a scaffolding yard and making videos for £60. Along the way, they have transformed from a vaguely psychedelic indie guitar band with bowl cuts into a full-on, shiny, keyboard-dominated pop thing. Where their guitar-based music once had echoes of Pink Floyd, their luxuriant synth-pop now shares DNA with the likes of A-ha, the Human League and Abba. Named after a nearby pub, Blossoms may look like regular northern lads, albeit with hippy hair, but their sound owes much to the kind of keyboard-heavy 80s pop bands with daft names who would gaze moodily into the middle distance under elaborate New Romantic coiffures. Wistfully euphoric opener There’s a Reason Why (I Never Returned Your Calls) and the beautifully lovelorn How Long Will This Last? relocate New Order’s old G-spot on the cusp of agony and ecstasy and set the scene for a steady procession of singable, summery synth-pop. Apart from shouting “Have we got a rowdy balcony?” (which quakes in approval), they mostly just get on and play the songs – 18 of them, with 10 from the new album. On record, Myles Kellock’s fairground keyboards are ramped up for the radio, so it’s nice to hear subtleties such as Charlie Salt’s Chic basslines. Doorsier old songs such as Blow or Cut Me and I’ll Bleed could be a different band, but demonstrate that even when Blossoms were dressing like the Rutles, they had the devotion to verse, chorus and middle eight that is the hallmark of a singles group. Strip away the electronics and I Just Imagined You could be the 1960s Hollies. The deluxe version of Cool Like You does unplug the synth – for lovely acoustic, campfire versions of the songs that are closer to Fleet Foxes than Duran Duran. When Ogden dons an acoustic guitar for a solo spot here, his own Love Talk more than holds its own in a singalong covers medley that hurtles from Baby Bird’s You’re Gorgeous to George Michael’s Last Christmas. The synths are plugged back in and Charlemagne’s big, bouncy riff – the blueprint for Blossoms 2.0 – completes the celebrations in a town that is audibly delighted to have something to sing about."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/34fd3eb5bf1fafad6d6e7058dc57b5998ce2ef8c/0_54_2858_1715/master/2858.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b091b14bbabcd34445e2428f5c8d46e7","title":"local elections brexit little comfort right or left","story":"Entering the West Midlands market town of Nuneaton, there are signs saying “Nuneaton and Bedworth – United to Achieve”. But in the town centre the upbeat slogan does not rest easy with the prevailing mood. The traditional industries that once drove the local economy – coal and textiles – have all but disappeared. It is now a dormitory town for nearby Birmingham and Coventry and people complain that its centre is dead, that its shops are struggling. Paul Bull, the local butcher, is one of those anxious about his and his town’s future. “I’ve seen trade get less and less, year on year,” he says. “There are fewer stalls on market days and they usually pack up early – even the nice weather doesn’t get people out.”At every election, local or national, the attention of politicians and political pundits turns to Nuneaton, a key marginal, a bellwether seat in the heart of England that oscillates between Labour and the Tories. It is a place to gauge the national mood and the political temperature in middle Britain.It expressed its discontent at the 2016 referendum by voting by 6634 for Brexit. Last week, after eight years of Conservative government at Westminster, and against the backdrop of crises over immigration and the NHS, and deadlock on Brexit, Labour had hoped to benefit from Theresa May’s troubles and consolidate its position on the local council.Yet Labour went backwards. Its tally of seats fell from 25 to 17 while the Conservatives’ went up from seven to 16, depriving Jeremy Corbyn’s party of control.Peter Kang, 48, a financial planning and analysis manager in the town, has voted Ukip in recent elections. But he now looks to the Tories to deliver on Brexit. “There’s no point voting Ukip because they’re just a spent force. It’s about making sure the Tories do what they’re supposed to do over Brexit: voting Labour doesn’t do that.”Yet that Ukip idend for the Conservatives – on a night when the party Nigel Farage once led lost 123 seats and held just three – could become a curse as well as a blessing, at least for those Tories who fear the consequences of an all-singing all-dancing hard Brexit. As the smoke cleared after an election night with no clear victor, one theme of capital importance was being identified by polling expert Professor John Curtice. The mass defection of the Ukip vote to the Tories in Leave areas could store up huge problems for Theresa May, placing the prime minister under even more pressure to deliver the kind of clean Brexit that her new backers, the ex-Ukippers, crave.“The vote that is helping to buoy up Theresa May’s popularity is very much a Leave vote,” Curtice told the BBC. “If the Conservatives are going to hang on to that vote, they are going to have to deliver a Brexit that, broadly speaking, appeals to the sympathies and instinct of Leave voters.”After a week in which pro-Brexit ministers had already quashed plans for a customs partnership with the EU that the prime minister hoped would help unlock the Irish border question, Curtice’s assessment was further music to their ears. Boris Johnson quickly took up the theme on Twitter – that Tories had to reject a customs union or partnership and buy fully into a hard, clean Brexit because that was what voters said they wanted.“Jeremy Corbyn has been abandoned in many Leave areas – his pledge to stay in the customs union means he is not trusted to deliver Brexit. PM’s clear Mansion House vision for leaving the single market and customs union a key part of Tory electoral success,” the foreign secretary tweeted.But there is a problem that will not go away. Last week the Irish government made clear again that it will veto any Brexit deal that fails to deliver a frictionless border between north and south. Neither in Brussels nor in Dublin, nor in soft-Brexit circles in Westminster, can anyone see how that frictionless border can be achieved without some form of customs union – one that ever more people who vote Tory say would amount to a Brexit betrayal.While Tory successes such as Nuneaton may create their own problems, Labour is contemplating a set of results which convey some disturbing messages, and deepen its own angst over what to say and do about Brexit.Labour scored some notable successes, robbing the Tories of control of Trafford in Manchester and taking Plymouth. It performed better in London than at any time since 1971. But there were similar stories to that of Nuneaton in too many other areas of provincial England where it had hoped to do well.Some Labour MPs and council candidates in the party’s ranks said the results were nowhere near good enough for an opposition fighting a governing party that had been in office for so long, and that never seems able to wrestle free of crises. On Saturday Labour’s Angela Smith, a member of the influential parliamentary committee representing backbenchers, said it was time for the party to “take a long hard look at ourselves as many voters don’t like what they see”. Former shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna said: “After eight years of Tory misrule, most people thoroughly tired of austerity, a disastrous Brexit negotiation, the Windrush outrage and four cabinet resignations in six months, we should be well ahead and we are not. If we don’t ask why, then we risk losing a fourth time at the next general election.”Labour lost three councillors in Derby, ceding overall control, as well as losing their leader, Ranjit Banwait. In Basildon the Conservatives took control of the council as they picked up half of 10 seats lost by Ukip. In Redditch, another Leave-voting area, Labour struggled, losing three seats while the Conservatives picked up four to take control of the council.Just as damaging to morale was Labour’s failure to take, or make the hoped-for headway in, any of the traditional Conservative strongholds in London – Wandsworth, Westminster, and Barnet (where the row over antisemitism in the party had a devastating effect). The relief among Tories, even though they lost 33 seats, was palpable. The national picture showed them neck and neck with Labour, but they had outperformed expectations that had been pegged very low.The Liberal Democrats had cause for celebration too, retaking Richmond and Kingston upon Thames councils.Theresa May looked happier than for months as she congratulated Tories in Wandsworth and taunted Labour. “Labour thought they could take control. This was one of their top targets and they threw everything at it, but they failed,” she said on Friday.Corbyn will address the parliamentary party a week tomorrow and will face calls for changes of direction on many fronts. Labour MPs say the crisis over antisemitism needs addressing urgently and is damaging the party more by the week.Gillian Lazarus, a former Labour supporter in the borough, told the Observer: “I’ve always voted Labour and have been a member off and on. I come from a Labour family and am the granddaughter of Jewish immigrants. I could not vote for Labour in the council elections, because I have witnessed the rampant and unremitting antisemitism coming from the Labour environment.”For its part, Labour desperately requires a strategy that stiffens its Remain resolve without alienating voters in the passionately pro-Leave towns of provincial England.Calls are growing from Labour’s Remain majority for it to be bolder in backing a soft Brexit and membership of the single market. That, they say, would open up clear water between the two largest parties. “Why did we fail to do better in London and why did the Lib Dems get back in the game in areas we need to be progressing in?” asked one Labour frontbencher on Friday. “Because people think we have no policy on Brexit that is different from the Tories. Remainers don’t think we are with them. We are a pro-EU party without a pro-EU policy.”Key parliamentary votes are approaching. A group of Labour peers is protesting this weekend that Corbyn is not backing their efforts in the Lords to promote amendments to Brexit legislation that would allow the UK to effectively stay in the single market. Corbyn fears any move that would appear anti-Brexit would hit Labour support hard in the many Leave areas where it routinely returns MPs – a view backed by many of those MPs themselves. While the likes of Umunna push for soft Brexit, or no Brexit, other senior figures in the party argue the reverse.As a crunch period approaches, in which Britain’s future trade agreements with the EU must be agreed one way or the other, the time for judicious equivocation is almost over. Last Thursday’s poll suggests that, for both of the main parties, there is no easy option available. But an option must be chosen.Kate Hoey, Labour MP for Vauxhall and leading pro-Brexit campaigner“These results suggest many ex-Labour Ukip voters don’t yet trust us to genuinely honour the referendum result. While this is the case we simply cannot win the seats we need to form a government. Those who voted Leave in Labour areas want us to stick to our manifesto promises and not be pushed into a Brexit that is in name only.”Chuka Umunna, Labour MP for Streatham and leading anti-Brexit campaigner“Neither major party can treat these results as any kind of endorsement. On Brexit, clearly the country is not coming together behind the prime minister’s hard-Brexit plan or, frankly, the alternative Labour is offering. People deserve leadership on Brexit, the biggest issue of our time – which will fundamentally impact on our ability to end Tory austerity, reduce inequality and poverty, and spread opportunity – and we have yet to see it.”Bernard Jenkin, Conservative MP for Harwich and North Essex“Be wary of drawing conclusions from these results about Brexit. Either Conservatives deliver what the people voted for, or we risk looking indecisive and paralysed, which would never be rewarded at the ballot box. Most people who voted remain want us to get on with Brexit. Governments are rarely rewarded for a reform programme which drags on without conclusion.”Sir Vince Cable, leader of the Liberal Democrats“We enjoyed a number of gains in areas that voted heavily to leave the EU, including Sunderland and Hull, as well as Remain-leaning areas that commentators would have expected us to do well in. This shows that people respect parties if they have the courage of their convictions, even if they disagree with them. It also reflects that while there can be these disagreements, it is still the case that people correctly place high value on the ability of a party to effectively run a council.”Anna Soubry, Tory MP for Broxtowe and anti-hard-Brexit campaigner“Bins not Brexit won it for the Conservatives in this week’s local elections. That view may not be shared by Tory councillors who lost their seat in places like South Cambridgeshire, Richmond and Wandsworth, but by and large it was hard graft on local issues by moderate, competent Conservatives that saw off Labour and in places even won us seats. The real story is Labour’s failure to make the sort of progress we feared they would, and which they should have made.”Suzanne Evans, former vice-chair of Ukip“The collapse of the Ukip vote worked mostly in the Conservatives’ favour in this election, as the bulk of the Leave vote went to them. This sends a clear message to Theresa May. She must deliver a clean Brexit, one in which we are fully independent from the EU – no fudges or compromises – or Ukip will rise again, strongly, and swiftly, and the Tories will face a massive loss of electoral support at the next general election.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/207c1c201f34f7564b7b3a2c07c933539698887c/0_0_4421_2652/master/4421.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bee7f93fac21c4e4300ab0007bce5831","title":"local election verdicts too much negative spin","story":"It is not accurate to write of “the Tories’ narrow retention of fortress London boroughs like Westminster” (Editorial, 5 May). In 2014, there was a 44-16 Tory-Labour split on Westminster council. It is now 41-19. Labour had a golden chance to make bigger inroads in Westminster, which voted by 53,928 to 24,268 against leaving Europe.Labour sent all its chiefs, from Jeremy Corbyn and Jon Lansman to most of the shadow cabinet, and celebrities like Owen Jones, to campaign in Westminster. They were welcomed but they refused to talk about Brexit, attack Mrs May’s disastrous handling of the dossier, or highlight the serious economic damage that will be done to London by leaving the single market and bringing in a new immigration control bureaucracy of Home Office jobsworths to make life miserable for anyone who wants to employ EU\u0026nbspcitizens.So, on the biggest constitutional, economic, social, cultural and geopolitical issue of the day, Labour had nothing to say to voters in a council area greatly affected by leaving Europe. That may explain why Labour won only three more seats and have left the Tories firmly, not narrowly, in control of Westminster.Denis MacShane London• As an activist who knocked on doors in Barnet for the Labour party, I must take issue with Adam Langleben’s assertion that “every Jewish Labour household we visited, people said, ‘Not this time’” (Labour antisemitism scandal is blamed for Tory victory in ‘easyCouncil’ Barnet, 5 May).I came from neighbouring Brent but, recognising Barnet’s significance, and being Jewish myself, I canvassed several times, often accompanied by other Jewish activists. On Thursday I helped get out the vote in Adam’s ward, arriving at 10.30am, and knocking on my last door at 9.45pm. At least once I was in a team with Adam.I don’t dispute that Adam had negative reactions from Jewish voters, or that the perception of Labour party antisemitism played a crucial role in this result. But Adam cannot know about every Jewish household. I met Jewish voters who were still prepared to vote Labour. Rabbi Danny Rich, the chief executive of Liberal Judaism, was elected a councillor, certainly with Jewish support. In Childs Hill ward, Labour had its first win in 40 years. I cannot believe that no Jewish voters had a part in that.The perception of antisemitism in the Labour party should not be minimised. Where that perception is accurate, antisemites should be expelled. But we should also be careful not to give credence to the myth that antisemitism is endemic or rife in the party. The tragedy of the situation in Barnet is at least partly explained by the willingness of some to spread this myth in order to do harm to Labour. Dr Ian Saville London• As a defeated Labour candidate in Thursday’s council elections, I don’t think your report (Victories in remain areas boost Cable, 5\u0026nbspMay) does justice to the stunning victory of Lib Dems taking control of South Cambridgeshire. They secured 30 out of 45 seats, 13 with female councillors, under a female leader, Bridget Smith, reducing the Tories to 11, despite a good turnout. This is a prosperous constituency, long considered a safe Tory seat, formerly Andrew Lansley’s, currently occupied by Heidi Allen MP.Yes, South Cambridgeshire voted heavily remain, but on the doorstep big issues of the county and district failures in terms of potholes, housing, rural services, deeply flawed infrastructure planning and bitterly opposed busways were writ large.Clearly, considerable tactical voting was deployed to defeat the Tories, together with reorganised wards and boundaries leading people to rethink who deserved their vote. That seems more significant for the Tory party than any boost to Vince Cable (however otherwise deserved).Roger TomlinsonCoton, Cambridgeshire• Much commentary has centred on Labour’s win in Plymouth, forgetting to mention that Plymouth voted heavily to leave, and that over the years the council has swung between Labour, Conservative and no overall control.If I still had a vote in my home town I would be weary of hearing about the northern powerhouse, so beloved of the Tories while the south-west is ignored, and sick to death at having, as a taxpayer, to subsidise their HS2 vanity project while transport links beyond Exeter are pitiful.And of course there is defence and fears that the Devonport naval base will be further reduced since 2010 the Tories have not put the money where their mouth is. This is most recently exemplified by concern about the future of HMS Albion and HMS Bulwark, over whose fate Conservative MP Johnny Mercer and Labour MP Luke Pollard have joined forces. Though why anyone concerned about this country’s defence and security and with their head screwed on would vote for Corbyn mystifies me.Elizabeth BalsomLondon• Very disappointed by the pessimistic analysis from the  of the local election results in England for Labour.In reality, Labour now has around 900 more seats than the Tories, has control of about twice as many councils, has gained its best result in London since 1971, and has managed to gain more seats in Westminster and\u0026nbspWandsworth than at any time since 1986.Could they have done better? Of course. Is this a bad result for Labour? By no means. The negative spin in the media against Labour is not justified when seen against actual results.If this were a general election, Labour would be the largest party in the House of Commons. Joshua ReynoldsTredegar, Gwent• The real victors in the local elections in England were Labour with their 2,350 seats over the Conservatives’ 1,332 seats. Also, Labour won control of 74 councils, compared to the Conservatives’ 46. Further, the Conservatives only won seven out of 32 London borough councils and now control only one out of 36 metropolitan district councils in England.Leslie MutchDingwall, Ross \u0026amp Cromarty• Ukip’s Black Death metaphor may be more prescient than any complacency about the party’s abysmal local election results (Ukip: Like the Black Death, we’ll be back, says official, 5 May). Corbyn isn’t reaching former Labour supporters in the Midlands and the North. With the most incompetent government in my lifetime negotiating our future, a Brexit likely to appeal to anybody looks out of the question. If the boils of poverty, inequality and racism that Ukip has exploited cannot be lanced, the plague will return. Next time it may be something much more deadly.Philip KerridgeBodmin, Cornwall• Ukip is like the Black Death? Let’s just hope this is more accurate than most Ukip statements.

It is reasonable to meet the needs of known autistic iniduals attending an event but not to assume all “autistic” needs are common.A withdrawal space may be useful for all (although perhaps then not so quiet). Some autistic iniduals find it difficult to cope with fluorescent lighting andor high glare or contrast, but others are disturbed and disoriented by low levels of lighting, especially if this results in more shadows. Many autistic iniduals have learned to cope with clapping if they know when it will happen and it does not go on for too long. Some are excited by “flapping” and feel compelled to join in when exposed to it, often becoming disoriented and upset.The danger is that these changes give the impression of dealing with the problem of access, whereas the effect is greater segregation. Will not special autism sessions increase intolerance at other times?Most of the things autistic iniduals find intolerable (“lift” music everywhere, crowded aisles in supermarkets with unwanted intrusive advertisements, sudden, badly articulated announcements, etc) are also disliked by the rest of us.

The daughter of an Irish mother and Ghanian father, she spent the first couple of years of her life with her extended family in Ghana before growing up in south-east London and holidaying in Ireland to visit her maternal grandmother. Food – heaps of food from cooks who wouldn’t tolerate anyone leaving the dinner table hungry – features strongly in childhood memories of long summer days in Bantry Bay, County Cork. “Some of my earliest memories are very specifically about the smell of food cooking in Ireland – cabbage, black pudding frying. My aunt had a butcher’s shop so I was used to seeing a pig’s head on the counter and cows’ tongues hanging on hooks. We ate lots of offal, but we also used to go to the beach to hunt for crabs, to the river for salmon, and to the mountain to dig out peat for the fire – that smell always unlocks memories of my mum and her family. Peat, the smell of the sea, the morning dew – that landscape had its own special smell, a smell of freshness.”Food from a very different landscape was how, as a keen home cook, Adjonyoh later discovered and explored her Ghanian identity. The mysterious ingredients her father brought home to cook with were the same ones she would use to create dishes for her pop-up supper club in Brixton and her debut cookbook, Zoe’s Ghana Kitchen, published to great acclaim last year. These staples of Ghanian cookery were, she says, her sensory “access points” to finding out about her African heritage.“My father would be cooking with things I’d never heard of I didn’t know what they were,” she recalls. “Before I could taste them, I’d be aware of their unfamiliar smell and that’s a really strong memory of him in the kitchen – I’d want to eat something just from the aroma while it cooked.” After travelling to Ghana as an adult, and experimenting with traditional dishes back at home in her Hackney Wick kitchen, she started cooking updated versions of the recipes for friends. She sourced produce from Dalston’s Ridley Road market, getting to know the Ghanian women who sold from kiosks. “Shopping there, for me, was like being transported to another world,” she recalls. “They would help me identify ingredients and tell me how to cook them. The smells, flavours and colours were just amazing.”Some of the smells when she visited Ghana were a little too amazing. At a market with her aunt, Adjonyoh asked what a particularly pungent smell was. “What smell?” said her aunt, and carried on shopping. It turned out to be some cowhide drying in the sun, ready for eating later. Laughing, she recalls her aunt’s brief explanation: “‘Oh that’s wele,’ and I said: ‘What the hell is wele?’” The flavour wasn’t as strong as the smell, once she plucked up the courage to try it. “I was a bit wary of it, to be honest.”While her father’s cooking was hearty and traditional, it was a case of “there you are, get stuck in, don’t bother with cutlery”, she explains.Adjonyoh adapted recipes to make them visually appealing (gloopy okra was transformed into okra fries) because of the adage about people eating with their eyes. But it was the smell of her peanut butter stew – based on her father’s legendary groundnut soup – that drew people to come and buy food from an impromptu stall at her flat. “The dish has an amazing smell profile from the blend of spices,” she says. “People were asking what the smell was, how the dish was made. It was very much the smell that brought people to my door.”A career in food wasn’t the plan, but the clamour for her African cooking paid her way through an MA in creative writing: “It was just the demand. I loved the cooking and so did all the people who tried it.” The supper club, with just six tables and housed in a shipping container, was born, and for three years celebrated the variety, richness and abundance of Ghanian food. Now it’s time for a new adventure, with Adjonyoh travelling across Kenya and Uganda for a month to meet female chefs, cooks and food bloggers: “I want to understand each country’s relationship with food, the history of that, their distinctive produce and why it is that their food industry is largely dominated by women.” The journey will once again unite her passions for cooking, writing and travel. “I can’t wait to soak up the sights and sounds of two new food cultures,” she says. “When you’re travelling, all your senses are heightened. The first thing that always draws me in is food smells. No doubt I’ll be led by my nose again.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b77d0a429a164e7085ceb936ddf800e37f748e59/0_300_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fb271976ebfa9602c59d30e032a68384","title":"low turnout lebanon election voter scepticism","story":"First parliamentary poll in nine years viewed as unlikely to shake up country’s political orderLow turnout marred Lebanon’s first parliamentary poll in nine years, with voters seemingly unconvinced that a new ballot – and system of voting – could shake up a political order that has remained beholden to regional interests since the end of the civil war.Many who did not vote said they believed the election had been predetermined by the very exiles promising change and that a new, complex electoral law intended to inject fresh voices had instead cemented the old guard.“If I thought standing in a two-hour line to vote would change anything, I would have,” said Mohammed Obeida, a Beirut resident. “I would have taken my grandad too. He stayed home because he’s seen it all before.”Early indications suggested that two major political blocs, the pro-western March 14 alliance, and the pro-Iran and Syria March 8, may have been diminished, a result that – if borne out – could unsettle an already fragile domestic scene that has been dominated by former warlords from the civil war era.Both factions started as protest movements in the aftermath of the assassination of the former prime minister Rafik Hariri, and have been central to Lebanese society since. However, the new electoral law, which replaced a winner-takes-all system with proportional representation requiring a choice for a list as well as an inidual candidate, is thought likely to weaken the two blocs.March 14, which is dominated by Sunni Muslims and half the country’s Christians, appeared most at risk of fragmenting, with waning Saudi backing and growing disaffection leading some Sunnis to look for new power bases. Saad Hariri’s hold on the prime ministership is not likely to be threatened. However, ahead of the election he faced a mounting challenge from Sunni figures whose support he could have banked on earlier in his tenure.Hezbollah, a dominant player in Lebanon’s political landscape, had also faced dissent within its usually disciplined ranks, particularly over its ongoing involvement in Syria where up to 1,800 members have been killed supporting Bashar al-Assad. However, the militia cum political bloc appeared to have performed well in its strongholds and could emerge from the ballot with an even tighter hold on Lebanon’s affairs.Such a result would unsettle neighbouring Israel and Saudi Arabia, which scaled back its long-term support for Hariri when Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman summonsed him to Riyadh last November and ordered him to resign, after complaining that his government had given cover to Hezbollah – the most important arm of Iran’s foreign policy. Hariri was eventually able to leave Riyadh, but his relationship with the Saudi leadership has remained strained, and the Saudis remained largely disengaged from the election process.“If the Saudis stayed in this, things may have been better for the Sunnis,” said Othman Skaf, from north Lebanon. “They left because the country was being eaten by Hezbollah. But by leaving they ensured that would happen even quicker.”Nadim Shehadi, the director of the Fares Centre for Eastern Mediterranean Studies at Tufts University in Boston, said: “The big picture is that the Sunnis being defeated regionally translated into fragmentation and crisis of leadership on the ground. This is not good because the frustration could produce more support to radicals. The alternative leadership would be more radical.”While the election was contested largely on local issues, such as rampant corruption, a moribund economy and poor civic services, regional affairs loomed large. A raging war in Syria, the ongoing fallout from the US-led invasion of Iraq, wars against Islamic State and in Syria and the displacement of more than half of Syria’s population have fed disaffection across Lebanon.Sunni populations have felt especially disgruntled, with senior leaders and residents claiming they are on the losing side of a regional ledger that has seen Shia Iran prosper in three countries at their expense."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5325058944c25af852069a5acc8c75f527c375c9/0_43_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0895e1345e570bb0fc1cc556db4c851a","title":"qatar blockade unexpected new vision isolation","story":"Enforced isolation has given the emirate confidence to pursue a political and cultural rebootFor most of the past year the city-state of Qatar, the wealthiest peninsula on the planet, has been exploring the law of unintended consequences. The trigger for that came last June, when Qatar’s closest neighbours, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Bahrain and the UAE, escalated a simmering disquiet about the Gulf state’s role in the region to implement a full land and air blockade.Overnight, planes and cargo ships heading for Qatar were erted, all diplomatic links were cut and Qatar’s sole land border, with Saudi Arabia, was closed. Even camels were not spared the politics – 12,000 Qatari animals were forcibly repatriated.The stated aim for the blockade – which came with a 10-day ultimatum of 13 unlikely demands – was a protest against what was seen as Qatar’s singular role in “funding terrorism” (the Saudi line that Donald Trump swallowed and retweeted whole). Politically, it seemed rather an attempt to humiliate the sheikhdom and call it to heel. In the event, something like the opposite of that expectation has unfolded.Far from destabilising Qatar’s ruling al-Thani family, resistance to the ultimatum has lent it an “us against the world” authority. Among the 313,000 native Qataris (in a population of 2.6 million) a cult of personality has grown around the youthful emir, Sheikh Tamim, whose idealised portrait now gazes across the Gulf from the steel and glass skyscrapers of Doha, and is almost ubiquitous in the back window of the 4x4s that cruise the capital’s six-lane corniche.Isolation has also, it seems, acted as a catalyst to Qatar’s long-term vision for itself. One of the inbuilt ironies of the richest per capita state on earth was that, ever since it discovered and exploited its vast natural gas reserves, there has been little native necessity to drive invention. The al-Thanis’ stated goal has been to create a erse knowledge economy that lasts beyond the gas reserves. As Sheikha Hind, younger sister of the emir, explained to me in Doha last week in a rare interview, money – and the incentive of capital projects such as the 2022 World Cup – solves only some of those skills shortages.“It is not a secret that we are a wealthy society and that maybe nobody even needs to work,” she said. “But knowing that you can contribute in developing your country, and allow it to become even more prominent, is something everyone feels pride in. If anything, the blockade helped that. We see a big opportunity to be self-sustainable.”Qatar’s modern nation-building aspirations were first expressed by Sheikha Hind’s parents. While her father developed the partnership with Iran that could exploit the natural gas fields, her mother, Sheikha Moza, established the multibillion-dollar Qatar Foundation in order to transform education, particularly for women. Sheikha Hind, 34, a mother of five herself, was one of the first beneficiaries of “Education City” and has for the past three years been chief executive of the Qatar Foundation.From the balcony of its offices you can see the glass and marble evidence of that ambition in the futuristic campuses of a dozen “partner universities” that radiate outward. Each was persuaded here for its particular expertise in building capacity that Qataris need: Georgetown for its programme in government, Texas A\u0026ampM for engineering, and so on.The newest addition to Education City is the stunning Qatari National Library, designed by the Dutch architect Rem Koolhaas: a huge, welcoming building in which book stacks rise all around a central area that includes an open theatre and cafe, like terraces on backlit hillsides. There has been no library tradition in the Gulf, so Koolhaas’s idea was to create a space that is immediately understandable. Fifty-one thousand Qataris have already taken membership and the children’s library has proved particularly successful. In the few months since opening, every one of the 150,000 books on its shelves has been borrowed at least once.Along with those silver terraces of books, at subterranean level, in what look like excavated catacombs made of Iranian marble, the library houses an expensively acquired collection of rare manuscripts and calligraphy relating to the Arab world. This collection has been assembled in the same acquisitive spirit in which the al-Thani billions have filled its IM Pei-designed Museum of Islamic Art: to establish Doha as the modern intellectual capital of the Arab world. Later this year a new National Museum, shaped as a series of giant intersecting discs, designed by Jean Nouvel, will add another dimension to that claim.There is a blatant “look at us” attitude in some of this, but also the message that the territory that Qatar aims to colonise is as much cultural as economic. The al-Thanis have made headlines buying blingy stakes in such global landmarks as the Empire State Building, Harrods and the Shard – and splashing out ostentatiously on the world’s most expensive paintings ($250m for Cezanne’s The Card Players) and footballers ($262m to bring superstar Neymar to Qatari-owned Paris St Germain). But they have also long realised that it is whoever controls the story who generally wields power.That principle was first tested 22 years ago when the then emir established and funded the Arab broadcaster al-Jazeera. The harsh journalistic light the television station has shone on the internal politics of other Arab nations (and the relatively soft focus it gives to Qatar) is at the heart of the current enmity and blockade. One of the 13 ultimatum demands of the blockaders was that the broadcaster be shut down.The Saudi-led outrage at al-Jazeera’s reporting and editorial stance deepened during the Arab spring, when the station (and Doha’s ruling family) threw its support behind the popular uprising, rather than the established ruling powers. This stance was seen as part of a wider pattern in which Qatar seeks to build power at home while fomenting dissent abroad, aiming to be all things to all people: keeping trade and diplomatic channels open to Israel while openly funding Hamas hosting the major American air base, al-Udeid, while giving support to the Islamist Muslim Brotherhood offering to broker peace talks on Syria while giving refuge to known al-Qaida affiliates.The dean, Everette E Dennis, a distinguished observer of the fourth estate’s role in extending civil society in the former eastern bloc as well as in the US, had expected a fight over censorship when he came to Doha. He has found, he says, that “there has never been a single intrusion into what we teach and how we teach it – the full range of social issues that would be part of the conversation on an American campus are freely discussed here”.Initially, he found some unwillingness to challenge authority among the students,who come from across the region and beyond, but that quickly dissipated. He suggests that the gains of regular press freedoms have begun to be appreciated in Qatar (despite the fact that, since 2016, the authorities have blocked Doha News, an online outlet that offered more critical reporting of their actions).There has been learning on both sides, he suggests. The university has established the first system of press accreditation, for example, and lobbying from graduates of the programme has coincided with the establishment of a properly functioning government information office. That spirit of critical enquiry, he suggests, has also prompted the ruling family and its government to address international concerns, in particular over the shameful treatment of migrant labour in Qatar on capital projects for the World Cup. They have responded to concerns with a minimum wage and new policy over housing programmes and healthcare that have been given a qualified welcome by the International Labour Organisation of the UN.In the dean’s view the blockade has again accelerated this transparency. At the same time as it has become illegal in Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and the UAE for citizens to question or criticise even the idea of the blockade, Qatar is lifting visa restrictions and attempting to brand itself as a home of greater free speech. While Saudi Arabia congratulates itself on finally allowing women to drive, Sheikha Hind can point to a majority of female undergraduates across all departments, including engineering, at Education City.In that sense, I wonder if the Qatari ruling family is secretly grateful for the blockade in sharpening a perceived cultural ide between itself and its Wahhabi neighbours. Has it proved more an opportunity than a crisis?“I won’t lie to you and tell you we are OK with the blockade,” Sheikha Hind says, “absolutely not. We have had students here who are terribly affected by it – whole families have been torn apart. It is a sad situation we are in.” She hopes, along with every other Qatari I speak to, that there is a resolution to the conflict soon. Still, she says, “if anything, the push we always had here for self-sustainability is just exploding now.” The goal has not changed, she suggests, “but now we are running rather than walking”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d9e801d7fd8a832272ef4ab0d9f8088383448346/0_0_2493_1496/master/2493.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=462b2bd81538d3f28c005768bec2a0a2","title":"thai activists claim victory over luxury housing on forest land","story":"Government bows to protesters and agrees to shelve development near Chiang MaiEnvironmental activists in the northern Thai city of Chiang Mai claimed victory on Sunday after the country’s military government agreed not to continue the development of luxury property on forest land. The decision follows a demonstration in Chiang Mai last week in which more than 1,000 people protested against the construction of a luxury development earmarked to house judges in the foothills of the Doi Suthep mountains. The demonstration was one of the largest since Thailand’s junta took power in a 2014 coup. It was also one of a growing number of anti-government protests, including in Bangkok, that are putting pressure on the government before a general election planned for early 2019. Green ribbons symbolising the environmental movement have appeared in public places in Chiang Mai, including on lamp posts and on cars, over the past week. The Thai prime minister, Prayuth Chan-ocha sent Suwaphan Tanyuvardhana, one of his senior officials, to Chiang Mai on Sunday to talk to protest leaders. “We have concluded that no one will be living in this housing estate,” Suwaphan said after a meeting with the activists. The area will eventually be restored to the forest, he added. The government would form a committee with activists and representatives from the local community to determine the future use of the land currently under development, which includes 45 houses, he said.A decision will be taken later this week, but construction of the homes already under way would have to continue for the government to honour its agreement with the construction firm involved. Activists hailed the decision as a victory. “What we have now is a promise that Doi Suthep forest will be restored,” said Teerasak Roopsuwan, one of the movement’s leaders. “I think this could be a model for other parts of the country that public projects must not only be legal, but they must also consider local people’s opinions.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4d7aab1b33b857ce8ce1526be3b41cfa5783c122/0_717_2252_1351/master/2252.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8b9cbc44294d344c4d5f70323d863b87","title":"turkey fresh military actions kurdish militants erdogan syria iraq","story":"Operations in Syria and Iraq will continue, Turkish president says at election manifesto launchThe Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdogğan, has promised new military operations against Kurdish militants along the country’s border in Syria and Iraq as he presented his election manifesto.Speaking in front of thousands of supporters in Istanbul on Sunday, Erdoğan described next month’s snap presidential and parliamentary polls as a “milestone” for a strong Turkey. The country would “take the stage as a global power”, he vowed.Erdoğan has called elections for 24 June, more than a year earlier than planned – a move analysts say is partly aimed at capitalising on nationalist sentiment running high after a successful campaign to oust Syrian Kurdish militia from the border enclave of Afrin.“In the new term, Turkey will add new operations to the Euphrates Shield and Olive Branch operations,” Erdoğan said, in reference to a 2016 cross-border offensive in Syria and to the Afrin assault. “The operations will continue until not one terrorist is left.”The elections are hugely important as they will transform Turkey’s governing system into an executive presidency, a constitutional change that was narrowly approved in a referendum last year. As part of the changes, the office of the prime minister will be abolished and its powers transferred largely to the president.An alliance of opposition parties argue that the new system will lead to one-man rule and have vowed to return Turkey to a parliamentary system with strong checks and balances.Aiming to ease fears over the economy, Erdoğan promised lower interest rates and inflation and to reduce the current account deficit. “The Turkish economy will be more resistant to outer shocks and financial blows. Turkey will be even more attractive to investors,” the president said.He said Turkey had never abandoned its goal of European Union membership.Meanwhile, Muharrem İnce, the presidential hopeful nominated by Turkey’s main opposition Republican People’s party to run against Erdoğan, threatened to hold campaign events in front of television stations to protest against the scarce media coverage of his initial election rally.With Turkey’s media largely controlled by the government or owned by businesses close to Erdoğan, opposition parties have complained of an uneven playing field.İnce, a 54-year-old former physics teacher known for his combative rhetoric, tweeted: “We will come to power by battling this media system. If this embargo on the opposition ordered by (Erdoğan’s) palace continues, we will hold our meetings in front of the television stations.” "},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"TV presenter Robert Peston makes the claim during interview with Jacob Rees-MoggReports of desertions and attempted mutinies emerge from German intelligence reportsGroup embarks on 12-day trip to push for repeal of \u0026lsquounforgiving\u0026rsquo Eighth AmendmentThe man in his mid-30s was fatally injured when his vehicle hit a pole in FinglasYou can\u0026rsquot penalise people overnight for a change in government policy, says NaughtenGrowing consensus that political parties will back President for second termThe current and past pupils of Willow Park and Blackrock College hope to raise \u0026euro60,000An accused person \u0026lsquohas no legal right\u0026rsquo to testify by video link in a trial in absentiaFrancis Endicott took ill while taking part in Pink Ribbon event for breast cancer researchGarda\u0026iacute appeal for witnesses after injured man is found on Firhouse RoadBanners of protest and revolution go on display at Liberty Hall as part of MayfestTony O\u0026rsquoBrien had been due to go at end of July but is taking \u0026lsquoaccumulated leave\u0026rsquoFormer intercounty footballer described as one of the most admired figures in GAA history38-year-old left with \u0026lsquovery serious\u0026rsquo head injury following assault in Strabane, Co TyroneSingle-vehicle incident in Dungiven follows fatal crash in ColeraineMichael McCarrick, an ESB employee who lived at Belleek, lost his life on FridayPro-choice group launches new campaign as referendum approachesDaughter of Ann Lovett\u0026rsquos boyfriend says \u0026lsquosilence an enormous burden for so many\u0026rsquo"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3485898.1525609846!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"head of hse to leave post on july 1st government minister confirms","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMr O’Brien’s contract as director general of the HSE had been due to expire at the end of July.The head of the HSE Tony O’Brien is to leave his post at the beginning of July, a Government Minister has said.Mr O’Brien has faced strong criticism in the wake of the cervical screening controversy with Sinn Féin set to table a motion of no confidence in him in the Dáil this week.Mr O’Brien’s contract as director general of the HSE had been due to expire at the end of July.However, Minister of State at the Department of Health Jim Daly said on Sunday that Mr O’Brien would be leaving a number of weeks earlier than anticipated. Mr Daly confirmed to RTÉ’s The Week in Politics that Mr O’Brien will now leave his post at the start of July, a month earlier than had been expected.“That is correct, yeah,” Mr Daly said. “He is taking some leave that has accumulated in his favour so he’ll be leaving a bit earlier.”Mr Daly also said a new HSE board should be in place by next January. Vicky Phelan, the terminally-ill woman whose legal action revealed the smear test scandal, has repeatedly called for Mr O’Brien to resign.Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald said bringing forward Mr O’Brien’s departure by a number of weeks was not satisfactory.She said Mr O’Brien availing of his holiday entitlements was hardly an adequate or appropriate response to the current debacle over cervical cancer screening. She said if the Government was not prepared to hold the director general of the HSE to account when something had gone catastrophically wrong, then all its promises of change and reform in the health service was just talk.Fianna Fáil TD and chairman of the Oireachtas finance committee John McGuinness said Mr O’Brien should go immediately. “I believe that Tony O’Brien should resign with immediate effect,” Mr McGuinness told RTÉ.“I do not think he should have the opportunity to dictate the time of his departure”, he added. In recent days Ministers have avoided expressing confidence in the HSE chief, while Opposition figures have called for him to resign or be sacked. At the Oireachtas Health Committee on Wednesday, Mr O’Brien rejected calls from several TDs to step down.Tánaiste Simon Coveney declined to express full support for Mr O’Brien on Thursday. “Tony O’Brien’s focus on providing as much information as possible and putting systems in place that can co-operate fully with that independent investigation is probably the best way that he can assist in this process, rather than stepping aside from it,” Mr Coveney said.

Photograph: ITVTV presenter Robert Peston has suggested that Ireland has “undermined” British governments for at least the last century. In an interview with prominent Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg, Mr Peston described the Tory as a keen student of British history, before saying: “Ireland has undermined, the issue of Ireland in so many different ways has undermined, British governments, you know, going back well over 100 years now.” Mr Rees-Mogg responded by suggesting that the issue of Ireland had undermined British politics for “much more than 100 years. It’s a very long and complex history.”The interview took place on Mr Peston’s eponymous Peston on Sunday programme on ITV. Mr Peston suggested to Mr Rees-Mogg that in the absence of a post-Brexit customs arrangement, any Border checks could “undermine the peace that . . . has been so beneficial over the past few years”. Mr Rees-Mogg responded by stating that it was “deeply disgraceful that people who wish to keep us in the European Union are threatening the spectre of a return to terror to try and make people accept their views”. He said that those who raised the prospect of a return to violence “are all committed Europeans, some of them in receipt of pensions from the EU. “I think it’s deeply disgraceful to raise the spectre of lawlessness and of murder in pursuit of a political objective.” Mr Rees-Mogg pointed to the pro-Brexit stance of one of the key architects of the Belfast Agreement, former UUP leader David Trimble. Mr Trimble has said he does not share the contention of some Remainers that a return to a hard Border could undermine the peace process. Mr Rees-Mogg is one of the foremost Tories advocating that the UK leave both the customs union and the single market. He suggested during the interview that leaving both entities while keeping a soft Border between the Republic and Northern Ireland would be “very straightforward”, as neither the British nor the Irish government wanted to impose a hard Border. He cited claims by the head of HM Revenue and Customs, Jon Thompson, that a Border already exists between the Republic and the North. “It’s important to remember that there already is a Border: there is a Border for currency there is a Border for immigration there is a Border for excise, and there is a Border for VAT. But this does not need a physical infrastructure at the Border, and that’s what a hard Border is,” Mr Rees-Mogg said. “There may indeed need to be non-Border checks that take place – that would be perfectly reasonable in the new situation. But if we remain in the customs union and the single market, we’d lose the advantages of leaving.” Negotiations move to phase II after agreement reached on protecting the rights of citizens in both UK \u0026amp EU, Northern Ireland and the financial settlement of the orce"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3483261.1525444227!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"judging bertie ahern we all partied but he served the drinks","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBertie Ahern: will his achievements be eclipsed by his shortcomings?

Photograph: Patrick KovarikAFPGettyPresident Emmanuel Macron likes to convince people. In manner and method, he is unlike his predecessors. Nicolas Sarkozy cajoled and bullied. François Hollande just gave up. Macron fixes interlocutors with his intense blue stare and builds a Cartesian argument. If that doesn’t work, he starts over, patiently, but with determination.The past week has tested the young president’s powers of persuasion. Early in the hours of April 14th, Macron used his constitutional power as commander in chief for the first time, joining the US and Britain in launching cruise missiles against three chemical weapons installations in Syria. The goal, Macron said later, was to convince Bashar al Assad and Vladimir Putin that the international community was more than a “nice” and “weak” body they could push around.In a further exercise in persuasion, Macron volunteered for a combative, 2½ hour live television interview on Sunday night, during which he made the surprising claim that, “Ten days ago, President Trump said the US would pull out of Syria. We convinced him it was necessary to stay for the duration.”The White House later issued a statement saying Trump’s view had not changed, and the French president made an embarrassing climbdown on Monday, claiming he “never said” the US or France would remain militarily engaged in Syria for the long term.Perhaps Macron, whose nickname is “Jupiter”, is threatened by hubris, the sin of pride that afflicted Greek gods.The rest of the week was one long attempt to convince Europeans and the French of the rightness of his positions. Macron – who has become the de facto leader of Europe – received the heads of the three Baltic states who have teamed up with five other northern EU countries, including the Netherlands and Ireland, to thwart his efforts to further integrate the euro zone.Then, before a more sympathetic audience at the EU parliament in Strasbourg, Macron pleaded with proponents of liberal democracy to wake up and oppose the populist authoritarians who deny European values. Macron then travelled to Berlin in yet another effort to enlist German chancellor Angela Merkel’s support for his European reform agenda.On Monday, Macron will go to Washington for a three-day state visit, the first of Trump’s presidential term. Although the two men have clashed on climate change, the Iran nuclear accord, trade protectionism and the rise of Eurosceptical populism, Trump appears to have been charmed by the young president, who says Franco-American co-operation is crucial in the fight against terrorism.As the first anniversary of Macron’s election approaches on May 7th, and a half century after the May 1968 revolution, a different kind of spring is flowering in France. For the first time in decades, the country is reversing its post second World War decline, and the persuasive Macron is turning France into the world’s greatest soft power.There is, of course, discontent. It wouldn’t be France if there wasn’t. This week Macron also confronted striking railway workers in the Vosges, telling them to “stop taking people hostage.” The country is struggling through a rolling strike over the reform of the SNCF railway company.And despite Macron’s best efforts to reassure them, many in France suspect their young president is out to destroy the familiar but dysfunctional “French social model”. In their eyes, Macron is pushing France into the chasm of savage, race-to-the bottom capitalism.So what do they make of him in his home town? The  travelled there to find out.Macron was born in Amiens, the capital of Picardy, 40 years ago and lived here until just before his 17th birthday. From age 11 to 16, he studied at the Jesuit school La Providence.Built in the graceless concrete style of the 1950s, “La Pro” is an elementary, secondary and technical school for 2,000 pupils, spread over several acres. Aside from occasional crucifixes, calendars of Pope Francis and portraits of St Ignatius of Loyola, the religious footprint is light. The teachers are lay people. The priest visits only once a week now.Not a single plaque or photograph records that the president and first lady of France passed through these corridors. Yet this is where Macron asked to be baptised at the age of 12, and where, at 15, he fell in love with his future wife, a French and drama teacher called Brigitte Trogneux Auzière.Macron has always been drawn to older people. His maternal grandmother, Germaine “Manette” Nogues, died in his arms five years ago, at the age of 97. The Protestant humanist philosopher Paul Ricoeur was a spiritual father to him the progressive socialist millionaire Henry Hermand his political mentor. “He’s attracted by knowledge, by people who have experience,” his neurologist father, Jean-Michel (67), says over lunch in Amiens.At La Pro and subsequently at Henri IV, France’s leading lycée and prep school in Paris, Macron often stayed after class to talk to teachers.Marc Defernand (78) taught Macron history and geography here, and was principal of Macron’s section. “He was more mature than other students,” says Defernand. “He always asked a lot of questions. Sometimes he would pick up a conversation we’d started eight days earlier, exactly where we’d left off.”In the autumn of 2016, Defernand queued in a local bookshop to ask Macron to sign his autobiographical manifesto, Révolution. The retired educator is moved, recalling what happened. “He grabbed me by the hand and said, ‘Monsieur Defernand! It’s so good to see you!’” Macron inscribed the book: “To Marc, this ‘Revolution’, which owes more to him than he knows. In friendship, Emmanuel.”We visit the 700-seat theatre where Emmanuel Macron and Brigitte Trogneux Auzière adapted a play by Eduardo De Filippo together.“He was dynamite,” Defernand says. “I told him that if he continued, he would be the Gérard Philippe of the 21st century. It was difficult for others to act in the same play with him. In the same way, it’s difficult for his cabinet ministers now.”Defernand wasn’t aware of the relationship at the time, though he knew Macron went often to Auzière’s house. “I assumed there was a flirt between him and her daughter Laurence,” he says.The scandal of a married teacher with three children having an affair with a student nearly 25 years her junior has been transformed into romantic legend. Everyone would rather forget the trauma.“Jesuits never pried into people’s private lives. There was no morality investigation,” Defernand says. “There were unmarried teachers living together at the time. I was more worried about students taking drugs.”The fact that Brigitte continued to teach at La Pro for years after her lover’s departure, and then transferred to Lycée St Louis de Gonzague when they began to live together later in Paris, is further evidence of tolerance, Defernand says.A tragic love story, known to most French people, occurred a quarter-century earlier and helped pave the way for Macron and Auzière.Schoolteacher Gabrielle Russier (32) had an affair with a lycée student half her age, Christian Rossi, in Marseille. The youth’s parents filed a complaint against the teacher and had their son placed in a mental hospital. Russier was given a suspended prison sentence and took her own life. The story became the subject of books, films and songs. Asked about it at a press conference, former president Georges Pompidou famously quoted a poem by Paul Eluard that was sympathetic to women accused of having slept with German soldiers during the war.The historian Jean-François Sirinelli\u0026nbspcompares the Russier and Macron stories in his book Les Révolutions françaises, to show how much France evolved in a single generation. “Gabrielle Russier takes her own life in 1969. Emmanuel Macron and his teacher start an affair in the 1990s, and in May 2017, Brigitte Macron becomes first lady of France.”Macron’s parents learned of the affair by chance. “My wife was much more upset than I was,” Prof Macron says. “It may sound macho, but I thought he’d get over it. He didn’t . . . I thought it was a little early. It wasn’t the way I envisioned life, but it wasn’t my life. I raised my children to be free and independent.”The Macrons didn’t consider filing charges against Brigitte Auzière, but they asked to meet her. “I was requisitioned to impose authority,” Prof Macron laughs. “I told her, ‘He’s a minor. I want him to complete his studies. After that, he’s free to do what he wants.’”The president’s parents have been hurt by press reports that they sent their son to Paris to get him away from Auzière. “He was going to go to Henri IV anyway. It was planned,” Prof Macron says, nonetheless admitting that perhaps Emmanuel “went a little early”.At La Pro, I ask a class of 14-15 year-olds, Macron’s age when he met Brigitte, if they could fall in love with a teacher. The teenagers laugh and say yes. “If it happened to someone our age, it would shock me,” says a student called Grégoire. “But now that he’s an adult, it doesn’t bother me.”The students say it’s “cool” that Macron is president. “He was elected because there was Marine Le Pen,” pipes in Ayoub, of north African origin. Perhaps parroting their parents’ opinions, the youths object to rising taxes and praise the appointment of cabinet ministers who are not professional politicians. For the future, they predict flying cars and tell me France will never know full employment.On a scale of one to 10, they give the young president an approval rating of seven. “He has to prove himself,” one explains. Like France, Macron’s successors at La Pro are waiting to see.The Amienois may seem blasé about their president, but his father attributes this attitude to the “taciturn, reserved” character of Picard people. The region particularly suffered in both world wars, has a miserable climate and has been decimated by de-industralisation.His son is an atypical Picard, “an extrovert” infused with the sun of the southwest on the side of his mother, Françoise Nogues-Macron.History and bloodlines led me to Macron père, to find out more about the family’s English ancestry. In February, Macron spent an evening with the Presidential Press Association. As the representative for foreign journalists, I was part of the welcoming party. I gave him a sepia postcard of English soldiers in Amiens in 1918. \u0026nbspMacron studied the photograph closely. “You know, they found me an English great grandfather,” he said with a laugh, staring at the postcard. “He was called George Robertson.” The president scrutinised the English faces for a long moment. He was looking for a face that resembled his own.Towards the end of last year’s presidential campaign, Brigitte Macron mentioned to British journalists that her husband had a great grandfather called “Mr Robertson from Bristol”. The London Times, Mirror and Daily Mail researched the story and told the Macrons more than they had ever known about “Mr Robertson”.George William Robertson was born in Bristol in December 1887, and is believed to have fought in the Battle of the Somme. Distant relatives in England have preserved his war medals.Robertson married Macron’s great grandmother, Suzanne Leblond, in the town of Abbeville, 40km from Amiens, in 1919. They had three daughters. The middle daughter, Jacqueline, born in 1922, was Emmanuel Macron’s paternal grandmother.“He disappeared from one day to the next,” Prof Macron told me. “No one in the family ever heard from him. Suzanne raised three daughters alone. She kept a very modest grocery shop in Abbeville. My parents sent me to live with her and my aunts for two years as a child.”The failed marriage to an Englishman “was never, never talked about. The family kept no trace of him. I never saw a picture,” Prof Macron continues. George Robertson married again, settled in east London and kept a grocery shop, like his ex-wife, Suzanne. A step-daughter told the Mirror that he liked to sing Roses of Picardy, which he had learned in the trenches.Had a butcher from Bristol not fought in the Somme, married a Frenchwoman and fathered her children, Emmanuel Macron would not exist, would not be president of France today.Macron’s intellectual precociousness and his relationship with Brigitte meant he “skipped his adolescence”, his father says. In the autumn of 1993, three months short of his 17th birthday, the future president moved to a garret near the Lycée Henri IV in Paris. \u0026nbspHe continued his relationship with Brigitte. “When I went to see him in his chambre de bonne, sometimes he called through the door for me to come back later,” Prof Macron laughs. “I knew she was there with him.”Christian Monjou taught Macron American and British civilisation for three years at Henri IV. Though he did not know about the romance, Monjou noticed that Macron raced off to Amiens the moment classes ended on Saturday. “It was a case of\u0026nbsp ‘the ided self’,” Monjou says in an interview in his book-lined study.Macron obtained his baccalauréat with honours, but twice failed the entrance exam for the École Normale Supérieure, which trains French academics. It was the only failure of his life. Had it not been for the distraction of romance with Brigitte, Monjou says, Macron would have succeeded in the exam and become an academic.Against all odds, Brigitte Macron eventually orced and moved to Paris to live with Emmanuel. They married in 2007. “Without her, I would not be me,” Macron said during the campaign.Macron went on to earn a doctorate in philosophy, then reoriented his life towards politics with degrees from Sciences Po and the École Nationale d’Administration (ENA). “He used failure as a launching pad,” says Monjou. “That is typical of a leader.”“Have you brought your helmet and bulletproof vest?” the taxi driver who takes me to the Whirlpool clothes dryer factory in north Amiens asks. It’s a joke, of course, but the “Whirlpools” are notoriously hostile. A year ago, Marine Le Pen promised their factory would not close if she became president. Macron ignored advice and plunged into the crowd of angry strikers, saying, “If you listen to the security guys, you’re dead.”The factory will move to Poland at the end of May. Most of the 290 workers have been promised retraining or jobs building “intelligent” refrigerators by the factory’s new owner. But they’re still angry. On the day I visit, management proposed a clothes dryer in lieu of a severance bonus.“Macron, Macron. He’s not a god. We’re losing jobs. We don’t give a damn about Macron,” François Gorlia, the in-house union leader, tells me on the phone when he refuses to come to the gate to talk to me.“He’s a right-wing guy. Everything for the rich. Nothing for the poor,” Sibylle (39), an assembly line worker says as she arrives for the 1pm shift. She’ll benefit from Macron’s investment in training for the jobless, but she isn’t convinced. “Training is fine and dandy, but there are no jobs.”After lunch in a simple bistro, Macron’s father Jean-Michel guides me through a maze of streets under construction, to the music conservatory where his son studied piano for nine years. When he failed the conservatory exam after his first year, Macron’s mother told his biographer Anne Fulda, the boy insisted on having the same examiner the second year, an early sign of his determination to convince. He played well, Prof Macron recalls, mastering Bach’s devilishly difficult Goldberg Variations.Prof Macron gives me the address of the modest, two-storey brick bungalow where Emmanuel and his two siblings grew up, and where the neurologist still lives with his second wife. “It’s not Neuilly,” Macron père says laughing, referring to the Beverly Hills-like Paris suburb where Nicolas Sarkozy came from. Though they are both doctors, Macron’s parents earned low, public sector salaries. “They weren’t neurosurgeons with private jets,” comments a presidential adviser.The Trogneux chocolate shop, near the cathedral in central Amiens, is where Brigitte Macron’s family have made chocolates and macaroons for five generations. They also own the local Renault dealership.Black-and-white photographs of successive generations of the Trogneux chocolate dynasty hang inside the shop. There is no photograph or mention of Brigitte Trogneux Auzière Macron. Jean-Alexandre Trogneux (57), the first lady’s nephew and godson, agrees to be photographed, but refuses to talk about the presidential couple. “We’ve made it a golden rule,” he says. “We don’t talk about them and they don’t talk about us.”Fabien Dorémus (32) heads the political book section of a shop in central Amiens. Macron’s Révolution sold more than 400 copies there, an “enormous” number, Dorémus says. He had no desire to read it, and dismisses the book – and Macron – as “all slogans and clichés”. A former journalist whose local online newspaper failed for lack of funding, Dorémus is close to the far left party France Unbowed.\u0026nbspSince Macron’s election, Dorémus says, “I’m not optimistic for workers, pensioners and people who need public services. I am very optimistic for the rich.”The bookseller mentions various left-wing grievances against Macron, arising from a handful of disparaging remarks since 2014: Macron referred to slaughterhouse workers who were losing their jobs as “illiterate” Macron told a heckler wearing an anti-Macron T-shirt, “The best way to buy a suit is to get a job” Macron called protesters against his labour reforms “slackers” and accused strikers of wanting to foutre le bordel, or wreak havoc.It’s hardly “let them eat cake”. But the president has been hanged and burned in effigy by protesters. “You have to put yourself in the place of the people who get told they are slackers and freeloaders,” Dorémus says. “He’s contemptuous of the lower classes. People started hating him because they feel disrespected.”Another criticism, made by Macron’s former teachers, is that his speeches are often so long and intellectual that they can be difficult to follow.And attempts to control the president’s image can be counterproductive. The novelist Emmanuel Carrère was given exclusive access to the president and first lady. In two interviews with Macron, there was “one really strong, beautiful sentence”, Carrère wrote in the . “And this really strong, really beautiful sentence was off the record. In its place I was given permission to use a perfectly dull, perfectly formatted variant.”In the course of a day in President Macron’s home town, there is not a single photograph of him to be seen.Brigitte Fouré, the city’s mayor, tells me the poverty rate is two percentage points higher than the national average, and 80 per cent of inhabitants qualify for social housing. Amiens is ided between disadvantaged north and middle-class south. It was ruled by a communist mayor for 18 years in the 1970s and 1980s.Macron spent less than 17 years in Amiens, Fouré notes. He “went up” to Paris nearly a quarter of a century ago. “People here don’t know him. A lot of people are proud that the president is from Amiens, but that’s it. There has never been a real relationship between him and the city. There is no emotional tie.”On a beautiful spring day, the Élysée Palace feels light years away from dreary Picardy. The top-floor office of a close presidential adviser has a view over the gardens and the Eiffel Tower in the distance.Macron’s entourage is comprised mostly of fervently devoted young men with backgrounds similar to his own. No one at the Élysée, other than the president, can be quoted by name. “Our rule is that no one gets inidual credit for anything,” the adviser explains.The adviser reportedly thought up the slogan used by Macron when Trump pulled out of the Paris accord on climate change, “Make our planet great again!” But he refuses to confirm this. “We work collectively. Everything we do belongs to the president.”The adviser counts a resurgence of French pride as Macron’s greatest achievement so far. “It’s been a long time since the French have been proud to be French, in the eyes of the world,” he says. Though it contradicts my experience in Amiens, the statement rings true. Most people in the professional milieus of Paris adore Macron and are proud of his presidency.A few doors from the president’s office, the adviser lists Macron’s “important victories”: the revision of the labour code and the taxation of capital investments the overhaul of the country’s education system changes to the EU’s posted workers directive ending the giant squat at Notre-Dames-des-Landes and dismantling the nuclear reactor at Fessenheim. The last two issues had festered for decades. “They seemed impossible for any preceding majority,” the adviser says.Macron is doing as much for the disadvantaged as for the rich, the adviser insists. “We have increased basic payments to the poor, the disabled and the elderly. We’re decreasing social charges on lower salaries. The pendulum has swung much more towards the least advantaged than the most privileged.”So why isn’t that message getting through? Why do polls indicate that a majority consider Macron the “president of the rich”?For one reason, the adviser says. “He was an investment banker. What’s more, at Rothschild the most symbolic bank in the world. For many people, that proves his competence. The thing that makes him hated by some is the reason why he is respected by others.”Because Macron worked for four years as an investment banker, “everything he does that is perceived as right-wing or for the rich is blown out of proportion”, the adviser says.“And everything he does for the underprivileged, that would be seen as left-wing, is discounted. It’s a problem of perception.”Opinion polls can be read two ways. An Ifop-Fiducial poll published on April 10th gave Macron a 55 per cent approval rating, high for France, 11 months into a presidency. But a BFM poll published four days later showed that 44 per cent of voters are “disappointed”.Nine years of piano and the rigour of France’s best schools have honed Macron’s powers of concentration. On April 17th, he took questions from MEPs in Strasbourg for three hours, without notes, without so much as jotting down a question – a regular performance for Macron.“He is someone with a great capacity of attention and concentration,” says Monjou. “People who’ve met him often tell me they were struck by the intensity with which he looks at them, as if, for the time they are with him, they are all that matters.”“When you talk to him, it is as if he is downloading your brain,” says a former cabinet minister who sometimes advises Macron.Geraldine Byrne-Nason, now Ireland’s Ambassador to the United Nations, is doubtless the Irish official who knows Macron best. She became friends with the future president when both were “sherpas”, responsible for briefing and accompanying Irish and French leaders to EU summits, between 2012 until 2014. Byrne-Nason represented the taoiseach’s office, Macron the Élysée Palace.“We spent hours and hours in corridors through the night while the heads of state and government were locked in meetings,” Byrne-Nason recalls. “Emmanuel would be one of my first points of repair. If you’re going to be there for seven hours, you want someone interesting to talk to.”Byrne-Nason calls Macron “an insider-outsider” who has mastered the system but is able to regard it with detachment. “He has a healthy disrespect for bureaucracy, and Brussels is the home of process and procedure,” she says. “In that regard, we were kindred spirits. There was a slight impatience with the weight of slow-turning wheels.”Macron was particularly understanding of Irish difficulties during the bailout, Byrne-Nason says. She believes he was responsible for support offered by then president François Hollande.Byrne-Nason sent glowing reports about Macron’s potential to Dublin, long before he became a presidential candidate. Last September, she listened to what she calls his “extraordinary speech in favour of international co-operation and law” at the UN General Assembly. “It was poetic. It was powerful. It lit up the place.” Ireland could have signed off on every word, Byrne-Nason says, calling Macron “a superstar president who generates both respect and influence here amongst the 193 countries of the UN”.If Macron were Irish, he might be a hybrid of President Michael D Higgins and Taoiseach Leo Varadkar: part poetic intellectual, rooted in left-wing Christianity and fascinated by ideas part dynamic young liberal, determined to make the economy flourish.When Christian Monjou was Macron’s teacher at Henri IV, he says Macron talked a lot about the Fabians, the centre-left British intellectuals who founded the London School of Economics. The Fabians believed in “the inevitability of gradualness, the idea that everything that is gradual you won’t be able to go back on,” Monjou says. “It is totally anti-French, with our tradition of revolution, not evolution.“French political life is saturated in ideology,” Monjou continues. “With Macron, there is something you might call empirical or pragmatic. It’s familiar to an Anglo-Saxon, but it stands out in France. I suspect this slightly Anglo-Saxon approach may come from listening to me for three years.”Macron’s adviser stresses he is more than a mere pragmatist who would be content to solve one problem after another. “The two legs of Emmanuel Macron are action and reflection,” he says. “He always does both.”Macron’s en même temps mantra seeks to reconcile irreconcilabables, such as liberalism and social protection. The challenge is most obvious in his self-described “humane but realistic” immigration policy. Measures such as the Collomb circular, which authorises police to search emergency shelters for illegal migrants, have alienated some of Macron’s closest allies.In 1997, Macron’s spiritual father Paul Ricoeur delivered a lecture titled Foreigner Myself. Ricoeur cited Leviticus, about “the stranger that dwelleth with you”, and the Gospel of Matthew, which says: “I was a stranger and you took me in.” Opponents of Macron’s tough immigration policy say he has betrayed Ricoeur’s ideals. The criticism must sting, but Macron believes that unless he calms fears of unlimited migration, extreme right-wing populists will continue to gain ground, in France and across Europe.The necessity of ending the “society of status” in which family background, education and profession determine all aspects of one’s life, “gives coherence to everything we are doing”, says the presidential adviser.Philippe Aghion, who teaches economics at Harvard, the London School of Economics and the Collège de France, has greatly influenced the president’s economic thinking.Contrary to Thomas Piketty, the French author of the best-selling Capital in the 21st Century, Aghion and Macron believe that increasing social mobility, not high taxation, is the most effective way of reducing income inequality.Aghion wants to wean France off its post-second World War reliance on the Keynesian welfare state, in which government spending stimulates demand. He is inspired by John Maynard Keynes’s exact contemporary, the Austrian-born economist and Harvard professor Joseph Schumpeter, who believed that innovation and technical progress are the basis of a prosperous economy.Aghion’s theories underlie Macron’s reform of the French labour code last year, and the ongoing reform of professional training. It is, Aghion admitted in an interview, a liberal economic policy. But, he insists, it is also a social policy.Schumpeter believed in creative destruction, “which means you constantly have new jobs replacing old jobs, new firms replacing old firms”, Aghion says. It’s a hard sell to a French public that craves security and is adverse to change.Aghion advocates Danish-style “flexicurity” that combines labour market flexibility with unemployment benefits and retraining for laid-off workers. “In a nutshell: innovation, social protection and social mobility. That’s the triangle you want to achieve,” he says. Listening to him is like hearing Macron speak.Macron’s parents were left-leaning agnostics who did not baptise their children. At the age of 12, probably under the influence of his surroundings at La Pro, Macron asked to make his First Communion. A black-and-white photograph provided by one of his teachers, Gérard Banc, shows the future president making his profession of faith.Macron’s intellectual affiliation has been with the Christian left, with Ricoeur and Esprit magazine, for which he wrote a half-dozen articles, and whose board he sat on. French media interpreted gestures at Macron’s campaign rallies as signs of mysticism, for example when he asked his followers to “show benevolence”, or ended rallies Christ-like, with outstretched arms. On the night of his election, he concluded his speech in front of IM Pei’s glass pyramid at the Louvre with the words, “I will serve you with love”.During his evening with the Presidential Press Association, I asked Macron if, 28 years after his baptism, he still has faith. Personal belief is a taboo subject in secular France. Embarrassed laughter rippled across the room, but he addressed my question.“I believe in something we don’t see, yes,” Macron said. “I have faith in the generic sense of the term. If one doesn’t believe in one’s lucky star, in good fortune, in one’s country, one doesn’t do what I’m doing. I believe in a form of transcendency.”Following Macron’s April 9th speech to French bishops, leftists and Freemasons accused him of attacking la laicité, which has been France’s official policy of state-enforced secularism since 1905.“We share the confused feeling that the link between church and state has been damaged, and that it is as important to you as it is to me to repair it,” Macron said.\u0026nbsp The purpose of laicité was “certainly not to deny spirituality” he argued. \u0026nbsp“For biographical, personal and intellectual reasons, I have the highest opinion of Catholics.”There is something Jesuitical, indeed monklike, about Macron. Unlike his predecessors, he shows no need to eat, sleep or chase women. Asked what has been the “greatest trial” of being in office, the French president said he has “measured the weight and the solitude and the end of innocence” that come with power.“I do not think it is a trial,” Macron continued. “The French have authorised me to do what I committed to do. One thing is certain. There is no respite, which may explain why I sometimes look pale. I do not feel authorised to enjoy any form of leisure. I take time to reflect. I read and write. But in the times we live in, there is no room for respite. That may be the trial of power, though I don’t live it as such. There is undeniably a form of asceticism.”Macron sees his rise to power as the result of a troubled epoch. “I don’t forget where I come from and why I am here today,” he said. “I am the fruit of a form of brutality in history, of a break-in, because France was unhappy and uneasy. If I forget that for one moment, it will be the beginning of the trial.”"},{"url":null,"title":"prince louis pictured at three days old","story":"Pictures of Prince Louis’s first days at home — including a snap of the British baby royal being cuddled by his big sister — have been released by their parents.The newest member of the royal family, born on April 23rd, was photographed by the duchess of Cambridge at Kensington Palace when he was just three days old.Louis is pictured in a white outfit propped up on top of a white frilly cushion on a seat at the family residence in London.A second photograph shows Louis receiving a kiss from his sister Princess Charlotte, taken by their mother on May 2nd, Charlotte’s third birthday.Louis appears to be sleeping soundly, as Charlotte puts a protective arm around her baby sibling and plants a kiss on his forehead.The palace said the duke and duchess of Cambridge, William, and Kate, were “very pleased” to share the photographs, adding: “Their Royal Highnesses would like to thank members of the public for all of the kind messages they have received following the birth of Prince Louis, and for Princess Charlotte’s third birthday.”The duchess, a keen photographer, bucked tradition when she took the official photographs of her newborn daughter in 2015.A history of art graduate, she has released pictures to mark other milestones in her children’s lives. – PA"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/04/18/TELEMMGLPICT000160774771_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bq1otmVHALaTv2ghQ0pTDq-HpDg9BxLZzwDfiPKIQ2Cwk.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"erdogan vows new military campaigns launches manifesto","story":"Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Sunday promised new military operations against Kurdish militants along its border in Syria and Iraq as he presented his election manifesto.Speaking before thousands of supporters in Istanbul on Sunday, Erdogan described next month\u0027s snap presidential and parliamentary polls as a milestone for a strong Turkey.

They did so this year with added piquancy because it was the 50th anniversary of the famous “Mai 68” when, in the Latin Quarter of Paris, the Left Bank, the whole month was devoted to riotous assembly led by students. In contemplating these events, I recall Wordsworth’s often quoted phrase: “Bliss it was in that dawn to be alive” – unless, of course, you were struck by a cobblestone hurled by a student demonstrator or soaked and knocked off balance by a police water cannon.Presumably those who were demonstrating in Paris last Tuesday have now resumed their normal lives. The point about May 1968, however, is that they didn’t go back to college or to work the next day, they carried on, some of them for the whole month. Why was that? After all, economic growth had been unusually strong, the country was calm, both politically and socially, inflation was weak, living standards had been rising and there was little unemployment.Was it in a way a very 1960s thing? That question is prompted by a French historian of the period, Éric Alary, who observes that “May 68 is seen as a period when audacious moves seemed possible and during which society profoundly changed”. For that is an accurate description of the nature of the 1960s, whether in Western Europe or in North America.At the same time, there was a big rise in the sheer number of young people as a result of an increase in the birth rate in the closing stages of the Second World War and for some years afterwards. Thus, in France, the under-20 cohort rose from 30.7 per cent of the population in 1954 to 33.8 per cent in 1968. At the same time in France (1967), the school leaving age was raised from 14 to 16.  Two men take evasive action during a Paris street riot on 30 May (Getty)This required a massive expansion of teaching staff and building. As a result, students often found themselves being taught by hastily trained teachers in hastily built class rooms. In France, as in Britain, this was followed by a big expansion of the university sector. There was inevitably something ramshackle about it all, and students noticed. Yet the command structures of educational establishments remained unchanged. Nonetheless, universities are never just academic establishments full stop. For their campuses and their indoor and outdoor spaces lend themselves to meetings and debates and even to organising mini demonstrations. The intellectual gods of these 1960s students were Marx, Freud and Sartre, the French existentialist philosopher. In a famous passage, Sartre wrote that “God does not exist, and as a result man is forlorn, because neither within himself nor without does he find anything to cling to”. This struck home. For as Bob Dylan sang in 1965 – “How does it feelHow does it feelTo be on your ownWith no direction homeLike a complete unknownLike a rolling stone?”One had either to start things on one’s own without adult backing, or not at all. This was an unprecedented and intoxicating freedom. As the French student leader Dany Cohn-Bendit told the Paris demonstrators in May 1968: “There are no marshals and leaders today. Nobody is responsible for you. You are responsible for yourselves.”In fact, as is the way of things, Mai 68 began not in central Paris, but in Nanterre, a suburb seven miles to the northwest, and not in May but on 22 March. The construction of the university of Nanterre campus in a bleak shanty town had begun in 1962. In the spring of 1968 it was still not finished. The building were exceedingly functional and contained some 12,000 students. They were particularly shocked to find themselves living and doing their studies in what was in effect a building site. They demanded, too, the right to circulate freely between the residences of males and female students, still forbidden in what one might call pre-1960s style. There was a lot of justified discontent.Daniel Cohn-Bendit  was known as ‘Dany le Rouge’ because of his politics as well as the colour of his hair (Getty)Some 150 students, including far-left groups together with a small number of poets and musicians, occupied a building. The police surrounded it. After publication of the students’ wishes, they left the building without any trouble. But then they took their protest movement to the Sorbonne in the very middle of the Latin Quarter. That was how Mai 68 started.In a drastic action, the authorities shut down the University of Nanterre on 2 May. The students who had decamped to the Sorbonne were bound to think that this was a hostile act, an outbreak of war between the university authorities and the student body. It had been natural to head to the Sorbonne, France’s premier university, which had the prestige of its ancient foundation 700 years earlier. This meant nothing to the police, of course, who invaded the Sorbonne the next day.In response, on 6 May the national students’ union and the union of university teachers organised a protest march. It was one of the key events of the month. The head of the Paris police was obsessed by the need to protect the Sorbonne and its surroundings from a massive invasion by the students. He placed 1,500 officers in defence. But then came 6,000 protesters in waves. Overnight the confrontation was particularly violent. Thousands of cobblestones were ripped up and used as projectiles by the demonstrators. The police responded with teargas grenades. Dozens of gendarmes were taken to hospitals. Students were wrenched from the arms of the police by their colleagues.The next day, students, teachers and increasing numbers of young workers gathered at the Arc de Triomphe to demand that all criminal charges against arrested students be dropped, that the police leave the university and that the authorities reopen Nanterre and the Sorbonne. But negotiations broke down. When the students returned to their campuses to find that the police were still in occupation, a near revolutionary fervour began to grip them.The lyrics of Bob Dylan captured the sense of isolation and alienation felt by many young people (Redferns)The events were broadcast on radio as they occurred, and the aftermath was shown on television the following day. This demonstration of heavy handed police brutality brought on a wave of sympathy for the strikers. Moreover, in a highly significant move, the major union federations called a one-day strike and demonstration for Monday, 13 May. The workers were going to march with the students.They had their own grievances. There had been sporadic industrial trouble since the beginning of the year. More than half of them put in a 48-hour week. They feared that their standard of living had ceased to improve. Unemployment, albeit from a low base, was beginning to rise. As a result this was no longer a Paris event, for workers took to the streets throughout France. Their slogan was “Ten years! That’s enough!” referred to Charles de Gaulle’s long period as president.French politicians Michel Debre and Andre Malraux at the tomb of the unknown soldier, demonstrating their support for De Gaulle (Getty)The events the next day, 14 May, were as important. For workers began occupying factories, starting with a sit-down strike at the Sud Aviation plants near the city of Nantes. If students could occupy their universities, then workers could seize control of their factories. By 16 May, workers had occupied roughly 50 factories throughout France and 200,000 were on strike by 17 May. That figure snowballed to two million workers on strike the following day (18 May) and then ten million, or roughly two thirds of the French workforce on strike the following week (23 May).The unions assumed that the workers simply wanted more pay. So, when they were able to negotiate substantial pay increases with employers’ associations, they thought their job was done. But workers had also demanded the ousting of the De Gaulle government and in some cases demanded to run their own factories.The demonstrations and the strikes went on. Meanwhile on the morning of 29 May, De Gaulle suddenly boarded a helicopter and left the country. He went to the headquarters of the French military in Germany and called a meeting of Council of Ministers for 30 May back in Paris. On that same day, the unions led 400,000 to 500,000 protesters through Paris chanting “Adieu, De Gaulle”. The head of the Paris police carefully avoided the use of force.Sensibly De Gaulle responded by dissolving the National Assembly and calling a new election for 23 June. He ordered the workers to return to work immediately, threatening to institute a state of emergency if they did not. The Communist Party agreed to the holding of the election. Immediately revolutionary feelings began to fade away. The police retook the Sorbonne on 16 June. And the Gaullists won the greatest victory in French parliamentary history.The May days of 1968, it turned out, had been a convulsive moment, nothing more enduring than that. Nonetheless in Wordsworth’s words, “to be young was very heaven”.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

However, animals were not the only threat. Kenya was at the time a British colony.During the Mau Mau uprising of the 1950s, white families were fair game to the rebels thanks in no small part to the brutal nature of colonial rule. (In 2011 William Hague expressed “sincere regret” for the thousands who had been detained and tortured.) When Sheldrick was nine months pregnant she survived an ambush by Mau Mau fighters.Chained and tortured: The horror inflicted on India’s elephantsSo when a wild elephant she had mistaken for one of her hand-reared orphans turned on her in 1994, she took it in her stride.“I opened my eyes. I could feel the elephant gently insert her tusks between my body and the rocks,” she wrote in her autobiography, Love, Life and Elephants: An African Love Story, in 2012.“Rather than a desire to kill, I realised that the elephant was actually trying to help me,” she added. “I knew then and there that I had an absolute duty to pass on my intimate knowledge and understanding of Africa’s wild animals and my belonging to Kenya.”Born Daphne Marjorie Jenkins, Sheldrick came from a family of settlers who left rural Scotland for Africa in the mid-1820s. Her great-uncle Will, a successful farmer in South Africa, began the family’s connection with Kenya after meeting governor Sir Charles Eliot. Eliot was offering free land to families prepared to move to his new colony. Among the families that subsequently boarded the boat to Mombasa were Daphne Sheldrick’s great-grandparents.The author’s work on the Ban the Bloody Ivory campaign drew in stars including Joanna Lumley (front, centre) (Rex)The settlers arrived to an uncertain future in a country with none of the comforts of home. They could not move their livestock inland without first swathing them in cloth to foil the tsetse fly. The new railway was notorious for the number of workers eaten by lions during its construction. And the 5,000 acres of virgin bush gifted by the British government were in fact already home to the Masai. After an arduous four-month journey to get there, Sheldrick’s family had to move on again.I knew then and there that I had an absolute duty to pass on my intimate knowledge and understanding of Africa’s wild animals and my belonging to KenyaBy the time Sheldrick was born, third of Bryan and Marjorie Jenkin’s four children, the family was established on a farm in Gilgil in the Great Rift Valley. Marjorie Jenkins was determined to instil in her children a love for the natural world. Family walks included not just the farm dogs but an impala, a waterbuck and Rikki-Tikki-Tavi, a brown-furred dwarf mongoose. At the age of four, Sheldrick was given responsibility for the care of an orphaned infant bushbuck.It was an idyllic upbringing but it was hard to run a European farm among African predators such as lions and leopards. At the same time, the global picture was changing rapidly. With the Second World War reaching Ethiopia, the British government looked to Kenya to feed the troops. Bryan Jenkins was tasked with shooting thousands of wildebeest and zebra in the Southern Game Reserve. He set up a portable biltong factory, assisted by two Italian prisoners of war. It was while camping nearby that six-year-old Sheldrick was woken by lions. Attracted by the smell of meat, they stayed to lick salt from the tarpaulins.The author’s work on the Ban the Bloody Ivory campaign drew in stars including Joanna Lumley (front, centre) (Rex)As soon as she was old enough, Sheldrick, who could speak Swahili, was sent to boarding school. She was a keen student, graduating eighth in her year and winning a university bursary. However, she was already in love with Bill Woodley, a student from her brother’s school, and chose instead to leave full-time education to be with him.Khurshid Drabu: Britain’s first Muslim judgeRemembering Avicii, Swedish superstar of electronic dance musicLeila Abashidze: Georgian actress who became a star of Soviet cinemaJanka Nabay: Musician who brought Sierra Leone’s bubu to the worldIsao Takahata: Japanese animation master who co-founded Studio GhibliAt around the same time, a state of emergency was declared in Kenya after Mau Mau guerrilla fighters, drawn from the Kikuyu, Meru, Embu, Kamba and Masai people, rose up against white colonial rule. The insurgency was put down with shocking brutality by British colonial officials and Kenyan “home guards”. Thousands of civilians were rounded up in mass detention camps and subjected to beatings, sexual assault and even castration, allegedly sanctioned at the highest level. (Finally, in 2013, after a long legal campaign, the British government apologised.)Mau Mau retaliation was equally bloody and Sheldrick’s family did not escape the violence. During a Mau Mau raid on her great-aunt’s farm, five people, including three children, were burned alive. Sheldrick’s grandparents were beaten and left for dead in an alleged Mau Mau robbery. Meanwhile, a worker on the Jenkins’ farm wasted away and died, convinced he was cursed after refusing to kill his employers at the Mau Mau’s behest.The David Sheldrick Trust has been reintroducing orphans back into the wild at Tsavo National Park since 1987 (Rex)In the midst of this unrest, Sheldrick married Woodley, visiting the United Kingdom for the first time on their honeymoon. After their marriage they moved to Tsavo National Park, where they worked as wardens. In January 1955, Bill took the now heavily pregnant Sheldrick back to visit her family in Gilgil. Returning in darkness, they were ambushed. “A terrifyingly loud sound erupted and in the arc of the headlamps we could see crazed, menacing figures, clad in skins, coming towards us in a great swirl of anger and noise. Some were wielding pangas, some were hurling enormous boulders and others were firing at us from point blank range.”Sheldrick continued working into later life (Rex)Bill Woodley saved his wife and unborn daughter, Jill, by driving straight through the Mau Mau attackers. A year later, the capture of Mau Mau leader Dedan Kimathi marked the official end of the “Emergency”, but the rebellion continued underground for almost a decade.The Woodleys survived the ambush but soon after their marriage foundered. Sheldrick, still Mrs Woodley as she then was, had fallen hopelessly in love with her husband’s boss with whom she had much in common. David Sheldrick was a keen naturalist dedicated to ending poaching. During his anti-poaching campaign, more than 25,700lbs of ivory was recovered and in 1959 and he was duly awarded an MBE. Meanwhile, Bill Woodley’s passion for hunting, so much at odds with his role as warden, was beginning to grate. Sheldrick left him for his high-minded superior.Sheldrick married David in 1960. Their family quickly expanded to encompass a variety of furry and feathered orphans, such as Gregory Peck, a buffalo weaver-bird, and Old Spice, a civet cat with a passion for the aftershave that bore his name. Soon after came a human daughter, Angela.We had come to Kenya as children of pioneering families who had lived through difficult times as their parents struggled to farm the land, and when grown had served Britain with distinction in its world warsDavid Sheldrick had already raised two orphaned elephants, Samson and Fatuma. His observations of the pair formed some of the first studies on elephant diet and migration. Daphne Sheldrick took charge of further orphans including one she named Aisha. In an interview, Sheldrick explained: “She came to us as one of the smallest elephants I had ever seen, with soft fuzz and ears as soft and pink as petals. When she arrived, my heart plummeted as we had never been able to save an elephant this young.”The Sheldricks had already discovered that elephants do not thrive on traditional baby formula and after a few days on glucose and watered down cow’s milk, Aisha was wasting away. As a last resort, Sheldrick tried coconut oil. It worked. Aisha began to thrive on Sheldrick’s recipe and the future of many more orphaned elephants was assured.Sheldrick leaves two daughters, four grandchildren, and a huge family of elephants, rhinos and many more (DSWT)By the early Sixties, the Mau Mau Uprising may have been over but the “winds of change”, as referenced in Harold Macmillan’s 1960 speech in South Africa, were blowing across the continent. When it came to Kenya, the British government decided that continuing colonial rule required more force than they were prepared to expend and Kenya was granted independence in 1963. The Duke of Edinburgh presided over the handover to Jomo Kenyatta.They suffer loss and heartbreak on an almost daily basis, they grieve and mourn the loss of loved ones just as deeply as us, but they turn the page to focus on the living, and I try to emulate thatThe change of rule caused much anguish for the white settler families, who, as Sheldrick described, “had come to Kenya as children of pioneering families who had lived through difficult times as their parents struggled to farm the land, and when grown had served Britain with distinction in its world wars. Britain began to turn its back on those people – even the daily BBC programme previously announced as ‘Home News from Britain’ became ‘News From Britain’, a subtle change that did not go unnoticed.”Sheldrick’s husband was among those who struggled to renew his British passport at the time. David Sheldrick put the situation succinctly: “There was no question about me not being British when the Second World War broke out and I was called up to fight for your bloody country.”In 2016 Sheldrick warned that if the ivory trade continued, the African forest elephant could be extinct by 2025 (Rex)The Sheldricks worried that the transition to independence would adversely affect Kenya’s national parks but it was their success in making the park a safe haven for elephants that caused the next problem. The elephant numbers at Tsavo had grown dramatically – from an estimated 5,000 to 15,000 – and the increased competition for food led to the devastation of much of the forest landscape. However, David Sheldrick firmly resisted the idea of an artificial cull and, in time, the more open grasslands created by the elephants’ indiscriminate browsing attracted new species, including antelope and buffalo. The Tsavo lions thrived.Money, corruption, greed and ignorance motivates the evil ivory and rhino horn tradeIn 1976, the parks were finally brought under government control, merging with the Government Game Department. Sheldrick explained that for the park’s “wild inhabitants, especially rhinos and elephants, who became instant targets, it was the death knell”. Shortly afterwards, David Sheldrick was offered a desk job in Nairobi and the family left Tsavo to an uncertain fate.David Sheldrick died that same year. After his death, devastated Sheldrick began to raise funds in his memory to continue the work that meant so much to him.‘Born to be Wild’, narrated by Morgan Freeman, shone a spotlight on the rehabilitation efforts in Kenya (Getty)The first official fundraiser was a film by former warden Simon Trevor. Somali gangs, armed with AK47s, had been gunning down entire Tsavo elephant herds, turning the park into a no-go zone. Trevor’s film on the crisis, Bloody Ivory, came to the attention of President Arap Moi, who agreed to attend the premiere. Alas, Moi was a no-show, but a few months later the Vatican proposed a papal visit to Kenya, during which the pope wished to bless an elephant and a rhino calf. Sheldrick obliged. The logistics were difficult but the publicity was priceless.Sheldrick was named one of the most significant conservationists ever (DSWT)In 1987, the David Sheldrick Memorial appeal became The David Sheldrick Wildlife Trust (DSWT), with a mission statement declaring it “embraces all measures that compliment the conservation, preservation and protection of wildlife”. Over the next 30 years the trust expanded to three sites: the elephant nursery at Sheldrick’s home in Nairobi, and two centres in Tsavo where the orphans were reintroduced into the wild.There was no shortage of infant elephants to be reared. Though President Moi tried to signal an end to the ivory trade by publicly burning Kenya’s stockpile in 1989, the international appetite for ivory remained undiminished. Between 2003 and 2013, the DSWT saw a 500 per cent increase in the number of orphans rescued, driven by demand for ivory from China. In an interview in 2016, Sheldrick lamented that elephants were being killed at a rate of 50 a day, telling Bohotraveller: “Money, corruption, greed and ignorance motivates the evil ivory and rhino horn trade.”UK ivory trade ban a positive step but what next for Africa’s elephantConservationists warn its too early to celebrate elephants\u0027 safetyEurope must choose: elephants or ivoryYoung Kenyans care for nature but are detached from conservation Wildlife conservancy grows cattle feed to fend off droughtFamily of elephant conservation pioneer pledge her legacy will live onSheldrick spread the word about the crisis facing the elephants with numerous television appearances. She published four books, including her autobiography. Meanwhile, her work was recognised all over the world. In 1989, she was appointed MBE. She was awarded an honorary doctorate in veterinary medicine by Glasgow University. In 2001, the Kenyan government awarded her the Moran of the Burning Spear and in 2006 Sheldrick became a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire, “for services to the conservation of wildlife, especially elephants, and to the local community in Kenya”. Her knighthood was the first to be awarded in Kenya since the country’s independence in 1963, something that Sheldrick said “left me dumbfounded but nevertheless extremely proud”. At the time of Sheldrick’s death in April 2018, the DSWT hand-reared more than 200 orphaned elephants, more than 100 of whom were successfully released into the wild. As the trust approached its 40th anniversary last year, Sheldrick told Eluxe magazine: “I have always turned to the elephants for inspiration in the face of adversity. They suffer loss and heartbreak on an almost daily basis, they grieve and mourn the loss of loved ones just as deeply as us, but they turn the page to focus on the living, and I try to emulate that.”As Sheldrick wrote in her autobiography: “Elephants are, indeed, just like us, and in many ways better.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

They are making a big decision as to where the next motor plant should be in Europe.“We have a very successful one in Deeside, in North Wales, but there are choices as to whether that should be located on the continent. “Between that plant and the plant in Derbyshire there are 3,500 people employed. The nature of that business is that over 50 per cent of the parts come from out of the country. They come through every hour of the day and night ... It’s just in time manufacturing. It is highly efficient. “What we have always said is we will have a customs agreement that has the minimum of frictions. Now that is crucial.”Tory rebels: We can push May towards single market, if Labour backs usBank of America moving 125 UK jobs to Ireland because of Brexit ‘Manual workarounds’ plan over fears IT systems not ready for BrexitBrexit blamed for weak services growth in AprilMs May’s customs plans will help firms as it would mean you can import parts without border checks or paperwork, he said.Mr Clark added: “But it’s not perfect, because what it means is that if we have imports from other countries where we’ve abolished the tariff, there has to be an arrangement where you pay back.”He also opened the door to extending a transition period on customs with the EU, saying it could be a case of implementing a new customs arrangement “as soon as you can do” rather than 2020 when the transition would expire.It could take until 2023 to put new infrastructure in place, he added.Former home secretary Amber Rudd, who resigned last week over the Windrush scandal, immediately tweeted her support of Mr Clark’s plans.Business leaders also welcomed Mr Clark’s comments, saying it was important to maintain the status quo on frictionless trade until a new arrangement is in place.However Mr Rees-Mogg, chairman of the powerful European Research Group (ERG) of Tory Brexiteers, said it would be “odd” for Ms May to back a policy that effectively breached her commitment on leaving both the customs union and single market.He told ITV’s Peston on Sunday: “This Project Fear has been so thoroughly discredited that you would have thought it would have come to an end by now.“We trade successfully all over the world.

I was told there’s no need to see anyone or a specialist\u0027Katie Holley was jolted awake by a cold thing – what she had initially thought was a small piece of ice that somehow slid down her left ear. Still disoriented, she rushed to the bathroom, grabbed a cotton swab and slowly stuck it inside her ear. And then Ms Holley felt something move. It was like a “rhythmic” movement, she recalled, as whatever it was tried to burrow deeper into her ear canal.She pulled out the cotton swab and saw small, dark brown pieces that looked like legs.Cockroaches have been a nuisance in the Holley household since she and her husband, Jordan Holley, bought their first home last year, she wrote in Self magazine this week. They thrive in warm and damp places and that includes Florida, where the young couple live and where flying cockroaches called palmetto bugs are most common. Households in warm cities, such as New Orleans, Houston and Atlanta, report more problems with cockroaches than much of the country.Woman discovers cockroach in Air India loungeWhite House infested with cockroaches, mice and ants, documents revealDoctors find live cockroach in woman’s skullA few weeks earlier, an exterminator sprayed every room inside the couple’s house in Melbourne, Florida and Ms Holley felt what turned out to be a very temporary sense of relief.That morning, around 1.45am on 14 April, Mr Holley rushed to the bathroom to help his panicking wife, grabbed a flashlight and looked inside her ear. And there it was, a small part still visible from the outside as it stayed there, lodged in the middle of the ear canal. Mr Holley managed to pull out a couple of legs using a pair of tweezers, but the intrepid bug had crawled too deep.The young couple drove to the emergency room just a few miles away. A man sitting behind a desk near the hospital’s entrance saw the look of panic in Ms Holley’s face and asked whether she was in pain.“A roach crawled into my ear while I was sleeping and it was stuck,” Ms Holley said she told him.She was given a wristband and taken to a room, where she lay on her side on a gurney, whimpering. A nurse injected the bug with the anaesthetic lidocaine to try to kill it. Ms Holley said she felt the roach move, twitching and wriggling further into her ear as it tried to avoid death. Two minutes later, it stopped moving.It took the doctor about 20 seconds to pull out chunks of the dead roach and Ms Holley saw what she thought was the remains of a small insect. She left the hospital nearly two hours later with a prescription for antibiotics and ear drops, relieved that it was all over. She and her husband vowed to never let the experience happen again, stopping by a Walmart to buy earplugs.Nine days passed, but Ms Holley’s ear still did not feel normal. It was still numb, she said and she felt some discomfort every time she yawned. Her medicine drops also had stopped passing through her ear, leading her to think that perhaps earwax had built up inside.She went to her physician for her regularly scheduled appointment and asked the doctor whether she could check her ear. Her doctor and a physician assistant flushed her ear four times. Using an otoscope, they peeked inside and there it was – another leg.Lord of the butterflies: Clive Farrell has turned his Dorset estate into an insect-filled fantasiaLord of the butterflies: Clive Farrell has turned his Dorset estate into an insect-filled fantasiaMs Holley’s doctor pulled out six pieces of the roach’s remains – but feared there was still more left. Ms Holley said her physician arranged for her to see a doctor who specialises in treating the ears, nose and throat (ENT) later that day.As she went home and waited, Ms Holley tried to remember how much of the roach was taken out at the emergency room more than a week ago.“Did they find the head? Antennae?” she wrote. “I couldn’t recall. But I could only hope that the ENT would only need to remove another teensy leg or two.”The specialist placed what looked like a microscope next to Ms Holley’s face. A few minutes later, she felt something bigger was getting extracted out of her ear canal. And then she saw it. Not a “teensy leg or two”. Not the remains of a baby roach. But a head, a torso, limbs and long antennae of what looked like a fully grown palmetto bug.For nine days, much of the dead roach sat in Ms Holley’s ear.“I was furious. I was really disappointed with the ER for not having seen that, for letting me believe it was all out,” Ms Holley, a 29-year-old sales and marketing manager, said on Saturday. “They said this is something that happens often. I was told there’s no need to see anyone or a specialist.”Scientists create robotic cockroach to search disaster areasHolley declined to name the hospital she first went to in April.Holley said she did not have any permanent damage or infection. Palmetto bugs generally do not bite and if they do, their bites are not harmful.Cockroaches have been known to burrow into people’s ears. A South African hospital, for example, pulled two dozen critters out of people’s ears over a period of two years, according to a National Geographic article published last year.“Roaches are searching for food everywhere,” entomologist Coby Schal of North Carolina State University told National Geographic. “And earwax might be appealing to them.”But, still, as Ms Holley said: “It was still a roach. In my ear.” or register with your social accountAlready have an account? Log inWe use cookies to enhance your visit to our site and to bring you advertisements that might interest you.

But the more things change, the more they stay the same\u0026nbspLebanon is a colourful place at the moment. Spring has been unusually warm the hillsides above Beirut are green and the pink and purple blossom of bougainvillea and jacaranda trees drift down onto the city’s streets.  The plethora of new political flags and posters, however, is definitely more eye-catching.  On Sunday Lebanon’s erse population of six million will cast their votes for the first time since 2009 in a national election which should end almost a decade of political gridlock.Lebanon Prime Minister Saad Hariri says resignation on hold awaiting talksThe new elections come with a set of complicated new rules designed to move Lebanon towards a proportionally representative system for the first time, allowing space for more independents and reducing the power of establishment blocs formed by the country’s multiconfessional political system.Critics, however, say that since the new electoral law asks voters to pick lists of allied sects and parties, as well as prioritise inidual candidates on the list of their choice, it accentuates the already isive tendencies of Lebanon’s complex politics by making candidates on the same slates compete with each other. “Like almost every law on the books in Lebanon, the way it looks on paper is very different to how it is applied or fairly administered in practice,” said Imad Salameh, a professor of politics at Beirut’s Lebanese American University. “We are injecting into the normal proportional system this Lebanese twist. Parliament is unlikely to change too much. But it is a step in the right direction.”Lebanon’s politics – which involves 18 officially represented sectarian groups – is famously complicated. The filth and the fury: A mountain of rubbish is blighting Lebanon\u0027s once-beautiful beachesThe filth and the fury: A mountain of rubbish is blighting Lebanon\u0027s once-beautiful beachesIn the Christian villages just below the cedar forests of north Lebanon’s Tannourine, huge posters of the Christian president, Michel Aoun, are currently hung underneath tens of Shia Hezbollah’s distinctive yellow flag, green fists brandishing AK-47s.  Some of the country’s more surprising political partnerships – such as that of the recently elected Mr Aoun and Lebanon’s Sunni prime minister, Saad Hariri – say a lot about how Lebanon’s internal politics are still intrinsically linked to its position in the region and the Middle East’s wider power struggles. Lebanese media has been dominated in recent weeks by pundits angry that the country’s biggest issues – the heavily indebted economy, the disarmament of Hezbollah, Syrian refugees and crises in public services such as electricity and garbage – have for the most part been sidelined by the major parties, who are too preoccupied with forging allegiances to maintain the status quo to assure voters they will do what’s best for the country.Analysts believe that the reaction of Iran and the administration of US President Donald Trump – both of which have proxy interests in Lebanon – will depend on other events across the region.“The problem is, the Trump administration and Iran will treat the election results depending on so many other factors,” said Mohaned Hage Ali of the Carnegie Middle East Centre. US pledges support for Lebanon’s army after Israeli ‘Hezbollah’ claimPiles of rubbish wash up on Beirut beach amid national waste crisisThe Boustani house encompasses both the tragedy and faith of LebanonSaudi Arabia has threatened Lebanese stability in the past“There’s so much happening in May in the region alone. We will still be counting the votes, probably, when Trump pulls out of the Iran deal, and Iraq holds its own elections, which may change a lot in the Shia power balance there. “Our future is dependent on many variables outside our control.”The rest of the Middle East casts a long shadow on the tiny country. Internally, so do ongoing rows over gerrymandering, conflicts of interest, party funding and the steep cost for independents for running a slate.Despite all that, however, there is still a sense of optimism among many young people in Lebanon – 800,000 of whom are excited to cast a vote for the first time. Art exhibition in Lebanon shut down by people trying to erase imperialism from their historyA record number of women are running this year and civil society movements aimed at educating people about their democratic rights are flourishing. “The best way of looking at these elections is: they are an exercise for the new blood in Lebanese politics and new candidates and movements popping up everywhere to try contest the sectarian establishment and elite,” said Mr Ali. “It is building up some sort of new independent movement for the next round. It’s a long process, and there’s a long way to go.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

A new £3.5 billion HMS Queen Elizabeth carrier is nearing the end of its trials and a second HMS Prince of Wales is still under construction.But critics claim at least ten more escort ships are also needed. Challenged yesterday, Sir Mark signalled the intention was only ever to use both carriers as part of an international taskforce when they are operational.Speaking to MPs on the cross-party Defence Committee, he said: “We will see what happens in the circumstances but that is part of the thinking about the use of the carriers“It is projecting them as a British sovereign capability but one that will almost inevitably - I would actually say inevitably - be used in a context of allied operations of some kind if used in a contested environment.”Lord West said it was clear the Government need to “put its money where its mouth is”. “I have always said we should have 30 escorts – indeed that number came out of the Strategic Defence Review in 1998.

A vibrant metropolis, at ease with its diverse, tolerant self.A shining example to the world of how folk from different backgrounds and cultures can rub along together.At least, that’s what we’re invited to believe. But the truth is this depiction of our capital city is not one recognised by millions of its citizens. That’s because London is, in fact, a tale of two cities.There are the gentrified hotbeds of liberal cosmopolitanism — the Islingtons and Camdens — top-heavy with the professional classes and cultural elites, the type of areas that were a bedrock of Remain support in the EU referendum.But then there are those places outside the bubble. On the one hand the grittier, traditional working-class areas — the Canning Towns and Bermondseys — populated by those steamrollered by globalisation, for whom austerity and mass immigration have exacerbated the problems of low wages, poor housing and under-pressure public services.On the other, the middle-class suburbs — the Upminsters and Eastcotes — inhabited by those who sense that their “small c” conservatism is increasingly incongruous with the image of their city as a beacon of progressive modernity.It is between these places that a new and unintended coalition has emerged, born out of resentment at having  to watch their old-fashioned, socially conservative — what some describe as “faith, family and flag” — views shunned and disparaged by the liberal elite.You can see something similar writ large across England: An accidental alliance between once-loyal Labour voters in the post-industrial towns and Conservatives in the shires.It’s an alliance which manifested itself most starkly in the Brexit vote.For the Londoners that fall within these groups, their city is not the harmonious and cohesive ideal seen through the eyes of the chattering classes.It is, instead, a place increasingly atomised, where millions feel a diminishing sense of belonging and in which entire communities within a few hundred yards of each other live utterly parallel lives.Take, for example, the borough in which I grew up, Barking and Dagenham.As working-class as it gets, it was once the very essence of a traditional Labour heartland. Never affluent, but stable, close-knit and settled.Centred around a sprawling 1930s council estate and with generally healthy levels of employment — the dominant Ford factory being at the heart of local industry — Barking and Dagenham enjoyed its steady constancy, its social and cultural familiarity.For those short on money and opportunity, the concepts of place, belonging, identity and relationships take on so much more meaning.But then things changed. Over a few very short years, around the turn of the century, there was a sizeable influx of migrants, precipitating rapid social and cultural transformation.The demographic convulsions meant stable, settled Barking and Dagenham found itself in the eye of the storm of the debate over mass immigration.The indigenous population cried out for respite. The letters page of the local paper was filled with correspondents begging to be heard. But nobody in power took a blind bit of notice, other than to patronise them with trite arguments about improved GDP and cultural enrichment.Rather than rally to their support, the Left — including, shamefully, the Labour Party and trade unions — treated these marginalised working-class folk like an embarrassing elderly relative, imploring them to “stop blaming migrants” (something they hadn’t done in the first place).What was genuine bewilderment and disorientation on the part of local citizens was, inexcusably, dismissed as casual racism and bigotry.Yet it wasn’t their sense of race that had been violated by the sudden upheaval in their community. It was their sense of order.So, in 2006, locals took the only route of protest they thought left available to them and returned  12 British National Party councillors at the local elections.The noxious far-Right, which previously had never gained a foothold in the borough (though it had penetrated areas close by) now formed the official opposition on Barking and Dagenham council, not because thousands of locals had overnight turned into vile racists, but because they had repeatedly been ignored by a tin-eared establishment.But even then, nothing changed. Locals were told to get with the zeitgeist.Women in their eighties who had lived in the borough for most of their lives, had raised  families there and in many cases now lived a life of lonely isolation, were told to embrace the vibrancy of the new multiculturalism.That was the level of condescension to which the liberal establishment had sunkSo thousands of people simply upped sticks and left. In the first decade of the new century, Barking and Dagenham experienced a vast exodus of families who had been rooted in its streets, workplaces and  institutions for generations.It was the only home that many had ever known, but they went all the same. They departed for the Essex coast or Kent. It wasn’t “white flight”, for skin colour was irrelevant to most of them.It was, instead, a flight to familiarity.The tragedy was that most of these people never were anti-immigration. They would not have objected to the integration of a modest and manageable number of arrivals over a reasonable period.But the whole debate around immigration has been toxified by what the ruling elites imposed on places such as Barking and Dagenham.They shook a kaleidoscope then stood back in surprise when the pieces didn’t fall exactly where they wanted. Remember all this the next time you hear someone speak of London as the greatest city in the world.Chances are the words are being spoken by a politician or a celebrity or a middle-class liberal from one of the trendier parts of town.For there are, in reality, two Londons. One half — alienated, neglected and resentful — represents a potentially formidable army at the ballot box.Who will speak for it?Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Well, the customs partnership idea, which would involve the UK collecting tariff revenues on the EU’s behalf, would make the UK a much less attractive country to do trade deals with.To be fully effective, it would also  require the UK  to essentially copy all EU regulations on goods.With the scheme also leading to the European Court of Justice getting involved in Britain’s affairs, it would not be “taking back control”.But even after the remarkable rebuff it received from the Brexit inner Cabinet on Wednesday, despite the Prime Minister putting her authority on the line by making clear her support for it, No10 won’t give up on the idea. It believes that, with a few changes, it can be made to work.Ministers are now bracing themselves for a huge effort from Theresa May’s allies to get them to change their minds.Already, No10 is telling ministers that what really matters is getting out, and that once the UK is no longer a member of the EU, all these problems can be ironed out at a later date.I understand that one minister has even been warned that the whole Brexit project might collapse without a customs partnership.The argument is that there is “no deal” without a customs partnership, which the Government views as being  key to solving the Irish border question.Without a deal, Parliament could turn on Brexit.The Chief Whip has also told Cabinet colleagues that he hasn’t got the votes to defeat a customs union amendment in the Commons. So, the best way to see that off is to embrace a customs partnership instead.But the local election results show that the Tory vote is becoming more and more Leave dominated. Number crunchers estimate that 70 per cent of Tory voters are leavers.As one influential Tory warns, this means that if Mrs May loses Brexit Secretary David Davis or Boris Johnson from the Cabinet over the customs partnership “and is seen to be selling out Brexit, the Tories will be utterly screwed electorally”.Another problem with the customs partnership idea is the message it sends the EU.As one insider tells me: “The EU is trying to force us into a false choice between a customs union and no deal — and we’re encouraging that by not being clear enough in our negotiating position.”Rather than trying to pressure ministers into backing her customs partnership idea, Mrs May should tell the  EU she wants a free trade  deal with sensible customs arrangements that keeps red tape to a minimum.Once she has been clear, she might find the EU more willing to negotiate.THE country is there for the taking. The local election results show neither Labour nor the Tories are able to break the political stalemate.If these results were replicated at a General Election, we would have another hung parliament.It is easy to declare that the country is permanently split, and that’s why no party can win a big majority. But I don’t think that’s right.Rather, the problem is that neither Labour nor the Tories are capable of reaching out.If Labour was led by a working-class leader from the Midlands who stood up for the country, then they would be on course for a proper majority. Equally, if the Tories were led by a Brexiteer whose upbeat, optimistic vision could appeal in Remain areas then they would be beating Corbyn comfortably.  Indeed, these local election results suggest that Labour under Corbyn has stalled – that it hasn’t kept up the progress it made in last year’s General Election.Now, Labour are highly unlikely to change leader before the next election.Jeremy Corbyn and his allies have seized control of the commanding heights of the Labour Party, and the new members who so fervently believe in him wouldn’t back a challenge to him whatever Labour MPs do.But the Tories will almost certainly change their leader before 2022. These results are a reminder that they need to show  they have delivered on Brexit by the time of the next election. Government whips have been calling round to ask Tory MPs what they think of handing the  NHS a funding boost on its 70th birthday in July, and how they would pay for it.These results suggest they would be well advised to portray this money as the beginning of the Brexit dividend for the health service.This might stick in the craw of Tory Remainers, but  voters now expect them to deliver on Brexit promises.When the Tories pick their new leader they need to go for someone with cross-over appeal – someone who can firm up their support among Leave voters but reach out to Remainers too.I am told that Bercow, who is currently under pressure over bullying allegations, doesn’t feel   he can say this publicly. But I am assured that this is his plan. It remains to be seen whether the knowledge that Bercow will go  will curtail calls for him to quit.Many in the Commons feel  the claims against him must be properly investigated if Parliament is to show  it is serious about protecting its  staff. Senior figures in Government are also keen to see the back of  him because they suspect him of encouraging Labour’s use of an arcane procedural device – “a humble address” – to try to winkle embarrassing information out of ministers.PENNY MORDAUNT presented to Cabinet on the gender pay gap this week.She turned in an assured performance less than 24 hours after being appointed minister for women and equalities, telling ministers to demand a plan to close the gender pay gap from the sectors covered by their department.But as one female Cabinet minister points out, no one mentioned the elephant in  the room – the fact that the second most senior woman  in the Cabinet had to quit  her job, only to be replaced by a man.Only five of the 23 full members of the Cabinet are women.  The Government might want to concentrate  on improving this balance before they lecture business any more.PHILIP HAMMOND and Michael Gove are clashing over the powers of the post-Brexit environmental regulator.The Environment Secretary wants it to have the  same power to hold the Government to account that the European Commission  has.  But the Chancellor is sceptical. Senior Treasury figures tell me he does not think it is sensible or necessary to continue these restraints post-Brexit.The dispute is causing some raised eyebrows. One Whitehall source describes it as part of the “constant war” between the pair.  The two obviously disagree on Brexit.But Hammond is also deeply unenthusiastic about Gove’s green agenda.James Forsyth is political editor of The Spectator.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Ukip is all but wiped out.Good news, maybe, for Theresa May’s party.

We hope the PM and her ­europhile backbench rebels realise it.Some half-baked customs compromise, or another forced on it by a ­Commons vote, will be a knife to the Government’s jugular and hand Ukip an unlikely route back from the dead.Some argue that voters couldn’t care less about the customs union. But wait till they realise that staying in one ends our newly-won independence as a  trading nation and locks us for ever into voiceless subservience to the EU.Brexit voters would be merciless.So Mrs May MUST heed her Cabinet Brexiters over her Remainer aides, dump her foolish “customs partnership” fudge and face her rebels down. She must then challenge the EU to get serious about solving the Irish border issue.Millions of Tory votes count on it.The party has a right to celebrate its election victories and improved  campaigning team. But it also has to recognise the precarious position it’s in.The ­Government is in a state of paralysis. It must start offering something positive to Remainers — especially those under 47 who lean towards Labour.Jeremy Corbyn’s vision is economically insane, but at least he has one. The Government must make the case for capitalism over socialism and give younger voters a real stake in it. A huge increase in affordable homes is vital.The Tories cannot survive on Brexit alone.AT long last voters have given Corbyn’s toxic party the bloody nose it deserves.Its rampant anti-Semitism killed it in Barnet. Maybe lefties’ racist barracking of new Home Secretary Sajid Javid online cost Labour elsewhere. Corbyn’s excuses for Russia and Assad didn’t help.Nor do voters like being hectored in public by arrogant young Corbyn cultists convinced of their own moral superiority.Brexit-backers, meanwhile, know Labour cannot be trusted.

Once again, we have been ignored and neglected.Some groups claimed that they had asked for the safety sheet to be green months ago - with the colour having been used as part of commemorations since the tragedy in June last year.Grenfell United, a group which represents those impacted by the blaze that claimed 71 lives, said despite their requests, they were ignored.A spokesperson said: Survivors, bereaved and the community agreed with the Government two things last year – that the tower would be covered and would be covered in green to reflect the wishes of the community and ensure that what happened would never be forgotten.The bill to replace the plastic sheet could reach as high as £400,000, the news outlet claimed.The tower still has not been completely covered - with fears that the process wont be done in time for the first anniversary of the tragedy, June 14.London Local Authority Gold, which is responsible for the building, said a decision would be made in due course.A spokesperson said: ‘We continue to consult closely with the community. The wrapping of the tower is by its nature a sensitive issue and one which many people have understandably strong views on.The inferno that tore through the Grenfell Tower in West London started at a Hotpoint fridge freezer - model number FF175BP.Witnesses said flames spread up the exterior cladding of the building sparking an urgent review of tower block safety.It was revealed that low cost cladding was fitted to the block in a £9million refurb completed in May last year, ordered by the firm that manages the tower."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000403713026.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"uk weather bank holiday weekend freezing fog beach","story":"The freak weather conditions appeared to come out of nowhere, stunning people who had flocked to Woolacombe Beach in Devon to make the most of the heatwave and the start of the long break.The popular beach was said to be cleared “in minutes” as temperatures plummeted suddenly after the cold fog suddenly appeared.The scenes at Woolacombe Beach, north Devon, were in stark contrast to scenes up and down the country as holidaymakers and locals flocked to the beaches to soak up the sun.Temperatures soared to just over 23C, making the UK warmer than many holiday hotspots on the continent, like the Spanish island of Ibiza.Britain is set to see the hottest early May Bank Holiday Monday since records began, the Met Office has said.After a cold and wet start to the week, the odds are the long weekend will be warm and pleasant, with the mercury likely to rise to 26C or 27C by Bank Holiday Monday.Sunday will be dry and warm, the Met Office said, with sunny spells expected for most of England and Wales.     The temperature of 23.3C was recorded near Heathrow Airport earlier today.Glorious sun is expected for the entire three-day weekend, with the sizzling temperatures expected to make it the hottest Bank Holiday in nearly two decades.Bank Holiday Monday in 1999 was 23.6C, while the hottest bank holiday weekend ever was in 1995 when temperatures peaked on the Saturday at 28.6C."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000403071308.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"beds for kids the gift of a bed","story":"There are 400,000 kids in this country who do not have a bed of their own.These shocking statistics will come as no surprise to desperate mums and dads in crisis, who have turned to charity Buttle UK’s Chances for Children campaign.Over the past ten years, the grant-giving charity has been a lifeline to thousands of families and young people in need.Now, YOU can help, too, with our great Beds For Kids campaign.Here, RUTH HARRISON talks to four mums about how the gift of a bed turned their life around.EMILIA slept in her mum’s bed for more than two years.But last November, Buttle UK delivered a new bed and mattress to the family home in South London, where seven-year-old Emilia lives with mum Lottie Woodman.Lottie, 45, believes it changed her daughter’s life, and says:WHEN Emilia grew out of her ­toddler bed, I didn’t have the money to replace it. I have osteoarthritis and cannot work. If I have to buy new school shoes, I decide what bills I can’t pay.I shared a bed with Emilia for more than two years and in that time I barely slept. Every time she moved, I’d wake up and it took me hours to get back to sleep. In November 2017, I was referred to the charity by my support worker.Within days, I received a message about a bed that was going to be delivered. The charity was a lifeline for me and Emilia.I know so many families in need – one friend puts her three children to sleep in a single bed each night. Children shouldn’t be living this way.Thankfully Emilia now has the space to dream. Without Buttle UK this wouldn’t have happened.FOR 18 months, Sylvia Johnson, 35, woke up in the morning to find her youngest son Daniel, 11, lying on the floor in a sleeping bag.His big brother, Quentin, 13, would be curled up on the sofa, groggy and irritable after a terrible night’s sleep.With no money to replace her two boys’ broken beds, Sylvia – who suffers from rheumatic pain and cannot work – felt like she was not doing her job properly as a mother.Sylvia, of St Austell, Cornwall, says:MY children had third-hand beds that became unbearable for them. So Quentin felt happier sleeping on the sofa, while Daniel chose to sleep on the floor.He’d pile cushions on top of one another to make it more comfortable and fell asleep in a sleeping bag. Quentin was angry and irritable and the two of them would argue all the time because they were so tired.Both are bright and their schoolwork suffered. They were constantly late for school and Quentin started to take time off because he was so exhausted. His mood suffered and he started to get depressed.Every night, I was so stressed. I didn’t know where Daniel was going to sleep – the chair or the floor? I knew I had to tell someone but I was scared and felt like I wasn’t doing my job. I worried people would judge me or take my kids away.But I was losing my mind so I told the school and was referred to the charity in June last year. I know people take having a bed for granted but sleep is so important to a child’s health and education.Now with their new beds, Quentin is in the top set for maths, science and English.My sons have their own space and don’t argue anywhere near as much.It’s not shameful to need help and to ask for it. Some people think there’s no such thing as poverty in this country but they have no idea.This gift has changed our lives. Because someone was willing to help me and not judge us, I’ve been able to ask for help in other areas of my life.SINGLE mum Emma Ross couldn’t afford to replace her sons’ bunk beds when they broke last year.Emma, 38, was forced to share a bed with her sons Daniel, 13, and Christopher, six, for four weeks, while daughter Emily, 11, slept in the room next door. The barber, from Gateshead, Tyne and Wear, says: WHEN we moved house last November, the boys’ bunk beds got damaged. When you’re a single parent who works part-time, you allow for day-to-day expenses but not that kind of money.The three of us slept in my bed for four weeks and it was a nightmare.Daniel was grumpy when he woke up and teachers started to notice how tired Christopher was at school. I couldn’t tell them the truth so I just said he was going to bed too late.Daniel moved in with my ­parents until I was able to sort out a new bed. I got in touch with Buttle UK and they delivered new bunk beds within four weeks.I felt as if a huge weight had been lifted off my shoulders. The kids were over the moon and now wake up fresh for school.MUM-of-one Siobhan Flynn, 32, shared a bed with her nine-year-old son Joseph for almost a year after she could not afford to replace his broken one.Siobhan, who lives near Rochester, Kent, says:JOSEPH has autism. Sometimes I don’t think he knows why he doesn’t want to do something and he finds it hard to verbalise his needs. He had barely slept in his own bed when it broke in August 2016. It was poorly made and uncomfortable, and Joseph refused to sleep in it.I’d ask him questions and jokingly say, “Even Superman sleeps in his own bed,” but he found it difficult to be there alone. The company refused to replace his bed and wanted to send an engineer to check if there was a fault. But I was worried they would tear it apart and leave it in a worse condition, so I refused.I didn’t have enough money to buy another so Joseph ended up in bed with me. It was hard. He’d hog the covers and I’d always end up with no space, with either an arm or leg thrown over me, and it affected our sleep.Joseph finds it difficult to go to sleep at a normal time and usually drifts off around midnight. It doesn’t matter if I read him a story, put him in his pyjamas or give him a nice bath, Joseph reminds me of a mobile phone battery. He’s not going to switch off at 25 per cent, he needs to wind down completely. He is often tired at school and has fallen asleep in class but I can’t force him to go to sleep.It was almost a year living like this before I applied for a new bed and mattress – and I don’t know what I would have done ­without the charity’s help. Perhaps I’d still be in the same position because £400 for a new bed and mattress is a huge amount of money to me.There were no other options. Nowadays, Joseph still doesn’t sleep in his own bed as much as I would like.He doesn’t like being alone and hates the dark but it’s important he feels ­independent. Knowing he has his own safe and secure bed to sleep in is a huge relief. Kids need breathing 7 space of their own.THERE are three ways to get involved with our Beds for Kids campaign – and YOUR support will make all the difference.FOR every bed or mattress bought from Dreams Beds stores across the country, one will be donated to Chances for Children.READERS can also donate directly to the charity through the Beds for Kids page at mydonate.bt/charities/bedsforkids or via your Sun Savers wallet.YOU can also buy a copy of the specially created book, That’s No Place To Sleep.   Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I was so miserable I even contemplated ending it all.“I’ve given up on my dad and the pain that he causes and I’m starting to build a life for myself.”In a heartbreaking interview, Taylor-Ann, a delivery driver, reveals how “Rocket” Ronnie has seen her just ten times in 21 years, despite living just TEN miles from her in Essex.She also told how Ronnie, who is worth £8million, cut her £1,000-a-month maintenance payments after accusing her of treating him like a cash machine — and claimed he branded her a “cokehead”.He also offered ZERO help in her recovery, even though Ronnie checked himself into rehab in 2000 for drug and alcohol addiction.That lack of support left Taylor-Ann hurt and bewildered.She said: “I thought of all the people in the world he would understand better than most how I struggled with depression and how I’d turned to drink and drugs.People had helped him recover and forgiven him but he was clearly writing me off.”Growing up, Taylor-Ann saw very little of Ronnie, who last weekend crashed out of this year’s Snooker World Championships in the second round.Taylor-Ann’s mum, Sally Ann, discovered she was pregnant just weeks after an acrimonious split with Ronnie in 1996.Taylor-Ann says: “When I look back our relationship was tragic. I used to google my dad when I was little. I’d screen-shot pictures of him and compare them to ones of me to see if I resembled him. I was desperate for his attention.“I haven’t watched him play since I was four. He promised he’d wave to me from the telly and I watched a whole tournament just waiting for my special wave. It never came and I was heartbroken.”But with no real understanding of her dad’s true character, Taylor-Ann was not prepared for the blow that sent her life reeling in 2013, when she was just 17.She explained: “I’d got a place at college to do business studies. As it was too far to commute my mum helped me find a flat. I was thrilled. I loved the course and got distinctions in the first year. I was so excited about telling Dad so I met him in a cafe.“I told him Mum had transferred the £1,080 per month maintenance he paid to her into my bank to cover my rent, bills and college fees.“He seemed a bit surprised. He raised an eyebrow and said, ‘That’s what you use it for?’ I hit back, saying, ‘I just want my dad’.“He smiled and nodded. I asked him to stay in touch. I remember saying a phone call every couple of months would be plenty. It was pathetic, really, looking back. But then I had no idea what was about to happen.”She claims that after dropping her home, Ronnie severed all contact and immediately stopped the payments.She said: “He’d stopped paying the court-ordered amount. I couldn’t believe it, especially when he knew it was covering my rent and college fees.”Unable to pay her rent, Taylor-Ann lost her home and was forced to drop out of college — before the courts had time to order Ronnie to cough up the arrears. He later resumed the payments — but the damage had been done.Taylor-Ann said: “I became depressed by what had happened and started drinking heavily to forget how miserable I was. I lost my driving licence for speeding, my job, and doing cocaine became a regular thing.“To be honest I didn’t really care. I just wanted to blot out the pain my dad had caused. Several times I thought about just ending my life and the whole sorry mess.”Taylor-Ann, from Redbridge, Essex, claims she had no contact with dad-of-three Ronnie, who is now dating Holby City actress Laila Rouass, 46, for years before texting him in 2016.She said: “I hadn’t called him or spoken to him for three years. It felt like we were finally building bridges“I wasn’t even sure of his number but just sent a text saying, ‘Hi Dad’ and he replied, ‘All right mate’. Even that was difficult. I didn’t want to be his mate, I’m his daughter.“To be fair, we did have a long chat on the phone a few days later. We caught up on everything that had happened to both of us. He sounded like he cared then.“We talked a couple more times on the phone over the next few months. It felt we were finally building bridges.”They even went out for a Thai meal last March with his children from another relationship Lily, now 12, and little Ronnie, ten.She said: “It was lovely to see my brother and sister. I really love them and am happy and grateful that they have a better relationship with their dad than I do. I confided in Dad about my problems.“He offered to pay for me to re-take my driving test and get my licence back. He could see how touched I was by the offer and even said, ‘Look, it’s not just you I ignore when things get difficult — I do it to Lily when she gets demanding’.“I think he was trying to make me feel better — in a clumsy way. I was grateful and managed to ask why he’d stopped paying my maintenance the year before.“His reply stunned me. He said, ‘You know Taylor-Ann, I’ve gone through life with people treating me like an ATM machine. Why should I keep paying? What do I get out of it?’”She found Ronnie’s hard love a shock and was more confused when he sent her a text that night. She said: “He sent me a really lovely message. He said he was proud of me for recognising my problems and attempting to deal with them.“I immediately forgot his harsh words earlier and was so delighted that he’d said he was proud of me. It was one of the few times he’d paid me a compliment in my life.”But the relationship took a terrible turn when Taylor-Ann — who had still not kicked her drug issue — went on a night out with a mutual friend of Ronnie’s.During a cocaine binge, the friend told Taylor-Ann her dad had warned the rest of the family to sever all ties with her. She said: “I was so hurt, so upset. I had no idea whether it was true. At some point the person I was with rang my dad and started having a go at him.“She had the phone on speaker and I heard my dad say, ‘You pair of cokeheads need help’.“I just broke down and sobbed because he obviously wasn’t going to help me. I tried to contact him to explain but it seemed he no longer wanted to know.”A few days later — in March last year — a broken Taylor-Ann checked into a rehab centre for cocaine addiction. But she claims at no point did her dad visit, call or even message to ask how she was.Just days after coming out of rehab she landed a new job at a car parts firm, where she met her boyfriend — and father of her child — Naihan Chowdhury, 21. The pair are now sharing a one-bed flat in Romford, Essex.Taylor-Ann, whose baby is due in October, said: “We don’t have a lot but we have everything a baby needs — two parents that love it and want to cherish and care for it.“Naihan is the same age as my dad was when I was born, but I already know he’s going to be a better dad than Ronnie ever was because he’s here and helping. I wish Dad had been there for me but he wasn’t, all I ever wanted was his love. I’ll make sure we learn from all the mistakes he made with me.”Ronnie declined to comment on Taylor-Ann’s claims.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We work aggressively to ensure that we do not have terrorists or terror groups using the site, and we also remove any content that praises or supports terrorism.Our approach is working – 99 per cent of ISIS and Al Qaeda-related content we remove is found by our automated systems. But there is no easy technical fix to fight online extremism."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000403689862.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"john bercow likened harvey weinstein black rod","story":"A former House of Commons official says the Speaker had “stepped over the line”.Mr Bercow is resisting calls to step down over bullying allegations which he denies.Former Black Rod David Leakey — who worked with him — said: “John Bercow is not an altogether bad Speaker.

but only to the property line.However, if you trim the branches back past this point and reach into your neighbours garden this can constitute trespassing and land you in trouble.Getty - ContributorFollowing the same idea, any fruit that falls into your garden is still your neighbours property.This means you cant collect it up and keep it for yourself without getting their permission first.Tidying up your garden and clearing away any trimmed branches from the ground might seem straightforward enough but even this carries a potential risk.If the branches come from your neighbours trees or bushes then they technically own them - even if you chopped them down.But, you also cant throw them into your neighbours garden as this counts as fly tipping.Whilst its unlikely your neighbour will mind, its still best to check they dont want the branches back for a bonfire or something. If youre planing on planting an extra tree in your garden you need to be careful it doesnt affect the house next door.Any window that has benefited from natural unobstructed natural light for more than 20 years must not be blocked by a tree and doing so could get you in trouble.Often having a barbecue is a great way to get to know the neighbours by inviting them over, they can also become a source of tension for those with a strained relationship.Neighbours can report a barbecue as a fire hazard or statutory nuisance and put you on the wrong side of the law.Fences are a long-standing source of tension between neighbours - the best rule to follow is that you are responsible for the fence on the right-hand side of your property if you have one on both sides.But, every property is different so its wise to check what falls within your boundary.If youre unsure what falls within your property you can contact HM Land Registry for help.Now a garden staple for most families, trampolines are a warm-weather highlight for most children and adults.However, there is a chance your neighbours could complain by saying it is an intrusion into their private lives if they feel the trampoline is an excuse to peek over the fence or hedge into their home.To dodge any conflict you should try and place your trampoline away from the boundary and educate anyone using it about the importance of privacy.Hot tubs are a firm favourite and add a bit of class and luxury to an outdoor area - plus theyre great for parties.But, they can become an unwanted noisy nuisance to your neighbours if the party gets too loud or goes on late into the night."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000169009014.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"top labour mp caroline flint tells pro eu lords and mps to stop playing games over brexit","story":"Former Minister for Europe Caroline Flint said planned amendments to key Brexit legislation by peers in the Lords would bind Theresa May’s hands in the negotiations.

He claimed the company was in the process of making big decisions about future production and there were concerns about how its \"just in time\" manufacturing model would deal with customs checks.Toyota employs 3,500 people in the UK - and Mr Clark said jobs had to be at the forefront of Britain\u0027s future customs model.Mr Clark said: \"Of course business wants certainty.

Many were in the process of moving home and switching kids’ schools after being offered permanent hospital posts last month. But now they face losing their new jobs after a “dreadful” error meant some candidates were given the wrong interview marks. The Royal College of Physicians said it would have to rerun the offers process. The British Medical Association said it was “appalled” to learn of the blunder, warning it had caused “extreme anxiety” for trainees. Those hit had been offered jobs in 24 different fields through ST3 Recruitment, a nationally co-ordinated system for hiring doctors. But last week the RCP discovered some candidates had been given the wrong interview marks due to an error in transferring data from one computer program to another. It meant there were a “significant number” of incorrect rankings.  In a letter to junior doctors, the RCP said: “We are deeply sorry that it has been necessary to rerun the ST3 offer process due to a mistake in this round of processing. “We have taken this approach to be fair to all candidates which can only be achieved with the real scores used.” Furious BMA chief Chaand Nagpaul said he had spoken to RCP president Prof Jane Dacre to “articulate the strength of feeling and extent of the impact that this has had”. He said: “We have heard from trainees who have, after receiving these job offers, put down deposits on homes, arranged moves or whose families had adjusted their plans. “We cannot express how unacceptable we find this situation and the impact - both emotionally and financially - it is having on junior doctors across the UK.”  The RCP said it would do its “utmost” to resolve the cases of those who had accepted offers and made “unretractable commitments” based on those offers. It added: “We set the highest standards for our work and expect to be held to them. “We have not met them here and are truly sorry. We will learn from our mistake and make any changes necessary to fix it.” The offers process will begin again on May 14. As many as 1,500 junior doctors offered posts as registrars are feared to have had their job offers withdrawn. Doctors say they have been left stressed and in limbo, and potentially out of pocket over plans to move home. Fellow doctors described juniors as being in tears.

The day of drinking has become a tradition at the university, drawing thousands of students to Jesus Green ahead of their exam season. It\u0027s is usually held on the Sunday of the Bank Holiday weekend, and according to Cambridge legend, began as all good parties do: with a dispute over a bottle of booze. The event is said to have originated from a disagreement about 80 years ago between two drinking societies who quarrelled over a bottle of stolen Pimm\u0027s.  These days, Caesarian Sunday marks the last hurrah before it\u0027s time to knuckle down for exam season.

Andy Perry, who almost died, is believed to be the first Brit to lose an entire leg from a spider bite. The 46-year-old had been working as a landscaper when he fell ill with severe back pain just 48 hours after a fencing job in Thorpe Astley, Leics. He had no idea he had been bitten on the ankle by Britain\u0027s most venomous spider until he was rushed to hospital suffering from sepsis and kidney failure.  Andy required emergency care, was placed on an IV drip and remained at Leicester Royal Infirmary for a week. Over the next few weeks the infection subsided but he was left with lymphedema - a painful and debilitating swelling of the leg, which left his skin falling off. He said the pain got so bad that he even considered chopping off his own leg with a chainsaw. After numerous appointments with specialists Andy opted for an elective amputation above his right knee, which was carried out in March. He has now been left wheelchair bound, unable to work or play with his children and needs daily treatment. Andy, of Huncote, Leics., who lives with his police officer wife Christine, 39, said: I was doing a quote for a job in 2015 and I was coming home at lunchtime to look after the kids because my wife was on shift.  But within a couple of hours I started feeling really poorly. I rang the missus to see if she could come home but she couldn\u0027t and the next I know I got a massive ache in the small of my back. That was pretty much me done then and Christine came back home when I called her again. I went to bed when she got back, pretty much for the whole weekend and I was throwing up. Then on the Sunday morning it was a question of having to get over to the hospital as soon as I could. I was seen by a doctor in the Royal Leicester Infirmary Triage and he said there was no chance of me going home.  Then he admitted me straight away, the ache in my back was the kidney\u0027s packing up from the infection and sepsis. I put on a IV anti-biotic and almost died because of the sepsis. Experts believed the false widow spider was to blame after daily blood test when a phlebotomist noticed two puncture marks on Andy\u0027s ankle. The doctor in charge deemed the bite to be from the false widow spider - as its bite has similar effects that Andy was experiencing. Andy added: It was the phlebotomist who did my daily blood test - he spotted these little puncture marks on my ankle. He said it looks like a spider bite, they then got the doctor in charge to have look and that\u0027s what they came to agreement on. They came to a conclusion it was a false widow spider because it has a reputation of biting people.  The puncture marks were just above the sock line because I used to wear socks and boots. The only thing we can think of is that I literally just brushed past it and its had a quick bite as I\u0027ve gone past. Apparently the bite of the false widow feels like a bee sting but I didn\u0027t feel a thing. He added: The spiders are an awful lot more common than people think. After they sorted out the kidney function, things started improving and the sepsis was beaten by the anti-biotics. I\u0027ve had the district nurses coming around for the next three months changing the dressing on my leg every day. The lymphedema caused the leg to swell to the point where the skin split and fell off. That was all just a massive open weeping sores and blisters and just generally horribleness.  At that point, Andy said, his leg was all but useless and he spent time trying to get treatment. He added: There just wasn\u0027t a surgeon nearby who wanted to touch it because of the lymphedema as it was a live infection. So without getting any treatment I just couldn\u0027t work - so I figured I would go down the route of elective amputation in a last desperate attempt to get back to work. But again trying to find a doctor or surgeon to look at the amputation was hard. Eventually I had to threaten my GP with cutting my own leg off with a blade from a chainsaw because I was getting so desperate. Out of that I tried a guy in Coventry who climbed on board straight away as soon as he saw the leg. Andy said he got a second opinion after the conversation and spoke to prosthetics specialists. His leg was amputated on March 13 this year, but he suffered a setback when he got a secondary infection, resulting in another surgery on April 27. He said: I\u0027ve now got a vacuum dressing on me which pulls all of the gulp out of the leg and takes it away.

Showing no evidence whatsoever of any sibling jealously, the photos (taken by mum Kate ) showed a tender moment between Charlotte and Louis, as the proud big sister gives the little prince a kiss.  The picture of Charlotte is similar to one Kate took of George holding his little sister a few weeks after her birth. But as eagle-eyed royal watchers have spotted, it\u0027s not the only photo this new snap bears a strong resemblance to. Take a look at this picture of a baby Prince William taken 35 years ago...    Twitter account Kate Middleton Fans spied the striking similarity Prince Louis has to his father - even down to their wrinkly fingers. As many a parent knows, wrinkly hands and feet are normal with newborn babies, and soon plump out.  Prince Louis also appears to be wearing a second-hand ensemble from big sister Charlotte, as his outfit is nearly identical to one she sported in photos taken weeks after her birth. Charlotte was pictured in a blue cardigan which her older brother George (who was mysteriously absent from the photos) wore for a Vanity Fair shoot.

John Kinsella, 53, was the man shot dead while walking his dog in a secluded woodland alongside the M62 in Merseyside, the Liverpool Echo reports. The gunman is thought to have been on a mountain bike when he fled the scene near the Rainhill Stoops interchange on Saturday morning. Kinsella was once arrested in Amsterdam after fleeing the UK while under investigation for a robbery at a haulage depot.  In 2008, he was convicted for that robbery and the boxer and martial arts exponent, formerly from Everton, was handed an 11-year sentence for robbery, dangerous driving and skipping bail. During his trial, Kinsella admitted he was close to the scene at the time of the raid in Grantham, Lincolnshire, but claimed he was in the area to enforce a \u0026pound100,000 debt. While in the dock, his work for Liverpool FC hero Gerrard - who last week was named new manager of Rangers - was used as an example of how he collected debts and sorted out problems.  Kinsella claimed he had been contacted by Gerrard\u0027s family after the player was being targeted by George Bromley Jnr, a man nicknamed \u0027The Psycho\u0027 and described as a “violent figure” whose father, another gangland enforcer, had been “executed”. Kinsella claimed he spoke to George Bromley and from then on Bromley left Gerrard alone. The court was later read a letter from Gerrard’s father Paul – obtained after Kinsella went to his home – in which the claims were confirmed.  Mr Gerrard said that, for two years, Bromley attempted to extort money from his son – and threatened to “maim” him – until Kinsella stepped in. Paul Gerrard, whose letter was confirmed as genuine by police, said he and his son had “total respect” for Kinsella. Kinsella, a judo and jujitsu expert, had already served a nine-year prison term when he was contacted by the Gerrards.  He received the sentence at Liverpool Crown Court in October 1991 for attempted robbery and carrying a firearm with intent to commit an offence. Kinsella is believed to have been walking his dog with a friend or family member when he was targeted in a chilling attack at 7am on Saturday. His associate was not injured. A gunman, thought to have been wearing a hi-vis jacket, is believed to have shot Kinsella in a section of woodland popular with dog walkers at around 7am.  The assassin then fled the scene on a mountain bike. Kinsella was pronounced dead and Merseyside Police launched an investigation into the attack that led to a section of an M62 slip road being blocked off. Enquiries are ongoing to identify the gunman, who is described as male, around six foot and of a slim build. A Merseyside police spokeswoman said: “He was wearing dark clothing and a hi-vis jacket and riding a mountain bike. “If you saw someone matching this description around the time or area of the incident, please get in touch.

The Hull University student, named only as Tess, was studying in the library when she made the gruesome discovery - which prompted her to cause a bit of a racket before she captured the insect on camera. The 38-year-old nursing student quickly sent a video of the larva-like insect to her husband, Steve, who immediately went to the Kingswood store to complain to staff.  Steve was given a new fruit pot and \u0026pound10 compensation for the distress caused - however Tess raised concerns over how the bug ended up inside the packaging in the first place, Hull Daily Mail reports.   Tess said: I was having the fruit pot as a snack and I had nearly eaten of all of it. “I went to put the plastic fork in my mouth after picking up a grape and on the back of the grape was this thing. “I cannot understand how that got through. You expect it maybe when with lettuce as things might creep in and hide but for pre-packaged fruit it should have already gone through quality control. “I don’t think it was a maggot but it looks a larva of some kind. It was full of life and it wasn’t nice at all. “I think it’s appalling from Asda because it was still in date until Saturday on the box. I had already had one or two and you just don’t know whether I had already eaten one.”  Tess fears she would not have spotted the creature if she had porridge with her fruit pot, as she usually does. She said: “If I had poured the fruit into the porridge I would never have seen it. “It’s lucky that the traffic was really bad so I didn’t have time to take the porridge with me.” Tess said she plans to return to Asda as it is the supermarket she uses to buy her children’s school clothes from. However, her shock find has put her off eating fruit in any form for the foreseeable future. She added: “I don’t think I will eat fruit for a while – even anything pre-packaged. Even my friend couldn’t eat her food after seeing what we saw. “From now on I will always be checking anything that is pre-packed and ready to eat.” "},{"url":null,"title":"keep house cool heatwave sleep","story":"NewsWays to keep your home cool in a heatwave so you can relax and fall asleep easilyThe heat is lovely, but it also comes with some drawbacks - here are 17 tips and tricks to bring the temperature down\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByJo-Anne RowneyDeputy Audience Growth Editor17:50, 6 MAY 2018Updated18:36, 6 MAY 2018NewsVideo LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in 8CancelPlay now\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailIt\u0027s awful tossing and turning in bed, stuck to the sheets, drenched in sweat. The heatwave is no fun for anyone, but there are a few things you can do to at least cool down your home. There\u0027s nothing worse than trying to nod off in your room, or trying to relax, while feeling like you\u0027re in the seventh circle of hell. Being in the midst of a heatwave is not as fun as it first sounds, especially without air con, but there are some things you can do to cool down your home and finally get some shut eye. Before we get to how to use a freezer to your advantage (not sticking your head in it) and getting as low as you can (no this isn\u0027t limbo), we have to acknowledge the quickest way is to get air con. Of course, the bad thing about getting air con is the cost - upfront and then running it - so here are a few quick tips and tricks to drop your home\u0027s temperature without spending too much.  Keep away from the satin and silk and opt for the cooler linen and cotton sheets. Light-coloured bed linen made of light fabrics (take Egyptian cotton for example) are breathable so better to sleep in. The Egyptians had it right, in fact, they even had their own method for keeping cool. Known as The Egyptian Method (original, we know) they\u0027d dampen a towel or sheet in cool water and use it as a blanket. It may be a good idea to lay the damp sheet on top of a towel first, no one likes a wet bed. 2. Freezer tricks Speaking of sheets, you can stick them in the freezer for a few minutes before you\u0027re about to go to sleep. No, we haven\u0027t lost our minds, just make sure you put them in something like a plastic bag before you pop them in. You don\u0027t want your sheets smelling of pizza and ice cream. The trick won\u0027t last all night but it will give you a breather so you can get to sleep. 3. Don\u0027t cook a roast  ...or any hot meal. Summer is never the time to be whipping up a casserole or hot meal. Put the slow cooker away, step away from the stove and have a salad. 4. Use that hot water bottle Buy yourself a hot water bottle. While we\u0027re used to filling them with hot water in the winter to keep toasty, in the summer sticking it in the freezer instead creates a lovely ice pack. 5. Turn your fan around Fans are great in the mild heat, but when it\u0027s cranked up they just blow hot air around so it\u0027s all about strategic placement. If you point them outside, slightly towards the windows, they push out the hot air. If you have a ceiling fan set them counter-clockwise to pull the hot air away. 6. Ice fan  We\u0027ve already mentioned fans, but there\u0027s so much more to be said. At school we used to use those little iceboxes to keep our food cool, so this idea comes from that. It\u0027s sort of a DIY aircon system. Use a roasting pan, or box and fill it with ice and put it in front of a fan. When the ice melts the breeze from the fan picks up the cool air coming from the ice\u0027s surface, creating a nice cool mist. 7. Cross breeze More of the fan tricks. Strategically place numerous fans around a room. Put a fan by the window, and then another further inside the room so they both push the cooler air around the room. 8. How low can you go Hot air rises so sleeping in a room on the ground floor means you\u0027ll feel cooler. If you\u0027re in a one-storey flat you can move your sheet to the ground to make life easier. 9. Don\u0027t get steamy  We imagine you\u0027re continually hopping in the shower to cool down, just make sure the water is tepid rather than warm/hot. Steam hangs about and makes a room that much hotter. 10. No lights This should make sense. Light bulbs - even if they\u0027re environmentally friendly - give off heat, so switch them off. The sun shines for longer now anyway so keeping the lights off not only saves on your energy bill, but cuts down on the extra heat. 11. Hang a wet sheet Yes, you read that right. Hanging a wet sheet in front of an open window will help bring down the room\u0027s temperature. 12. No electronic devices  The same applies here as the lights. Unplug your phone and devices, do not charge them when you are asleep. Everything radiates heat and you don\u0027t need that when you\u0027re trying to catch some zzzs. 13. Use grains Buckwheat pillows don\u0027t absorb heat like cotton does so getting one is a good investment for summer. 14. Closing curtains  In the daytime. If you think about when the sun is at its hottest those rays are coming through the window hotting everything up. Close the curtains and your room is instantly cooler.  15. Use your garden  If you plant the right trees and shrubs around the house they will provide you with much needed shade. Vines work well too. Of course that won\u0027t work for this summer, but next year you\u0027ll be thanking us. 16. Paint it white  Again, maybe one for next year, but painting your house white helps. The white colour reflects the light, cooling the house down. 17. Insulate  Long-term thinking again. When you think of insulation you probably think of keeping warm, but it can work the other way too. Good insulation keeps the heat out as well once the room is cooled down.

Her tennis star sons Andy and Jamie attended the primary school when a gunman killed 16 pupils and a teacher. Judy, 58, said she had hoped other shootings in the States would prompt changes to gun control laws there. But in February, 17 children were shot dead at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School near Miami, Florida. Judy said: “[I cried] when I heard about the most recent school shooting.” Addressing the US President, she went on: “Learn from what happened in Dun\u0026shy\u0026shyblane. Our Government acted and there hasn’t been an incident like it since. “In America, shootings happen on a regular basis. Trump could flick the switch and change all that.”  Her call came as Dunblane survivor Aimie Adam, 27, said she wants to meet the US leader when he visits the UK later this year, to question him about gun laws. She was five when Thomas Hamilton shot her twice at the primary school, near Stirling, shattering her thigh and back. Private ownership of handguns was banned after the 1996 horror. Mental health nurse Aimie, who was left with permanent injuries from the attack, said: “I know there are people who don’t want Trump to come to Scotland, but I do want him to come.  “I want to meet him, and hopefully I can twist his arm by letting him know what it is like to have your life devastated by gun violence. “I would also tell him there is something that you can do about it. We changed gun laws after Dunblane and we have never had another school shooting.” Judy’s sons were in the school when Hamilton, who the family knew, killed pupils and teacher Gwen Mayor, before turning the gun on himself.

This is not the first time Kate, 36, – one of the world’s most photographed women – has gone the other side of the lens. In 2015 she took the first official photographs of Charlotte. Kate has also released pictures to mark other milestones in her children’s lives, including George and Charlotte’s first days at nursery school.  Last year she accepted a lifetime honorary membership of the Royal Photographic Society in recognition of her talent and enthusiasm. Kate’s work also gets the thumbs-up from Mirror photographer Ian Vogler. He said: “It’s always hard to get a nice picture of very young children. I know from my own experiences. But the Duchess of Cambridge has done a really good job with the picture of Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis. “It’s a really charming image of a big sister proud of her new sibling. “Both pictures are nicely lit with natural daylight the best way to photograph children. The picture of Prince Louis on his own is more formal looking but at the same time it’s very good. “Just getting such a young baby to keep his eyes open is an achievement.” "},{"url":null,"title":"supermarket shoppers urged check cupboards","story":"NewsSupermarket shoppers urged to check cupboards after Lidl, Tesco and Sainsbury\u0027s urgently recall these productsA number of leading stores have issued urgent recalls for tarnished products due to fears over allergies, choking hazards and possibly dangerous pet food\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByJamie Bullen23:42, 5 MAY 2018Updated08:42, 6 MAY 2018NewsVideo LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in 8CancelPlay now\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThree leading British supermarkets have urged shoppers to check their cupboards for tarnished products after recalling some of their products. Tesco, Sainsbury\u0027s and Lidl have all issued urgent recalls over fears that include allergies, choking hazards and possible dangerous pet food.  The Croydon Advertiser has put together a breakdown of the affected products are and guidance on what to do if you have bought them.  The products being recalled by bosses include croquettes, sliced beetroot, pet food, toy cars and sausage and mash.  Tesco - Hearty Food Company - Cottage Pie / Sausage and Mash   Tesco is recalling Hearty Food Company Cottage Pie and Hearty Food Company Sausage and Mash because it contains milk which is not mentioned on the label.

Lidl - Aunt Bessie\u0027s Croquettes   Aunt Bessie\u0027s is recalling Aunt Bessie\u0027s Croquettes because the packs may also include potato balls that contain egg, which is not mentioned on the label.

Kate Middleton and Prince William have gone the traditional route with George, Charlotte and more recently, Louis. But other families are prepared to try something a bit different.  The Daily Record has reported on three Scottish families who found inspiration in some rather unusual places.   Ransom Morrow   The parents of Ransom Morrow hope his life won’t be as wild as the cowboy he’s named after. Lydia, 22, and illustrator Dave, 31, called their six-month-old son after Jimmy Stewart’s character in the Western The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance. The couple, who live in Glasgow, say their little boy has been holding their hearts to ransom since he arrived on October 4 last year.  Lydia, who was born in Indiana, US, said: “A couple of years ago, we were talking about baby names while watching a Western. Jimmy Stewart’s character was called Ransom and we both agreed it was a great name. “When we found out I was pregnant, we started discussing names but couldn’t agree on a single one. The only one we both liked was Ransom so it stuck. “People think it’s unusual but he suits it and we can’t imagine him being called anything else.” Lydia, who has just graduated from Glasgow School of Art, added: “We are quite a creative family. Dave is an animator and illustrator and I’m hoping to do something in textile design so it makes sense that we were creative when it came to naming our baby.”  Amazon   When parents Anneliese Pirt and Andy Harris were searching for a name for their little boy, they wanted something unique. So they turned to their family tree for inspiration and called their son after the world’s most famous rainforest – and not, as some have suggested, the online retailer. And at just six months old, Amazon Atlas Spruce Harris is already living up to his globe-trotting name. The Edinburgh-born tot has visited Denmark, Switzerland, Australia and Fiji.  Primary school teacher Anneliese, 36, said: “We get a lot of people asking us if he is named after Amazon – but we just politely smile and say no.  “We wanted him to have a name that was unusual and special to us. Amazon really suits him and he already has the personality to match.” Anneliese says she and husband Andy, 41, a safety expert, chose the name Amazon to honour her relative Richard Spruce, a 19th-century botanist who spent 15 years exploring the river. She said: “Richard is famous in the world of botany. He was a great Victorian explorer and travelled down the Amazon.  “I’ve done research into him and discovered there is even a statue in his honour in Banos, Ecuador, which I have visited. “My grandad researched our family tree to find out my exact connection to Richard and he was probably my great-great uncle. Spruce is my mum’s maiden name. Andy and I had a great trip to South America, going down the Amazon following in my ancestor’s footsteps from Peru through Colombia to Brazil.  “We both fell in love with the idea of calling our baby Amazon and decided it was a good unisex name that would work whether we had a boy or a girl.”   The couple also set their hearts on the name Atlas as a middle name for their son, who was born at the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh last October. Anneliese, who was born in Edinburgh, added: “Andy and I both have a love of travelling. “We actually met abroad. So Atlas reflects our love of travel, our hopes Amazon will enjoy travelling too and that he will know his way in life.  “We are now living in Fiji. Travelling is in Amazon’s genes – it’s the perfect name .”   Ultra-Violet  "},{"url":null,"title":"uk weather roast russia makes","story":"NewsUK Weather: The \u0027Roast from Russia\u0027 makes British Bank Holiday hotter than Hawaii but thunderstorms are comingTemperatures could hit 29C (84.2F) as many round off the three-day weekend in 15 hours of sunrise-to-sunset “unbroken sunshine” - but the rain will be here by the end of the week\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByBen RossingtonNews reporter21:17, 6 MAY 2018Updated21:44, 6 MAY 2018NewsThe sun rises over the city of London - as seen from Richmond (Image: PA)\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailBritain will sizzle tomorrow on a record-breaking Bank Holiday. After basking in a weekend of sunshine, it could be the hottest early May bank holiday Monday since records began and will see the mercury top even that of Mexico. Temperatures could hit 29C (84.2F) as people round off the three-day weekend in 15 hours of sunrise-to-sunset “unbroken sunshine” for many, the Met Office said. That will see Britain hotter than both 23C Mexico City and 26C Honolulu, Hawaii. But sunlovers are already being warned to make the most of it, with rain and thunderstorms on their way by the end of the week. After the ‘Beast from the East’ left the country shivering last month, Britain will bake in the ‘roast from Russia’, with hot air arriving from 30C southern Russia, the Met Office said. The Met Office said the South East, East Anglia and the East Midlands will feel the heat most. Scotland and Northern Ireland will be a little cooler, but even eastern parts of Scotland will reach the low 20s at times.  Met Office forecaster Marco Petagna said: “It will certainly be the warmest early May Bank Holiday on record, with 29C possible in the South-East. “There will be plenty of sunshine for most, with good conditions for outdoor activities. “Tuesday has 28C possible again, with the low 20s from Wednesday and a lot of fine weather in days ahead, with only the chance of a shower on Tuesday and Thursday.” Although things are likely to worsen by next weekend, the outlook for the summer is good. The Met Office three-month forecast, being briefed to councils, transport chiefs and business leaders, said: “For May-July, above-average temperatures are more probable than below-average temperatures. “The probability the UK average temperature for May-July will fall into the warmest of our five categories is 30 per cent. The probability of the coldest of our five categories is between 5 and 10 per cent.” The Weather Outlook forecaster Brian Gaze said: “This summer could be the warmest for five years.  “31C could be seen from June onwards. Warm air is due from continental Europe. “As recent summers have been so mixed, this summer has a higher chance of being the warmest since 2013. But there will also be cool and wet spells.” Today’s sunshine is likely to signal another stampede to the beaches, which were full yesterday. Around 125,000 visitors are expected to hit Brighton, 50,000 at Bournemouth and another possible 50,000 at Blackpool today.

Most Brits are so baffled by washing instruction labels that thousands of pounds worth of garments are ruined. Fewer than one in seven of us can correctly identify the six most common washing symbols. As a result one in three simply sling clothes in the machine without checking labels. Most of us admit to having accidentally washed items that are dry clean only. Men tend to be more careless, with 78% always using the same washing programme. But almost half of women use just three programmes or fewer. Yet these are not the only startling stats to come out in the wash in school uniform supplier Trutex’s survey.  Care for our clothes after they are taken out the machine also leaves a lot to be desired. Some nine in 10 people did not know some items should never go into a tumble dryer. And six out of 10 do not check the setting needed for ironing. Nearly all women learned how to wash clothes as young girls by helping their mums and know about separating whites from colours. In contrast, just 15% of men assisted their mothers. About 70% did not use a washing machine until they left home and that tended to be at a laundrette.  One in six men have never used one. Matthew Easter, managing director at Trutex said knowledge of labels can save time and money. He said: “This is especially important when it comes to school uniforms which are worn five days a week and often treated very roughly and require frequent cleaning.”   ANSWERS:  1 Hand wash. 2 Machine wash. 3 Water temperature not above 30C 4 Machine wash (permanent press). 5 Machine wash (gentle cycle). 6 Do not wash. 7 Do not bleach 8 Tumble dry. 9 Do not iron. 10 Do not wring.

The 2018 best teacher winner Mandy Manning was silent at the ceremony, but wore six politically-themed badges on her dress, as Trump presented her with the award. She also didn\u0027t shake the president\u0027s hand.  Claiming she wasn\u0027t allowed to read the speech at the time, yesterday she instead read an excerpt to CNN\u0027s Van Jones.   The teacher said she promised her pupils she would use her audience with the president to present him with a stack of letters from members of the Spokane, Washington community where she works, and the refugee children she teaches.    Dunblane massacre survivor says she wants to meet Donald Trump to \u0027make him see he is wrong on guns\u0027  Manning told how she and her family had their photograph with the president during the ceremony last week, before she took the opportunity to present him with the letters. She said she told Trump:  \u0027It\u0027s really important that you read them\u0027 — and he did. He took them so graciously, he thanked me and said he looked forward to it and had them put on his desk. According to her award application, Manning teaches English and maths to refugee and immigrant students in the Newcomer Center at Ferris High School in Spokane. The application says she is her pupils\u0027 first teacher once they arrive in the US, and she uses projects like map-making to help the young refugees process their trauma, celebrate where they are from, and learn about their new home.   Nightmare on Downing Street as Donald Trump confirmed to visit UK on FRIDAY 13TH July  She instead read aloud an excerpt of her speech on Jones\u0027 show, referencing refugee and LGBT issues. In the speech she said: Over the next year, I will be sharing my students\u0027 stories and profound insights into our country throughout the nation — like Sultan\u0027s — a refugee from Syria, who escaped war in his country and understands the importance of the United States to be peacemakers. I am here for refugee and immigrant students for the kids in the Gay-Straight Alliance, and for all the girls I\u0027ve coached over the years, to send them the message that they are wanted, they are loved, they are enough, and they matter.

Kim Jong-un promised to denuclearise the Korean peninsula last month during a landmark summit with South Korea\u0027s President Moon Jae-in. It\u0027s the first time a North Korean leader has stepped foot in the south since the end of the Korean War in 1953. The pledge boosted hopes of peace amid fears over North Korea\u0027s nuclear missile programme and even prompted Republicans to suggest Donald Trump should win the Nobel Peace Prize for his role, despite months of online threats. But North Korea has now accused the US of misleading public opinion over the diplomatic breakthrough, which it was claimed was aided by a series of UN and US sanctions designed to halt the development of nuclear weapons.  The state\u0027s official news agency KCNA reported that North Korea also warned the US not to deliberately provoke Kim Jong-un by moving to deploy strategic assets in South Korea and raising human rights issues. This act cannot be construed otherwise than a dangerous attempt to ruin the hardly-won atmosphere of dialogue and bring the situation back to square one, the a foreign ministry spokesman was quoted as saying. It would not be conducive to resolving the issue of denuclearisation if Washington miscalculated North Korea\u0027s peace-loving intention as a sign of weakness and continued to pursue its pressure and military threats, KCNA said. Trump, who plans to meet Kim over the next few weeks, has said he will maintain sanctions and pressure on the North and not repeat the mistakes of past administrations.  He claimed his tough stance had helped create the breakthrough. Trump told the National Rifle Association\u0027s annual convention in Dallas on Friday that he had toned down his rhetoric in anticipation of the talks after labelling Kim Little Rocket Man last year and threatening him with fire and fury.  Moon said Trump deserved a Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts to end the standoff with the North, while 18 House Republicans also backed him to be awarded the honour.  The White House said that Trump\u0027s national security adviser, John Bolton, met his South Korean counterpart, Chung Eui-yong, on Friday and both said there were no plans to change the U.S.-South Korea bilateral defence posture. North and South Korea are technically still at war because their 1950-53 conflict ended in a truce, not a peace treaty. South Korea said US troops need to stay in the area even after a peace treaty is concluded to replace the armistice. The United States stations 28,500 troops in South Korea, a legacy of the war. "}]
