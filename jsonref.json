In the UK, only 3 per cent of spending is made using cash, the findings suggest.According to the study, the prevalence of items with prices ending in .99p has fallen in recent years and now only accounts for around 12 per cent of prices.Using data from the ONS for February this year, it is evident that roughly 70 per cent of prices in the UK already end in a zero or 5, and so would not need rounding at all, according to the Bank\u0027s two economists.While some consumers may be attached to them, surveys suggest that six in ten 1p and 2p coins are used in a transaction once before they leave the cash cycle.            Falling: The decline in prices ending in .99, according to two Bank of England economistsMany end up in \u0027jars, down the back of the sofa or just lost to the ether.\u0027 To meet demand created by such losses from circulation, in previous years the government and the Royal Mint have needed to produce and issue over 500million 1p and 2p coins each year to replace those falling out of circulation, the Bank\u0027s two economists suggest.

Students are also reminded to bring their sixth form or college paperwork with them.          The GCSE test results can be obtained either in-person or by post if requested by the studentWhat do the new GCSE grades mean?The 2018 GCSE results will feature a new grading system that will change how the tests have been scored.The new grading system will see the traditional A* to G grades replaced with a numerical grading system of nine to one.A nine will represent the highest grade while a one is the lowest passing mark. U will still represent a failing mark in the new grading system.A and A* grades are now essentially the equivalent of a seven, eight or nine mark.Passing marks of B and C are now roughly represented by four, five and six.The D, E, F and G grades are now the equivalent of the new one, two and three grades.How grades impact college coursesIf students don’t have the grades they need for their college courses, they should contact the sixth form or college they’ve applied to as soon as possible.Some colleges, it should be noted, have stringent requirements that they adhere to when it comes to GCSE grades while others have much more relaxed rules and will allow students to attend the course regardless of their GCSE grades.Students seeking to improve their grades will be able to retake the Math and English Language GCSEs in November 2018. For all other subjects, the earliest date to retake them will be in June 2019.          How GCSE grades impact college courses generally depends on specific school requirementsHow to dispute a GCSE markStudents who believe they’ve been given an incorrect mark are eligible to dispute it and have their test results remarked.Those interested in doing so should speak to a teacher after obtaining their test results and submit an exam appeal form to request a review of their test marks.This process is required to be done at a student’s school unless they’re homeschooled. New on Hulu in September 2018: All the movies and TV shows coming soon revealedWho is Gretchen Wilson? \u0027Redneck Woman\u0027 singer revealed after arrest at Connecticut airport All the James Bond directors revealed following Danny Boyle\u0027s departure from Bond 25New on Netflix in September 2018: New TV shows and movies revealedNational Lottery results: Lotto numbers for Wednesday, 22 AugustHow Meghan Markle won Princess Charlotte and Prince George over with clever trickGCSE results day 2018: When are the results out and what do the new grades mean?Who is Deborah Hutton?

He\u0027s Sheffield\u0027s youngest ever mayorReality TV star turned Lord Mayor of Sheffield BANS Trump...New Sheffield Mayor, who went viral over his inaugural...Share this articleThen, making amends for his error, he adds: \u0027I\u0027d take her out for dinner. I\u0027d buy the Queen a drink.\u0027Quite obviously, Magid Magid is not a typical city mayor.A former refugee from Somalia who came to Sheffield at the age of five with his mother and five siblings \u0027to find a better life\u0027, he was appointed to the post in May. At the age of 28 he became the city\u0027s youngest-ever mayor, with lofty plans to bring the role \u0027into the 21st century\u0027.His predecessors include a colliery owner, a steel maker, the 7th Earl Fitzwilliam, a former Welsh rugby international and Labour politician Roy Hattersley\u0027s mother Enid, who, in the Eighties, battled Conservative governments as they waged war on the so-called \u0027socialist republic of South Yorkshire\u0027.Another previous mayor, the 15th Duke of Norfolk, owned vast tracts of land and his tenure in the 1890s was marked by his role as postmaster general. He is best remembered for his philanthropic work.Magid could hardly be more different.\u0027Just being me brings an element of difference to the role,\u0027 he says.One of the first things he did as mayor was to extend an open invitation to the city\u0027s 518,000 inhabitants to join him to watch a screening of the new Mamma Mia! film.Dozens took up the offer.However, such hospitality will not be extended to the Queen if she wants to make an official visit to Sheffield.Magid says: \u0027I would have an objection because when it\u0027s an official visit, the council has to pick up the bill — and that\u0027s thousands. It means cutting vital services when we are already stretched. I\u0027d say to the Queen: \u0027You are more than welcome. We will show you a great time, but as a city we can\u0027t afford it. You will have to pay for it.\u0027At a time when so many people are fed up with the lies, incompetence and venality of so many politicians, Mayor Magid Magid is seen — by his fans, anyway — as rather a refreshing change.          Elected in May, the now 28-year-old is the Sheffield\u0027s youngest ever mayor and vows to bring the city into the 21st century. But he has ided opinion in the South Yorkshire city Representing the Green Party and having appeared on Channel 4\u0027s reality show Hunted (in which contestants go on the run and have to evade capture), he was sworn in to the sound of the Imperial March from Star Wars, followed by the Superman theme tune.He wears his populism with pride and issues rules about how the good folk of Sheffield ought to behave. Rule No 1: \u0027Don\u0027t be a pr*ck\u0027 (his asterisk).To much acclaim, he has decried Donald Trump, calling him a \u0027wasteman\u0027 and condemning his \u0027ban\u0027 on Muslims visiting America and his decision to withdraw from the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement, in which many countries agreed a wide-ranging package of measures to protect the environment.Magid, now 29, says: \u0027I don\u0027t have any hard powers, but I do have soft powers. I have a voice now, and I\u0027m going to use it.\u0027He is relishing the challenge.After fleeing war-torn Somalia, he, his mum, four elder sisters and elder brother spent six months in an Ethiopian refugee camp before arriving in the UK in 1994, having been given asylum.\u0027We made Sheffield our home,\u0027 he says. \u0027My mum left her friends, her family and her identity, but she had to do what was best for her children. No mother would take her kids to another country if it wasn\u0027t needed.\u0027He remembers little about his early days here, apart from the weather. \u0027It was always raining. None of us spoke English, but I learnt it very quickly — quicker than my mum. I remember being the one to fill in forms for her.\u0027He soon thrived and as a result, like his mother, who worked as a cleaner to support her family and get them a good schooling, he likes to stress the importance of education.\u0027It was a case of knowing that I\u0027d have to work twice as hard as the white kids,\u0027 he says.          Magid Magid came to the UK from Somalia when he was five-years-old for a better life           After fleeing war-torn Somalia, he, his mum, four elder sisters and elder brother spent six months in an Ethiopian refugee camp before arriving in the UK in 1994After school, he studied aquatic zoology at Hull University (\u0027it was a bit left-field, yes, but I\u0027d just been ing\u0027). His mum had wanted him to train as a lawyer, a doctor or an engineer.At university he founded the mixed martial arts club, where he was given the fight name \u0027Magic Magid the Submission Magician\u0027, got into student politics, joined the Green Party and was voted student union president.Explaining his interest in politics, he says he wanted to tackle racism. \u0027I couldn\u0027t just sit on the sidelines. It was a case of \u0027if you don\u0027t do politics then politics will do you\u0027.\u0027I want people to see that being different is a positive thing. Immigrants, refugees, asylum-seekers — they all enrich our society.\u0027When he returned home to Sheffield after a stint working in digital marketing, he says: \u0027I was fed up with objecting. I thought I must get involved.\u0027In 2016, he was elected as a Green councillor in the city.The Lord Mayor role in Sheffield is rotated between all the parties, and there were no objections when the Greens suggested him. \u0027It\u0027s mad, isn\u0027t it?\u0027 he says with a smile.Not mad, but unarguably Lord Mayor Magid Magid represents the face of modern Britain.Also, unlike his more traditional predecessors who donned their ceremonial chains to plant trees in civic spaces and open new school canteen buildings, he is more likely to be found on social media.Asked about his role models, he rejects figures such as Churchill, Nelson Mandela and Martin Luther King. \u0027I think my role model is the internet,\u0027 he says.Recently, for example, he re-tweeted an online posting from a former prisoner who is a grime performer in Sheffield that read: \u0027Legendary business who\u0027s coming my bday bash to see the mayor of sheff do the 1 foot skank\u0027.What Sheffield\u0027s no-nonsense citizens, renowned for being as steely as the city\u0027s most famous manufactured product, make of such interventions is anyone\u0027s guess — particularly at a time when headteachers claim to be woefully underfunded, local hospitals saw a surge in A\u0026ampE patients during the heatwave, and the city council has been heavily criticised for giving trade union representatives a bumper pay rise.          Sheffield\u0027s Lord Mayor Magid Magid attends Tramlines Festival 2018 at Hillsborough ParkInevitably, too, Magid\u0027s unusual background has attracted notice abroad and he has been invited on TV chat shows in several countries. He has just been to Amsterdam to \u0027speak about panel politics and youth culture\u0027 and is planning trips to Brussels, Germany and maybe New York next year.Do the people of Sheffield really want their Lord Mayor to be gadding around New York, though? Wouldn\u0027t they rather he was at home, making sure the bins are collected properly?\u0027My job is to be an ambassador,\u0027 he argues. \u0027What better way to shout about what an amazing place Sheffield is?\u0027As he gives me a tour of Sheffield\u0027s City Hall, his style is informal, to say the least.What I learn about past Lord Mayors is minimal. \u0027No,\u0027 he says, \u0027I don\u0027t really know much about them. I could Google them…\u0027The same applies to his knowledge of the town hall itself. He is rather vague about when it was built, but you can\u0027t argue with his view of what the Victorian architects would think now.He says: \u0027I\u0027m sure the people who built this in 18-something wouldn\u0027t have thought that in 2018 a black Muslim would be breaking the fast of Ramadan in here.\u0027So, just three months into the job, is he still finding his feet? Yes.Today, those feet are in a pair of green Doc Martens — he has a selection of them in different colours. I ask whether he\u0027ll get in trouble if he is photographed with his feet on the fine mahogany desk. Possibly, he says, but he \u0027doesn\u0027t give a s**t\u0027.Warming to his theme, he adds: \u0027One woman said she cried when she saw a picture of me standing on a table. Said I was being disrespectful. She said: \u0027What\u0027s the point of being Lord Mayor if you aren\u0027t going to respect the traditions?\u0027.\u0027I thought: \u0027What is she talking about? That table is 20 years old. What is tradition anyway? It used to be tradition in this country that women couldn\u0027t vote. Traditions change. Is the rule for this job that you have to do things in a certain way just because they\u0027ve always been done this way? Who says so?\u0027 \u0027Out of interest, I ask if there is a rule book for Lord Mayors.\u0027Nah! Well, there is. They gave me this thing called The Protocol, but I haven\u0027t read it.\u0027          Sheffield Lord Mayor standing beside poster depicting his \u0027ten commandments\u0027 for the citySo, instead, what is his mission for the coming year?He says he wants to target young people, encourage creativity (he would like to appoint a Sheffield Poet Laureate and has a rapper in mind), and be the antithesis of the Lord Major who \u0027just turns up at fetes and shakes hands\u0027.Indeed, such traditional hand-shaking events are not his thing.He recalls a dinner he recently attended, organised by the Master Cutlers of Sheffield — an ancient body linked to the cutlery trade for which Sheffield is world-famous.\u0027It\u0027s a big thing here — 370 years old but all people of the same background, same class. The dinner was one of those events where they do slow handclaps and there are people with swords and every bloody ten minutes there is a toast to someone. Very la-di-da.\u0027Suffice to say, Mayor Magid Magid won\u0027t be spending his year in post kowtowing to the great and the good.\u0027I\u0027ve already turned down 85, 90 per cent of the stuff I\u0027ve been invited to. I mean, I\u0027d be stupid not to go to Remembrance Day but a lot of the stuff… well, no.\u0027Some, like his grime chum on Twitter, will say: \u0027Bravo that man!\u0027Others, less so.An online petition calling for his removal from office (\u0027he\u0027s turning Sheffield into a laughing stock\u0027 was a typical comment) collected 6,000 signatures, but was rejected by the Government on the grounds that his appointment was not its responsibility — and, in any case, his fans rallied with a counter-petition.          Lord Mayor Magid said \u0027My job is to be an ambassador\u0027 for the \u0027amazing\u0027 city of Sheffield Magid has one word for his detractors: racist. \u0027There have been people writing to the local paper saying \u0027we are losing our identity. Sheffield has fallen\u0027. It\u0027s really over the top and ridiculous.\u0027 But he concedes that his style isn\u0027t everyone\u0027s cup of tea. Indeed, he admits his mother would prefer it if he wore a suit.But what one wears, he says, is not the point. \u0027Even if I put on a suit, these people would find another excuse. There is no pleasing some. They call me \u0027radical\u0027. If being determined to do things differently makes me radical, then yes, I am.\u0027I\u0027m a reflection of Sheffield.

Vincent Brooks told reporters that reports about continuing nuclear and missile development activities in North Korea show that Pyongyang currently lacks confidence that it can take real steps toward denuclearization and still be safe.\u0027While I do seek to have empathy to understand why North Korea is doing what it\u0027s doing and where it\u0027s coming from, nevertheless, this is a condition North Korea created for itself,\u0027 Brooks said at a news conference in Seoul.\u0027They will have to take the risk to move into the direction toward peace, given that they created the circumstances we are in.\u0027          Lots of material from the partially deconstructed structures can be seen lying on the ground instead of having been taken away          There are also less construction vehicles visible at the facility with only seven on one launch pad compared to 12 in recent monthsThe family who will never meet again: Harrowing moment...U.S. officials warn Moscow there will  \u0027much more economic...Share this article\u0027The amount of progress that has been made in the relationships among countries since this time last year is perhaps not something that could have been conceived of last year and yet it has happened,\u0027 Brooks said.\u0027But we still have to see earnest action being taken on those matters of great concern like denuclearization. There is still a need for continued pressure so that there\u0027s not a reason or even an ability for North Korea to back up.\u0027 Following a provocative year in weapons development, during which it tested a purported thermonuclear warhead and demonstrated potential capability to strike the U.S. mainland, the North has shifted to a diplomatic approach in 2018.North Korean leader Kim Jong Un held a historic summit with President Donald Trump in June. They issued aspirations for a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula without describing when or how it would occur.Post-summit talks aimed at mapping out a denuclearization process got off to a rocky start, with North Korea accusing a senior U.S. delegation led by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo of making unilateral demands for the country to relinquish its arsenal.North Korea has also been demanding that the United States fast-track discussions on a declaration to formally end the Korean War, which stopped with an armistice and not a peace treaty.

Along with huge rallies in Pyongyang on the day itself and the revival of North Korea\u0027s trademark mass games at the stadium, Kim has deployed soldiers and ordinary citizens alike to erect buildings, improve roads and work on other infrastructure on a scale unseen in recent years.          Kim Jong-un flew into the northern city of Samjiyon to oversee construction work with his government officials          The North Korean leader has ordered a massive construction campaign to celebrate the country\u0027s 70th anniversary since independenceThe construction spree is intended to improve living conditions in keeping with one of Kim\u0027s first promises to the nation, that he would bolster the economy so they would no longer need to \u0027tighten their belts.\u0027 But it is also a demonstration of the power of his regime in the face of U.S.-backed international sanctions intended to squeeze his economy and force him to abandon his nuclear weapons.Kim made that political message clear during a visit to Samjiyon with his wife last week, when he was quoted by state media as saying \u0027the hostile forces\u0027 persistent sanctions and obstructive moves\u0027 have come as a serious setback, but added the North Korean people have risen to the challenge and are \u0027making a history of legendary miracles despite the most difficult conditions.\u0027Kim said that by \u0027showily\u0027 building up Samjiyon, the nation is in effect fighting a symbolic battle against those who would try to stifle its \u0027socialist civilization.\u0027Samjiyon lies at the foot of Mount Paektu, which is closely linked to the Kim family and is considered the spiritual center of the North Korean revolution.Steamrollers and other heavy equipment are rare, so roadwork is particularly labor-intensive. Work crews spreading out nearly 20 kilometers (10 miles) from the city limits fill potholes with shovelfuls of dirt and flatten surfaces with wooden tools.          Porters deliver luggage from a plane arriving at the airport in Samjiyong in North Korea as Kim Jong-un touches down          The city of Samjiyong has become a hive of activity as the preparations for the anniversary are stepped upThe work has transformed Samjiyon from a relatively sleepy provincial center surrounded by potato farms into a buzzing hub of activity the likes of which would be hard to find anywhere else. The government says it is to be the model for future development projects nationwide. The Associated Press was allowed to view the city on the same day Kim visited, but was not allowed to shoot photos.One important aspect of the building boom is that much of the work is being done outside of Pyongyang. Under three generations of Kim leadership, the capital has gotten the bulk of funding and is far more developed than the rest of the country, creating a glaring - and potentially destabilizing - gap between the capital and the provinces.Along with Samjiyon, major construction projects are underway in several other cities - including 20-story high-rise apartments in the eastern port city of Chongjin and extensive infrastructure and tourism-related facilities in Wonsan, another port on the country\u0027s eastern coast. Under Kim, Wonsan has gotten a new airport that officials hope will attract international visitors in the near future. More than a dozen resort hotels are being built near its coastline.The construction campaign is all the more ambitious considering it comes at a sensitive time for Kim, who has held a series of summits over the past several months with China, South Korea and the United States in an attempt to undermine support for sanctions and establish his position on the global stage as the head of a nuclear power.His diplomatic gambit appears to be working in many ways.          Major construction projects are underway in several other cities across the hermit kingdomChinese businesspeople and tourists are once again flowing over the borders - several large tourist groups were in Samjiyon last week - and South Korean officials are seriously considering ways to help the North improve its roads and railways. But doubts are growing over whether Kim has any real intention to meet Washington\u0027s main demand and unilaterally abandon the nuclear weapons he worked so hard to develop over the past five years.That rift with Washington could significantly complicate Kim\u0027s rapprochement with his neighbors and stifle his efforts to woo the trade and investment he needs to fund his development projects. A crucial indicator of where Kim stands will come soon after the Sept. 9 anniversary when he is scheduled to hold another summit with South Korean President Moon Jae-in, this time in Pyongyang.Moon, who has been playing a middleman role between Pyongyang and Washington, is under a great deal of pressure to broker progress toward denuclearization. Without tangible progress, he will be hard-pressed to justify going against Washington\u0027s \u0027maximum pressure\u0027 policy and easing sanctions any further.In any event, it appears Kim is ready to forge ahead. Though many improvements will be completed by Sept. 9, it is clear from the construction in Samjiyon that his plans go much further into the future than that. Dozens of buildings are still in the skeletal stages and will likely require several more months to finish.In the meantime, scenes of Kim giving his on-the-spot guidance to senior officials feverishly taking down his every word in their notebooks has dominated the TV news in the North each day since his visit to Samjiyon.           Chinese tourists take in the sight from a viewing platform overlooking North Korean land"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/23/00/4F51133E00000578-0-image-m-17_1534980904886.jpg","title":"Dominic Raab says no deal Brexit impact blown proportion","story":"Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab (pictured giving his speech in Westminster today) dismissed \u0027doomsday\u0027 scenarios about the consequences of failing to strike a broad trade deal with the blocBrexit hardliner Rees-Mogg calls on Theresa May to \u0027chuck...Fresh Labour chaos on Brexit as Keir Starmer says second EU...Share this article    Mr Raab (pictured with Michel Barnier in Brussels this week) said he was still \u0027confident\u0027 there would be an agreement - but the government was taking steps to \u0027protect the UK\u0027"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/23/08/4F52AB0600000578-6089775-image-a-4_1535010641426.jpg","title":"Polar bear hard spot leaps broken sheets ice Canada","story":"    Can you spot the polar bear?

It is a route for the absolute biggest, widest vehicles that use the M27. I am sure locals will know shorter routes.\u0027But smaller roads aren\u0027t always suitable for the larger vehicles and so this is a ersion for them.\u0027He added: \u0027It is inevitable that long queues of traffic will occur in all directions.\u0027          Policy director for the Road Haulage Association Duncan Buchanan said the closed section of motorway is a \u0027major link\u0027 for trucks getting to ports on the south coast.

The first is whether the closure is necessary - is there an alternative to a full closure?\u0027Then, is the ersion safe or is it over cautious is the next question.\u0027It has been more difficult getting information about this planned ersion from Highways England than it really should have been.          The stretch of road will be closed for three weekends over the next year. The first closure is on September 28 and October 1 and the road will also be shut on April 26 to 29 and then again between October 18 and 21, both 2019 starting from 8pm on Friday until 6am on the Monday\u0027We are really disappointed that they have failed to give any serious notification of this closure to us and we are concerned about the planned ersion route through Salisbury and Andover.\u0027For the hauliers and freight companies going into the port this ersion is unrealistic and we do not understand why they have done this, quite frankly.\u0027We think of Highways England as having one job to do and that is to run the road network correctly for key users.\u0027It\u0027s a debacle and they are not focused on this and key road users.

Price of the cryptocurrency rises...Share this articleThe Bank\u0027s two economists suggest that even if 1p and 2p coins were scrapped, rounding up is more likely to be applied to a final bill rather than inidual items.Now share your opinionThe study also points out that rounding is relevant only to cash payments, since electronic payments could still be charged the exact amount. In the UK, only 3 per cent of spending is made using cash, the findings suggest.According to the study, the prevalence of items with prices ending in .99p has fallen in recent years and now only accounts for around 12 per cent of prices.Using data from the ONS for February this year, it is evident that roughly 70 per cent of prices in the UK already end in a zero or 5, and so would not need rounding at all, according to the Bank\u0027s two economists.While some consumers may be attached to them, surveys suggest that six in ten 1p and 2p coins are used in a transaction once before they leave the cash cycle.            Falling: The decline in prices ending in .99, according to two Bank of England economistsMany end up in \u0027jars, down the back of the sofa or just lost to the ether.\u0027 To meet demand created by such losses from circulation, in previous years the government and the Royal Mint have needed to produce and issue over 500million 1p and 2p coins each year to replace those falling out of circulation, the Bank\u0027s two economists suggest.          One trick pony: Surveys suggest that six in ten 1p and 2p coins are used in a transaction once before they leave the cash cycleCash processors are now holding increasingly large sums of coins that have been returned to them, but are now out of favour of out of circulation. The old rounded one £1 coin is one example. The latest Annual Report from the Royal Mint shows that production of 1p and 2p coins was halved in 2016-17, compared to the year before.Last year, the Guardian reported that former Chancellor George Osborne was weeks away from scrapping 1p and 2p coins in late 2015, but was stopped by Prime Minister David Cameron, who feared the symbolism of the Conservative party scrapping the penny.

Vincent Brooks told reporters that reports about continuing nuclear and missile development activities in North Korea show that Pyongyang currently lacks confidence that it can take real steps toward denuclearization and still be safe.\u0027While I do seek to have empathy to understand why North Korea is doing what it\u0027s doing and where it\u0027s coming from, nevertheless, this is a condition North Korea created for itself,\u0027 Brooks said at a news conference in Seoul.\u0027They will have to take the risk to move into the direction toward peace, given that they created the circumstances we are in.\u0027          Lots of material from the partially deconstructed structures can be seen lying on the ground instead of having been taken away          There are also less construction vehicles visible at the facility with only seven on one launch pad compared to 12 in recent monthsThe family who will never meet again: Harrowing moment...U.S. officials warn Moscow there will  \u0027much more economic...Share this article\u0027The amount of progress that has been made in the relationships among countries since this time last year is perhaps not something that could have been conceived of last year and yet it has happened,\u0027 Brooks said.\u0027But we still have to see earnest action being taken on those matters of great concern like denuclearization. There is still a need for continued pressure so that there\u0027s not a reason or even an ability for North Korea to back up.\u0027 Following a provocative year in weapons development, during which it tested a purported thermonuclear warhead and demonstrated potential capability to strike the U.S. mainland, the North has shifted to a diplomatic approach in 2018.North Korean leader Kim Jong Un held a historic summit with President Donald Trump in June. They issued aspirations for a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula without describing when or how it would occur.Post-summit talks aimed at mapping out a denuclearization process got off to a rocky start, with North Korea accusing a senior U.S. delegation led by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo of making unilateral demands for the country to relinquish its arsenal.North Korea has also been demanding that the United States fast-track discussions on a declaration to formally end the Korean War, which stopped with an armistice and not a peace treaty.

Along with huge rallies in Pyongyang on the day itself and the revival of North Korea\u0027s trademark mass games at the stadium, Kim has deployed soldiers and ordinary citizens alike to erect buildings, improve roads and work on other infrastructure on a scale unseen in recent years.          Kim Jong-un flew into the northern city of Samjiyon to oversee construction work with his government officials          The North Korean leader has ordered a massive construction campaign to celebrate the country\u0027s 70th anniversary since independenceThe construction spree is intended to improve living conditions in keeping with one of Kim\u0027s first promises to the nation, that he would bolster the economy so they would no longer need to \u0027tighten their belts.\u0027 But it is also a demonstration of the power of his regime in the face of U.S.-backed international sanctions intended to squeeze his economy and force him to abandon his nuclear weapons.Kim made that political message clear during a visit to Samjiyon with his wife last week, when he was quoted by state media as saying \u0027the hostile forces\u0027 persistent sanctions and obstructive moves\u0027 have come as a serious setback, but added the North Korean people have risen to the challenge and are \u0027making a history of legendary miracles despite the most difficult conditions.\u0027Kim said that by \u0027showily\u0027 building up Samjiyon, the nation is in effect fighting a symbolic battle against those who would try to stifle its \u0027socialist civilization.\u0027Samjiyon lies at the foot of Mount Paektu, which is closely linked to the Kim family and is considered the spiritual center of the North Korean revolution.Steamrollers and other heavy equipment are rare, so roadwork is particularly labor-intensive. Work crews spreading out nearly 20 kilometers (10 miles) from the city limits fill potholes with shovelfuls of dirt and flatten surfaces with wooden tools.          Porters deliver luggage from a plane arriving at the airport in Samjiyong in North Korea as Kim Jong-un touches down          The city of Samjiyong has become a hive of activity as the preparations for the anniversary are stepped upThe work has transformed Samjiyon from a relatively sleepy provincial center surrounded by potato farms into a buzzing hub of activity the likes of which would be hard to find anywhere else. The government says it is to be the model for future development projects nationwide. The Associated Press was allowed to view the city on the same day Kim visited, but was not allowed to shoot photos.One important aspect of the building boom is that much of the work is being done outside of Pyongyang. Under three generations of Kim leadership, the capital has gotten the bulk of funding and is far more developed than the rest of the country, creating a glaring - and potentially destabilizing - gap between the capital and the provinces.Along with Samjiyon, major construction projects are underway in several other cities - including 20-story high-rise apartments in the eastern port city of Chongjin and extensive infrastructure and tourism-related facilities in Wonsan, another port on the country\u0027s eastern coast. Under Kim, Wonsan has gotten a new airport that officials hope will attract international visitors in the near future. More than a dozen resort hotels are being built near its coastline.The construction campaign is all the more ambitious considering it comes at a sensitive time for Kim, who has held a series of summits over the past several months with China, South Korea and the United States in an attempt to undermine support for sanctions and establish his position on the global stage as the head of a nuclear power.His diplomatic gambit appears to be working in many ways.          Major construction projects are underway in several other cities across the hermit kingdomChinese businesspeople and tourists are once again flowing over the borders - several large tourist groups were in Samjiyon last week - and South Korean officials are seriously considering ways to help the North improve its roads and railways. But doubts are growing over whether Kim has any real intention to meet Washington\u0027s main demand and unilaterally abandon the nuclear weapons he worked so hard to develop over the past five years.That rift with Washington could significantly complicate Kim\u0027s rapprochement with his neighbors and stifle his efforts to woo the trade and investment he needs to fund his development projects. A crucial indicator of where Kim stands will come soon after the Sept. 9 anniversary when he is scheduled to hold another summit with South Korean President Moon Jae-in, this time in Pyongyang.Moon, who has been playing a middleman role between Pyongyang and Washington, is under a great deal of pressure to broker progress toward denuclearization. Without tangible progress, he will be hard-pressed to justify going against Washington\u0027s \u0027maximum pressure\u0027 policy and easing sanctions any further.In any event, it appears Kim is ready to forge ahead. Though many improvements will be completed by Sept. 9, it is clear from the construction in Samjiyon that his plans go much further into the future than that. Dozens of buildings are still in the skeletal stages and will likely require several more months to finish.In the meantime, scenes of Kim giving his on-the-spot guidance to senior officials feverishly taking down his every word in their notebooks has dominated the TV news in the North each day since his visit to Samjiyon.           Chinese tourists take in the sight from a viewing platform overlooking North Korean land"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/23/09/4F52E21100000578-6089819-image-a-2_1535014423457.jpg","title":"Fly tippers confronted dumping old mattress garden","story":"    Craig Hardwick, 37, filmed the moment he caught two men dumping a mattress  in his garden in Walsall, West Midlands          The father tells the two men to \u0027get rid of it\u0027 and threatens to send the video he is capturing the the police\u0027I\u0027m recording you and I\u0027m sending it to the police.\u0027 He filmed the moment he interrogated the two men and repeatedly told them to take the bedding back to their house.Jogger confronts \u0027courier\u0027 hurling parcels into the bushes...Outrage as flytipper caught red handed while dumping rubble...Share this articleMr Hardwick said: \u0027I don’t want people dumping rubbing in f***ing street.

It was something to do with filling that loss. She was my  angel’My grandmother, who raised me, was a stern woman of very few words. She believed in strong discipline. But she was also a devoted caregiver. Growing up, she would dress me in Baby Jane ruffled dresses and braid my hair into two twists with ribbons and hair ballies. On the morning of this photo, which I took in 2005, she did my hair again, just like she did when I was a child.Every Saturday afternoon, around the same time each week, she would tend to her porcelain dolls. She must have had hundreds, all in different sizes, different outfits, different nationalities. It was like the UN of porcelain dolls in her living room.She began collecting them when my aunt – her daughter – was murdered. It was something to do with filling that loss. But it was also about pride. Despite growing up in a hard, industrial town like the one I grew up in, I never felt poor. The care she expended on them taught me that, no matter what the circumstances outside were like, we should always take care of ourselves. She taught me that we had value.I set up the camera and the moment she came into the frame, I moved in, sat next to her and asked her to look at the lens. I had no idea what her expression was, I just turned and pressed the shutter release – you can see it in my right hand. In 14 years of documenting my family and my home town, this was one of thefew times my grandmother cooperated. For that alone, this shot is immensely special to me.To this day, I’m profoundly grateful to her. She was a  and an angel to me. She had the foresight and knowledge of how to keep me alive and safe during a very tumultuous, difficult time.Braddock is an industrial town in Pennsylvania, nine miles outside of Pittsburgh. By the time I was born in 1982, most of the steel mills had already closed. The unions were broken up, most companies had gone overseas and the town was abandoned, on every level: local, state and federal. Yet the land bore the marks of what had gone before: it had been poisoned by industry, and the men and women of Braddock were paying the price. They still are.My grandmother died of cancer, my mother has battled cancer and I have lupus. Much of my childhood and my grandmother’s later years were spent looking after my step-great-grandfather who worked in the factories. It ruined his body, it ruined his health, and the only healthcare he received was from the women of my family.It’s a story that rings true across America. Women create the very possibility of a workforce, not only by giving birth to the men who work in heavy industry, but by caring for them when that industry destroys them. Their story gets written out of history, doubly so when they are black.Today the working class is, once again, being spoken about as if it were exclusively white. And yet African Americans have always worked in these industries. They have never been deemed deserving of representation by most of the photographers whose work has lasted.If you want to talk about America or US politics, you’ve just got to look at this little town. Despite the hardship, people from Braddock, including my grandmother, are proud of where they come from. It’s the belly of the beast, it’s the backbone of this country. It’s home to Andrew Carnegie’s first factory and his first library. People in these small towns are always much further ahead than people in the cities – or the media – assume. For the first time in Braddock, an African-American democratic socialist woman in her 30s has been elected to the state legislature of the 34th district. Her name is Summer Lee. She unseated a white man from a political dynasty which had been dominant since we were born, and she won by a landslide. By the end of my life’s work, I hope to have created an archive that shows just how erse the working class is and who the workers are. I want to show how their lives have been impacted by the fact that corporations have more rights than human beings in this country. I want to show the fullness of the working class, because it’s not just synonymous with whiteness.Studied: “Master of fine arts, Syracuse University.”Influences: “Allan Sekula, Martha Rosler, Carrie Mae Weems and Dawoud Bey.”High point: “Receiving the MacArthur fellowship in 2015.”Low point: “When my mentor Kathe Kowalski passed away in 2006.”Top tip: “Let your photographs be your compass, always follow where your photographs lead you.”"},{"url":"https://fastly-io.guim.co.uk/img/media/6ffcb0202f84f60709d228dfa5e9c4e24e6ec7d8/0_1850_3877_2326/master/3877.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=669e57f600381eb7fa5edb21da5e38be","title":"benjamin hardman photographer omur arctic exhibition theprintspace gallery","story":"Benjamin Hardman, an Australian photographer based in Iceland, found his admiration for the north five years ago as he embarked on his first photographic mission in the Arctic winter.

Her first long-form comic – a western revenge fantasy starring a bright pink dog – is just as subversiveEven if you’ve never heard of Lisa Hanawalt, you’ve likely seen her work. It’s visible in every frame of Netflix’s BoJack Horseman, for which she is production designer and producer. She has designed book covers for Patricia Lockwood, illustrated the New York Times, and decorated guitars for Tegan and Sara. But more importantly, she’s an award-winning cartoonist, one who catalogues the humour and horror of the quotidian (see, for instance, her series of toilet comics), often with colourful, anthropomorphic animals. But Coyote Doggirl is a little different. “I wanted a surreal, horse-focused western with dog people in it,” Hanawalt told a XOXO festival crowd in 2015. “And I couldn’t find an example of that. So I made it.”And she has been making it, in between other projects, for several years. She never thought it would be longer than 15 pages. “I think if I had known it would be this long when I started, I would’ve been really intimidated,” Hanawalt says. But Coyote Doggirl, her first long-form graphic novel, is finally here.She describes Coyote Doggirl as a “revenge fantasy”: the story sees Coyote being pursued because she maims a man while he assaults her. “The scene where she’s getting assaulted – or nearly assaulted – is not that sexy. And I think sometimes when we see these things in movies, they’re very sexualised and the female body is shown as this treasure that’s being pillaged,” she says. “And it’s kind of gross.”When fleeing her pursuers, Coyote is injured, and later rescued by a Native American tribe. In westerns, indigenous peoples are often villains here, they’re heroes. And they’re playful, too: striking mock-mystical poses while telling prank fortunes (“you’ll end up owning a donkey with big purple pussy lips”), or pretending a ceremonial horse mask is an actual horse.“I started out not wanting them to be specific to any particular real tribe,” Hanawalt says. She drew from the culture of Plains Indians and the Ute people, but tried to “fictionalise them as much as possible”. But she grew worried about this approach and asked a sensitivity reader to check over Coyote Doggirl. They told her it was clearly satire. However, she still has her concerns – and takes full responsibility for any offence caused. “I think my view of how to represent Native people has changed since I started making this book,” she says. “Now, I might have a different approach.” Hanawalt started releasing excerpts of Coyote Doggirl online in 2013. And the world has changed quite a bit between then and now. “I think everything has gotten more ided,” she says. “Which is really a shame, because I don’t want to make work just for people who already agree with me. I want to connect as many people as possible and reach out to as many people with universal feelings as possible. I don’t think people are all that different, even if their beliefs are. We kinda all want the same things in the end. I hope.”So much of the wild west is a romantic invention. Hanawalt’s partner, the comedian Adam Conover (who rescued a draft of Coyote Doggirl from the trash), even dedicated an episode of his myth-debunking show, Adam Ruins Everything, to the misogyny and racism that underpins the cowboy narrative. But where Conover critiques these narratives from the outside, Hanawalt argues from within – creating the western she’d like to see.She may do it playfully, and with elegant watercolours, but subverting this old narrative is more timely than Hanawalt could have imagined when she started: now living under a president who romanticises America’s past, uses misogynous language and is trying to exclude many of the same people spurned by traditional westerns. But Coyote Doggirl does one better than simply revise a genre’s uncomfortably pertinent, ideological baggage: it shows how challenging a problem can be more fun – and more colourful – than perpetuating it."},{"url":"https://fastly-io.guim.co.uk/img/media/15f45fa82b309e36c8c5531051050c9eb3c747ad/49_278_3406_2044/master/3406.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=40461a49f8afe6697842b30840e4388a","title":"competition watchdog to scrutinise merger of sainsburys and asda","story":"Proposed £12bn deal’s impact on shoppers and suppliers to be investigatedThe competition watchdog has launched an investigation into the proposed £12bn merger between Sainsbury’s and Asda.A phase 1 investigation will assess how the deal, which was announced in April, could affect competition for UK shoppers, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) confirmed on Thursday.

The biggest one-day strike earlier in August saw a walkout by pilots in five European countries, disrupting the travel plans of an estimated 55,000 passengers at the height of the holiday season, with Ryanair cancelling around 400 out of 2,400 scheduled European flights.That action included a fifth 24-hour walkout of the summer by pilots in Ireland, a move which prompted Ryanair to propose fresh talks with the Forsa union via a mediator that began last week and ended early on Thursday.Ryanair apologised to customers earlier this week after it emerged that a number of cheques issued to compensate passengers had bounced because they had not been signed. “The proposed agreement will now go to ballot, with a recommendation for acceptance from Forsa and its Ryanair pilot representatives,” the pilots’ union Forsa said in a statement on Thursday, adding that the mediator asked that neither side makes further comment while the ballot is conducted. Ryanair said it would take the proposals to its board after the Irish-based pilots had voted on the agreement.Other trade unions mired in negotiations around Europe are watching the Irish talks closely. The Dutch pilots union, VNV, said Thursday’s agreement would not necessarily change its situation as it had “different priorities”. Ryanair employs more than 4,000 pilots, with around 350 of them based in Ireland. Negotiations in the country have proved among the most difficult, the company has said.Ryanair workers based in European countries outside Ireland have also been attempting to secure employment on local contracts, rather than the Irish terms the airline prefers.Analysts expressed scepticism that the airline, which has long paid scant attention to traditional industry behaviour, and employed staff through third-party schemes that attracted the attention of tax authorities, would easily navigate its first attempt at collective bargaining and maintain its costs at rock bottom. Ryanair’s chief executive, Michael O’Leary, who once said he would cut off his own hands rather than negotiate with unions, said he personally instigated the surprise move. But he has since further angered staff by signalling he would move aircraft from Ireland to Poland to move them away from strike-hit bases, and then seek redundancies – tactics that unions warned flouted labour laws. Negotiations with Forsa have been fraught, with public denunciations from Ryanair earlier this month demonstrating the distance between them, as it accused the union of “irresponsible action, designed to cause the maximum damage to Ryanair” rather than reaching a resolution to the pilots’ concerns. Cabin crew working for Ryanair have also been on strike in Europe this summer over pay and conditions."},{"url":"https://fastly-io.guim.co.uk/img/media/2a9073dd5e5a2e3f8fbaac451d321d8159526719/0_0_1733_1040/master/1733.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b1b868a946f8b25eebe5c9f942e69ca5","title":"how to pollution proof your skin","story":"Polluted air is a problem whether you live in or out of town. Author and beauty expert Lindsey Kelk shares the latest intel on keeping your skin protected from its harmful effects  According to Dr Doris Day, “urban dust” has been shown to contain a cocktail of 224 toxic chemicals, making it possibly the only cocktail I have never been tempted to try, and all those chemicals can lead to a whole host of skin problems dryness, loss of collagen, acne and there has even been research linking air pollution to dark spots. Because getting those from too much sun wasn’t already enough of a problem … Start at the sourceAs we all know, prevention is always better than the cure – and while topical products designed to fight the effects of polluted air are a must, preventing damage before it takes place starts with your diet. A diet rich in antioxidants is the first way to help neutralise free radicals (those are the particles floating around in the air that attach themselves to your skin and damage it at a cellular level – find out more about these epidermal vampires here). Dr Andrew Weil recommends loading up on fruits and vegetables such as tomatoes, watermelon, blueberries, carrots and leafy greens. On top of your fruits and veggies, protein is also key to rebuilding cells – your best bets are tofu, lean meat, fish, eggs, beans and nuts. As well as eating a healthy diet, drinking plenty of water is an essential factor in the fight against damage caused by pollution. Hydrated skin is healthy skin and ensures your epidermis – the top layer of skin and our barrier against all the chemicals and particles in the air – stays plump and in tact. For extra hydration and antioxidant protection, try adding green tea to your diet. It’s packed with catechins, which not only help your skin repair itself, they have also been proven to improve heart health and help combat hypertension and cardiovascular disease. Also, red wine is a great source of resveratrol, which is amazing for skin (and yes, I know the alcohol dehydrates my skin but the wine gods giveth and they taketh away). Get city-readyEven though people living in densely populated, urban areas are generally found to have better skincare regimens than those living in more rural areas, thanks to all the pollution we face – and the free radicals that accompany that pollution – our skin usually shows signs of ageing more quickly than our country-dwelling counterparts. This is where your choice of products really comes into play. Look out for formulas targeted specifically at protecting your face from pollution, then follow up with with the same considerations as with your diet. Every skincare expert you can name, from Caroline Hirons to Nadine Baggott, has extolled the wonders of vitamin C, the collagen-building wonder ingredient that brightens and evens tone, protects from free radicals and, some studies have shown, may even help protect against sun damage. It works well in conjunction with vitamin E, so look out for products that contain both.While it’s important to protect against free radicals, it is essential to protect against the effects of the sun. UV rays and pollution work in tandem to destroy skin cells and cause lasting damage so always make sure you have protection, all year round. Remember, if there is daylight, there are UV rays. Sunscreen is for life, not just bikini weather. And, yes, I know it sounds dull, but long sleeves and covered legs will help protect your skin even more. Physical barriers against the sun and polluted air are one of the reasons your body ages so much more slowly than your weather-battered face, so maybe try one of those surfer-chic long-sleeved swimsuits next time you’re at the lido.After exposureAt the end of the day, your skin will need serious cleansing, even if it doesn’t look dirty. Double cleansing is a must, for city and country dwellers alike. Over the course of a day, your face has had to deal with pollution, sunscreen and makeup and they’re just the best case scenarios. Thorough cleansing should never strip skin, you definitely don’t want to compromise your natural barriers. Try a cleansing balm for your first cleanse, to dislodge the daily grime then move on to a soothing cream or refreshing wash-off cleanser for the second cleanse, whatever feels best for your skin type. Post cleansing, your skin should feel soft and clean but never tight. Apply your treatment serums and moisturising creams immediately after cleansing. Leaving skin to “breathe” isn’t a real thing, as soon as you’ve rinsed away your cleanser, it starts losing moisture – skin doesn’t need to breath, it needs to be cared for so be a pal and give it what it wants: proper hydration.While the effects of pollution on the skin do sound really rather frightening, they don’t have to be. I’m probably not going to give up going outside for the sake of a smoother complexion, but with the right diet and skincare tips, I don’t have to. Gentle cleansing, a hardworking hydrating cream, daily SPF and lots of red wine, I mean, lots of water, should ensure glowing skin, wherever you may be.Aimed at shielding skin from environmental assaults like pollution, Clinique’s Dramatically Different Hydrating Jelly works to hydrate, strengthen and protect skin for 24 hours.

I’d never opened it or even noticed it was there, tucked into the folder marked “Utilities”, right between PayByPhone parking and Booking. Unknown to me, and with no GDPR-style opt-out, this little gizmo had been recording every step I’d taken every single day.Was I horrified at this invasion of privacy? No: I was delighted. Having long shunned the ostentatious, Fitbit-wearing gym-zombies for the wallies they so obviously are, I became completely fixated. My phone, joggling up and down in my pocket as I trotted, was tracking my non-exercise exercise routine in real time!How many steps did I take yesterday? 6,143! Or the day before? 8,021! How about 25 May last year? Whee! 11,125! Must have taken the long way to the burger stand that day. At once, I had discovered a way of turning my day-to-day amblings – from home to school, from school to work, to and from the sandwich shop and the supermarket, up and down the stairs – into cold, hard data. Data that could be traded in for life expectancy, I fondly imagined, at some mystic branch of Travelex. 10,000 steps was the figure you hoped for: a figure that, like the equally plucked-from-the-air-seeming 21 units a week of alcohol, seemed to mark an absolute ide between Good and Not Good, and whose validity I have never doubted since hearing someone say it in a pub.Every day, I had hit or exceeded the magic 10,000 steps was a day about which I could feel quietly smug. When I was feeling less smug, I could always pep myself up by scrolling back to the 36,409 steps I took on 14 April, when I went walking with some old friends in the Peak District before eating a curry, drinking five pints of beer and falling asleep in a chair dribbling.To be fair, I’ve always suspected this of the wrist-mounted variety: it’s all too easy to imagine how their little accelerometers could mistake 20 minutes doing the washing-up for a healthy stroll round the park, or a quick hand shandy for a vigorous jog up a steep hill. I like to think that – together with GPS for distance covered and the fixed position in the trouser pocket (does it calculate stride length?) – the phone app will be more accurate and that any overestimate will be cancelled out by all those steps I take when the phone is on my desk charging. But who am I trying to kid?Most of the pleasure in all these things is the thrillingly sciencey illusion of exact, step-by-step accuracy. I mean: you don’t need a gadget on your wrist, or an app in your pocket, to tell you that you’ve walked a very long way, quite a long way, or roughly the distance between the sofa and the fridge. Common sense tells you that. We want that super-exact number. Where’s the fun in knowing you walked about 8,000 steps yesterday, give or take 1,600, and most likely take?All this puts us right back in the position we were in, which is to say: knowing that you need to take some damn exercise if your body isn’t going to crumble to bits, that you know fine well whether you’ve taken a decent amount of exercise (and eaten well, which your Fitbit doesn’t know either) and that no amount of geeky data accumulation is a substitute for going for an actual old-fashioned walk.• Sam Leith is an author, journalist and literary editor of the Spectator"},{"url":"https://fastly-io.guim.co.uk/img/media/df24385b78b49ffeba94cf517bd9c9b725917bc3/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3c4ea0d10dfb8e41479646e9621af978","title":"pope francis ireland irish catholicsm catholic church abusive institution","story":"Francis seems a fine person, and the faithful will greet him with joy. But he can’t repair the ruins of a corrupt, abusive institutionWhen the pope arrives in Ireland this weekend, he will find a Catholic church not just falling to ruin, but in some respects beyond repair. He will be greeted with joy by the faithful, but few, even among them, will expect him to be able to fix an institution that has been shaken to its very foundations.As a child I served mass most days in the church near our council housing estate in west Dublin. It has a vast open interior with soaring ceilings, three altars and row after row of long wooden seating. On Sundays there were six masses, on the hour from seven to noon. Every one of them was full or close to it. There were, at any given time, seven or eight priests to say them. They were busy: during the week, there were morning masses, evening devotions, sodalities, weddings, funerals and confessions. The church was as familiar to most of us as our own homes.And now? There is one priest holding things together on his own. The church itself is like a suit made for a very fat man who has now slimmed down to a fraction of his old weight. The rows are almost all empty, even for Sunday mass. The soaring ceilings merely echo the emptiness. The place is cold in winter because the parish can’t afford to heat it, and there is no longer the warmth of crowded bodies. The remaining faithful are almost all older and female.Some of this decline would have happened anyway. The sheer dominance of the Irish Catholic church was not normal. It happened because resistance to the Reformation had been the most effective way for most of the indigenous population to resist assimilation into British power, which was, of course, defined by Protestantism. With the decline of the Irish language in the 19th century, Catholicism became an even stronger marker of distinctive identity. Mass emigration made the universal and international nature of the church even more comforting – if you had to go from Connemara to Connecticut or from Cavan to Coventry, at least the mass was still the same, and the priest was probably still Irish. And then the partition of Ireland in 1921 created two religious ghettoes, the “Protestant state for a Protestant people” in the north mirrored by its Catholic counterpart in the south. Dissident minorities could be easily cowed on both sides of the border.This was never going to last. The belated modernisation of the Irish economy from the 1960s onwards gradually created an urbanised, secularised and much more highly educated society. Feminism put down deep roots. A patriarchal, authoritarian institution reliant on blind faith and the power of conformity was never going to survive these processes intact. Indeed, the Irish Catholic church was all the more vulnerable precisely because its power had gone largely unchallenged. Like a child raised in a sterile environment, its immune system was weak.But what might have happened slowly and gently, with half the population remaining faithful and half slipping into benign indifference, has instead happened quickly and bitterly. Buddhist monks in Vietnam used to set themselves on fire – the Irish bishops and cardinals have done so metaphorically, but no less shockingly. The petrol they poured over themselves was what Francis, in his open letter released on Monday, called “atrocities perpetrated by consecrated persons”. The flame they set to it was the systematic covering up and effective facilitation of the sexual abuse of children by clergy.While this horror story began to be told in the 1990s, it has since been compounded by three factors. First, child abuse by priests in parishes is just one part of a wider story of institutional abuse in which women and children were incarcerated in industrial schools, Magdalene laundries and mother-and-baby homes. This still emerging story casts a sickly retrospective glow on Holy Catholic Ireland – it is ever clearer that it maintained its “purity” through systematic terror.Second, what many Irish Catholics thought was a local problem, created by a few evil priests and weak bishops, has turned out to be an international phenomenon, and thus implicit in the nature of the institutional church itself. This was a global cover-up directed from the Vatican.Third, the Vatican’s response has been pitiful. In a special letter to Irish Catholics in 2010, the then Pope Benedict expressed “shame and remorse”, and claimed to share their “dismay and … sense of betrayal”. But that simply means that when Francis now says the same things, their effect is blunted. The fine words have not been matched by real change. The brilliantly articulate Irish abuse survivor Marie Collins agreed to serve on the Papal Commission for the Protection of Minors established by the Vatican in 2014. But she resigned over its lack of real clout within the church.And it’s too late now to offer more apologies and promises. Francis seems a fine person, and most Irish people will be glad to see him. For the remaining faithful his presence will bring pleasure and comfort. But the model Catholic state that Ireland once was is in the tomb, and there will be no resurrection. Perhaps something else will emerge in time, some radically different version of Catholicism, stripped of patriarchy, authoritarianism and institutional self-regard. In the meantime, there is only one sermon that can be truthfully preached in the ruined Irish church: absolute power corrupts absolutely.• Fintan O’Toole is a columnist with the "},{"url":"https://fastly-io.guim.co.uk/img/media/745c351b141bb312eef4b76d243bcb48dcafb124/0_39_3606_2164/master/3606.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=da0d70347071c297e08b4824ec07ee61","title":"ryanair michael oleary airline pilots strike","story":"Ryanair and its chief executive, Michael O’Leary, got some good news on Thursday when, after extensive negotiations with trade unions representing the airline’s pilots in Ireland, a deal was struck that should, if approved by the pilots in a ballot, bring to an end the strikes that have disrupted its services across Europe this summer.The cancellation of flights has been bad for business obviously, increasing costs and impacting on future bookings. Things were made worse by publicity over the airline’s failure to provide refunds or compensation to some customers. And it emerged on Wednesday that some customers had received unsigned cheques from the airline that then bounced when they tried to cash them. Cue outrage from those affected – and sneering from those who just don’t like the attitude and service of the Irish airline.Ryanair and O’Leary have form when it comes to not making due payments, however. Here’s one example of many: in 2002, Ryanair lost a high profile court case in Dublin, when the winner of a “flights for life” prize took action after O’Leary cut off her entitlements. Judge Peter Kelly awarded plaintiff Jane O’Keeffe €67,500 in damages and an estimated €200,000 to cover her costs for a lengthy hearing. But O’Leary wouldn’t pay up. O’Keeffe had to return to court and ask the judge to issue an order that Ryanair would be put into liquidation if it didn’t pay its bill. Reluctantly, O’Leary did.The long-serving chief executive – a remarkable quarter-century in control of the airline and yet just 57 years old – has always been “tight”, determined not to spend any money unnecessarily. He has never cared if that has brought him into conflict with customers, suppliers or airports Ryanair used. He does not embarrass easily. Any attendant bad publicity – and there has been plenty – has been regarded instead as an opportunity to emphasise that Ryanair would do whatever was required to keep its costs lower than those of its rivals, which it would then pass on to customers in lower fares. It wasn’t textbook marketing – and as his critics castigated his approach it required him to have a thicker skin than most corporate bosses – but it worked well for Ryanair.Ryanair is supposed to be a changed entity from the cheap but often nasty corporate beast that so irritated passengers. A midair pivot in approach in September 2013 received plenty of attention. Worried that the airline’s growth was stalling – and having made an expensive order to buy hundreds of new aircraft from Boeing – O’Leary decided that customer service did matter after all. Ryanair would be “nice” to passengers in future. He introduced a new mantra called “always getting better” and various measures to increase convenience and comfort, at the booking stage, at the airport and in the aircraft.It worked well for the first four years or so, as passenger numbers increased very strongly and profits with them. A year ago, Ryanair was valued on the London Stock Exchange at over €20bn. It had established itself as Europe’s biggest and most successful short-haul airline as it grew everything – routes, passenger numbers and profits – faster than all competitors.But then the airline flew into unexpected turbulence, possibly because it was growing too fast. In September last year a self-inflicted mess of its pilot rosters meant that it had to cancel thousands of flights affecting over 700,000 customers, with all the attendant bad publicity. For that reason, this week’s publicity about bounced cheques was more irritating than it was significant. The surprise was not that Ryanair was leaving cheques unsigned, but that it was sending them out at all. The airline has been insistent that it would be issuing only refunds – and not compensation – to those to whom it had been unable to supply booked flights in recent months. It has emphasised, on more than one occasion, that it believes that the costly requirements of EU rules – which provide customer protection if flights are cancelled – do not apply to strikes by employees or contractors. “Under EU261 legislation, no compensation is payable when the union is acting unreasonably and totally beyond the airline’s control. If this was within our control, there would be no cancellations,” is a line that has been repeated frequently by spokespeople. A German consumer advocate intends challenging that in court.While €1.45bn profits for the full year to 31 March 2018 still impressed, the enthusiasm of stock market investors for the Irish company has waned. For many years Ryanair had enjoyed a higher stock market rating than many of its rivals, because it had the flexibility to keep its costs lower. Now it appears to be little different from other airlines in the sector, bound by the difficulty of industrial relations in a notoriously sensitive sector.• Matt Cooper’s book Michael O’Leary: Turbulent Times for the Man Who Made Ryanair will be published by Portfolio, a Penguin Random House imprint, in late September 2018"},{"url":"https://fastly-io.guim.co.uk/img/media/2d7ca9afc1e26999c2c43c4d32907d90c450d73c/991_1892_2277_1366/master/2277.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=34f1ba4d2881458a851820cb00aa569d","title":"womens pockets size jeans fashion","story":"Broken in and cunningly ripped, my favourite jeans fit loosely. They’re designed to look as if I borrowed them from my guy. Hence their name: “destructed boyfriend jeans”. My jeans may have been cut to ape the lines of men’s denim, but they fail in one major way: the front pockets are only 5.5 inches (14cm) deep – too small for my hands, hardly big enough for my tiny wallet and certainly too snug for my iPhone Plus. My boyfriend jeans have pockets that would make a man laugh.Functioning pockets make women very excited. This is a sentence that shouldn’t need to be written in 2018. Women are busy, and we need to carry our stuff with the same ease as men do. Still fashion resists giving us what we want, when what we want is more, bigger, better pockets. It’s neither hard nor expensive to make women’s pockets functional – after all, fashion does it for men – so what’s the deal with women’s pointless pockets? The answer is a heady mix of sexism and patriarchal fear.In 2016, the white suit that Hillary Clinton wore to accept the Democratic party’s presidential nomination prompted me to write a piece on the sexist, political history of pockets. “Men have pockets to keep things in, women for decoration,” Christian Dior pronounced in 1954, and writers have long noted that fashion’s refusal to give women’s clothing pockets is tantamount to putting female form over human function. But while many writers acknowledge the sexism, most have overlooked the ways that politics – the dirty deeds of voting, the nitty-gritty of sedition, or the blood of revolution – have played into the design of women’s clothing.The colour of Hillary’s white suit echoed the clothing of the suffragettes, yet her suit’s apparent lack of pockets did not. For suffragettes, pockets were a political issue. A 1910 fashion show at New York City’s Hotel Astor featured a “suffragette costume” that boasted “two pockets in the front and two behind” with a total of “seven or eight pockets, all in sight and all easy to find”. So integral to the suffrage movement were pockets that The Old Lady With a Hundred Pockets was the title of a fundraising event in 1908. A New York Times article describes a life-sized dummy with pockets “all over a brilliant red skirt”. Attendees at the woman suffrage bazaar would pay to pick the lady’s pockets for a grab bag, with the proceeds going to benefit women’s voting rights organisations.Women voters weren’t alone in understanding the connection between pocket power and political power. A serialised 1913 newspaper cartoon depicts a man dressed in a frilly nightgown, pulling out the pockets in a woman’s skirt and looking nervously over his shoulder at his sleeping wife. It’s captioned “When Wifie Dons Suffragette Pockets”. Such is the terrifying potency of the female pocket. A century has passed. Women have the vote. But pockets? Not so much.Contrarians will argue that women who want to carry things have handbags. We can, and we do. But in addition to having to carry a bag, women have to buy the bag. And because of this, handbags function as a kind of “pink tax”, the price added to everyday objects and services that are sold specifically to a female audience. More germane to the pocket point, a bag is always endangered. Pockets can get picked, but only bags can be snatched. It’s one thing to lose your keys, for your phone to be boosted from your hands, or to have your purse stolen. It’s quite another to lose everything at once, and that’s the anxiety of carrying a handbag. The patriarchy may enjoy looking at a streamlined female form, but culture likes it when women feel imperilled and powerless.We pocket-loving women aspire to freedom. The dream of having pockets big enough to carry your phone, your keys, your purse and your lipstick is a dream of independence, a dream of walking unencumbered yet able to reach your necessities, and a dream of holding nothing on your shoulder. What women want is no mystery. We want to have one hand in our 9-inch pocket – and the other one giving a peace sign.• Chelsea G Summers is an ex-academic and former stripper who writes about sex and fashion"},{"url":"https://fastly-io.guim.co.uk/img/media/72bec28e4d5568cf9edb8590ca515f1e7b6a398c/0_0_7372_4424/master/7372.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2525d90c6bdcc4081d421ae3d5864009","title":"bronze head from emperor augustus statue to go on display at british museum","story":"Remarkably preserved sculpture will feature in the museum’s exhibition on dissent from SeptemberFor the second time in just over 2,000 years, the bronze head of the Roman emperor Augustus has been toppled, to serve once again as an emblem of power mocked and laid low.The last time his statue was captured by enemies, decapitated, and the head buried under the steps of a temple built to celebrate victory over mighty Rome, so that it was symbolically trampled into the dust by all those entering.This time a team of curators and conservationists at the British Museum tenderly lifted its 17kg weight and gently laid it on its side, one ear protected by a specially made circlet of foam and foil. His extraordinary glaring eyes, unique survivors among the many bronze Roman emperors, made of white stone delicately inlaid with coloured glass and shell, still seemed to flash in outrage.“It’s a strange thought that he has spent far longer buried under the earth than above ground,” said Tom Hockenhull, joint curator with Ian Hislop, the editor of Private Eye, of an exhibition on dissent opening at the museum in September.Augustus became emperor in 27BC, in the wake of the bitter faction fights that followed the assassination of Julius Caesar. The bigger than life-size bronze statue was one of many official portraits sent across the empire, and probably originally stood in a barracks compound. It was only a few years old when it was among three imperial statues captured by a Kushite army which was harrying the southern border of Roman Egypt. They carried it off in triumph to their capital, Meroë – in Roman Nubia, modern Sudan.There are several versions of what happened next: Roman sources say the Kushites were defeated and Rome demanded back their statues, but the Greek-born historian Strabo said the Romans were forced humiliatingly to plead for their return.The head of Augustus was never seen again until 1910 when the temple site was excavated, and it was found face down in the sand. Its beauty and remarkable preservation – as well as the drama of its rediscovery – made it instantly famous and within two years the Art Fund helped raise the money to buy it for the British Museum.Hislop and Hockenhull have spent three years trawling the museum’s galleries and stores, ferreting out the objects which express subtly or in a bellow of outrage opposition to tyranny, political oppression, or just any form of authority.The objects they found range from a 3,300-year-old sculpture from ancient Mesopotamia, to a pink pussyhat, worn at the Women’s March in Washington DC in January 2017 to convey revulsion at Donald Trump’s attitude to women.Hockenhull’s original idea was to dig a hole in the gallery floor and sink the head of Augustus into it, but unaccountably the idea of smashing up the concrete and marble floor was rejected by the museum authorities. After much discussion with the conservation experts, he has had to settle for bringing it down a peg or two to display it for the first time at shin height – but it will be protected by a glass case in case Augustus’s imperious gaze still has the power to provoke dissent."},{"url":"https://fastly-io.guim.co.uk/img/media/c1930e43137e4d2cfb25f3f5c1229fe9889a4d7f/0_51_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8200718f4c29ba49030c61008bd5057d","title":"gcses boys close gap on girls after exams overhaul","story":"Larger share of boys gain top marks under new system while share of pupils gaining C or 4 also risesBoys appear to have been the major beneficiary of the new GCSE examinations taken in England for the first time this summer, as results showed across-the-board improvements in boys gaining top marks while girls saw their share of top grades dip.The new style of GCSEs in England come with a new grading system, numbered from 9 to 1, replacing the old letter grades. The exam regulator, Ofqual, has said the previous top grades, A*-A, have been split into three grades, 7, 8 and 9, while the grade 4 and above matches those of C and above under the previous scheme.Under the reforms the exams have also been made more testing, with subjects such as chemistry including a higher proportion of questions involving maths. The amount of assessed coursework has also been greatly reduced in many courses, making grades depend on final exam performance.Michael Turner, director of the Joint Council on Qualifications which publishes the results, said this year’s results were “complicated”, because of significant changes in the age groups being entered for some exams.Sally Collier, Ofqual’s chief regulator, reassured candidates that the new exams would not cause turmoil in the grades awarded: “As in previous years, we have used the tried and tested principle of comparable outcomes to ensure standards are maintained. Senior examiners have reviewed papers to make sure the quality of work is appropriate to the grades awarded.”The harder courses and the new 9 grade, which equates to the highest marks of the old A*, led to speculation from Ofqual and experts that just a handful or even no pupils nationally would receive a sweep of nine or more 9s. But those initial expectations proved to be misplaced as schools reported high-achieving pupils.Brighton College, the independent school whose headmaster accused his private school peers of shying away from the new GCSEs, said 10 of its pupils achieved nine grade 9s, including four with 10 of the top grades and a remarkable performance by one pupil with 10 of new top grades and two A*s in unreformed exams including further maths.Maths and English – compulsory subjects in year 11 – were the largest exam entries, with increases seen in the subjects that form the government’s preferred English baccalaureate suite, especially in biology and chemistry while history and geography also improved.Another big change – in both Wales and England – has been the advent of a new combined science GCSE, which is awarded as a double-grade, replacing the old science, additional science and further additional science GCSEs.The results will have been eagerly awaited by the families of nearly 700,000 year 11 pupils in England alone, with more than 5.5m exam entries in total.Kevin Courtney, joint general secretary of the National Education Union, congratulated students on their results but said: “Removing most coursework and other non-exam assessment and just using end-of-course exams makes the exams extremely high stakes and is contributing to poor mental health among students.”Nick Gibb, the minister for school standards in England, said: “Thanks to our reforms and the hard work of teachers, education standards are rising in our schools and pupils have shown their abilities by achieving excellent results today, with so many pupils meeting and exceeding the standards we expect.”But Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, which represents many secondary school headteachers, said students and teachers had “weathered the storm of an unprecedented year of upheaval”.“We are concerned about the additional pressure this has placed on students and teachers and the impact on their wellbeing, and we are not clear why the government felt it necessary to ratchet up the pressure to such an extent and what this was intended to achieve,” Barton said."},{"url":"https://fastly-io.guim.co.uk/img/media/90cb0f65036288d82737e612ac4480d69c0a9302/0_55_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=160\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c714aea01cb1ebeb2fafe3f44cad74c0 160w","title":"gcse results day 2018 students get their grades live","story":"Rolling coverage as youngsters find out how they did under new grading system introduced for most subjects in EnglandCharity the Young Women’s Trust have warned that gender stereotypes and employer discrimination are still shutting girls out of some top-earning careers. Communications and campaigns director Joe Levenson said: Girls are achieving fantastic grades in GCSE physics and maths but are not continuing with these subjects to A Level or through apprenticeships. This is because gender stereotypes, employer discrimination and a lack of support shut girls out.Encouraging more girls to take science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) subjects to a higher level would help to plug the growing skills gap in industries like construction and engineering, boosting businesses and the economy. They have called on the government to set national targets to get more women into apprenticeships in male-dominated sectors and employers to do more reach-out work and offer part-time and flexible apprenticeships. A group of associations representing subjects that are not included in the EBacc performance measure have warned that the curriculum is narrowing. The EBacc requires that pupils take English language and literature, maths, a modern language, a science (including computer science), and history or geography at GCSE. Schools are measured on the number of pupils that take GCSEs in EBacc subjects which are prioritised in schools comparisons - which is leading to non EBacc subjects being excluding or marginalised, they warn.Rudolf Eliott Lockhart Chief Executive of the Religious Education Council of England and Wales (REC) said:While the Government’s ambitions to produce pupils with an ability in a core set of subjects are laudable, the unintended consequence of the EBacc measure is that essential knowledge and skills are being lost and we risk producing factory-farmed kids, who are compelled to take a narrow range of subjects simply to satisfy Government targets. Liz Moorse, Chief Executive, The Association for Citizenship Teaching (ACT) said: Recruiters such as Google are recognising that, while STEM subjects are important, wider knowledge and a broader skillset are equally important in a modern democracy and multicultural society.It’s vital that we safeguard against a narrowing of the curriculum that will leave students educationally impoverished, employers limited in their choice of candidates, and our society culturally worse off. Lesley Butterworth, General Secretary of the National Society for Education in Art and Design (NSEAD), said:Participation and engagement in art, craft and design at this level of education gives a unique and meaningful experience, developing transferable skills and personal expression, building confidence and self-esteem and signposting to career paths in the creative, cultural, digital media and heritage industries. A 14- year-old Vietnamese school girl who had written four novels by the time she was 13 has achieved a full set of grade 9s and A*s in her GCSEs, according to private school Francis Holland, in Sloane Square.Amanda, whose surname is not given, arrived at the £21,000 a year school last September on a bursary. At 13 she had written four novels, was studying undergraduate physics and, one year into piano, was taking Grade 5. She skipped two years to go into year 11 with a specially devised curriculum which condensed all her GCSE courses into a nine month period. On Thursday she got a “full sweep” of top grades (9s and A*s), and will begin her sixth form studies at Francis Holland, Sloane Square on a full scholarship. I was surprised but pleased with my results. Now I’m looking forward to studying maths, further maths, biology and chemistry at A level and going to university to study biochemistry. There are so many medical issues I would like to research. I am also constructing a new language.Josh Haliday has been speaking to students at William Hulme’s Grammar school in Manchester: At William Hulme’s Grammar school, where two-thirds of this year’s GCSE cohort were boys, there were laddy slaps on the back and fist bumps as they opened their results. Mohammed Al-Kalbani didn’t speak a word of English when he moved to Britain last May with his family, who are originally from Palestine.“I’m so proud,” he said as he digested results that showed he had passed both English exams, scored a double 9 in science, an 8 in maths and 7 in geography. “Everyone has helped me. At first it was really hard. I came here as the new kid, I didn’t have anyone to play with or talk to but I spent time with the mentor and she was really supportive with everything. I just kept working harder and harder.”Kisaa Bukhari, 16, said she was really happy with her 7 in maths, 8 in religious studies, and 7s in biology, chemistry and physics. “Honestly I was really scared because I thought if they are saying the new GCSEs are harder then I expected results lower than what I’ve got,” she said.Bukhari now plans to study chemistry, biology and statistics at A-Level and eventually go into medicine. “We get told science subjects are for everybody. Science has always been my favourite - in my class I’ve always contributed a lot compared to boys. It’s never been a big thing for us, people saying boys like sciences and girls can’t do sciences.”Last year saw the introduction of a new grading system for three subjects - English, English literature and maths. This year 20 more subjects were added to the reformed grading system. It seems to have made a difference, particularly among those students taking STEM subjects. Boys in England narrowed the gender gap in biology, chemistry and computing and actually outperformed girls in maths and physics.Students from across the country have been getting in touch with their stories.Olivia Zemmel, 16, from Yavneh Girls, The King David High School in Manchester who achieved seven nines and a seven said: “The exams were a lot harder than I thought they would be and it was especially difficult as we did not have any past papers. To celebrate I plan to go out with my parents and brothers tonight for a celebratory meal. I would like to thank the teachers from my school for all their help.”At Harrow High School in west London, Suela Merkaj got eight grade nines and an A* in further maths. She said: “I’m so pleased, honestly can’t believe it. I thought I’d done well but who ever thinks they’d do this well!”Agnieszka who is a mature student at Reading College achieved a nine in maths and a seven in English. With her grades she is planning to go to the University of Reading. She said: “I was happy there was no coursework as part of the qualification. I got 225 out of 240 points in maths and I couldn’t be happier. Doing an access course(which is basically three A-levels in one year together with GCSEs) made it so much easier for me. I think the change will make the access course more attractive to others mature students.”Brothers Daniel and Victor Cadenas Soto achieved seven grade nines and four grade eights plus an A** in further maths between them. Their mum is very proud was was too overwhelmed to comment!School standards minister Nick Gibb has congratulated pupils upon receiving their results and expressed his hope that this is the “first step to a bright and successful future”.  Congratulations to all the pupils getting their results today. All of their hard work – and that of their teachers – has paid off and I hope that this is the first step to a bright and successful future. Whatever they choose to do next – whether it is staying at school, going to college, or starting an apprenticeship – these qualifications will give them a solid base of knowledge and skills that they can build on.Thanks to our reforms and the hard work of teachers, education standards are rising in our schools and pupils have shown their abilities by achieving excellent results today, with so many pupils meeting and exceeding the standards we expect.British Telecom (BT) have issued a useful set of advice to help parents during this potentially stressful time, as they may have to take on the role of consoling their children. This is what they have suggested parents could say to their kids: “In addition to offering emotional support, the next step is to set a plan of action, but this doesn’t need to happen immediately as acting rashly can create chaos in an already unknown future,” BT said in a statement.They went on to advertise their apprenticeship schemes which they said offers a viable alternative to further or higher education.The general secretary of the organisation that represents secondary school head teachers has congratulated students and teachers on “weathering the storm of an unprecedented year of upheaval” as the share of pupils gaining the better marks rose.Geoff Barton, from the Association of School and College Leaders, said:Congratulations to students and teachers on today’s GCSE results. They have weathered the storm of an unprecedented year of upheaval with 20 new GCSEs being sat for the first time and they deserve full credit for the results achieved today.The reformed GCSEs are harder than their predecessors. They contain more content and more papers and the bar has been set deliberately higher to achieve the new top grade 9. We are concerned about the additional pressure this has placed on students and teachers and the impact on their wellbeing, and we are not clear why the government felt it necessary to ratchet up the pressure to such an extent and what this was intended to achieve.There will be a great deal of interest in students who have achieved grade 9s today. These young people have done exceptionally well, but it is important that we do not lose sight of the achievements of many other young people who have also recorded very good grades and should feel proud of their achievements.Pupils in England sat reformed GCSE exams in French, German and Spanish for the first time this summer with the numerically-graded exams for other modern foreign languages including Chinese, Italian and Russian to follow from next year.“The slight rise in pupils studying languages at GCSE is encouraging, particularly at a time when the UK is looking to establish a new position on the global stage,” said Mark Herbert, director of schools and skills at the British Council.Now more than ever our young people need to be equipped with the knowledge and skills to succeed in the internationally competitive economy.A survey of schools we conducted earlier this year suggested that more rigorous GCSEs may already be improving students’ linguistic competency, but also that lower ability pupils now appear less likely to take a language in the first place – so it’s vital we make language learning accessible for everyone, no matter their background.After a sustained period of decline German has had its first increase in years at GCSE, while Spanish continues to grow in popularity – to the extent it is likely to overtake French at GCSE in the next decade. To inspire a new generation of language learners we need to demonstrate the real-world value of being able to speak another language, not just on holiday, but in the workplace and beyond.Last year, student entries for all modern foreign languages were down by 7.3 per cent. The worst affected was German, which saw a 13.2 per cent decline in entrants, while French fell by 9.9 per cent, so these rises must be viewed with that in mind.GCSE’s are part of a linear process that needs to change, says Noel Tagoe, executive vice president at the Chartered Institute of Management Accountants.He calls on parents, pupils and employers to look at non-traditional approaches to pursuing long-term fulfilling careers.Regardless of whether the grading system is tougher, we must move away from thinking of education as a linear process. Education needs to take a more cyclical approach in order to encourage long-term, fulfilling careers. This means that parents, pupils and employers should look at non-traditional approaches because in-work education, such as an apprenticeship, might just be a better option down the line. Apprentices often start work with little to no debt, a career path to follow and no need for internships.However, a sustained fall in apprenticeships has meant that many children simply do not have the option of following this route.Figures out today show that girls are less likely to take the STEM subjects computing and ICT. Tara O’Sullivan, CMO at Skillsoft, says there are a lot of programmes going on designed to challenge outdated views that boys are more suited to these subjects:The bottom line is that women are just as capable as men. People often ask, “Why should more women get into STEM?” It’s like asking why women should be doctors. These on-going drives to get women into science and technology will continue to happen until the question no longer needs to be asked.Despite progression in gender equality, women are still grossly underrepresented in STEM. These low levels of participation can be traced back all the way to the school years, where a number of influences from society and culture, education and the labour market are all at play.Overall, an attitude overhaul – for both women and men – is needed if we are to close the STEM gender gap. Through better education and encouragement of both genders, we can chip away at antiquated attitudes and create a more equal workplace.Our Data Projects Editor Caelainn Barr is providing us with some delightful insight into the delightful morning that education correspondents have had today:The exam results are released under embargo to journalists at a “lock in” in Westminster at around 7.45am. In that time a room of about 20 sleep deprived reporters are given almost two hours to trawl through spreadsheets and figure out how students have fared in their exams this year. Unlike a typical “lock in” alcoholic libations are no where to be seen and craic is in short supply. This one is fuelled by a lone (now empty) coffee pump.My colleagues Richards Adams and Caelainn Barr report that boys are the main beneficiary of the new system.Boys appear to have been the major beneficiary of the overhaul of GCSE examinations taken in England for the first time this summer, as results showed across-the-board improvements in boys gaining top marks while girls saw their share of top grades dip."},{"url":"https://fastly-io.guim.co.uk/img/media/11bce504e922e834d0a230412def37c16b4f9bb3/0_260_5532_3319/master/5532.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9e9a6382bf7799e88581888ec3a520ae","title":"europe to ban halogen lightbulbs","story":"After nearly 60 years of lighting homes halogens will be replaced with more energy efficient LEDsAfter nearly 60 years of brightening our homes and streets, halogen lightbulbs will finally be banned across Europe on 1 September.The lights will dim gradually for halogen. Remaining stocks may still be sold, and capsules, linear and low voltage incandescents used in oven lights will be exempted. But a continent-wide switchover to light-emitting diodes (LEDs) is underway that will slash emissions and energy bills, according to industry, campaigners and experts.LEDs consume five times less energy than halogen bulbs and their phase-out will prevent more than 15m tonnes of carbon emissions a year, an amount equal to Portugal’s annual electricity usage.Philips, the lighting manufacturer estimates consumer savings of up to £112 a year from the switchover because LEDs last much longer than halogens and use far less power.But that has not stopped a perennial tabloid crusade against interference from Brussels – and the revival of timeworn Brexiteer campaign themes.Jonathan Bullock, Ukip’s energy spokesman in the European parliament told the : The EU\u0027s attempt to ban halogen bulbs is wrong because consumers will suffer financially and it’s always the poorest who suffer most from these kinds of policies.”“Customers should have the freedom of choice in bulbs and it shouldn’t be imposed by the EU.”However, with incandescent bans spreading from California to Canberra, any post-Brexit revival might depend on inefficient Chinese bulbs – and these could add £90 to average energy bills, studies indicate.At present, halogen bulbs are often inidually cheaper than LEDs but extrapolating cost savings from that is “a false economy” according to Stewart Muir, a product manager at the Energy Savings Trust.Ukip’s numbers “just don’t add up,” he said. “A halogen bulb may be cheaper to buy in the first place but the electricity costs will be much more expensive, whereas an LED bulb will pay for itself within a year.”Halogen bulbs also last for just two years on average, compared to LEDs which have a 15-20 year life expectancy, he said.The average British home has about 10 halogen lamps and uses each lightbulb for around three hours a day, according to government figures from 2012.Eliot Whittington, the director of the Prince of Wales’s corporate leaders group, which campaigns on the issue, said: “The science is clear. We can’t allow the human costs of climate change to reach the levels they will, if we fail to act. You ban things that threaten public safety and the wasteful use of energy is dangerous for us all in the end.”"},{"url":"https://fastly-io.guim.co.uk/img/media/c8bea207e5f4ba7f48afad5bd5ecf8c2eb29b643/0_365_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=756bbefe48bed45b9f604193ceecb017","title":"the man who would save mexicos natural wonders","story":"Mexico’s environmental marvels are on borrowed time, but poet Homero Aridjis is fighting to change thatAs Mexico emerges from the most violent election campaign within living memory and embarks on the presidency of Andres López Obrador, one prominent citizen watches at a diagonal: a veteran of Mexico’s other war – not that over narco-traffic and its clients in politics, but that against nature.In a recent interview with the daily El Universal, Homero Aridjis – award-winning poet and former ambassador – described all the candidates at last June’s election as “environmental illiterates” – referring to the battle he has fought for decades now, and which he sees reaching its final stages – for Mexico’s natural and cultural heritage.His war is fought for the survival of such menaced species as the unique richness of butterflies in her forests, turtles along her coastlines, whales in her waters.Such matters, however urgent, were “outrageously absent” from debate or discourse before or after the election, thunders Aridjis in conversation – the man who, more than any other person in Mexico, is responsible for the continued existence of these still threatened, marvelous creatures, and many others. “I don’t know whether it is indolence or ignorance among those who govern us,” he told El Universal, “but it is a grave act of moral corruption.”López Obrador will assume the presidency amid “an environmental disaster”, says Aridjis. “One of contaminated seas, lakes and rivers, terrible deforestation which has worsened of late, threats to – and trafficking in – fauna … and in the capital, monstrous pollution. None of the candidates expressed any interest in these problems of vast importance.”Aridjis defies categorization. After the death of his friend Octavio Paz, Aridjis, now 78, became Mexico’s most important poet – of verse at once mystical, personally intimate and romantic. The author of 49 books of poetry and prose, he was the country’s ambassador to Switzerland, the Netherlands and Unesco. And Aridjis founded the “Group of 100” artists and intellectuals in 1985 to lead and coordinate what has since been an unrelenting fight for nature and indigenous peoples, a battle during which he has “almost lost count”, he says, of the death threats against himself and his family.Now, as Mexico’s political violence spirals and narco-bloodletting hurls the country into an abyss apparently without bottom, a visit to Aridjis at home in Mexico City is like a corrective to the madness, a reminder of what matters on a higher level – that of his higher causes.Not that Aridjis’ struggles for imperiled flora and fauna put him “above all that” – on the contrary. His foremost message to the incoming president is: “What will happen to the thousands of unresolved justice cases – crimes committed by the cartels, daily murders, femicides, acts of corruption – that the Peña Nieto government has accumulated during these six years? Since his inauguration in 2012, there were some 107,000 homicides, among them 42 journalists whose murders are unresolved. Will there be honest justice, or will the victims be buried by the opportunistic gravestone of forgetfulness in that electoral circus?”To enter Aridjis’ house is like stepping into a wonderland past. The walls are lined with masks Aridjis has found on travels around his native land, ensnared “before the New York art dealers get their hands on them!” he says, eyes wide. They come from Oaxaca, Michoacán, Chiapas, used in dances of the Catrines, the Viejitos, Moors and Christians, Cora and Yaqui – so that all we discuss has the stare of ancients upon us. Aridjis exudes a mixture of sagacity, strength and charm his energy for a man two years short of 80 is infectious.Aridjis’ odyssey (an analogy he enjoys, given his name and Greek ancestry) began in childhood, with a near-fatal accident when 10-year-old Homero injured himself with a shotgun lent to an older brother. The convalescent boy felt his own survival “connected” to that of birds the gun was intended to shoot.But Aridjis’ collateral, his gravitas, rests upon decades of work for the natural backdrop against which these horrors unfold.Aridjis hails from Contepec, a town nestled against the Cerro Altamirano in Michoacán, in central Mexico, where – for millennia before the region became infamous as terrain over which drug cartels battle – millions of monarch butterflies converged from southeastern Canada and the northern United States to overwinter. This wonder infused young Aridjis’ poetry he described the monarch as a “winged tiger”.In 1975, this miracle was “discovered” by Canadian scientists: a use of the word which Aridjis likens to the “misnomer” of Cristoforo Colombo discovering, in 1492, an entire hemisphere that had been civilised for millennia. Aridjis and his Mexican forebears knew of the “millions of butterflies, layered like tarnished gold on the trunks and branches”. Because it occurs in early November, Indian lore connects their arrival to the return of departed souls on the Day of the Dead.The Group of 100 had been initially formed to combat lethal pollution in Mexico City, but later focused on the menaced future of the butterflies, facing a new threat: logging, both sanctioned and illegal. A battle began to save “the landscape of our childhood and the backdrop of our dreams, from the depredation of our fellow men”, as Aridjis told a joint symposium of Unesco and Pen International (of which Aridjis was international president for six years), in the hope that “perhaps other human beings can save their hill and their butterfly, and all of us together can protect Earth from the biological holocaust that threatens it”.In 1986, Aridjis convinced then president Miguel de la Madrid to create the Monarch Butterfly Special Biosphere Reserve. However, fires and unchecked cutting proceeded apace in the reserve and in 1989, “the butterflies came to Altamirano, but did not stay”. The reserve challenged “political interests, local and national”, explains Aridjis, “with congressmen, mayors and ejidatarios – co-owners of common land – logging on sanctuary land”. Throughout the 1990s “the government continued to allow logging in both unprotected and protected areas – illegal and commercial cutting were rampant”.But in 2000, the protected area was tripled, and in 2008, with Aridjis now Mexico’s ambassador to Unesco, the Monarch Butterfly Biosphere Reserve was listed as a world heritage site. Even so, with narco-trafficking cartels now controlling the power players in Michoacán, “illegal cutting, illegal fires continue,” says Aridjis. “Often the cartels and the logging interests overlap, joining hands, becoming one and the same.”By the 2013-2014 season, the monarch population had plummeted from 1.1 billion butterflies overwintering in central Mexico in 1996 to 33 million. Aridjis and monarch scientists Lincoln Brower and Ernest Williams penned a letter, signed by more than 200 writers and scientists from 18 countries, to US president Barack Obama, Peña Nieto and Canadian prime minister Stephen Harper, identifying a further cause for the decline as “genetically modified herbicide resistant soybean and corn crops in the US corn belt. Relentless spraying of glyphosate herbicides on the fields has destroyed the once abundant milkweed plants, the only plants that monarch caterpillars can eat.” The letter urged action to preserve the migratory phenomenon, pleading that “the monarch butterfly is literally being starved to death”.“I wonder whether Donald Trump will take any interest in the monarchs,” wonders Aridjis now, “or will his scorn for migrants extend to migratory species as well? For now, the butterflies come – but for how much longer?”“It all happens inside of me the turtles lay eggs on the beachthe turtles shed tears of sandthe nest robbers are thieving eggs as old as life itself”A Seri person told him that when a member of the community dies, he or she turns into a Leatherback turtle, and Seri elders are said to be able to talk to them. “Obviously,” says Aridjis, “the Seri don’t eat leatherbacks, but both may become extinct.”During the 1970s, while Aridjis was Mexico’s ambassador to the Netherlands, he forwarded letters to the president protesting against the cruel mass slaughter of sea turtles, who are facing extinction, on the coasts of Mexico. “I only provoked his anger,” says Aridjis. “He thought it frivolous of me to be defending turtles when there were more important matters in hand, such as selling Mexico’s oil, uranium and natural gas.”“What kind of economic progress,” he adds, “cripples ecosystems and makes the land barren and unlivable?”The narrative unearthed by Aridjis and his movement was one of shocking cruelty against species which Aridjis calls “living receptacles of the earth’s natural history”. They survived the extinction of dinosaurs but are threatened by the banalities of greed for turtle “products” – their skins, shells and supposedly aphrodisiac eggs.In articles for the newspaper La Jornada, Aridjis revealed that pirates, unheeded by navy patrols, severed the front and rear flippers of captured turtles before throwing the still living creatures back into the sea. At Mazunte, Oaxaca, olive ridley turtles “piled up like boulders” were killed with bullets or machetes. “Often the womb would be slit open to extract eggs and the turtle left to die a slow death on the sand.” Mutilated females whose wombs were ripped open at sea “frequently crawled up on the beach to die ... Near one beach was a mountain of carapaces eighty feet high ... Every restaurant had turtle eggs on the menu.”Although the sale of turtle eggs was forbidden, a collection and distribution network continued to operate. Poachers crammed up to 1,000 eggs into a single sack, often “accompanied by the same marines charged with guarding the nests”.In 1990, after reading a published declaration by the Group of 100, then president Carlos Salinas de Gortari signed a total and permanent ban on the capture of sea turtles. But 28 years later, says Aridjis, “we lack the means to enforce it, and there are other threats: incidental capture of turtles in commercial fishing gear, the BP Alabama oil spill, entanglement in and ingestion of plastic debris”.In 2004, two veterinary students studying olive ridley turtles disappeared – the body of one later washed ashore the death certificate registered death by beating, not drowning. No one – certainly not Aridjis - would suggest that Mexico’s wars are not interconnected.“And there in San Ignacio Lagoon God created the great whalesand each creature that moveson the shadowy thighs of the waters”An excerpt from one of Aridjis’ poemsA wonder of the natural world occurs in this lagoon on the coast of Baja California. After completing one of the world’s longest migrations undertaken by any mammal - between 5,000 and 6,800 miles – magnificent gray whales spawn their young, returning each March with their calves to the Bering, Chukchi and Beaufort seas. The warm lagoon waters were officially protected by legislation in 1954, 1972 and 1979. Mexico established a gray whale sanctuary in Laguna San Ignacio in 1954 and banned whaling. That same year Exportadora de Sal, SA was founded, to mine salt in Baja California Sur. In 1972 the lagoon was decreed a reserve and refuge area for migratory birds and wildlife, and in 1979 a refuge for pregnant whales and calves and a tourist attraction area.Aridjis and the Group of 100 took the offensive, denouncing the company’s 465-page environmental impact assessment that contained only 23 lines on whales and “denies the existence of any body of water that would be adversely affected by the saltworks’ operations”. “Protected areas,” said the group, in a full-page advertisement in the New York Times signed by Octavio Paz, Allen Ginsberg, Margaret Atwood and Günter Grass among others, “would become evaporation ponds, pumping stations, conveyor belts, stockpiles, new service roads and new human settlements …”The now international campaign – coined the biggest environmental battle ever in Mexico – paralleled those seeking to ban Japanese and Norwegian whaling.In March 2000, five years after the campaign was launched, then president Ernesto Zedillo annulled the saltworks project, citing harm to the landscape, although the real reason was financial. In conversation, it is one of the few victories Aridjis allows himself to savour without qualification: “It is one of my great joys to go there, to watch and touch the whales, meet local people I came to know, who are bringing up their children to love the whales.”Aridjis’ articles and speeches were recently collected and translated into a book, News of the Earth. The Nobel laureate JMG Le Clézio writes of the volume that “the great strength of Aridjis’ work is the faith it transmits in a creative virtue of the world, pessimism notwithstanding, and in the possibility of saving it”.In his preface, Aridjis writes that he “often felt like Sisyphus, confronting the same problems over and over again, or Cassandra, prophesying disaster, or Don Quixote, because we sometimes seem like madmen tilting at windmills”.Relevant to Sunday’s election result: the book records how the party of the favourite to win, Andres López Obrador, was as obstructive towards Aridjis’ campaigns over butterflies and whales as either of the two establishment parties Obrador claims to usurp.Aridjis is darkly, disdainfully hilarious about the banal vulgarity at play in the encounters his campaigns have led him to. He recalls a president’s relative offering him a car and a chauffeur to stop campaigning against a chemical waste plant. And that at the 1994 International Whaling Commission meeting in Puerto Vallarta, the undersecretary of fisheries offered him a $50,000 bribe to stop opposing Mexico’s support for Japanese whaling.Then there was a meeting with the owner of the influential Televisa stations who, to Aridjis’ amazement, offered his support for the campaign against Norway and Japan: “I don’t give a damn about environmentalism,” he said, “but I love going out in my yacht and watching the whales swim around.”Phone numbers for the Japanese and Norwegian embassies were duly broadcast on Televisa’s channels and viewers asked to call demanding an end to whaling. Salinas de Gortari took note and instructed the undersecretary to get the new Mexican position from me.“A corrupt journalist once said to me: ‘I don’t understand you, Homero. You have access to all these powerful people, and could really get yourself a good deal – money, a position. And all you talk to them about is stupid animalitos and arbolitos. I told him I don’t think of my work as being for stupid little animals or little trees. I think of it as being a battle for who we are, and the existence of what we have inherited from nature”."},{"url":"https://fastly-io.guim.co.uk/img/media/a343f5bc0f781ba0d71f6bd4f715d1286f5b1908/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ea28d5c1ae98b39fec37168bf34442d6","title":"100 days a duchess what meghans style has shown us about her new royal life","story":"Since marrying Prince Harry, her tights, messy bun and the way she crosses her legs have all caused controversy. But what do her fashion choices really tell us?The gooey-eyed, loved-up, you-can-do-no-wrong stage of the honeymoon between the new Duchess of Sussex and the media lasted for three weeks precisely. On Saturday 9 June, for her first appearance on the Buckingham Palace balcony after the trooping the colour celebrations, the royal formerly known as Meghan Markle wore a pale-pink Carolina Herrera dress with a wide, off-the-shoulder collar. “Some were quick to notice that she may have bent one of British royalty’s most steadfast rules,” observed Hello! magazine gravely, noting that “royal protocol usually advises that women should keep their shoulders covered”.A few weeks later, at Wimbledon’s women’s singles final, the big news from the royal box was the daring return of the duchess’s signature “messy bun”. “Meghan Markle has been sticking to the royals’ elegant style lately … but this weekend her messy hairstyle and casual look were back,” noted Vanity Fair. As if strands of untucked hair were not enough to see the duchess branded the biggest royal rule-breaker since the Duchess of Devonshire scandalised 18th-century society with her affairs and gambling debts, it transpired that at one event she had momentarily forgotten the “duchess slant” and crossed her legs at the knee, rather than the ankle. The Daily Mail expressed concern that she would be “slammed for disrespecting the Queen”, quoting a “royal etiquette expert” who pronounced crossing the leg at the knee one of the “biggest etiquette mistakes a lady can make”.It is 100 days since she became a duchess and the “breaking royal protocol” narrative has emerged as the plot twist that makes her fairytale a modern one. It is a tagline that has almost nothing to do with her relationship with the royal family and everything to do with her relationship with the public.The first “scandal” of the duchess’s married life came when, at her father-in-law’s birthday party, she was photographed in sheer tights. It was reported that the tights were by order of the Queen, but I find it hard to believe the Queen is so petty as to issue hosiery edicts (the Duchess of Cambridge does not always abide by them, if so). It seems more likely that the tights were simply an attempt at looking formal that backfired in the face of flash photography. Nonetheless, little else seemed to be discussed on social media for days. To brandish a pair of unphotogenic tights as proof that a 36-year-old woman who had weathered a pre-wedding familial firestorm and maintained grace and dignity in front of a wedding audience of millions had surrendered free will and submitted to Gilead-esque rules within days seems to stretch the significance of hosiery.The duchess’s image as a rule breaker is catnip because it cuts both ways. It energises those who disapprove of her and those who cheer her. Even when the breaking of royal protocol is used as admonishment, many among the public see it as her greatest asset. As the first biracial woman to marry into the royal family, the first to have had a successful career, the first self-proclaimed feminist, she is a revolutionary force in Britain just by being herself. Everything that happens in her orbit – from Bishop Michael Curry referencing Martin Luther King during her wedding ceremony to a few strands of hair escaping from her updo – is seen through this lens.The discussion of her clothes is never really about clothes. When Kate Middleton married Prince William seven years ago, the interest in her wardrobe settled on the price tags. The forensic examination of how much she had paid for her LK Bennett shoes and Reiss jackets was a thinly veiled vehicle for the sneery obsession with her having come from a family which was not quite posh enough. With the Duchess of Sussex, our interest is in how exciting and refreshing she is as a royal, so the focus on her wardrobe zeroes in on how formal or informal it is.As a rule, the British public likes its royal women to be as glamorous as possible, but around the duchess there is a new appetite for deshabille. Her outfit for Wimbledon – the messy bun, along with a striped, blue-and-white Ralph Lauren shirt and cream palazzo pants – was her best-received outfit since the wedding. This was a more polished version of the oversized white shirt and ripped blue jeans she wore for her first public appearance with her then boyfriend in September last year. A sharp but understated black Givenchy trousersuit, worn on 11 July during an official visit to Dublin, was also loved by fashion critics. By contrast, the voluminous blue-and-white toile de jouy Oscar de la Renta maxi dress she wore to the wedding of her husband’s cousin Celia McCorquodale – by far her most daring, fashion-forward choice of the past 100 days – got a cold reception. No one wants fashion-forward from the duchess, it seems. Those of us who do not want her in sheer tights would prefer to have her in ripped jeans and a white shirt.She has developed a signature look that appeals to as broad a church as possible. The most distinctive feature is the wide, bateau neckline that featured on her Givenchy wedding dress and in which she has been seen many times since. This neckline has featured on a caped, cream Givenchy dress, but also on a navy belted Dior number and an olive-green Ralph Lauren ensemble. This, therefore, is a directive coming from the wearer, not the designer. Tailored dresses such as this are favoured by women in the public eye all over the world because a sculpted shape is reliably flattering from every angle, but they can be a little ice-queen in tone.The bateau neckline is a grownup, non-tawdry way to show enough skin to lend warmth to this look. It is a preppy, non-specifically vintage style favoured by a certain kind of upscale, Europeanised American woman – Grace Kelly, Carolyn Bessette-Kennedy and now the Duchess of Sussex.The interest in the wardrobes of the Duchesses of Sussex and Cambridge is intensified by the generational balance of the royal family. That the Queen is a bona fide style icon was proved beyond doubt even before she wore a brooch given to her by Barack and Michelle Obama to a meeting with Donald Trump, but she is also 92 and unlikely to experiment with new silhouettes or hairstyles. In the royal glamour stakes, the duchesses must do the heavy lifting on the global stage without looking as if they are upstaging the monarch. The predominance of bridesmaid-style blush pink and demure navy in their wardrobes – one sunshine-yellow sheath dress from the Duchess of Sussex being a notable exception – is a show of deference to the Queen owning bright colours at public events.Our new royal is compelling to watch because the balancing act she must pull off is almost impossible. The Duchess of Sussex is expected to show us the way towards the royal family of the future, but without showing disrespect for the royal family of today. We cheer her on for breaking royal protocol, but we admire and praise her when she remains aloof of the scandals that swirl around her. We want our royal women to be real and human and modern these days – and that is progress. The catch is that we still want them to be perfect.• This article was amended on 23 August 2018 because an earlier version erroneously referred to the Duchess of Sussex as the first orcee to marry into the royal family."},{"url":"https://fastly-io.guim.co.uk/img/media/38cd5017e1e7f8a3e581a84749b529683d27198b/323_28_3576_2146/master/3576.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=59db70dc75e63a43bd562e63673dcdba","title":"premier league player england caps futsal wolves","story":"Max Kilman improved as a footballer by playing futsal but his England career could be over after his move to WolvesBy Chris Evans for The Set Pieces, part of the Sport NetworkMax Kilman is an England international who could walk down any busy high street in the country without turning a single head. Yet the 21-year-old left-back has 25 caps and has already played a starring role for England in two epic tussles with Germany. But after moving from National League side Maidenhead United to Wolves on deadline day, he might have to call time on his international career.It might sound like the implausible career of a Football Manager regen suffering from a bizarre in-game glitch, but Kilman’s story is real. The only catch is that his international honours are not from football: he’s part of England’s futsal squad. Or at least he was until his move to Molineux.“I don’t think I’ll have any time to do futsal now because I’ll be training with Wolves every day,” says Kilman. “I want to try to organise something so I can still play for England, but it’s difficult and I’m not sure it’ll happen. Of course I’m going to be upset if that does happen, but it’s a risk I have to take to become a professional footballer.”Kilman may become one of England’s youngest international retirees when he gives up futsal for football, but his story could have been very different. Only three years ago, when Kilman was on loan from Maidenhead at seventh-tier Marlow, he knew one of the sports would have to give and considered jacking in football to chase the professional dream in futsal.“When I was 18 and first in the England futsal team, I was definitely considering going abroad to become professional,” he says. “Football maybe wasn’t going as well for me and wasn’t heading anywhere, so I was considering it. I was playing for Maidenhead’s youth team and slowly broke through, but when I did get into the first team, I was sent on loan two leagues below. It was difficult and a long process.With futsal still relatively low-profile in England, Kilman would have struggled to make a living from the sport in his homeland and would probably have had to follow the lead of England team-mates who moved to the continent to play in Italy or Croatia. Instead he kept plugging away at both, often turning out for Maidenhead on a Saturday before a game of futsal for London Helvécia on a Sunday. Juggling the two was a challenge and Kilman was forced to miss occasional matches or training sessions depending on different priorities. The two sports require different skills, so did he ever mix them up? “No, I could do it all right,” he says. “I learned quite quickly and adapted to both. Some people might not be able to play the other sport or take a while to swap, but I did it quite quickly, which was lucky. There’s a bit of transition, but you need to know what you have to do.“It’s mainly remembering what you need to do the job. It’s about thinking ‘OK, now I’m playing futsal, I need to make more movements off the ball.’ But in football you’re in one position, so you don’t pass and move in the same way. In futsal, you need to constantly keep moving and realise you need to be a bit more forward-thinking.“Futsal helps with football quite a lot. Everybody thinks it’s all about making you better controlling the ball, but it’s about being more aware, more comfortable on the ball and making better decisions. It helps because it’s really fast and the area is much smaller. So, when I came back to football, I was more confident to get the ball from throw-ins, in more tight areas and I felt like I had way more space when I got on a bigger pitch again.”Kilman believes playing futsal helped him progress as a footballer – and, ironically, hone the skills that led to Wolves signing him and effectively ending his futsal career. Even if Kilman never sets foot on a futsal court again, he is adamant that more children should use the sport as a breeding ground, just as he did. It’s widespread in other countries – including leading football nations such as Spain, Brazil and Portugal – yet futsal struggles to be taken seriously in England, as is highlighted by the Three Lions’ lowly world ranking of 52 – behind football minnows Vietnam, Kyrgyzstan and the Solomon Islands.“It’s always difficult over here because every time you look on the internet or social media, you always see football highlights and very rarely futsal. And for 10 or 11-year-olds, it’d be good to be promoting more futsal pages with clips of nice goals or tricks. It’s weird because futsal is more exciting than football in futsal, each team makes about 30 chances a game at least, whereas in football you might only see one shot on target for the whole half.”Kilman’s futsal career is currently on hold but his recent transfer might be a step towards becoming a double international in the future. If he is ever capped for England’s football team, he is guaranteed to turn a few heads while walking down the street.• This is an article from The Set Pieces• Follow Chris Evans and The Set Pieces on Twitter"},{"url":"https://fastly-io.guim.co.uk/img/media/e920555161136968b77275b432fa3ced1f207fe2/0_148_3264_1958/master/3264.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4adb213314325c265c26f27282f6dcf6","title":"the big squeeze what to pack for an overnight trail run","story":"Packing light for an endurance event can seem like an insurmountable challenge. From fluids to food and kit, here’s how to get it rightI felt well prepped. My first serious trail run lay a week away. Madeira’s mountainous tracks and cliff-top coastline beckoned. Our route: the classic MIUT ultra ning the Portuguese island in the north Atlantic. But we weren’t crazy. We would do it in two stages rather than in one, crazy-goat go. And we would hack off the first 35km. So that left around 80km over two days. Sure, the gradient chart for the first day looked like a heart attack victim’s cardiograph (3,600m of ascent). But, as I say, I felt good. I had trained hard. I wasn’t carrying any niggles. Then, with a simple email, everything changed. The message was from Charlie, one of our Madeira trail-running trio. Of the three of us, he was the only one with any experience of serious long-distance running. He owns a high-end travel company in Morocco and talks casually of jogging in the Atlas mountains. He had already won our ear. Then I learned he had done the Marathon des Sables, a seriously gruelling six-day race in the Sahara, and our respect rose inordinately. So when he sent an email with the subject heading, “Everything weighs something”, I was primed to listen.It’s obvious, of course. Except for air, nothing is weightless. Everything else had to fit into a backpack (a 12-litre rucksack, in my case). I had been excitedly purchasing bits and pieces over the past fortnight or so: some new sunglasses (with sporty reflective tint), a running visor (to look the part), a buff (to look like a Spanish biker). Anyone who has prepared for an endurance-type event will know that buying the kit is half the fun. Gradually, however, a hefty pile of stuff had begun to collect beside my bed.The question of how to squeeze all this into my (much smaller) bag had, in a vague sort of way, been turning over at the back of my mind. Charlie’s email sent such thoughts scurrying to the front. To save weight, he was recommending that we portion out the essentials between us. So Jon, our mutual friend, was assigned toothpaste and sun cream (“small tubes”), plus a phone charger and, weirdly, a knife. Channelling his inner nurse, Charlie put himself down for kinesiology tape, first-aid kit and anti-inflammatories. I got the leftovers: toilet roll, wet-wipes, water purification tablets. The email ended in the cavalier style of a Victorian-era Arctic explorer: “The rest is each-to-his-own.”I look again at my pile. Forget 1-in-4 gradients: packing light suddenly seemed the insurmountable challenge ahead. Start with the non-negotiables, I resolved. So into my bag went my passport, my inhaler, my survival “space blanket” and my phone. The remainder vied up into three broad categories: fluids, foodstuffs and comfort-offering accoutrements. But what to take?For fluids, I decided to keep it old-school: a modest-sized bottle in a side pocket, plus a 1.5l hydration. I’m prone to cramps, so I allowed myself some electrolyte tablets as well. What I didn’t pack were purification tablets: I’d searched high and low in Porto, where I live, but couldn’t find them anywhere. We would just have to bet on Madeira’s watercourses being free of cow muck and chemicals.Subsequent events taught me two key lessons. First, water is seriously heavy. Second, I wish I had known to fill up whenever and wherever I got the chance. While streams and irrigation channels were two-a-penny on Madeira’s lower slopes, the story was altogether different above the treeline. Climbing to a lengthy 1,500m ridgeline, I found myself out of water. My legs turned heavy, my head hurt. If we hadn’t eventually stumbled on a mountain spring, my adventure would have been over almost before it began. So, to food. Into the bag went two 250g bags of nuts, and some energy bars. At the last minute, I also snuck in a cheese sandwich and banana, both of which emerged from my bag totally squished but no less edible. Our general game plan was to keep nibbling through the day, then carb up in the evening. In the end, we arrived at our night-stop after dark and discovered the hamlet’s two eateries long shut. In the days after the run, I barely left the fridge. Finally to kit: painkillers, salt tablets, plasters, head-torch, bank card, toothbrush. Most of the rest related to staying warm. My dilemma wasn’t the daylight hours. The forecast was saying around 25C, even at altitude. It was packing for the night that threw me. I spent hours lusting over one-man tents online, but all fell far outside my price range. I opted instead for just a sleeping bag, plus lots of layers. I figured I could sleep in my fleece and rain jacket, plus the spare clothes I had earmarked for the journey home. Assigned by lack of space to the “leave” pile was a roll mat, an inner lining for the sleeping bag, and a thin puffer coat. Did I sleep well? No, not especially, but I felt emboldened for roughing it.In retrospect, if I were to have shelled out on anything, a top-notch sleeping bag would probably have topped the list: it would have taken up less room and, being warmer, saved on me packing extra clothes. But, in general, I felt I had whittled everything down as much as possible. Only my weight of expectation remained alarmingly high – and Madeira, runners’ heaven that it is, did not disappoint.

At its conclusion, virtually all of the major players in the story – from the Strokes to Yeah Yeah Yeahs – find themselves in reduced circumstances. Damaged by their own excesses, overtaken commercially by cannier, hungrier artists – the gimlet-eyed Killers and Kings of Leon, the nerdy but organised Vampire Weekend – things just haven’t worked out the way they once expected them to.Interpol’s dalliance with a major label ends prematurely and badly, having failed to catapult them into arenas. The band end the book talking the pragmatic, defiant, but downcast language of a band digging in for the long haul, aware that their golden moment has passed, and facing the future with lowered expectations: albums that get reviewed respectfully but without any real excitement gigs that sell tickets to diehard supporters and people who only really want to hear songs from your first two albums solo projects that go almost unnoticed, and play-the-classic-in-full anniversary tours. “Man are we lucky these people want to come and see us.” “We have fun.” “Having outside interests helps.”Of course, it’s better to be realistic than delude yourself, but anyone who’s read Goodman’s book might find Marauder a surprise. Judging by their comments in Meet Me in the Bathroom, not even Interpol would have imagined their sixth album could sound this revitalised and emboldened. At least part of its success is down to Flaming Lips and Mercury Rev producer Dave Fridmann, whose fingerprints are all over certain aspects of it, not least the way the rhythm section is recorded scuffed with a layer of distortion, as if everything is in the red. But it’s mostly down to Interpol themselves. Sixteen years after their acclaimed debut, Turn on the Bright Lights, they appear to have unexpectedly hit on a variety of ways to broaden their sound without losing its essence.The spindly, reverb-laden guitars of The Rover or Surveillance could in theory have appeared on their debut, but they feel noticeably more grownup and expansive, less concerned with asserting their place in an august lineage of angst-ridden alt-rock with Joy Division and the Chameleons. There’s a sunlit buoyancy about the melody of Surveillance that would never have been permitted in the austere, nocturnal world conjured up by the Interpol of the early noughties.The kind of icy detachment that was once Interpol’s raison d’etre – this is, after all, a band who called the opening track of their debut album Untitled – is noticeable in its absence here. Instead there’s a real immediacy even about its most oblique moments. On opener If You Really Love Nothing, airy vocals drape themselves beautifully over muscular glam-rock drums. The best thing here might be Stay in Touch, a song that slowly unfolds, punctuated by a rhythm track that adds prickly urgency: the drums don’t so much underpin the tune as slip and slide around it, never quite landing where you expect them to.It also sounds remarkably like the work of a band who’ve learned from their mistakes. Around the time of 2007’s Our Love to Admire, the album on which Interpol made their major-label assisted push for mainstream success, frontman Paul Banks’ default vocal setting was a stentorian bellow, which fitted with the booming, stadium-ready sound constructed by Muse producer Rich Costey. Here, there’s more light and shade on display: Mountain Child gets its emotional impact from the cooing tenderness of Banks’s voice during the verses Party’s Over features him singing in a fragile falsetto. Similarly, if his tendency to imponderable, portentous symbolism hasn’t been entirely excised – “the pink house returns to gloom and becomes the fundamental,” he sings at one juncture – it’s now outweighed by more direct, personal and affecting lyrics. The title of It Probably Matters sounds like an expression of shrugging Brooklyn hipster insouciance, but the song turns that idea on its head. Banks appears to be addressing his dissolute younger self and his offhand treatment of others in a tone of anguished mortification: “I didn’t have the grace or the brains … I was pawning my days away.” In fact, Banks is very good throughout Marauder on the subject of regarding your past and involuntarily cringing at instances of unthinking behaviour, posturing indifference and missed opportunities: “Who reigns in that silence when you sleep in the afternoon?”It’s among the factors that make Marauder a mature album, rather than the work of people hemmed in by their past, cowed by the sense that they can never hope to be as exciting as they were on arrival. That’s something that most of their noughties NYC peers have thus far failed to achieve. It’s the sound of a band who have done the last thing you might expect them to do at this stage of their career: start moving on.Perfect end-of-the-summer aural balm: a hazy reverie of half-heard voices and beautiful, distant electronics."},{"url":"https://fastly-io.guim.co.uk/img/media/2017e9b921ee6e68b2792420ab0a54b3086be310/0_238_5160_3096/master/5160.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5f7ec88975190e09931afc104509a22c","title":"tearing our hair out learning to treat compulsive hair pulling","story":"Christina Pearson was 14 years old when she started pulling out her hair, creating bald patches on her head. She was taken to a psychiatrist, but in 1970 there was no name for her disorder, and certainly no treatment. The doctor issued a psychiatric discharge that removed Pearson from high school. At first, she felt relief. At school she had lived in dread that somebody might pull off her hat and reveal that her head was mostly bare – a possibility she found “so frightening that anything was better than that”.In the ensuing months Pearson holed up at home, pulling out her hair and feeling, she told me, like a monster. Scared and searching for relief, she eventually decided to leave. “I hitchhiked across Mexico at 14 and was doing peyote out in the desert, all kinds of things,” she said. “I really lived a very fringe life.” At 15, she started picking her skin, until her body was covered with open sores. By 20, she was addicted to drugs and alcohol.At the age of 30, Pearson finally got sober and started a business with a friend in Santa Cruz, California. In 1989, she received a phone call from her mother, who had just listened to a story on the radio about a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine. “There’s a name for what you used to do,” Pearson’s mother told her, not knowing that Pearson still pulled her hair. The news that there was a name for her condition – trichotillomania – was immense.After decades of shame and isolation, she began to feel hope: it turned out there were others living with the same condition. Pearson launched a support group and appeared on a Seattle news network, where she spoke about her life and gave her own phone number as a trichotillomania hotline.By the time she got home she had over 600 messages.“People were crying and sobbing and begging for help,” said Pearson, who spent a week calling each person back. “It was the best therapy I ever had, because I heard my life coming out of other people’s mouths.”One night Pearson made the decision to walk away from her business and devote her life to improving awareness of trichotillomania. “I was scared shitless. I’m a drug addict, I’m a small-business person, I’m in sobriety, I have an eighth-grade education, and I’m going to get out there and change the world and some weird pathological disorder?” said Pearson. “I was terrified.” Step into any classroom or coffee shop and the odds are that at least one person in the room has a body-focused repetitive behaviour (BFRB), such as trichotillomania or skin-picking disorder. People with this disorder perform repetitive self-grooming activities such as picking, pulling or biting. These can cause emotional distress and damage to the body, but the people doing them can’t stop.At their most extreme, these conditions are life-threatening. A significant minority of people with trichotillomania (commonly called “trich”) swallow their hair. Over time, it can block the intestine and require surgical removal. Skin-picking can lead to infections that require treatment with intravenous antibiotics or skin grafts.These conditions take an emotional and social toll. They often begin in late childhood or early adolescence, while children are at school and vulnerable to bullies. One sufferer now in his late 20s found school an “absolute hell” because his classmates saw him as “the weird kid with missing eyelashes”. Another woman, now 30, recalled watching her classmates play catch with the wig they had snatched off her head.Picking and hair-pulling are often a source of conflict between child and parent, which can heighten a child’s feelings of shame and isolation. In adults the condition can lead to fear of intimacy, missed job interviews, and hours lost each day to picking and pulling.Although trich has appeared in the medical literature for over a century, in the US it was not included in the DSM (the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, the official classification guide published by the American Psychiatric Association) until 1987 – a full 17 years after Pearson made her first visit to a psychiatrist, and six years after I entered elementary school and started pulling my hair.My mother took me to a dermatologist, who did not offer any advice. As it turned out, I was part of a subset of kids – including toddlers and even babies – whose symptoms simply go away without any kind of treatment. By the end of the school year, my hair-pulling had stopped. But for most iniduals, the condition is chronic, lasting years, or even decades.Skin-picking disorder was added to the DSM in 2013. “We were ecstatic when it was given its own diagnostic label,” said Nancy Keuthen, director of the Trichotillomania Clinic and Research Unit at Massachusetts General hospital. An official label validates people’s experiences and encourages them to seek treatment. In the absence of a name, Keuthen said, the tendency had been to think: “I don’t know anybody else who has this, I must be really weird”.Now both are included in the chapter on obsessive–compulsive and related disorders. On the surface, OCD and body-focused repetitive behaviour (BFRB) share similar characteristics: both involve strong urges towards repetitive behaviours. But unlike some compulsions, picking and pulling are soothing, even pleasurable. This distinction matters because the conditions benefit from different kinds of behavioural therapies and whereas medication is a first-line treatment for OCD in the US, for example, there currently is no BFRB treatment approved by the US Food and Drug Administration.In fact, compared with better-known psychiatric conditions, BFRBs remain markedly underresearched. “Historically, there has been almost no funding for these disorders,” said Keuthen. Funding usually goes to conditions that are seen as significantly affecting quality of life, or that make it difficult to function in the workplace. Although BFRBs can do both, they have been misunderstood as “bad habits that lazy people have”, Keuthen explained. This obscures the critical distinction between ordinary self-grooming (who doesn’t occasionally pick a scab or pluck a hair?) and a clinical case in which the behaviour goes on and on, causing distress or impairment, while the person feels wholly unable to stop.Christina Pearson founded the Trichotillomania Learning Center (since renamed the TLC Foundation for Body-Focused Repetitive Behaviours) in 1991. Her goal was to help people, especially children, avoid the fear and secrecy she had lived with for so long. She wanted to offer authoritative information that could help people. There was just one problem: that information didn’t exist.There was also a powerful stigma. At least some of this can be traced back to the medical literature of the 1950s and 60s, which tended to blame the parents, particularly mothers, of people who pulled their hair.One report from that period examined 11 children with trich. The authors, who were professionals at the US National Institute of Mental Health, concluded that the children’s behaviour stemmed from intense conflict “between the child and the original love object, the mother”. The children, they wrote, pulled their hair “with large amounts of libido” and used hair-pulling as a substitute for an emotionally unavailable mother.This judgment and blame continued even after trichotillomania got its official diagnosis and was added to the DSM. Pearson began renting booths at medical conferences. In the early years, psychologists would walk by and make fun of her, pulling their own hair. One dermatologist warned her that people who pick their skin and pull their hair are “often psychotic”. She recalled one young man who had been told by a mental health professional that pulling out his hair was like public masturbation.Something else that contributed to the misunderstanding was that trich was considered an exceedingly rare disorder. The first prevalence study wasn’t published until 1991, when the DSM criteria for trich were more stringent than they are today. To be counted as having trich, in addition to having a strong impulse to pull hair resulting in hair loss, iniduals needed to experience tension prior to pulling and “gratification or relief” while pulling.In 1990, Pearson attended one of the first professional talks about trichotillomania, given by the psychologist Charles Mansueto. At the event, she met a number of interested clinicians, including Carol Novak, a psychiatrist from Minnesota who had written a pamphlet about trich.“Back in those days, we had no internet. Nobody knew the word trichotillomania,” said Novak, who went on to become the founding director of the TLC Foundation’s scientific advisory board. Around that time, Novak, Mansueto and Richard O’Sullivan, a psychiatrist who currently practises in Connecticut, attended a retreat Pearson had organised for people with trich. Novak recalled the participants expressing frustration and anger with the mental health field “because they had been so mistreated by professionals”. Soon after, more professionals agreed to join the board and conduct research in the field.One study currently under way is the BFRB Precision Medicine Initiative, which has been funded by TLC donors. It is taking place at the Semel Institute for Neuroscience and Human Behavior at the University of California, Los Angeles, the University of Chicago Medicine, and Massachusetts General hospital, an affiliate of Harvard Medical School. The goal is to test up to 300 participants using a variety of methods, including interviews, imaging and bloodwork.Nancy Keuthen at Massachusetts General noted that researchers have tended to study BFRBs in narrow slices – a small brain-imaging study, for instance. While this approach could uncover an interesting abnormality, it isn’t especially helpful without a broader network of data to illuminate causes and effects. Additionally, larger sample sizes are needed to ensure that study results can be generalised to a wider population.A pair of studies published in 2017 and 2018 were the first to report that iniduals with BFRBs have higher rates of sensory over-responsivity to external sensations than the general population. In other words, they respond intensely to things like sounds and textures. The phenomenon – also referred to as sensory integration dysfunction or sensory processing disorder – was first described in the 1970s by the occupational therapist Jean Ayres. Since then, sensory over-responsivity has been most frequently studied in association with autism, and more recently in OCD.One of the studies found that people with trich were twice as likely to have severe to extreme sensory over-responsivity to touch and sound. One participant described her struggle with clothing: “My tactile discomfort lies in how I feel in clothes. They always feel too tight and uncomfortable as soon as I step out of the house. For this reason, I only go out when absolutely necessary – school or work.”In the early 2000s, the psychologist Fred Penzel introduced the stimulus-regulation model of trichotillomania, based on his work with patients. “It would appear that pulling might be an external attempt on the part of a genetically prone inidual to regulate an internal state of sensory imbalance,” he wrote.According to this model, a person with a BFRB is exposed to the same levels of environmental stimulation as others, but their nervous system is unable to easily manage it. “It is as if the person is standing in the centre of a seesaw, or on a high-wire, with over-stimulation on one side, and under-stimulation on the other, and must lean in either direction (by pulling) at different times, to remain balanced,” he wrote.A number of studies have found that some people with BFRBs have difficulty regulating their emotions. A 2013 review notes that as a group, people with BFRBs have higher rates of psychiatric conditions such as depression and anxiety than the general population. In addition, many report that their pulling and picking provides relief from boredom, tension, anxiety and frustration.On a Saturday in April, I attended the 25th annual TLC conference for BFRBs, in San Francisco. The conference is just one of the ways that TLC aims to help people directly. It was attended by around 500 people, including iniduals with BFRBs, their families, clinicians and researchers.One woman who struggles with high-pitched sounds told me: “I used to throw things at my brother, who was just regularly playing. I’d throw books at him because noises were too much.”Haley O’Sullivan started picking her skin at the age of 20, a year after a traumatic sexual experience. “It started with two hours in the mirror picking at ingrown hairs, like on my armpits or my bikini line,” she recalled. “It was also picking at zits on my face and other places on my body.” For several years, O’Sullivan led a support group in Boston, and she is working on starting a group in New Hampshire, where she lives. She was careful to point out that not everyone with a BFRB has experienced trauma. In her case, however, skin-picking is “my body’s way of trying to say, ‘Hey, I’m not OK.’” Skin-picking creates a positive sensation for her in the short term, but “obviously it doesn’t feel good emotionally afterwards when you’re like, ‘Oh man, look at this damage I caused.’”O’Sullivan has seen several therapists and been successfully treated for post-traumatic stress disorder and depression. But she said she feels stuck with BFRBs. She has done a lot of research but lacks access to a specialised clinician. There simply aren’t enough therapists with expertise. Once you find a clinician, they may have a long waiting list, and health insurance might only cover a handful of sessions.Marta Isibor, a graduate student from Scotland, sought help for her own skin-picking disorder in her late 20s. The UK lacks specialist clinics and expert BFRB researchers, said Isibor. After publishing a study on skin-picking disorder as a mature student, Isibor travelled the UK presenting posters at conferences run by the Royal Medical Society and the British Psychological Society, among others. Most of those present had never even heard of BFRBs, she said. It is still a very isolating condition.Currently, the treatment for BFRBs that shows the best results is a type of cognitive behavioural therapy called habit-reversal training, developed in the 1970s as a treatment for tics. During this therapy, a person learns to recognise the context in which pulling or picking is most likely to occur. With this awareness, people can then plan to substitute a competing response. For example, when faced with an urge to pick, someone might instead make a fist, or play with a fidget toy. In some studies, more than half of adults with trich achieve short-term improvement. However, some find it difficult to maintain the results over time.The Florida-based psychologist Omar Rahman recently conducted a promising study of habit-reversal training in children with trich. He says that the goal of the therapy is to give the brain an opportunity to become habituated to the urge, meaning you can ignore it or respond with a substitute behaviour. Over the years, Rahman has come to believe that there is no real way around this if you can’t learn to manage the urge, which may explain why habit-reversal training doesn’t help everyone, or why improvement doesn’t always last.For this reason, researchers and clinicians have increasingly sought to augment habit-reversal training with other means of helping people with their urges. For example, mindfulness-based strategies can help a person observe and accept negative emotions, sensations and urges without needing to act on them by pulling or picking.Christina Pearson stumbled into mindfulness in the early 1990s after a series of therapists and medications were unable to help her. She started paying attention to her sensations, observing her thoughts, feelings and muscle movements.Around this time, the psychologist Charles Mansueto had been seeing BFRB clients and developed the Comprehensive Model for Behavioural Treatment (ComB). This model recognises that a variety of triggers may cause someone to want to pick or pull: thoughts, emotions, sensory experiences, specific body movements (such as stroking one’s hair) and environment. Today, Mansueto and his colleagues are in the process of running a randomised controlled trial to test the approach.Bridget Perez and her 19-year-old daughter Gessie were leading a conference session for parents and children. They were both wearing T-shirts designed by Gessie that said “Trichster” on the front. The room was packed.“We may seem like we have it together now, but we haven’t always,” said Bridget.She recalled one morning when Gessie was 14 and sitting at the table eating breakfast. “I’m standing over her, and I go, ‘Oh my God!’, because there was a huge bald spot in the back of her head.” Over the ensuing years, she went from a “gorgeous long-curly-haired girl to having bald spots, to hiding the bald spots, to the hair thinning out and just kind of hanging. I screamed, I cried. I yelled. I mourned the loss of her hair,” said Bridget.Like many parents, her first response was to want to fix the problem, and so she looked online for information. They attended their first TLC conference several years ago. “I realised it’s not about the hair,” said Bridget. “It’s about being there for your children. Supporting them, loving them, no matter what they look like.”Gessie agreed that the first conference was life-changing. Living with trich had been hard. Even today, she has no eyebrows and keeps her hair short, but she considers herself in recovery, “because trich doesn’t control my life any more”. The pulling comes and goes, but she doesn’t focus on stopping.“For me, cutting my hair, shaving my head, realising that I’m not defined by my appearance was … ”“Was pivotal,” offered her mother.After the first conference, Gessie shared her story on social media. Since then, people from all over the world have reached out to ask questions and offer support.For all the obvious good that the TLC conference does, it can be a difficult experience, especially for first-timers. One mother described her first time attending as overwhelming. “I cried a lot,” she said. “You think you’re going to come and fix it, and then you realise you’re in it for the long haul.”And that long haul is not clearly mapped. Parents may feel torn about how much financial and emotional energy to invest in treatment, or whether to accept the condition and support their child in other ways.These tensions can play out in adults, too. For example, many people with BFRBs say that complete abstinence from picking or pulling is an unhelpful goal that may magnify self-criticism and frustration. Yet one woman spoke positively about her experiences in Hair Pullers Anonymous, a support group that uses the same literature and spiritual tools as Alcoholics Anonymous. In the three months since she joined, she said, “My hair-pulling is down so much – you wouldn’t even believe it.” She has a sponsor she can call if she feels like she wants to pull her hair. And she’s also working on self-care, which is an important part of the TLC Foundation’s message.“Maybe that’s why I’m having success,” she said, “because I’m hitting all these things.”This is an edited version of an article first published by Wellcome on Mosaic, and republished here under a Creative Commons licence.

This would include engagement on arrangements for land border trade. We will provide more information in due course,” the technical notice on trading explains.“If you trade across the land border, you should consider whether you will need advice from the Irish government about preparations you need to make,” it adds.Asked directly about the risks to British citizens living abroad, he said he hoped “cooler heads would prevail”, and allow “practical cooperation” over issues such as access to pensions.“It’s hardly in the interests of southern Spain to do harm to the British pensioners living out there,” he said.He said that after the passing of the EU Withdrawal Act, and with 7,000 civil servants already working on Brexit, and funding in place to hire 9,000 more if they were needed, “our laws will be on the statute book, the staff will be in place, and our institutions will be ready for Brexit, deal or no deal”.The new Brexit secretary, who campaigned vociferously for leave in the 2016 referendum, also sought to play down recent alarming stories about the potential risks of no deal – including the idea that food supplies could be disrupted, or key ingredients no longer available. “You will still be able to enjoy a BLT after Brexit, and there are no plans to deploy the army to ensure food supplies.”On state aid, the rules currently overseen by the EU that limit taxpayer bailouts, the government said it would create a new “UK-wide subsidy control framework”, which would be overseen by Britain’s Competition and Markets Authority.Underlining the reach of the EU in all aspects of regulation, the notices also say that Britain would have to introduce new health warnings on cigarette packets, as the copyright for the existing picture library is owned by the European commission."},{"url":"https://fastly-io.guim.co.uk/img/media/e1e44a5eabf81bcccde90ab075efcdfb7251d0b1/0_58_2784_1670/master/2784.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9d4a55d0965bd7fa2514fa37aa28d565","title":"new brexit referendum should remain on the table says labour","story":"Keir Starmer says nothing should be ruled out if parliament rejects deal with EULabour’s Brexit spokesman has said a second referendum should be “on the table” if parliament is not prepared to accept the final orce deal Theresa May negotiates with Brussels.Sir Keir Starmer said nothing should be ruled out at this stage of Britain’s exit talks, clearly contradicting remarks earlier this week from Barry Gardiner, the shadow international trade secretary.Starmer told the BBC’s Today programme on Thursday he had never accepted that MPs should support the Brexit agreement May brings back from Brussels, “however bad it is”.“I do think there needs to be a democratic check. I don’t think the prime minister can simply decide for herself what the future of this country looks like. I have focused on the vote in parliament, and the meaningful vote,” he said.“If that vote is to reject the article 50 deal, parliament must decide what happens next. In those circumstances, it seems to me, all options should be on the table.“So we’ve not called for a vote on the deal we’ve called for a vote in parliament on the deal. But I accept the proposition that, if it’s voted down, parliament then decides what happens next and in those circumstances, in my experience in the last few years, keep your options on the table, not off the table.”When asked again specifically about a second referendum, Starmer said: “We are not calling for it, but in the event that article 50 is voted down, we think all options should be on the table … That is the Labour party position.”On Tuesday, Gardiner emphasised that a second referendum was not the party’s current policy, and said there could be civil disobedience if an attempt were made to overturn the Brexit vote through another national poll.“If people want to be able to achieve change through democratic means, if they feel that that is being denied to them, they then turn to other, more socially disruptive ways of expressing their views, and that is the danger here,” he said.Starmer dismissed these claims in his interview. “Well, we’ve had lots of ups and downs already on Brexit. I’m sure there are many to come, and I have not seen signs of civil disobedience. So I think we can get through this exercise without that,” he said.The marked difference of opinion emerges at a time when Labour is coming under intense pressure from campaigners to hold a vote on whether to adopt the second referendum policy at its party conference in September.Labour activists are preparing contemporary resolutions in the hope they will be passed by constituency parties and put forward to conference for debate. Labour policy at the moment is that the party does not want a second referendum and is not calling for one."},{"url":"https://fastly-io.guim.co.uk/img/media/ea8c3c5f555c034d33ef75fc7c52156b2a74e765/926_383_2258_1355/master/2258.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0fde6a4c57e13d0a7bb0d24942c7b78f","title":"brexit no deal papers dominic raab prepares to publish no deal planning papers politics live","story":"Rolling coverage of the publication of the first batch of government planning papers for a no deal Brexit, and the accompanying speech from Dominic Raab, the Brexit secretaryThe Scottish and Welsh governments have both said the papers published today by the UK government fail to address the problems a no deal Brexit would pose.Mike Russell, constitutional relations secretary in the SNP-run Scottish government, said the UK was facing a “no deal nightmare” after Dominic Raab published the first tranche of technical notices on the impact of a no deal Brexit. Russell said the documents “lay bare” the risks to businesses and public services of a no deal outcome. He said:From the bureaucratic burden that will be imposed on EU imports and exports to the need to strike a wide range of ‘no deal’ deals before the end of March, these notices only add to the uncertainty surrounding Brexit.People want to know if their medication will still be available and farmers and fishermen want to know if they will still be able to sell their products.While a responsible government must prepare for all exit possibilities, the UK government should rule out a disastrous ‘no deal’ and focus instead on securing the best outcome for us all – which, short of staying in the EU, is remaining part of the single market and customs union.And Carwyn Jones, the Labour Welsh first minister, said in a statement:The writing is on the wall. ‘No deal’ would be a catastrophic failure of the UK government that would cause huge disruption and serious, long-lasting economic and social damage to all parts of the UK.It is hugely frustrating, because if the UK government had adopted the blueprint to negotiations we set out over 18 months ago, they could have made substantial progress on the future partnership with the EU. They also could have avoided the situation we face today where our biggest employers are considering leaving the UK with the loss of thousands of jobs causing disruption to our economy, our universities are at risk of losing out on vital research and our hospitals are warning of staff shortages putting patients at risk.‘No deal’ is not an option and the UK government’s bluff is fooling no-one. It is time the prime minister dropped the poker face and worked constructively with the EU-27 to secure a Brexit deal that protects our citizens, services and economy.Matt Hancock, the health secretary, has published an open letter (pdf) he has written to NHS organisations about the no deal Brexit planning.He says drug companies will be asked to stockpile medicines to prepare for the possibility of a no deal Brexit.Today the government has set out a new scheme to ensure a sufficient and seamless supply of medicines in the UK in the event of a ‘no deal’ Brexit. In the unlikely event we leave the EU without a deal in March 2019, based on the current cross government planning scenario we will ensure the UK has an additional six weeks supply of medicines in case imports from the EU through certain routes are affected. This is the current planning assumption but will of course be subject to revision in light of future developments. Under the medicines scheme, pharmaceutical companies should ensure therefore they have an additional six weeks supply of medicines in the UK on top of their own normal stock levels. The scheme also includes separate arrangements for the air freight of medicines with short shelf-lives, such as medical radioisotopes. The government is working closely with companies who provide medicines in the UK to ensure patients continue to get the medicines they need. I am today also writing to pharmaceutical companies with more details.Interestingly, Hancock also says he does not want hospitals, GPs and patients to start stockpiling drugs themselves. He specifically tells them not to do this, warning that they will face investigation if they disobey.Hospitals, GPs and community pharmacies throughout the UK do not need to take any steps to stockpile additional medicines, beyond their business as usual stock levels. There is also no need for clinicians to write longer NHS prescriptions. Local stockpiling is not necessary and any incidences involving the over ordering of medicines will be investigated and followed up with the relevant chief or responsible pharmacist directly. Clinicians should advise patients that the government has plans in place to ensure a continued supply of medicines to patients from the moment we leave the EU. Patients will not need to and should not seek to store additional medicines at home.(This is faintly reminiscent of a warning against the old wartime vice of “hoarding”, something that once got Margaret Thatcher into trouble in the 1970s.)UK citizens living in Europe face the possibility of losing access to their pension income and other financial services, according to technical papers on no-deal Brexit preparations, the Press Association reports. Lending and deposit services, insurance and annuities - which people rely on for a regular pension income - are among the financial products which expats could struggle to access, it has been suggested.A no deal planning document says:In the absence of action from the EU, EEA-based customers of UK firms currently passporting into the EEA, including UK citizens living in the EEA, may lose the ability to access existing lending and deposit services, insurance contracts (such as life insurance contracts and annuities) due to UK firms losing their rights to passport into the EEA.As the Press Association reports, the documents say the government has committed to putting unilateral action in place if necessary to resolve issues as far as possible on the UK side. For UK-based customers who access banking, insurance, investment funds and other financial services with EEA firms currently passporting into the UK, temporary permissions will enable these firms to continue to provide these services to UK customers for up to three years after exit - allowing firms time to apply for authorisation to continue operating in the UK, the documents said. New medicines will need UK approval before they can be made available to patients in the event of a no-deal Brexit, the Press Associaton reports. The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), which regulates drugs in the UK, will take on the functions of the EU if an agreement is not reached by March 29. Products will have to go through national assessment before they receive market authorisation to be sold in the UK, according to a technical paper on no-deal Brexit preparations.After EU exit, to market a product in the UK, an initial market authorisation application will need to be submitted to the MHRA and will go through a national assessment. MHRA will take a streamlined approach to approving UK market authorisation applications that places no greater burden on industry and ensures that patients can access new and innovative medicines at the same time as EU patients.Most new medicines currently come to the market through a licensing route overseen by the European Medicines Agency (EMA). However, as the Press Association reports, if a deal is not reached, the UK’s current participation in the European regulatory network including centralised routes will cease, according to the guidance. The outcome of EU procedures that have not reached the decision phase when the UK leaves the EU will not be valid, it adds. “However, the MHRA will take EU decisions into account where possible,” the paper states. Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, says Dominic Raab’s speech today, and the papers that have been published, show the government is not prepared for a no deal Brexit. In a statement Starmer said:Dominic Raab’s speech exposes the reality that this government is simply not prepared for a no deal scenario.The speech was thin on detail, thin on substance and provided no answers to how ministers intend to mitigate the serious consequences of leaving the EU without an agreement. We are eight weeks out from the deadline for reaching an agreement. Ministers should be getting on the job of negotiating a Brexit deal that works for Britain, not publishing vague documents that will convince no one.A no deal Brexit has never been viable and would represent a complete failure of the government’s negotiating strategy.And Sky’s Lewis Goodall has posted a good thread on Twitter with some of the highlights from the papers. This is from my colleague Heather Stewart, who has been looking at the Brexit no deal planning papers.The no deal planning papers are now here, on the Brexit department’s website.Here is an overview from the Brexit department explaining what the government is doing.And here is the full text of Dominic Raab’s speech.More than 300,000 pensioners who have moved overseas could be hit in the pocket in the event of no deal. Almost 200,000 pensioners have retired abroad are in receipt of a British pension and reciprocal health care.Another 135,000 British pensions are currently paid to Irish citizens who live in the republic, many of them who worked in Northern Ireland but lived south of the border secure in the knowledge pensions were mobile under EU law. Dominic Raab, the Brexit secretary, admitted that these are at risk but said he was confident there bilateral deals could be struck with EU member states who would also have a vested interest to protect their citizens living in the UK on EU pensions. “I would have thought that would be a practical issue we can resolve,” Raab told reporters after his speech on no deal planning. The government revealed last year that there 190,000 UK insured pensioners with reciprocal health care arrangements, by which HMRC reimburses Spanish, French and other health services for treatments received by Britons retired abroad. This included 70,000 in Spain, 44,000 in Ireland, 43,000 in France and 12,000 in Cyprus.Earlier this month the Irish government said there was “broad agreement” with the UK to “maintain the status quo” in terms of payments to the holders of UK pensions in Ireland. The Brexit department (officially DExEU - the Department for Exiting the European Union) is meant to be posting the no deal planning documents on its website, but they are not there yet.Raab has been talking about there being 25 papers coming out today, but in fact there are 24.My colleague Heather Stewart has been reading the no deal planning papers on an embargoed basis. The embargo has just been lifted, and she has filed a first take story. Here it is.And this is how it starts.Consumers would face slower and more costly credit card payments when they buy EU products, and British citizens living abroad could lose access to their bank accounts, in the event of a no-deal Brexit, the government has warned.The Brexit secretary, Dominic Raab, insisted he was “confident that a good deal is in our sights”, as he launched 24 “technical notices” in Westminster on Thursday morning, telling businesses and the public how to prepare if no deal is reached.He insisted the government’s priority was to ensure continuity. But the 24 technical notices – the first batch of more than 80 due over the summer – underline the potential impact on daily life, if Britain leaves without a deal in place in March next year.With UK banks likely to lose access to EU payments systems, the financial services paper warns that, “customers (including business using these providers to process euro payments) could face increased costs and slower processing times for Euro transactions”.It added: “The cost of card payments between the UK and EU will likely increase.”Q: What should iniduals do to prepare for a no deal?Raab says, for iniduals, there will not be much change at all. There is not much for them to do. He says it is businesses that will have to make plans.Raab says it would be in the interests of the EU to come up with arrangements that would satisfy their nationals too.Q: When will all these technical notices be published?Raab says 25 are being published today. That is roughly a third of the total. More will be published in coming weeks. He would expect them all to be published by the end of September.Q: You promised people that Brexit would free them from red tape. But don’t these papers propose a red tape bonanza? And is it right that Britons living in the EU could lose their pensions?Raab says the government is giving practical advice to firms. That is what it does in relation to other export markets too.On citizens’ rights, he says he wants to provide as much reassurance to Britons living abroad as possible.Q: But you cannot guarantee they will still get their pensions?Raab says the questioner is right to say that, in the event of there being no deal, there will be a change. But EU nationals living in the UK would be affected too. He says he thinks there would be a practical solution.Q: Do you accept that a no deal Brexit would leave the UK worse off, and by how much? And you are asking Brussels to back off from red lines.

As a result he is set to feature in Gloucester’s pre-season fixture against the Dragons and will be free to start the Premiership campaign with his new club.He will also be available for selection for England’s next training camp in late September – provided Eddie Jones chooses to pick him – as well as the autumn internationals. Cipriani, who contested the charge, will therefore be mightily relieved, having made only his first England start for 10 years in June while the RFU – criticised by both Gloucester and the players’ union for intervening – emerges with little credit.The three-man disciplinary panel ultimately decided that no further action was warranted after Cipriani was fined £2,000 and given 10 hours’ community service by Gloucester on Monday, on top of the £2,000 fine he was given by Jersey magistrates court last week following convictions for common assault and resisting arrest at a nightclub incident in Jersey.“Danny Cipriani is expected to behave in line with the core values of the game which include respect and discipline,” said Gareth Graham, who chaired the panel. “Those core values are not empty words or slogans as the panel were reminded during the hearing. Mr Cipriani is a role model and by committing an act of common assault and by resisting arrest, the panel find his actions are prejudicial to the interests of the game.”The decision should bring an end to a sorry episode and the drawn-out row that followed the RFU’s decision to charge Cipriani last Friday with the governing body facing fierce criticism from both Gloucester and the Rugby Players’ Association. Both Gloucester and the RPA felt the RFU was guilty of “singling out” Cipriani and bowing to public pressure but the governing body insisted there was a case to answer. The panel supported the RFU’s decision to charge Cipriani, insisting it was “appropriate”, but the fact that no further sanction was imposed raises the question of why Cipriani was in the dock on Wednesday night, having already been disciplined both in court and by his club.Graham added: “The panel do not agree that this is a ‘minor’ incident or ‘trivial’ and, whilst they endorse the actions of Gloucester in fining Mr Cipriani and ordering that he complete 10 hours of work in the community, find that the decision of the RFU to bring a charge was appropriate.”Gloucester released a statement shortly after the verdict was announced in which the club’s chief executive, Stephen Vaughan, said: “Whilst disappointed at the verdict this evening, we accept the decision of the panel, particularly concerning the way Gloucester have handled the matter. We believe that the panel’s decision not to impose any additional penalty endorses our approach. We now look forward to the start of the season and putting this incident behind us.”James Haskell, a former Wasps team-mate and another England international who enjoys a high profile, believes Cipriani was the victim of “trial by social media” and that he was “thrown under a bus” by a number of former players and coaches who voiced their disapproval. The former England coach Sir Clive Woodward was among those to speak out, claiming Cipriani’s England career should be brought to a end.Haskell also feels that modern day rugby players are under greater public scrutiny than ever. He added. “You’ve just got to be whiter than white and don’t put yourself in those positions. It is unfortunate that when you have a profile, everything is multiplied by one million.”"},{"url":"https://fastly-io.guim.co.uk/img/media/c6c0568dcc8ca51cf752b360ed0ba1e54d67ce2e/0_105_4219_2531/master/4219.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=49956b84a96200f1b9cac324540cb15e","title":"england test squad james vince recalled","story":"• Hampshire captain to act as cover for Jonny Bairstow• Jos Buttler to keep wicket against India at Rose BowlJames Vince has been recalled to England’s squad as cover for Jonny Bairstow, with Essex’s Jamie Porter omitted for the fourth Test against India.Vince – who played the last of his 13 Tests against New Zealand in March – averages 56 in Division One this summer and made scores of 74 and 147 for Hampshire in their win against Nottinghamshire at the Ageas Bowl this week.

Laurens, on the other hand, won her Classic over an extended 10 furlongs and will be stepping up to a mile-and-a-half for the first time today. Her pedigree offers some mixed messages about whether she will be as effective at this trip, as Siyouni, her sire, tends to produce milers such as Ervedya and Spectre while her dam, Recambe, was a winner from 10 to 14 furlongs.The way she goes about the business of racing, though, suggests that Laurens (3.35) has as much class as any runner in the race and also that it will take a very good filly to get past her in the closing stages, even if her stamina is beginning to peter out. The odds – 11-8 versus 7-2 – implies that Sea Of Class has twice the chance of Karl Burke’s runner but they are more closely matched than that and 7-2 is a price worth taking. The Lowther Stakes could well amount to a match between Fairyland and Angel’s Hideaway (1.55) and John Gosden’s filly is marginally preferred at the likely odds. She was a comfortable winner of a strong race at Ascot last time and that form gives her the edge over her main rival as Aidan O’Brien’s string is still feeling its way back to peak form. The huge prize for Goffs UK Premier Yearling Stakes always guarantees a big field, but there is usually a wide range of ability involved too and it may not be as competitive as the numbers imply. He’zanarab will be popular with Ryan Moore booked and Richard Hannon going for a hat-trick of wins, but his form does not justify his price and Celebrity Dancer (2.25) makes more appeal at around 14-1. Kevin Ryan’s gelding is improving steadily, his trainer has won this race twice since 2011 and Celebrity Dancer was a ready winner in a strong time at Ayr last month.Several of the runners in the Clipper Logistics Handicap lined up for the Unibet Golden Mile at Goodwood earlier this month, when Seniority enjoyed a smooth run to victory under Ryan Moore. The Queen’s gelding headed the market overnight but he was scratched on Thursday morning and several of the runners who suffered a more difficult passage than the winner at Goodwood are now jostling at the head of the market.These include Firmament (3.00), a half-length winner of this race off a mark of 96 in 2016, who found trouble at a vital moment down in Sussex and is just 2lb higher than for his success two years ago."},{"url":"https://fastly-io.guim.co.uk/img/media/f4bc102181c348f8d6c5473f23c09c2367915a1b/0_125_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=696cbe0e263bc8012c18e97b8d1bf090","title":"elon musk 120 hour working week tesla","story":"The Silicon Valley drive for corporate efficiency – all 247 schedules, bulletproof coffees and five-minute meetings – has long been lauded. Now the wheels are flying offLast week, an emotional Elon Musk described how he was working so hard to keep production of the Tesla Model 3 on track that he missed his own birthday. “All night – no friends, nothing,” he told the New York Times, apparently “struggling to get the words out”. Musk had, he said, been working 120-hour weeks, often not leaving the factory for three or four days. When he did get home, he said, the choice was between no sleep or taking an Ambien, an insomnia drug intended for short-term use (and blamed by some of Tesla’s board members for his erratic night-time tweeting).Musk has long been celebrated by the business press for his work ethic. His extraordinary schedule – a long working day broken into five-minute increments, so that every second is accounted for (lunch is usually wolfed down in a meeting) – has been reported, approvingly, for some years now. And certainly, Musk has more on his plate than many chief executives. As well as running Tesla, the first mass-market car company to be founded in the US in decades, he is the head of SpaceX, which aims to fly people to Mars, and Neuralink, a company attempting to build a brain-computer interface.The only reason he is not even more busy is because he resigned from the board of OpenAI, a non-profit founded to create “safe artificial general intelligence”, when he decided there was a conflict of interest with Tesla’s own AI projects and because he is no longer the chairman of his cousins’ solar panel company, Solar City, since Tesla bought it wholesale in 2016.He also has six children.Historically, the boss who dedicates his life – every second of it – to corporate success has been an icon of the US boardroom, nowhere more so than in Silicon Valley. Tech bosses have typically combined the pressure of being an executive managing millions with the optimise-everything mentality of a typical engineer, while the straight-out-of-college age of many first-time entrepreneurs is a perfect storm for a level of dedication to workplace productivity that verges on the dangerous. Not just dinners at the office and a sleeping bag under the desk, but 5am starts after an hour at the gym, breakfast replaced by “bulletproof coffee” (coffee with butter in it, but apparently healthy) and interspersed with spells of “intermittent fasting”. Then there is the tendency to take client calls while in the check-in queue for your third international flight in as many days. Could Musk’s tearful disclosure be the moment all that changes?Arianna Huffington, another multimillionaire with her fingers in multiple pies, led the reaction to his interview, with an open letter on her Thrive Global website imploring Musk to “give yourself time to reconnect not just with those you love but also with yourself and your wisdom”.“This is not about working hard,” Huffington wrote. “It’s about working in a way that allows you to make your best decisions. Working 120-hour weeks doesn’t leverage your unique qualities, it wastes them. You can’t simply power through – that’s just not how our bodies and our brains work. Nobody knows better than you that we can’t get to Mars by ignoring the laws of physics. Nor can we get where we want to go by ignoring scientific laws in our daily lives.”Musk was having none of it. In a tweet sent at 2:30am, he told her “Ford \u0026amp Tesla are the only 2 American car companies to avoid bankruptcy. I just got home from the factory. You think this is an option. It is not.”On Monday, Huffington responded, telling CNN that “This is not about sleep, or about slowing down, or about asking Elon to chill out under a mango tree … It’s about how we can unlock and sustain our peak performance, and see solutions and opportunities where others can’t.”Everything we know about a healthy working life supports Huffington, says André Spicer, professor of organisational behaviour at the Cass Business School in London. “There’s lots of evidence that having no boundaries between work and life, and allowing work to infest your whole life, can be very damaging for productivity.”Forthcoming research from Spicer’s colleague Hans Frankort, for example, shows that greater work effort – measured in both time and intensity – not only leads to reduced wellbeing (as even Musk may agree), but also worse career outcomes. In fact, intensity, measured by whether people described their job as requiring working at “very high speed” or to “tight deadlines”, was an even stronger predictor of bad outcomes than whether or not employees had to work overtime.Frankort and his co-author Argyro Avgoustaki call for “genuine consideration” of initiatives to reduce exposure to intensive work, but acknowledge that it will “take time to unfold and may encounter resistance”.Silicon Valley has long been one of the leading exporters of the unending work day. The technology sector is, of course, responsible for the tools that people have used, firstly to bring work home, then on holiday and, eventually, everywhere: the networks, laptops and smartphones that mean that leaving the workplace no longer means leaving work.It has also been pioneering an approach to workplace design that encourages a round-the-clock schedule. With free breakfasts, lunches and dinners, on-campus gyms and running tracks and rec rooms filled with games and toys, it is easy to see why some tech workers spend every waking hour somewhere in the office.And, increasingly, their sleeping hours, too. Google and Facebook have both proposed building “self-contained towns” near their main campuses in the Bay Area, slotting hundreds of apartments into the companies’ already sprawling complexes. It is not a huge stretch, really, when you consider the employees who are already taking their home to work, including the Google employee, Brandon, who was revealed, in 2015, to be living in a van in the office’s car park.Other typical Silicon Valley perks take on a similarly dark tinge when they are considered more closely. Policies that allow employees to take unlimited holidays, for instance, sound great. But, according to Sage Business Review, “instead of taking too many days, most committed employees don’t take enough”. The problem is so bad that some places that offer unlimited holidays have had to introduce a second minimum-vacation policy to prevent employee burnout, as staff, unsure of how much time off was the “right” amount, opted to just take none at all. (The prospect of unlimited holidays is one of the more isive offers among British workers, with broadly equal numbers of supporters on each side, according to the intelligence platform Streetbees.)The recent, highly accelerated commitment to work and efficiency can reach levels that even some Silicon Valley types see is A Bit Much. In 2013, for instance, the meal-replacement kit Soylent was launched by software engineer Rob Rhinehart, after he “began to resent the fact that he had to eat food at all”. Rhinehart – with no previous nutritional experience – mixed together a bunch of off-the-shelf nutrients ordered online, and created a 400-calorie slurry that, he hoped, would provide everything he needed to live.Five years on, Soylent no longer advertises itself as a complete replacement for food (“Keep in mind that, while Soylent can replace any meal, it is not intended to replace every meal,” the company tells customers), but it has been popular enough to raise almost $75m (£58m) in funding from venture capitalists and attract competitors in the market such as UK-based Huel).Rhinehart’s dedication to efficiency in other areas of his life hasn’t achieved quite as much take-up, however. In 2015, he wrote about how he gave up a mains connection, instead trying to live entirely from solar cells. A noble goal, achieved through some unconventional methods: “I enjoy doing laundry about as much as doing dishes,” he wrote. “I get my clothing custom-made in China for prices you would not believe and have new ones regularly shipped to me. Shipping is a problem. I wish container ships had nuclear engines but it’s still much more efficient and convenient than retail. Thanks to synthetic fabrics, it takes less water to make my clothes than it would to wash them, and I donate my used garments.”But while they still have their fans, Rhinehart and Musk’s unflinching dedication to work is increasingly viewed as an unhealthy reflection of a past Silicon Valley would rather forget. As a generation of dotcom founders have grown up, and looked back at their careers, they have realised that maybe they didn’t quite get the balance right – and are determined that the next generation doesn’t repeat their mistakes.“When my children were young, I thought what I was doing at work was far more important and urgent than what was going on at home,” Scott Weiss, a serial entrepreneur and early partner at influential venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, wrote in 2015. Later, he said: “I realised that committing to my family required disconnecting from work (eg turning off the computer and phone), and focusing all of my attention on the details of the home. Cooking a great meal. Helping with a science project. Discussing the future with my partner.“I’ve observed that CEOs in their 20s may be fully equipped and knowledgeable enough to handle leading a company, but when their family life begins to expand and demand for their attention increases, they are at a loss as to why things aren’t just falling into place … Still, I’m hopeful.”Driving down Sand Hill Road, the centre of Silicon Valley’s venture capital industry, last weekend, a friend who moved to the area recently remarked on the emptiness of the parking lots. “I thought they were supposed to be at work 247,” he said, “but the cars are all gone by 5pm, and at the weekends.”Spicer agrees that change is afoot. “If you look at the TED talk universe, and what you find in the Harvard Business Review – the kind of things that managers read – there’s a lot of talk now about how to get sleep, how to protect worklife balance, how to make sure that you have some boundaries around work, how to be mindful,” he says. “And all these things are about saying there’s a boundary between work and life. Work shouldn’t be everything for you, and sleeping in the factory isn’t the best thing to do.”But while you can take the engineer out of the workplace, you can’t stop them being an engineer, and there is a risk that worklife balance becomes just another thing to optimise for peak performance.“If you look in the Silicon Valley culture – and this also extends to many corporations,” says Spicer, “executives there are not just obsessed with making their work more productive, but with making their whole life more productive. So they spend a huge amount of time thinking and talking and engaging with these questions about how do you eat in the most efficient way, how do you exercise in the most efficient way, how do you take all these little parts of your life and make them more efficient?”Nonetheless, even that would be an improvement on the status quo. Spicer argues for a few key changes that would help society, and companies, restore a healthy balance (and, yes, improve productivity). One way would be to ensure enforced time off by mandating holidays and banning out-of-hours email use. Another would be the separation of the core intensive, creative work that many office workers struggle to find time for from the more rote administrative tasks that balloon to fill the rest of the working day.For Musk, all the advice being proffered his way may still be too late. As he struggles to bring Tesla’s finances into shape – and fulfil a claim that he had “secured funding” to take the company private at $420 a share – he told the New York Times that, “from a personal pain standpoint, the worst is yet to come”."},{"url":"https://fastly-io.guim.co.uk/img/media/6fcb3a070453588adbd50237e204fb49c4f47416/157_791_4702_2821/master/4702.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ad74753a94465bd14a6def14d909bcd8","title":"how can i switch from hotmail to gmail","story":"After using Hotmail for 20 years, our reader’s friends say she should switch to Gmail. Is it worth it?I’ve used Hotmail from the late 90s. All my friends and family use Gmail and I feel like a dinosaur with clunky old Hotmail. Apart from looking like I’ve finally entered the 21st century, what are the benefits of switching from Hotmail to Gmail? And, given everyone I’ve ever known has my Hotmail address, and I have so many old emails in my Hotmail inbox, how on earth could I switch? TI was one of Gmail’s first public users in 2004 and spent a decade recommending Hotmail users to switch. I almost switched back in 2013, but both services have changed a lot since then. I now think you should have both services, with one acting as a backup, though you could also back up to Yahoo.Ideally, you should use your own domain name for your main address. Unfortunately, neither Hotmail nor Gmail provides that feature free, though to some extent you can fake it with an alias. See below ….Today, I can at least guarantee that you are not using Hotmail. Microsoft closed that service years ago, and all Hotmail users are using its current service at Outlook. Technically, Outlook is newer than Gmail, though both services are updated all too frequently.You are, of course, still using a Hotmail address. However, if you switched to using a new Outlook address, you would still be using exactly the same email service. In fact, the simplest way to remove the Hotmail “stigma” would be to add an Outlook address and use both from the same mailbox.To do this, log into Hotmail and then paste https:account.liveAddAssocId into the address bar. (You can get to it via the full Settings page, Email, Sync email etc but it’s complicated.) Create an alias in the form myname@outlook, and set this as your primary email address.You can now use the same inbox to send emails from both your old Hotmail and your new Outlook addresses, and switch between them.If you email everyone from your Outlook address, most people will start using it eventually. However, anything sent to your Hotmail address will still arrive in the same inbox, so it doesn’t really matter. Microsoft has supported Hotmail addresses since it bought the service in 1997, and I don’t expect it will ever stop supporting them.Note that you can also add aliases for any of your old email addresses. This might be handy if you have one you rarely use. Set it to forward all incoming emails to your HotmailOutlook inbox and reply from there.In the beginning, Gmail had several significant advantages over Hotmail. The main one was that it offered 500 times as much storage: 1GB! Gmail also had much better search and spam blocking, and it worked like an app rather than an HTML web page. (HoTMaiL got its name from HTML.) This made Gmail faster and more responsive.Many iterations later, the two services are much closer. I like the fact that you can set up Outlook to work much like Outlook, the email program from Microsoft Office. Outlook still has folders instead of Gmail’s labels. Outlook even has the edge in offering more storage. Both services now provide 15GB. However, Outlook’s email storage is in addition to the free 5GB you get with OneDrive, whereas Gmail shares its 15GB with Google Drive.At the moment, I prefer Gmail. It’s still faster its search and spam-blocking still work better. Most importantly, Gmail still paginates emails, which means I can easily skip from the second page of search results to p500 (emails 24,951-25,000). This is useful when you have 250,000 or more emails . You’ll never scroll back to 2004.If you want to switch from Hotmail to Gmail, or vice versa, then you have to open a new account. The hardest part is finding a usable email address that has not already been taken, though it helps to have an unusual name. In your new Gmail account, go to Configure Inbox in Settings (the cogwheel icon) and click the tab for Accounts and Import. This lets you import all the emails from your old Yahoo, Hotmail, AOL or other address.Google uses an external service called ShuttleCloud to do this. It can take a few days or, in my case, more than a week.Once you have all your emails in Gmail, set the old address to forward incoming emails to your Gmail inbox.In Hotmail, go to the full Settings page, select Email and then Forwarding, and click the radio button next to “Start forwarding”. Next, go to “Forward my emails to:” and enter your new email address. Also tick the box that says “Keep a copy of forwarded messages” so that you can answer emails from either Gmail or Hotmail. In fact, you can add your Gmail address as a Hotmail alias, and add your Hotmail address as a Gmail alias.Now you have a backup of all your emails online, and if you get locked out of one mailbox, you can use the other.Although it’s easy to get Gmail to fetch all your email from another service, this is not without problems. The main one for me was deleting thousands of emails to get inside Gmail’s storage limit. This is also not very practical because you start with a full mailbox.Gmail makes a complete mess of tagging the incoming mail, and happily puts thousands of emails that you have filed away in folders – a good sign that you want to keep them – into the spam box. Not all of them, of course, just enough to be really annoying.You also end up with long labels. First, every email gets tagged with the full email address of the old mailbox, which might be quite long (eg WolfgangAmadeusMozart@Yahoo). Gmail doesn’t do folders or sub-folders, so it adds labels for the old folder names. That doesn’t leave much room for subject lines, so you may want to delete the email address label.If you want to open a new mailbox to provide an online backup, it would be better to use Yahoo Mail, which is now owned by Verizon’s Oath ision. Oath Inc also owns AOL, Tumblr, the Huffington Post, Weblogs and various other things.One solution to the email address problem is to register your own domain. That way you can keep the same address for ever, as long as you remember to keep paying for it. If you owned, for example, mydomain then you could use myname@mydomain as your email address with any email service that will host it. If you don’t like the service, or it shuts down, you can switch to a different service.There are three problems. First, domain names cost money. Second, it requires setting up. Third, Gmail and Outlook won’t host personal domain names as part of their free services. The only one that does, as far as I know, is Zoho. However, that only provides 5GB of storage and is web only: you can’t use a mail client such as Microsoft Outlook or Thunderbird.Microsoft only supports personal domain names with Office 365 business accounts, so your best bet would be to sign up for Google’s G Suite. Prices start at £3.30 per month for 30GB of email storage, no adverts and, Google claims, “247 support”. Zoho Workplace offers the same features for $3 per month.Have you got a question?

I love strolling out early in the morning along Huntington Beach Pier, when the marine layer mist lingers, making everything seem mystical. All you can see are the silhouettes of hundreds of surfers, sitting, waiting for a wave. Watch them as you stroll along the 1,850ft-long pier, then head to Ruby’s, a 1940s-style diner at the end of the pier. Head upstairs and sit by a window looking out to the Pacific, to watch the dolphins and the mist slowly lift, drinking bottomless coffee and eating delicious pancake stacks.Maddy Miller, LondonThe island of Usedom, shared between Germany and Poland in the Baltic Sea, is a fantastic place to cycle. One of our rides covered the five-mile promenade linking the three imperial spa villages of Bansin, Ahlbeck and Heringsdorf. The last of these has an impressive pier (a relatively modern structure of glass and steel, replacing the original wooden one constructed in 1891, which was then the longest in continental Europe). We enjoyed its shell and coral museum, and ate in the space age-looking restaurant at the far end. You can rent holiday apartments on the pier, and Heringsdorf has fine golden sands – a lovely resort.Kevin, Ilkley“The most beautiful pier in England” according to John Betjeman, and England’s only surviving Grade I-listed example, Clevedon pier is a gem. There’s a lovely tea shop at the end and a superb new restaurant that during the day offers delicious picnic-style food to eat on the pier, and at night becomes a classy food venue specialising in fish dishes. The Bristol Channel has the second-highest tidal range in the world, and watching the tide sweep in and out can be spectacular. You can spend a pleasant hour or so reading the moving and often funny memorial plaques. The paddle steamer Waverley is an occasional visitor.Russell Richards, ClevedonAfter two days’ walking around Gdansk in northern Poland weheaded towards the coast on a 15-minute train journey to Sopot. Sopot is home to Europe’s longest wooden pier. It is over 500 metres long and is dotted with classically trained buskers. As you walk out over the sea and turn to look back at the beautiful Polish coastline, you’ll see an art-deco hotel and cafes. Try it at sunset. too.Ollie, LisburnWhat Umhlanga Pier on South Africa’s east coast lacks in length, it more than makes up for in dramatic beauty. The whalebone archway makes for unforgettable photographs as you stroll along it, perhaps to watch sunset over the Indian Ocean. It hides a clever engineering project too: it’s an extension of an underground culvert that helps disperse storm water and has radically improved water quality in this tourist spot near Durban. There’s lots to do in Umhlanga, from watersports to fine dining, but the pier has to be the resort’s most iconic land-cum-water mark, especially when lit up at night.Moira, South WalesThe most unexpected part of my visit to the Netherlands. Extending 400m over a wide strip of golden sand and flanked by beach cafes, a wide promenade and great shopping, the pier is home to a zipline, a ferris wheel and a bungee jump. If you prefer things a little more sedate, there are cafes and shops to browse. Festivals, cultural events, markets, kids’ afternoons, educational activities and musical performances are offered throughout the year. And if you want to make a night of it, stay in one of the beautiful suites, at the end of the pier, where you’re guaranteed a sea view and a great night’s sleep listening to the waves whispering up the beach.Deborah Gilbody, RushdenThis newly refurbished pier is a gem. It looks like any other harbour pier on first inspection, well used by cyclists, strollers, sunbathers and people fishing. Recently it has undergone restoration so that you can now explore its tunnel, hidden within the pier itself, which runs to the lighthouse at the end. Where else do you get to go inside a pier structure? The views from the lighthouse are superb. And there is excellent fish and chips at the entrance to the pier.• Entry to pier is free, tours of tunnel and lighthouse £6pp, rokerpierAnya Chapman, BournemouthReaching 1.8km into Geographe Bay in the far south-west of WA, three hours from Perth and close to the Margaret River wine region, Busselton Jetty is over 150 years old. Built on wooden piles, it was a major trading point for European settlers, servicing over 5,000 vessels during its working life. Now you can walk, or ride the miniature railway, to the underwater observatory at its farthest point. A day ticket is $4, which allows you to walk the jetty, and e, fish or swim from it the miniature railway and observatory cost extra. Better still, the jetty is open 24 hours and is free in the evenings and early mornings.• busseltonjetty.auGraham Sheath, YorkAt weekends, Bangkokians drive 90 minutes south to Hua Hin, not just for the beach and sea but to eat freshly caught fish at what are known as the squid piers. These are wonderfully constructed long wooden jetties over the sea, lined with open-air restaurants serving reasonably priced dishes. I’d recommend La Terrasse, Chao Lay and Mee Karuna.Helen Jackson, LondonThis idyllic pier is freely accessible from the beach and was a favourite fishing spot of Ernest Hemingway.

The crane stopped 20 metres above the ground and the child was helped on to a metal seat on the side of a towering float topped with a crown and a cross. There she perched, a human decoration shining in the August heat, held in place just by a bar around her waist. The crane slowly descended to pick up another child.An hour-and-a-half later, the three-tier float was adorned with about 20 children. Smiling and squinting into the sun, they seemed to have the patience of the saints they were dressed to resemble. Well, most of them did. One of the youngest burst into tears midway up and was swiftly returned to his mother. Speeches and blessings followed, until at last the contraption was ready to be paraded around the town. A group of men grabbeda rope each, the tower lurched and swayed a little then began to move forward.Messina, at the north-eastern tip of Sicily, and Randazzo, just north of Etna, are the only two towns on the island to celebrate the Feast of the Assumption in this way: with a three-tier float covered in blue satin and mirrors, representing the stages of Mary’s ascent to heaven. The tower is the highlight for the children, for whom it is an honour to be chosen, but also for visitors who happen upon this summer spectacle. It is accompanied by marching bands and a carnival atmosphere, with great clouds of helium balloons on sale, throngs of mostly Italian tourists and local residents throwing sweets at the children from their balconies.We heard about the festival in Randazzo only because we were staying nearby and our guesthouse owner recommended it.This year the Randazzo procession – or La Vara as it’s known – was postponed because of storms and giant hailstones. It will take place instead on Saturday 25 August.There were no storms last year, just sunshine and blue skies. Once the Vara was under way, we ran ahead of it and ducked into Il Brillo Parlante on Via Umberto, a deli-bar whose owner let us stand on his doorstep to watch the parade pass by, making sure our son could see the action. With the pound floundering against the euro, Il Brillo’s €1 beers and €2 glasses of wine were a bonus.Our base on the island was Il Tanaceto, a 150-year-old farmhouse with a pool and simple white-washed rooms. Owner Mariolina serves meals cooked by her husband Saro and also dishes out tips on this little-visited corner of the island. After a road and ferry trip from Scilla on the mainland (a picturesque village where former fishermen’s houses sit on the edge of the gin-clear water), it was a treat to tuck into a typical Sicilian dinner of aubergines cooked with pine nuts, raisins and mint – much of the island’s cuisine combines local produce with Arabic influences.While Etna itself is touted as a must-see attraction, most of its visitors seem to be on day trips from resorts such as glitzy Taormina or the port city of Catania, just south of the volcano. The stark foothillsof Europe’s largest volcano remain largely empty. There was another British family at Il Tanaceto – with, luckily for us, children the same age as our son (7) – but otherwise we saw barely another Brit on our forays from the guesthouse.We headed first to the nearest town, the classic hilltop settlement of Castiglione di Sicilia, a 10-minute drive away with its red-roofed houses and medieval churches appearing to tumble down the slopes. There we discovered deli-cum-wine-shop Vitis Vineria Bottega and indulged in our staple holiday diet of meat and cheese platters – these ones beautifully presented with tiny cherry tomatoes and a drizzle of local honey. It’s a great little spot, so good we went twice, although the second visit was unplanned. On leaving the village we drove straight into a forest fire that was encroaching across the road. My partner was all for me driving through it like some sort of stunt woman, but I made an immediate U-turn and so we found ourselves back at Vitis, recovering from the drama.Another visit involved a ramble round a miniature extinct volcano– its crater full of almond trees, its giant neighbour smoking moodily to the south. In every direction were black slopes dotted with trees or vineyards. Thanks to the rich volcanic soil and the contrast in temperature from day to night, Etna wines are renowned not just in Italy, but globally, with winemakers such as Marco de Grazia of Tenuta delle Terre Nere and Giuseppe Russo of Girolamo Russo among the top 100 producers in the world.We paid an all-too-brief visit to Tenute Mannino di Plachi, an agriturismo and wine cellar with views down to the coast, but if I visit again I will book a place on the Etna Wine Train, which stops at Randazzo and includes bus trips to two vineyards (€47, including two tastings).After days of looking at Etna in the distance, we headed there with our son and the other family from the guesthouse. There are several ways to explore the barren, black, rocky landscape – on foot, by mountain bike, by train (see above) or, in winter, on skis – but we chose the most child-friendly: by donkey.Salvatore from Etna Donkey Trekking led our party – the three boys on donkeys, their parents on foot – on a short walk across the lower wooded slopes. Living in the shadow of an active volcano has to be nervewracking but, for all its activity, Salvatore emphasised the calming effects of the mountain, insisting that we close our eyes, turn off our phones and “listen to nature”. As a parent you hope these experiences might fill your child with wonder at the world, but my son was far more excited by the small creatures crafted from lava in the gift shop than he was by volcanology or the breeze in the trees.On our final evening we treated ourselves to dinner at Terra Mia, the best restaurant in the area according toMariolina. We sat on a terrace overlooking a country road where the only traffic was a man on a horse. As Mariolina had promised the food was fantastic: my ragu of Nebrodi black pig, sourced from the nearby Nebrodi national park, Sicily’s largest, was deliciously rich.Etna is often referred to as an island within an island. The people, the climate, the wine and the food all have a distinct character, influenced by the 3,329-metre volcano. It’s a spectacular backdrop for a holiday, but the smaller attractions we stumbled across, from wobbly towers of children to the flavours on our plates, made as much of an impression on us as the giant on the horizon.• Accommodation at Il Tanaceto was provided by Sawdays doubles from €70 B\u0026ampB.

He said Trump repaid him for the $130,000 in hush money received by Daniels.On Wednesday Trump offered a characteristically combative response, insisting that the campaign finance violations that Cohen had pleaded guilty to “are not a crime”.In an interview with the conservative network Fox News, due to be broadcast on Thursday, he said: “They didn’t come out of the campaign, they came from me. And I tweeted about it. You know, I put – I don’t know if you know but I tweeted about the payments. But they didn’t come out of the campaign.“But they weren’t – that’s not a – it’s not even a campaign violation. If you look at President Obama, he had a massive campaign violation but he had a different attorney general and they viewed it a lot differently.”Trump was apparently referring to a fine levied on the former president’s 2008 campaign over missing and delayed disclosure of high-dollar donors in the final days of that race.On Wednesday evening, Trump issued another self-exonerating missive, tweeting: “The only thing that I have done wrong is to win an election that was expected to be won by Crooked Hillary Clinton and the Democrats. The problem is, they forgot to campaign in numerous states!”But Trump’s offensive did not dominate the news agenda. Cohen’s own lawyer, Lanny Davis, kept up the pressure in a series of TV interviews. He told NBC’s Today show that Cohen “said under oath the most damaging, definitive information yesterday – that the president of the United States directed him to commit a crime.”Cohen would not accept a pardon, Davis added, even if Trump were to offer him one.“Not only is he not hoping for, he would not accept a pardon. He considers a pardon from somebody who has acted so corruptly as president to be something he would never accept.”Davis also suggested that Cohen was ready to tell Mueller, who is investigating Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election, everything he knows.“Michael Cohen knows information that would be of interest to the special counsel, in my opinion, regarding both knowledge about a conspiracy to corrupt American democracy by the Russians, and the failure to report that knowledge to the FBI,” he told MSNBC.“What he knows that he witnessed will be of interest to the special counsel,” he said on ABC’s Good Morning America. “He will tell the truth to everyone who asks him about Mr Trump.”Cohen was for years one of Trump’s most trusted advisers, but his lawyer made it clear he has thoroughly turned on his billionaire boss, less than a year after he said he “would take a bullet for” the president.Cohen believes Trump is “unsuitable to hold the office”, Davis said, citing his refusal while standing alongside Vladimir Putin, Russia’s president, to accept the conclusion of US intelligence agencies that the Russians were responsible for the election disruption.Trump’s opinion of Manafort is very different. He lavished praise on his former campaign chairman, saying he was “brave” and had “tremendous pressure on him and, unlike Cohen, he refused to ‘break’”.At the White House briefing, the press secretary, Sarah Sanders, declined to rule out the possibility that Manafort might receive a presidential pardon, saying only: “The Manafort case doesn’t have anything to do with the president, doesn’t have anything to do with his campaign, and it doesn’t have anything to do with the White House.”She also insisted: “As the president has stated on numerous occasions, he did nothing wrong. There are no charges against him in this. And just because Michael Cohen made a plea deal doesn’t mean that that implicates the president on anything.”Asked if the president lied to the American people about the payments, Sanders replied: “I think that’s a ridiculous accusation. The president, in this matter, has done nothing wrong and there are no charges against him.”But there has been sharp criticism from both sides of the aisle on Capitol Hill. The Democratic leader in the House, Nancy Pelosi, said the cases were “further evidence of the rampant corruption and criminality at the heart of Trump’s inner circle.“Cohen’s admission of paying hundreds of thousands of dollars in hush money ‘at the direction of the candidate’ to influence the 2016 election shows the president’s claims of ignorance to be far from accurate, and places him in even greater legal jeopardy.”Most Republicans remained loyal but Senator Ben Sasse said: “Paul Manafort is a founding member of the DC swamp and Michael Cohen is the Gotham version of the same. Neither one of these felons should have been anywhere near the presidency.”"},{"url":"https://fastly-io.guim.co.uk/img/media/931eeed5a6bd4ae7a38457d0adea08d0f9bbc23e/0_0_2437_1462/master/2437.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=200c597382824495522fb84b542080f4","title":"paul manafort juror says one holdout kept jury from convicting on all counts","story":"Juror Paula Duncan says 11 of 12 jury members thought former Trump campaign chief was guilty on all 18 chargesThe jury in the trial of Paul Manafort would have convicted the former Trump campaign chairman on all 18 criminal charges if not for one juror who had questions about the reasonable doubt standard of guilt, a juror told Fox News on Wednesday.“There was one holdout,” the juror in the trial, Paula Duncan, said in an interview. We all tried to convince her to look at the paper trail. We laid it out in front of her again and again and she still said that she had a reasonable doubt.“The jury on Tuesday found Manafort guilty on two counts of bank fraud, five counts of tax fraud and one charge of failing to disclose foreign bank accounts, giving special counsel Robert Mueller a victory in the first trial arising from his investigation of Russia’s role in the 2016 US election.But the jury of six men and six women could not reach a consensus on 10 other counts. Judge TS Ellis, who oversaw the three-week trial in a US federal court in Alexandria, Virginia, declared a mistrial on those 10 counts.In the first public comments by a juror in the case, Duncan said that 11 members of the jury were in agreement that Manafort was guilty on all 18 felony charges but that they could not get the one holdout to change her mind after nearly four days of deliberations.“We didn’t want it to be hung so we tried for an extended period of time to convince her. But in the end she held out and that’s why we have 10 counts that did not get a verdict,” she said.Duncan said she was speaking out to inform the public and that she was not concerned about her safety. Ellis said that he had received threats and he has not released juror names, citing worries about their safety.“I thought that the public, America, needed to know how close this was and the evidence was overwhelming,” she said.Duncan said she was a Trump supporter and wanted to believe that Manafort was innocent. She noted that even his critics had described him as a brilliant political consultant and that Trump had trusted him with overseeing his campaign.“I did not want Paul Manafort to be guilty. But he was and no one is above the law.”Duncan said some of the jurors had a problem accepting the testimony of Rick Gates, Manafort’s former right-hand man, because he was testifying as part of a plea deal and “would have done anything that he could to preserve himself”.She said the jury decided to not consider Gates’s testimony and focus instead on the documentary evidence. Duncan had tough words for attorneys on both sides.She said the prosecution looked bored at times and that she saw two of them napping. Manafort’s lawyers, on the other hand, gave short cross-examinations, rarely objected and gave off an “easygoing” vibe, she said.“I think I expected a little more,” Duncan said.Duncan said the deliberations were heated at times, leading some jurors to tears at one point, but that politics did not influence their decision-making.“I think we all went in there like we were supposed to and assumed that Mr Manafort was innocent. We did due diligence, we applied the evidence, our notes, the witnesses and we came out with guilty verdicts on the eight counts,” she said."},{"url":"https://fastly-io.guim.co.uk/img/media/8ff9b26740e24b3a67cf31c7871361e9490e62eb/0_158_4368_2621/master/4368.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fa35dbeae9e97bafa6f2200ce6a17816","title":"the syrian refugee aiming to become an olympic swimmer","story":"Eid Aljazairli could not swim when he arrived in Britain from Damascus in 2016. Now he aims for Olympic gloryOnce upon a time, water was Eid Aljazairli’s greatest adversary, a vast expanse that stood between him and a life in Europe. Now, it sustains his greatest ambition.Aljazairli was a non-swimmer when he fled Damascus and took his chances on a small, barely seaworthy vessel that took him across the Mediterranean. Now he spends four hours each day in a swimming pool and dreams of making it to the Olympics.“My story starts with the American swimmer Michael Phelps,” the 24-year-old says, sitting in a friend’s flat in north-east London. “I was sitting at home late at night and I saw a video of him on YouTube by chance. “I saw him swimming and flying. He really inspired me and ignited a passion inside me,” he adds. “After watching two hours of films, I just said to myself: this is something I have to do.”News doesn\u0027t always have to be bad – indeed, the relentless focus on confrontation, disaster, antagonism and blame risks convincing the public that the world is hopeless and there is nothing we can do.This series is an antidote, an attempt to show that there is plenty of hope, as our journalists scour the planet looking for pioneers, trailblazers, best practice, unsung heroes, ideas that work, ideas that might and innovations whose time might have come.Readers can recommend other projects, people and progress that we should report on by contacting us at theupside@theAljazairli was training to be an accountant and working as a visual merchandiser, developing floor plans and three-dimensional displays for shops when the Syrian war broke out.He arrived in Britain from Damascus in 2016, settling first in Scotland and then in the outskirts of London. When he was granted a five-year visa to remain in Britain this January, he moved to a hostel. And started swimming.Within six months, he has gone from barely being able to swim at all to clocking 43 seconds for the 50-metre freestyle. His times remain well short of Olympic qualifying levels, but his coaches reckon he could compete in a refugee team if the Rio 2016 innovation is repeated at the Tokyo games in 2020.The swimming Syrian, who lives on a meagre allowance of £5 a day, says he saves on groceries so as to put money aside for his monthly membership at the Waltham Forest Feel Good Centre. “I started practising, and I was so excited at first. When I started, I could not swim two or three metres, and I didn’t know why because it looked so easy on the video,” he says.Swimming takes him away from everything and transports him to another world where he feels untouchable, he says. “When you have a hard day and have a lot going on, you just go into the water and enter another world. In the water you cannot hear or see anyone … All I have is 25 metres and my passion to get to the Olympics.”Daniel Bullock, a local coach who has taken Aljazairli on, says the pace of his progress is remarkable – but that he has a way to go to get to hit the Olympic standard (currently the best in the world swim approximately twice as fast as him). “I hope that there will be mini-Olympics within the bigger event … We have been trying to support Eid’s application and find out whether there will be another like that,” he says.He adds: “The reason so many people have taken Eid’s story to heart and helped him … is that with little help, he has taught himself to swim in six months. He’s remarkable in his own right and has made rapid progress. His story is really an inspiration. I hope he will go back to Syria and be the next minister for swimming and generate interest in it,” Bullock adds.A crowdfunding page has been set up to help raise money to give Aljazairli the right support to compete. Aljazairli is now learning English and wants to go to university in September, but swimming is now a big part of his life. “I currently swim from 6am to 8am and 6pm to 8pm. I can organise my life around it,” he says.“When people hear my dream of swimming in the Olympics and I tell them I want to be like Michael Phelps, people laugh … They say, ‘You are a refugee and you get £5 a day, don’t waste your time and do other things.’ But I believe in myself and that I can do anything. When I hear people say that, it pushes me harder. I am not just a refugee, but I am a dreamer.”Bullock says: “Eid wants to go and be competitive. He has a long way to go to do that.

His mother Eimear put out an appeal for people to send him a card for his birthday - and thousands of people from all over the world responded. Photograph: Daragh Mc SweeneyProvisionA little boy who is battling leukaemia received thousands of birthday cards from all over the world on Wednesday morning after his mother posted about his birthday on Facebook. A convoy of Garda cars also called to Fionn Doyle’s home in Kildorrery, North Cork along with a fire engine to help celebrate his seventh birthday.Fionn was diagnosed with leukaemia at the age of 18 months and after three and a half years of gruelling treatment went into remission in July 2016, only to suffer a relapse in December 2016.A bone marrow transplant last December failed to stem the cancer and Eimear Doyle and her husband, Jack and Fionn’s sister, Saoirse( 8) and stepsister, Amy (13) were told in May to brace themselves for the worst when he ended up on a ventilator in Temple Street Children’s Hospital. But Fionn rallied and came back home to Kildorrery. On Wednesday, his bravery was recognised when gardaí from Fermoy presented him with his own garda uniform and medal for being a Super Hero while thousands of well wishers sent him birthday cards from all over the world.“Today was a day we weren’t sure that we would ever see - when Fionn came home from hospital in May after spending days on a ventilator, we were told days to weeks at most, nothing more, but today was magical - memories made that will last forever,” Ms Doyle said.She explained she had posted a message on Facebook, asking people to send Fionn a birthday card, but she never expected the response that they got. The local post-man delivered up to 10,000 cards, including from America, Australia and South Africa. “He knew he was getting birthday cards but they’ve been arriving at a rate of 2,000 a day for the last few days- we’ve only opened 1,500 so far and they are from all over Cork and Ireland and all over the world so we told him it was because the world heard that he was a Super Hero.“He knew the post was coming but to see his face light up when he saw the Garda cars from Fermoy and the Mitchelstown Fire Engine driving up to the house this morning, it was brilliant.” “Cancer has always been in his life since he was 18 months so he has no concept of life without it, but today just gave him a massive lift- it was just magical and we are so grateful to everyone who made it such a special day for him and for us and gave us memories we will cherish forever.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3605300.1535022409!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"putin urges us to reconsider as new sanctions set to kick in","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tRussian president Vladimir Putin in Sochi on Wednesday. “I hope the realisation that this policy has no prospects will sooner or later come to our American partners and we can begin to co-operate on a normal basis,” he said. Photograph:  Pavel GolovkinAPVladimir Putin has urged the US to reconsider its sanctions policy, saying moves by Washington to impose yet more penalties on Russia were pointless and counterproductive. Mr Putin was speaking as the US prepared to unleash sweeping new sanctions against Russia in response to the nerve agent attack on former spy Sergei Skripal in the English city of Salisbury in March. The measures, mandated by the 1991 Chemical and Biological Weapons Control and Warfare Elimination Act, will bar Russia from importing a wide range of technologies from the US that have national security implications.Yet tougher US sanctions will follow if Russia fails within 90 days to renounce the use of chemical and biological weapons and allow an international inspection of its chemical facilities. Russia has denied involvement in the Skripal poisoning. US sanctions were “pointless and counterproductive especially in relation to such a country as Russia”, Mr Putin told a press conference after talks with Sauli Niinisto, the president of Finland, in the Russian Black Sea resort of Sochi on Wednesday. “I hope the realisation that this policy has no prospects will sooner or later come to our American partners and we can begin to co-operate on a normal basis,” he said. Denis Manturov, the Russian minister of trade and industry, played down the impact of the fresh sanctions, saying Russia would turn to Southeast Asia for technological components barred by the US. Russia was considering retaliating against the US by renouncing the use of the US dollar in its international trade, he told reporters in Moscow. Rosoboronexport, Russia’s state armaments trader, said it planned to switch to national currencies when settling accounts with buyers in China, India and Turkey. Western countries, led by the US, have been ratcheting up sanctions against Russia since 2014 in a so far unsuccessful campaign to persuade Kremlin to change its policies in Ukraine and Syria. The measures have targeted the Russian oil and banking sectors as well as iniduals deemed to gain from Kremlin polices who have been hit with western asset freezes and visa bans. Allegations that the Kremlin meddled in the 2016 US election that brought Donald Trump to power have fired anti-Russia sentiment across the political establishment in Washington. On top of sanctions over the Skripal poisoning, US lawmakers have been calling for restrictions on investment in Russian government debt that have spooked investors. Russia’s finance ministry cancelled a bond auction on Wednesday, citing increasing volatility in the market. Russia’s central bank has bought up millions of dollars worth of foreign currency in the past few days in an attempt to halt a slide in the value of the ruble that has lost more than 6 per cent of its value since the start of this month. Dmitri Peskov, Mr Putin’s spokesman, warned that Russian relations with the US were on a downward slide and asked if Washington had the will to seek areas for co-operation.Mr Peskov was speaking ahead of a meeting between Nikolai Patrushev, the head of the Russian Security Council and John Bolton, his US counterpart, for talks in Geneva on Thursday that are expected to cover Syria and Ukraine as well as bilateral relations. Mr Bolton riled the Kremlin with a statement this week that Russia was “stuck” in Syria and was looking for other countries to fund postwar reconstruction there. Mr Peskov said Russia was playing a major role in rescuing Syria from international terrorists and resolving the country’s political problems. “To say that Russia is somehow stuck is incorrect – all the more so coming from our colleagues in the US. We shouldn’t forget that American servicemen are also on Syrian territory.” "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3605284.1535021331!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit british in eu could lose access to uk bank accounts under no deal brexit","story":"Britain’s Brexit secretary Dominic Raab outlines the British government’s ambitions for a no-deal Brexit.\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBritain’s Brexit secretary  Dominic Raab gestures during his speech outlining the British government’s plans for a no-deal Brexit. Photograph: Peter NichollsReutersBritish consumers would face slower and more costly credit card payments when they buy EU products, and British citizens living abroad could lose access to their bank accounts, in the event of a no-deal Brexit, the British government warned on Thursday.Brexit secretary Dominic Raab insisted he was “confident that a good deal is in our sights”, as he launched 24 “technical notices” in Westminster on Thursday morning, telling businesses and the public how to prepare if no deal is reached.He insisted the British government’s priority was to ensure continuity. But the 24 technical notices - the first batch of more than 80 due over the summer - underline the potential impact on daily life in Britain, if Britain leaves without a deal in place in March next year.With UK banks likely to lose access to EU payments systems, the financial services paper warns that, “customers (including business using these providers to process euro payments) could face increased costs and slower processing times for Euro transactions”.It added: “The cost of card payments between the UK and EU will likely increase.”UK citizens living in the EU, “may lose the ability to access lending and deposit services, and insurance contracts”, the paper says.Meanwhile, businesses are warned that if we leave without a deal, “the free circulation of goods between the UK and EU would cease”.Firms would need to fill out customs declarations for goods entering the UK from the EU - and should think about whether they should, “engage the services of a customs broker, freight forwarder or logistics provider to help, or alternatively secure the appropriate software and authorisations”.The technical notices also make clear Britain expects the EU to start imposing tariffs on UK goods in the event of no deal.Businesses should, “if necessary, put steps in place to renegotiate commercial terms to reflect any changes in customs and excise procedures, and any tariffs that may apply to UK-EU trade”, the notice on “trading” says.In a series of other areas, the technical notices strike a more reassuring note, with existing regulations in sectors from workers’ rights to the export of dangerous products due to be transposed into UK law under the Withdrawal Act.With the contentious issue of the Northern Ireland backstop still unresolved between the UK and EU27, businesses trading across the Border are advised that they may need to consult the Dublin Government. “The UK would stand ready to engage constructively to meet our commitments and act in the best interests of the people of Northern Ireland, recognising the very significant challenges that the lack of a UK-EU legal agreement would pose in this unique and highly sensitive context. This would include engagement on arrangements for land border trade. We will provide more information in due course,” the technical notice on trading explains.“If you trade across the land border, you should consider whether you will need advice from the Irish Government about preparations you need to make”, it adds. - Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

About 20 notices out of a total of more than 80, covering everything from veterinary medicine to banking and the Common Travel Area, are expected to be published, although the government declined to specify which areas would be covered in the first batch.In a speech to coincide with the publication, Brexit secretary Dominic Raab is expected to stress that Britain believes that the prospect of leaving the EU without a deal is unlikely.“I remain confident a good deal is within our sights, and that remains our top, and over-riding, priority ... But, we must be ready to consider the alternative. We have a duty, as a responsible government, to plan for every eventuality,” he is expected to say.“These technical notices – and the ones that will follow – are a sensible, measured and proportionate approach to minimising the impact of no deal on British firms, citizens, charities and public bodies.”Conservative Brexiteers who have long complained about the government’s failure to prepare adequately for a no-deal Brexit now fear that publishing information about its impact could weaken their argument that no deal with Brussels is better than a bad deal.Mr Raab will stress that the notices are designed to provide information and guidance to make a no-deal Brexit as smooth as possible. But some of the plans would involve Britain continuing to follow EU rules after Brexit.“In some cases, it means taking unilateral action to maintain as much continuity as possible in the short term, in the event of no deal – irrespective of whether the EU reciprocates. Of course, while we may take that approach in the short term, we will be outside the EU, and free to erge when we are ready, on our terms, in the UK national interest and when it’s right for the British people,” Mr Raab is expected to say.“And many of the no-deal challenges will affect the EU in similar ways.\u0026nbspFor our part, if the negotiations fail, we will continue to behave as responsible European neighbours, partners and allies. That should extend to necessary engagement with our EU partners when it comes to no-deal planning.”Labour’s shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer, said that if the publication of the documents was an attempt to dress up the severe consequences of a no-deal Brexit as somehow acceptable, the exercise would be pointless.“A no-deal Brexit would be a complete failure by the government to negotiate for Britain. These documents should not distract us from that.\u0026nbspNo deal would be catastrophic for people’s jobs, the economy and for the Border in Northern Ireland. It is irresponsible for anyone to casualise no deal,” he said.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches. See more here.

But the Central American nation’s sudden switch in allegiance to China has clearly rattled its US neighbour.  Reacting to the news, high profile US Senators Marco Rubio and Cory Gardner, representing Florida and Colorado respectively, immediately hit out with threats via their Twitter accounts. “El Salvador has made the wrong decision regarding Taiwan, and it will negatively influence US relations with El Salvador. The US govt must stand up to China’s campaign to bully Taiwan with every tool we have,” said Mr Gardner. Mr Rubio told his 3.6 million followers on Twitter: “I have joined @SenCoryGardner in an amendment to end foreign aid to #ElSalvador after their leftist government decided to abandon #Taiwan in favor of #China. I also spoke to @realdonaldtrump about cutting off their aid just a few minutes ago. They faced immediate charges of hypocrisy. El Salvador’s defection has left Taiwan, an island democracy which Beijing claims as its own territory, with only 17 formal diplomatic allies in the world, and the US is not one of them. Washington has not officially recognised Taiwan since 1979, when it shifted its recognition to China’s communist government to suit its own strategic and economic interests. But the senators’ comments join a narrative of growing concern within the US administration that China is acting in a predatory manner on Washington’s doorstep. Taiwan’s foreign ministry offered some candid insights into its own rift with El Salvador late on Tuesday night, revealing that it had faced repeated demands for funds to develop the La Union commercial port which would have held “tremendous debt risks” for both countries. Only last month, Jean Manes, the US ambassador to El Salvador, warned that China had intentions to turn the Pacific-facing port into a “military base,” reported the South China Morning Post. “It’s a strategic matter, and we all need to keep our eyes open to what is happening,” she said. China has previously sparked suspicions about the motivations behind its port investments after opening its first overseas military base in Djibouti, in the Horn of Africa, last year, and over the possible development of a second in Gwadar Port in Pakistan. Members of the Taiwanese community in Paraguay greet President Tsai during a visit last weekHowever, analysts including Bonnie Glaser, senior director for Asia at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies in DC, are more sceptical of the view that China is eyeing La Union for its strategic military interests, arguing that Beijing’s motives in Latin America are more commercially driven. “I don’t think China is looking to turn every port in the world into a Chinese base. It would be strategically stupid in my mind to be building a base in what America has always considered to be its backyard,” Ms Glaser told The . “The notion that China would like the countries in Latin America to have a good relationship with China and be less dependent on the United States, that could certainly be one of China’s objectives,” she said. “That’s what China has done around the world, certainly closer to home in Southeast Asia. China has used its economic clout to try and pull some countries away from the United States, at least positioning them in a way that they’re more neutral, so that’s certainly possible.”Top 10 | Things you didn\u0026#039t know about TaiwanSpeculation is rising as to which of Taiwan’s diplomatic allies Beijing may successfully pick off next in its quest to isolate the island nation on the global stage. But aside from the psychological impact on its population, Taiwan has tangibly little to worry about by losing its formal allies, several of whom have demanded funds in exchange for their loyalty, while offering little in return.  Taipei already enjoys strong informal relations with more powerful friends including the US and Japan. As China seeks to undermine the legitimacy and global influence of Taiwan, a democratic ally of the West located in a regional flashpoint, it is perhaps Taipei’s western friends who should be more concerned. A Pacific island may be next to switch its allegiance from Taiwan to China, which has grand strategic ambitions in the Pacific region. “People talk about the Solomon Islands,” said Ms Glaser. “That would be seen as very significant not only by the US but also by Australia and New Zealand, who are very worried about China’s growing influence in the region.”Please review our commenting policy94-year-old veteran\u0026#39s home ransacked while on a trip back to where he landed after D-DayQantas eyes direct flights to Sydney as London to Perth route proves a hitScottish tourist board warned not to use God, golf or Sean Connery in new adMan arrested after graphic pictures of fatal car crash posted on FacebookPatient diagnosed with deadly MERS virus in Leeds as fellow passengers on flight from Middle East soughtDonald Trump says economy would \u0026#39crash\u0026#39 if he were impeachedYorkshire chip shop puts up Mandarin menu amid influx of Chinese tourists after Premier\u0026#39s visit Paris attack: Knifeman kills his mother and sister in stabbing rampageJapan\u0026#39s Emperor Hirohito was so overcome with remorse he wanted to die, diary revealsComment: I was willing to give Jeremy Corbyn a chance... and then I saw him in the fleshGCSE results day 2018: New ‘tougher’ exams favour boys as gender gap narrowest in seven yearsOn this day in 1628: Charles I\u0026#39s close friend, and sworn enemy of Parliament, George Villiers is murderedMeToo actress Asia Argento now admits to sex with under-age boyDonald Trump says he\u0026#39s considering pardon for Paul Manafort Ticketmaster announces UK\u0026#39s first 100pc digitally ticketed event as they clamp down on illegal toutsHurricane Lane: Hawaii braces for major storm - track its path hereThe Pope is in Ireland for the first time since 1979, and for the Catholic church everything has changedSouth Africa hits out at Trump\u0026#39s \u0026#39narrow and isive\u0026#39 tweets on land seizuresPatient waits two-and-a-half days for ambulance as worst delays revealedParrots can make complex economic decisions to turn a profitWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/08/23/09/rts11s6y.jpg","title":"aramco oil ipo saudi arabia stock market listing shelved riyadh denies reports","story":"Created with Sketch.Sources said deal had been called off, however Saudi denials will come as a relief to advisers who stand to make $200m out of the IPOClick to followThe IndependentThe listing of Aramco would raise up to $100bn for Saudi ArabiaRiyadh has moved to quash reports the flotation of state owned oil giant Saudi Aramco has been called off.

That wasn’t the problem. The problem came in when they were making the final decisions about casting pre-production.”\u0026nbspBoyle apparently insisted on bringing in his\u0026nbspfrequent collaborator John Hodge to pen a new script, the existing one by long-serving Bond writers Neal Purvis and Robert Wade being put on ice. According to another industry source speaking to The , this “infuriated” producer Barbara Broccoli.It remains to be seen whether Boyle and Hodge’s Cold War-centred script will remain after the former’s departure, or if the project reverts to Purvis and Wade’s presumably more traditional story.Asked whether his Bond film would acknowledge a changing world and specifically the #MeToo\u0026nbspand #TimesUp movements, Boyle previously said: “You write in real time.“You acknowledge the legacy of the world of Bond and you write in the world – but you also write in the modern world as well.”Production on Bond 25 – which was set to commence on 3 December – will likely have to be pushed back. The film was scheduled for a 25 October 2019 release date but will potentially not reach cinemas until 2020, five years after the release of the last instalment, Spectre.The Independent has contacted representatives for Boyle, Craig and EON Productions for comment.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/08/22/17/rtx2kbjn.jpg  width= 2326  height= 1444  layout= responsive  srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/08/22/17/rtx2kbjn.jpg","title":"brexit no deal more likely than not kpmg survey reveals","story":"Created with Sketch.Click to followThe IndependentSeven in 10 people questioned said they think prices will riseBrexit: Every demographic in UK now thinks no deal more likely than not, survey revealsAll sections of UK society now think that it is more likely than not the country will crash out of the EU without a trade deal, a new survey has revealed.Every demographic, employment status and political group believes a no-deal Brexit is the likely outcome as negotiations continue to stall, KPMG found.In the poll of more than 3,000 people, 54 per cent said no deal was likely compared to just 20 per cent who thought it was unlikely.The findings come as The Independent’s #FinalSay campaign, which is seeking to ensure the people have the chance to vote on the Brexit deal, surpassed 700,000 signatures.The Independent and the People’s Vote campaign have also joined forces for a mass march through central London later this year.Seven in 10 people questioned by KPMG said they think prices will rise in the event of no deal and 69 per cent said they will change their consumer behaviour.Women and those aged under 35 were more likely than others to say they would have to change by taking action such as stockpiling certain good or cutting essential spending.\u0026nbspOverall, 45 per cent of respondents said leaving without a trade deal will be bad for the country, while just 25 per cent said they think it will be good.“This survey shows the public expect a ‘no deal’ Brexit and plan to spend accordingly.

I don\u0027t want it to define me.If anything it caused me to work a bit harder and fight a bit more.She plans to return to Brighton College for A-levels and is hoping to study a combination of chemistry, biology, maths, further maths and philosophy but is still deciding exactly which subjects to pick.Out of the 732 students across the country who received seven grade 9s or above, 34 studied at Brighton College, the private\u0026nbspschool said.There were 10 students who achieved at least nine 9s at the school with one getting the highest he possibly could in all exams - eight nines, an A hat and two A*s.(PA)The overall pass rate - the proportion of entries getting G1 or above - was 98.3 per cent.\u0026nbspThis is down slightly on 2017, when the figure was 98.4 per cent.\u0026nbspIt is also the lowest overall pass rate since 2007.School standards minister Nick Gibb said: Congratulations to all the pupils getting their results today.All of their hard work, and that of their teachers, has paid off and I hope that this is the first step to a bright and successful future.Whatever they choose to do next, whether it is staying at school, going to college, or starting an apprenticeship, these qualifications will give them a solid base of knowledge and skills that they can build on.Thanks to our reforms and the hard work of teachers,\u0026nbspeducation\u0026nbspstandards are rising in our schools and pupils have shown their abilities by achieving excellent results today, with so many pupils meeting and exceeding the standards we expect.On the\u0026nbspreforms to GCSEs in England, Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL), said: All the time and effort that has gone into reforming GCSEs, why have we done that?Because GCSEs were designed for an age when children were then maybe going into employment or going into the sixth form, so they were a gateway to other things.Now everyone has to stay in\u0026nbspeducation\u0026nbspto 18, so why have we got children doing at least 30 hours of exams, all the stress and all the time and all the money that is, when actually for employers, it\u0027s what they get at the age of 18 that\u0027s going to be important.That\u0027s where the real reform should be happening. And this is looking to me like a qualification that time forgot.He added that there should be more focus on the youngsters who score at the lower end of the grade scale.Under the old GCSE, if you got an F or a G, whilst you may not have felt particularly pleased with it, there wasn\u0027t a national narrative saying \u0027you have failed to get the standard pass, you have failed to get a strong pass\u0027, yet that is now built in, he said.\u0026nbspGirls are still much more likely than boys to secure the top grades at GCSE despite an overall narrowing of the gap.\u0026nbspFor example, more than three in five (62 per cent) of the students who secured straight nines - the new top grades - in seven or more new GCSEs were females.\u0026nbspOut of the 732 students who achieved\u0026nbspstraight nines, only 278 were males\u0026nbsp(38 per cent).\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspGrade boundaries are out for the exam boards:\u0026nbspCCEA boundaries are available here.\u0026nbspAQA’s boundaries can be viewed by here.OCR is available here.Edexce boundaries are\u0026nbsphere.\u0026nbspWJEC can be seen here.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspA reminder of what the new grading system means:It is not easy to make comparisons between the two grading scales – apart from at three points:\tThe bottom of a grade 7 is equivalent to\u0026nbspbottom of a grade A\tThe bottom of a grade 4 is equivalent to bottom of a grade C\tThe bottom of a grade 1 is equivalent to\u0026nbspbottom of a grade GA grade 9 is the\u0026nbsptop grade\u0026nbspand it will be\u0026nbspharder to get than an A*More than two-thirds of teenagers are concerned about the new GCSE grading system, according to a poll.The survey also suggests nearly two-thirds do not feel the new system - which sees exams given a grade from 9-1 - will represent their grades as well as it should.The findings of the poll, commissioned by the National Citizen Service, come on the day teenagers across England, Wales and Northern Ireland receive their GCSE results.\u0026nbspA-level results 2018 – in picturesStudents celebrate their A Level results from Ark Academy in WembleyCharlie Jenner, Nathan Sharp and Abhinav

She has adopted four Malawian children and was in the country to celebrate the first anniversary of the Mercy James Centre for Pediatric Surgery and Intensive Care, named after one of her adopted daughtersMadonna and Jean Paul Gaultier arrive for the 2018 Met Gala But there is one area where the older woman is suddenly and somewhat unexpectedly thriving – rock music. Madonna celebrates her 60th birthday on Saturday. Kate Bush has just celebrated hers. In fact, they are the spring chickens. Suzi Quatro, 68, and Patti Smith, 71, are not just still rocking, they are still snarling. Cher at 72 pops up with a delightful cameo in the Mamma Mia!\u0026nbspmovie. The queen of soul, Aretha Franklin, is still recording at 76.\u0026nbspWho’d have thought it? Look back to the 1960s and there were precious few women at all in pop music, let alone older ones. In the UK, Sandie Shaw, Dusty Springfield, Marianne Faithfull and a handful of others carried the fight to the mass of male groups (the word boyband had yet to be invented).No one thought then about whether the stars would still be recording and performing in old age. Indeed the concept was unthinkable – for men as well as women, for stars as well as fans. When I put it to Paul McCartney that he must be surprised to be still going, he replied: “I do rub my eyes. I didn’t foresee it. In The Beatles we always said 10 years. But it kept on and kept on and it kept being good and we seemed to be the people who could do it. Now there is a great young generation of people who can also do it, but it tends to be that the people packing them in are the people who have the material, have hits, songs people know, and I think that’s important. I think they have stagecraft, they have an ability with an audience.”There’s no doubting that the likes of Madonna and Kate Bush have stagecraft in spades. Even in an industry that ostensibly prizes youthfulness and a certain amount of athleticism on stage, the female superstars, like the male, are now gliding into pensionable age, with fan bases, voices, charisma and downright sexiness still intact.\u0026nbspThough, when it comes to longevity, the women themselves didn’t always think it would be the case. Joni Mitchell once remarked, all too despondently: “Record companies want the look. And if you’re over 50, however well preserved, you just don’t have the look.”Maybe the look, or audience perception of the look, has changed. No one remotely cared that Kate Bush looked older than they remembered her (quelle surprise) when she made her stage comeback after 35 years in 2014. And tickets were inevitably like gold dust. I was there to note that she sounded the same, and she still exuded charisma and stage presence.She did a staggering run of 22 performances. Two things perhaps attested to the more mature Kate. The show was only part rock concert, it was also part theatre with video and dance, and even the odd comedy sketch starring her son. Also, she gave all her audiences an instruction on her website, which bore witness to the fact that she comes from an earlier generation than today’s performers. She wrote: “I very much want to have contact with you as an audience, not with iPhones, iPads or cameras.”Suzi, 68,\u0026nbspsays she\u0027ll \u0027retire when I go on stage, shake my ass and there is\u0026nbspsilence\u0027 (Getty)\u0026nbspEarlier this year I witnessed the return to live performance of Annie Lennox, at the age of 63. To raise funds for her charity she did a one-off show which was largely a chat show, interspersed with the odd song at the piano, going through her life and career. The self-deprecating humour was erting: “When I was studying at the Royal Academy of Music, I lived on £3 a week.” Pause. “Scottish people can do that.” Pause. “And we like it.”Perhaps she had stumbled across the format for the older star, a chat show setting interspersed with the odd song. Except, at the end that she knocked everyone there for six with a breathtaking 30 minute performance of Eurythmics and solo hits that showed she retained all her talent. She was the epitome of soul as she belted out Eurythmics anthems, sometimes crawling sensuously across the floor as she did so. The only surprise was that she had (lamentably) eschewed live performance for 10 years.For some female legends, the routine can be tiring. I was at Marianne Faithfull’s most recent London appearance, an intimate show at Ronnie Scott’s jazz club. Plagued by a variety of physical problems over the years, she had a walking stick and performed most of the show sitting down. It was nevertheless a beguiling evening. But notably at one point she actually pleaded with her fans to allow her to retire. “Please let me go,” she said, “I can’t go on for ever. I’m not Keith,” referring to her long-time friend Keith Richards of The Rolling Stones, definitely not one of life’s quitters.Madonna, too, is not one of life’s quitters. Her fitness routine keeps her more than show-ready, even for a show as heavy on breathless choreography as hers. But I think there is another clue to her longevity in what she said to the audience at one of her shows that I attended 15 years ago. Just before her final encore, she said in idiosyncratic style: “When I was a girl I always thought ‘grown-ups can f**k off’. But now I’m 45 years old, I have children of my own, and you know what, grown-ups can still f**k off!”As I say, it was a piece of philosophy delivered in her personal style. But it perhaps partly explains her longevity and continuing appeal. She retains the anarchic spirit she had when she burst on the scene. Female rock stars, just like their male counterparts, and possibly more so, have no intention of growing old gracefully. They haven’t just retained their vocal prowess and stage presence, they have retained the hint of adolescent rebelliousness that has always been an intrinsic part of rock’s appeal. And having met both Madonna and Suzi Quatro, I can attest that in both cases the aggressive, in yer face attitude is not just a stage technique.But rock-star rebelliousness is not the only reason that rock and pop’s biggest female stars go on and on or come back after long absences. Kate Bush was never keen on playing live and before her comeback had only done one tour of the country. But she was persuaded to perform again by her teenage son. As she had a song on one album about watching his clothes go round and round in the washing machine, it was clear that a request from him would, fortunately, carry weight.Victoria Beckham is, of course, far from the vintage of Bush, Madonna and the other older stars. But when the Spice Girls had their reunion tour, it’s interesting that she said the key reason she wanted to do it was that her children had seen Dad play football and knew all about his skills. Now was a chance for them “to see what Mummy did” before they were born.Performing for a global audience is important. But performing for the family clearly also is a factor in keeping the career going.Jonathan Morrish, a long-time senior executive at Sony record company, and now a music industry PR consultant, says: “Women generally live longer than men, so it should come as no surprise that so many as they get older seem to flourish creatively with their music and on stage. None of this is easy. I know from the many artists that I have worked with you need tenacity. So perhaps it’s the staying power they had to show at the beginning of their careers, perhaps a savvy emotional intelligence –\u0026nbspwhatever it is, I admire and welcome it. And applaud them.”\u0026nbspAnd even for those female rock and pop stars who have decided to call it a day, a new avenue has opened up: the stage musical. Right now in London, audiences can see Tina Turner on stage at one theatre, and The Supremes and all the other Motown stars at another. Or at least, one can enjoy their music and life stories, delivered by lookalikes and sound-alikes. It’s possible not just to go on into old age, but literally forever.Faithfull pleaded with a crowd at Ronnie Scotts: \u0027Please let me go. I\u0026nbspcan’t go on for ever. I’m not Keith\u0027 (Alamy)Meanwhile, there is a core of\u0026nbsp 60- and 70- something female rock stars, who thankfully show no signs of even thinking about stopping and relying on musicals to seal their immortality.No one puts it better than Suzi Quatro, celebrating 54 years in the business, who states: “I will retire when I go on stage, shake my ass and there is silence.”David Lister is the former arts editor of The IndependentEnter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/08/10/16/south-africa-school.jpg","title":"south africa corruption president ramaphosa mabuza zuma anc","story":"Created with Sketch.The ruling African National Congress pledges education and opportunity\u0026nbspfor black people\u0026nbsp– but embezzlement in the\u0026nbspdeputy president’s province has left schools so decrepit that children plunge to their death in toiletsClick to followThe IndependentSchool at Orange Farm, near Soweto: one of the ANC’s policies is to improve education for black South African childrenZiyanda\u0026nbspNkosi hated going to the bathroom at school. The pit toilets were so dark, dirty and crumbling. Many children were so afraid of them that they simply relieved themselves in the schoolyard to avoid the ordeal.But as she played with her best friend during recess, the little girl, a six-year-old first-grader, really had to go. She stepped warily inside the closet-like latrine.Even with the gentle pressure of her tiny frame, the floor caved in. Ziyanda flailed wildly, clinging to the edges of the hole, frantically trying to keep herself from falling in and drowning in the fetid pool below.“Mommy! Mommy!” she screamed, managing to hold on long enough for an older boy to run in and save her.Hundreds of parents, enraged that their warnings about the dilapidated school had been ignored for years, burst into protest a couple of days later, upending their quiet rural town for two weeks last August. They burned tires, blocked roads and demanded justice from the provincial government led by David Mabuza, a former maths teacher who had become one of the most powerful figures in the African National Congress (ANC) and was positioning himself to become South Africa’s deputy president.One of the party’s historic promises had been to provide a good education for black people, who had been deliberately denied the opportunity under apartheid. ANC leaders like Nelson Mandela often spoke about freeing black South Africans through school\u0026nbspand Mabuza, whose first big post in the province was education minister, got his political start by promising just that.But under the ANC the education system has been a\u0026nbspshambles, so gutted by corruption that even party officials are dismayed at how little students are learning, in schools so decrepit that children have plunged to their deaths in pit toilets.The rage in Ziyanda’s town grew so intense that protesters hurled stones at a local ANC leader, who narrowly escaped by whipping out his handgun and shooting randomly into the crowd, wounding two children and roiling the community all the more.Mabuza never came to the school or met with the parents –\u0026nbspand for good reason, local officials contend. The dangerous conditions were a clear reflection of his control over the province, where millions of dollars for education have disappeared into a vortex of suspicious spending, shoddy public construction and brazen corruption to fuel his political ambitions, according to government records and officials in his party.But the uprising and allegations against Mabuza did not crimp his political rise. To the contrary, only a few months later, as the ANC tried to quash national outrage over misrule by its leaders, Mabuza scored his biggest triumph by far. He was picked to become second-in-command of the entire ANC, launching him into an even more prominent post\u0026nbspas South Africa’s deputy president, second only to the nation’s leader.Mabuza may seem an odd choice, especially at a time when the ANC is desperate to purge its reputation for graft and restore its image as the rightful heir to Mandela’s legacy. After all, Mabuza’s rural province, Mpumalanga, is fairly small, has little economic clout and is widely regarded as one of the country’s most corrupt.But that is the vexing secret behind Mabuza’s spectacular climb, current and former ANC officials say: he siphoned off money from schools and other public services to buy loyalty and amass enormous power, making him impossible to ignore on the national stage and putting him in position to shape South Africa for years to come.Mabuza (second right) (AFPGetty)“He didn’t become what he is now because of his political capability,” says\u0026nbspFish Mahlalela, a senior ANC figure in the province and a national lawmaker.“No, no, it was out of money and\u0026nbspmanipulation,” he adds. “Nothing else.”Perhaps more than any other member of South Africa’s new government, Mabuza undercuts the promise of a “new dawn” in the country after the removal of President Jacob Zuma this year.Besieged by scandals that have hacked away at the ANC’s legitimacy and electoral prospects, the party installed a new president, Cyril Ramaphosa, in February. From the start, he pledged to root out corruption and finally deliver on the promise of a just South Africa for all of its citizens.But to seal his new post, Ramaphosa first had to secure the backing of Mabuza, 57, who built such a formidable political machine that he became kingmaker in the back-room negotiations to choose South Africa’s new president. After campaigning for a rival, Mabuza abruptly switched sides and joined forces with Ramaphosa, helping the two emerge from a pivotal party conference last December as the country’s undisputed leaders.Then, to the surprise of many in his province, Mabuza gave a speech just weeks after being sworn in as deputy president this year, lamenting the poor state of the schools and the “tragedies that take away the innocence of our children”. He spoke movingly of a kindergartner electrocuted at school. Of a toddler who drowned after falling into a broken pit latrine. And of a five-year-old boy whose body was discovered by his mother at the bottom of another dilapidated pit, his hand sticking out of a pool of faeces.Such deplorable conditions were all too common, he noted, symbolising the failure to provide black South Africans with a decent chance at life.“Where is our care?” Mabuza said in the speech. “What has gone wrong with our nation?”Yet under Mabuza’s leadership, millions of dollars for schools in his province have been misspent year after year, according to the national government. His province routinely spent less on poor students than required\u0026nbspand school construction projects have been riddled with inflated costs, government records show.Nearly a quarter of the primary schools in Mabuza’s province still have only dilapidated pit toilets, despite ample government funds to fix them. And during his tenure, his province was caught fabricating the passing rates on the annual national exam, enabling him to claim big leaps forward that never happened.The schools Mabuza did champion provided an easy way to funnel large amounts of money into politics, according to ANC officials, high-ranking defectors and anti-corruption groups. He pushed to build big boarding schools whose costs tripled\u0026nbspfor unexplained reasons\u0026nbspto $30m (£23m) each, alarming education experts. Some construction was so shoddy that roofs sprouted leaks soon after being finished, toilets barely worked, students lacked water, retaining walls collapsed and dormitories were missing doors, according to a provincial report.Over the years, Mabuza’s province also became known as one of South Africa’s most dangerous. Nearly 20 politicians, most from inside the ANC, were assassinated in the past two decades, some after exposing graft in public works projects.All the while\u0026nbspMabuza’s political career flourished. He attracted legions of new ANC members with government contracts, cash handouts and even KFC meals, according to current and former party officials.His sweeping recruitment drive turned his relatively insignificant province into the ANC’s second biggest voting bloc. Under the party’s delegate system, his territory became more influential than even Gauteng, the province that includes Johannesburg and Pretoria\u0026nbspwith a population three times the size and an economy nearly five times as big.Now, critics contend, Mabuza’s role as the country’s second most powerful politician casts doubt on the legitimacy of the new government and its assertions that the ANC is turning the page on corruption.Under the ANC, Mandela’s once-heralded liberation movement, tens of billions of dollars meant to lift poor black South Africans have been stolen by party leaders. Strong institutions like the tax agency have been hollowed out by party officials bent on shielding their illicit activities.But the nation’s poor schools are perhaps the ANC’s greatest betrayal of the dreams of black South Africans – some of whom have turned to burning down such institutions in protest.Mabuza, who declined to be interviewed, built his political career on the schools. Unlike other, more celebrated anti-apartheid leaders, he did not go into exile he was not imprisoned on the infamous Robben Island. Instead, he fought for the right of black South Africans to receive an equal education, a call he echoed in his recent speech.As many South Africans pin their hopes on Ramaphosa’s pledge for a fresh start, analysts say that much of the country is looking past an unpleasant truth: the new president owes his victory in part to corruption, and much of his administration’s future – as well as the country’s – rests in the hands of Mabuza.“If there is any powerful person whom Ramaphosa’s presidency actually relies on, it is Mabuza,” says\u0026nbspRalph Mathekga, the author of Ramaphosa’s Turn: Can Cyril Save South Africa?“We are being reluctant as a nation to face the reality of Mabuza,” he adds. “If Ramaphosa gets hit by a bus, Mabuza is going to be the president.”Scandal from the startThe numbers just didn’t add up, even at the beginning.After apartheid ended in 1994, Mabuza got his first big break: he became Mpumalanga’s education minister, a chance to shape the schools and generations of students attending them.He had the perfect resume. The son of farmers, Mabuza grew up here in the province, walking miles from his village to the only primary school in a nearby town. Though he often had no shoes, he always tucked in his shirt and buttoned it up to the neck, recalls\u0026nbspReginah Mhaule, a childhood peer.“He was never late,” says\u0026nbspMhaule, a longtime ally who recently became one of South Africa’s two deputy foreign ministers.A bright student, Mabuza ultimately took one of the few jobs available to black South Africans back then. He taught maths at the local high school and later became a founding leader of a teachers’ association.Poor schooling was a major spark in the anti-apartheid movement, most notably in Soweto in 1976, when thousands of students protested the introduction of Afrikaans as the language of instruction. In Mabuza’s province, teachers and students began organising against white minority rule in the early 1980s.The teachers were at the centre\u0026nbspof the movement, says\u0026nbspSandile Sukati, a teacher who recruited Mabuza into the main student organisation. Mabuza quickly stood out, he says, travelling far and wide to build ties among anti-apartheid groups.Museum of London  Henry GrantMuseum of London  Henry GrantA United Nations photograph by Kay MuldoonCourtesy of the News LineCourtesy of the International Defence and Aid Fund for Southern AfricaSATIS (Southern Africa - the Imprisoned Society)Museum of London  Henry GrantMuseum of London  Henry GrantA United Nations photograph by Kay MuldoonCourtesy of the News LineCourtesy of the International Defence and Aid Fund for Southern AfricaSATIS (Southern Africa - the Imprisoned Society)“He was a leader in his own right,” Sukati says.But after apartheid ended, Mabuza quickly ran into trouble, leading to the province’s first big scandal of the democratic era.\u0026nbspIn 1997, three years into his tenure as education minister, the schools were performing poorly, especially on the national obsession: the annual matriculation exams that determine whether students graduate from high school. The passing rate in his province was 46 per cent that year, slightly below the national average.Mabuza was feeling the pressure, particularly as powerful ANC leaders returned from exile, often with military credentials that overshadowed his own, several current and former ANC officials say.Sukati, who worked under Mabuza at the education department, recalls Mabuza\u0026nbsptelling some of the teachers: “I am in a tight situation.”\u0026nbspThe next year brought a stunning improvement. The passing rate inexplicably jumped to 72 per cent – an incredible turnaround that catapulted Mpumalanga to second place\u0026nbspamong the nation’s nine provinces.“I was suspicious,” says\u0026nbspSukati, who is now a senior education official. “It couldn’t just happen like that.”A whistleblower exposed the cheating a few weeks later. The real passing rate, authorities announced, was under 53 per cent. Moreover, the doctoring had taken place inside Mabuza’s residence, where he met with a small circle of bureaucrats, some of whom were later fired.An investigation was never completed. Mabuza never admitted wrongdoing or suffered any significant consequences. Dropped as education minister, he was named head of housing instead.Ever since, Mabuza’s career has been remembered for that scandal, one that helped establish the kind of culture of impunity in his province that has tarnished the ANC across South Africa..“I think\u0026nbspthe man, he had to be charged, but unfortunately I don’t know what went wrong,” says\u0026nbspRonnie Malomane, an ANC official who was taught maths by Mabuza in the early 1980s. “They were just giving him position after position.”Nationally, Mabuza’s standing kept rising, propelled by his success at attracting new party members. In 2009, Zuma appointed him premier of all of Mpumalanga province.But Mabuza raised more red flags, stripping some of the decision-making power over government projects from local officials and concentrating it in his own office. He justified the move – called the “Rapid Implementation Unit” – as a way to act quickly. Others had a different explanation.“That’s how he managed to loot,” says\u0026nbspCollen Sedibe, a former ANC leader who grew up on the same street as Mabuza and worked under him in the provincial housing department.Treasury officials in the province say they are now investigating the irregular expenditures “incurred through the contracts arranged centrally by the Office of the Premier”.But parents, officials and educators had warned about the damage from corruption and neglect for years, pointing to the painfully overcrowded classrooms and decaying, apartheid-era schools.‘They wanted to kill me’It took four days of rage before the local ANC councillor showed up.The councillor, Justice Twelve Siboza, explained that he had been busy the week Ziyanda fell into the toilet, tending to another corner of his ward. Other activities had also drawn his attention: he is a gospel singer with his own radio show, so he crisscrosses the region to perform at weddings and funerals.By the time he got to Ziyanda’s school, hundreds of parents had closed off the unpaved roads, furious that their grievances had been met with near silence from the ANC’s leaders.Siboza made sure to bring a gun. Politics is dangerous in South Africa, sometimes lethal, he says.The ANC has a grip on the area around the school because most residents, aside from the lucky few working at the sugar cane plant, are poor and rely on the party for government jobs, contracts or monthly welfare grants.It is an area Mabuza knows well. He began his ascent inside the ANC as the head of this part of the province. It was once part of a homeland set aside for black people by the apartheid government. To this day, several ANC officials say, Mabuza has kept a hold on it through powerful proxies.Some see a deep cynicism behind the conditions in the schools. When black South Africans become educated and move into the middle class, their loyalty to the party tends to wane, recent elections have shown. So by perpetuating a culture of dependence, critics contend, the ANC ensures its dominance.But Mhaule, the childhood peer of Mabuza, rejects\u0026nbspany suggestion that the ANC had failed to prioritise education.Officials like Mhaule say the rising pass rate on the national high school exam provides clear evidence of progress. But the figures can be misleading. The number of students taking the exam has declined in the past two years. Weaker students who would drag down the rate are being held back, education experts say.About 600 protesters gathered at the school that cold Friday morning when Siboza, the local ANC councillor, arrived with a police escort. As he moved to talk to the parents, demonstrators showered him with rocks.“They wanted to kill me,” the councillor says.Siboza made a run for it, reaching for the hip holster under his brown overcoat. He took out his gun – firing three times and hitting two teenagers, a girl and a boy.Agreement Mashele, the school board chairman, was shocked. “This man is a church member,” he says.A few days later, the ANC councillor visited the children he had wounded.“The councillor said he was very sorry,” says\u0026nbspthe girl, Siphesihle Ngobeni, whose left leg was grazed by a bullet. The councillor pleaded with her not to press charges and gave her about $15, she says. She used the money to buy sanitary pads.The boy’s injury was more severe. His father, Petros Thobela, who had gone to the same primary school and did not have a job, accepted a similar apology and compensation of, according to the councillor, about $150.The boy’s mother, Nobuhle Ndlovu, who does odd jobs, deplores\u0026nbspthe state of education.“They promise,” she says, “and they just disappear.”Still, she would remain loyal to the governing party.“Yes, of course, I vote ANC,” she says. “It’s our freedom.”‘He always had money in his house’The protests spilled into September, but the country’s attention was fixed on another battle: the national push to replace Zuma as South Africa’s president.The all-important ANC party election was only a few months away, and officials in Mabuza’s province were bracing to see whether his years of hard work had paid off.In early October, the ANC released the delegate breakdown, with good news for Mabuza: his previously low-ranking province was now the ANC’s second most powerful.Mabuza owed his outsize influence to a single feat. In the past decade, ANC membership in his province had skyrocketed nearly 190 per cent, eclipsing the national increase of less than 60 per cent. No other province came close to matching Mpumalanga’s explosive growth.But Mabuza’s numbers were as cooked as his high school passing rates, current and former ANC officials contend.In South Africa, taxes are collected by the national government, which distributes the money to provinces. The provinces then use the money – with little oversight from above.Treasury officials in Mpumalanga say that “irregular expenditures” more than doubled in the previous two budget years, particularly in education, housing and health.Wages account for most of the education and health budgets. So money is usually siphoned off by politicians and business allies through contracts for services or construction, ANC officials say. When costs are suspiciously high, schools are poorly built or facilities are badly maintained, they say, it is often a warning that money is being skimmed, at the students’ expense.Thousands in Israel protest draft law that would ‘exclude’ ArabsGrenfell victims were subject to ‘social apartheid’, says Diane AbbottSouth Africa is the most unequal country in the world, says World BankMandela’s letters chart his heartbreaking struggle from behind barsAs premier, Mabuza promoted the construction of big boarding schools, or mega-schools, in farm areas to improve rural education. Since 2012, the province has completed five, with two more in the pipeline.For reasons that have not been explained, the price of each school has ballooned from $11m to around $30m.Asked whether Mabuza wanted the mega-schools to facilitate the theft of public funds, Mhaule, his former education minister, laughs\u0026nbspand says:\u0026nbsp“I don’t know.”But other officials say the mega-schools were overpriced projects to reward Mabuza’s allies and finance his ANC membership drive.Mabuza\u0026nbspwas sworn in as deputy president in February. “His passion,” reads his official biography, “still remains in education.”Minutes after the swearing-in, he faced questions about corruption and political killings in his province. “There’s nothing to set straight,” he told the national public broadcaster.“I’m here to serve South Africans,” he added. “Let’s give this government a chance.”Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/06/26/19/sainsburys-lorry.jpg","title":"sainsburysasda merger competition watchdog launches formal investigation","story":"Created with Sketch.CMA will consider whether the deal could lead to less choice, higher prices or worse quality services for shoppersClick to followThe IndependentThe merger will now be subject to what is known as a Phase 1 probe to assess how competition could be affectedThe competition watchdog has launched a formal investigation into the merger between Sainsbury\u0027s and Asda.The two supermarket chains announced the deal in May that would create a giant with around £51bn in sales.Now the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) will look into the merger after fears that the combined company could reduce choice for consumers.Sainsbury\u0027s needs a brolly as the other supermarkets bask in sunThe\u0026nbspmerger will now be subject to what is known as a Phase 1 probe to assess how competition could be affected.The CMA will consider whether the deal could lead to less choice, higher prices or worse quality services.The investigation\u0026nbspwill also consider whether the merged company could squeeze suppliers by using its increased buying power.Sainsbury\u0027s\u0026nbspand Asda\u0026nbsphave asked the CMA to use a fast-track process for the first phase of the investigation.Companies tend to do this when it seems clear that the watchdog will find competition concerns and then decide to carry out a more in-depth probe.If the merger is successful, the combined firm could account for around 30 per cent of UK grocery sales.A spokesperson for Sainsbury’s\u0026nbspsaid: “The combinatiom...\u0026nbspwill benefit consumers and the wider UK economy.

The fragment of jaw bone provides evidence of an east-west ide in the evolution of dinosaurs on the North American continent. During the Late Cretaceous period, 66 to 100 million years ago, the land mass was split into two continents by a shallow sea. This sea, the Western Interior Seaway, ran from the Gulf of Mexico to the Arctic Ocean. Dinosaurs living in the western continent, called Laramidia, were similar to those found in Asia1824 \u0027Male and female brains\u0027 aren\u0027t realBrains cannot be categorised into female and male, according to the first study to look at sex differences in the whole brain.

The fragment of jaw bone provides evidence of an east-west ide in the evolution of dinosaurs on the North American continent. During the Late Cretaceous period, 66 to 100 million years ago, the land mass was split into two continents by a shallow sea. This sea, the Western Interior Seaway, ran from the Gulf of Mexico to the Arctic Ocean.

This is inaccurate, the reason being that these images are not to scale.US ecologist Professor Bruce Lieberman, who co-led the University of Kansas team, said: “Maybe in the long term the best evolutionary strategy for animals is to be lassitudinous and sluggish.“The lower the metabolic rate, the more likely the species you belong to will survive. Instead of ‘survival of the fittest’, maybe a better metaphor for the history of life is ‘survival of the laziest’ or at least ‘survival of the sluggish’.”The findings, reported in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B, could have important implications for forecasting the fate of species affected by climate change, said the scientists.Dr Luke Strotz, also from the University of Kansas, said: “In a sense, we’re looking at a potential predictor of extinction probability.“At the species level, metabolic rate isn’t the be all, end all of extinction – there are a lot of factors at play. But these results say that the metabolic rate of an organism is a component of extinction likelihood.“With a higher metabolic rate, a species is more likely to go extinct. So, it’s another tool in the toolbox. This will increase our understanding of the mechanisms that drive extinction and help us to better determine the likelihood of a species going extinct.”Energy consumption had a bigger impact on species that were narrowly distributed, the researchers found.Species with a narrowly confined range were far more likely to go extinct if they had a high metabolic rate.Molluscs were used for the study because of the huge amount of available data on living and extinct bivalve and gastropod species.The team now plans followup work to see if “survival of the laziest” natural selection applies to other kinds of animals.Dr Strotz added: “There is a question as to whether this is just a mollusc phenomenon.“There’s some justification, given the size of this data set, and the long amount of time it covers, that it’s generalisable. But you need to look – can it apply to vertebrates? Can it apply on land?”The oldest animal ever known was a 507-year-old clam from the Icelandic seabed called Ming.\u0026nbspThe incredibly low metabolic rates of Ming and its fellow ocean quahog clams is thought to be responsible for their long lifes.Unfortunately, Ming’s long life was brought to an abrupt end in 2006 when scientists assessing its age killed it by opening its shell.Additional reporting by PAEnter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":null,"title":"subscribe to the daily edition our newspaper for your tablet","story":"For full functionality of this site it is necessary to enable JavaScript...Please follow the instructions in the link below.Please upgrade your browser to improve your experience."},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/08/22/17/rtx2kbjn.jpg  width= 2326  height= 1444  layout= responsive  srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/08/22/17/rtx2kbjn.jpg","title":"brexit latest no deal uk eu dominica raab brussels european commission","story":"Created with Sketch.The government will release its first batch of no-deal Brexit impact papers on ThursdayClick to followIndy PoliticsBrexit secretary Dominic Raab with chief European negotiator Michel BarnierDominic Raab risks new Brexit row with Brussels over no-deal preparationsCabinet minister Dominic Raab risks a new row with Brussels on Thursday as he demands the EU do more to ensure adequate preparation for a no-deal Brexit.The Brexit secretary\u0026nbspwill say British and European institutions have not been able to work together in enough areas to guarantee the smooth continuation of life if negotiations fail to reach a deal.The Independent understands some British officials feel that while member states are ready to begin no-deal preparation in more areas, the European Commission is not facilitating cooperation.It comes just a day after the commission’s chief negotiator Michel Barnier said he could see a “blame game starting against the European Union” over the issue of no-deal preparations.\u0026nbspThe British government will on Thursday release a batch of impact papers spelling out what action ministers will take in different areas of the economy.Mr Raab will say he remains confident a good deal that benefits both sides is possible “if the EU responds with the level of ambition and pragmatism”.The minister will add: “For our part, if the negotiations fail, we will continue to behave as responsible European neighbours, partners and allies.“That should extend to necessary engagement with our EU partners when it comes to no-deal planning.”Mr Raab said there were some good examples of where that was happening, like discussions between the Bank of England and European Central Bank.Tory MP and Johnson supporter calls for Brexiteers to join partyEU citizens will not be ‘turfed out’ of UK in event of no-deal BrexitBrexit ‘will leave UK with 380,000 care-worker shortage’ by 2026Travel industry bosses demand progress and a fresh Brexit referendumLeading Brexiteer Liam Fox complains Britons too obsessed with BrexitLabour faces pressure to change tack as Co-op eyes new Brexit voteBut he then added: “There are other areas where such engagement needs to take place, whether between the UK and the EU on data protection or between the UK and EU member states, for example between port authorities.“That is the responsible thing for us to do on all sides.”British officials are said to be frustrated that overtures from member states about cooperation on no-deal planning are not reciprocated by the commission’s officials, though EU officials in Brussels see things differently.Speaking from the Belgian capital on Tuesday, Mr Barnier said: “To be very frank with you I do see this blame game starting against the European Union in the case of no deal.

Could Brexit technical warning SCARE public into accepting Chequers de                \u0027All options on the table! Starmer says new Brexit vote still possibleHe added: \u0026ldquoThese technical notices - and the ones that will follow - are a sensible, measured and proportionate approach to minimising the impact of no deal on British firms, citizens, charities and public bodies.Mr Raab dsif yhr \u0026ldquochallenges presented by a no deal would also affect the European Union, adding: \u0026ldquoFor our part, if the negotiations fail, we will continue to behave as responsible European neighbours, partners and allies.Fears about the chaotic impacts a no-deal Brexit could have on the UK have been expressed by Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt and Bank of England Governor Mark Carney, as well as police chiefs, groups representing hospitals and ambulances, and the farmers\u0026rsquo union.But Dominic Raab has attempted to calm fears, and said in a press conference alongside Mr Barnier on Tuesday: As you will see when we set out our plans, some of these hair-raising scare stories are very far from the truth and I look forward to explaining the context on Thursday.See our live blog below for our latest updates on Brexit:Brexit: Dominic Raab will present advice on how to plan for the possibility of a no-deal outcome (Image: )1.05pm update: No deal Brexit preparation papers receive huge backlashThe first batch of no deal Brexit preparation papers has received a furious reaction from across the country.Welsh First Minister Carwyn Jones said the documents have shown the UK\u0027s no deal plans to be a bluff that was fooloing no-one.He said:\u0026nbspNo-deal would be a catastrophic failure of the UK Government that would cause huge disruption and serious, long-lasting economic and social damage to all parts of the UK.No-deal is not an option and the UK Government\u0027s bluff is fooling no-one.Shadow Brexit Secretary Sir Ken Starmer accused Mr Raab of being thin on detail, thin on substance and provided no answers to how ministers intend to migrate the serious consequences of leaving the EU without an agreement.He said: A no-deal Brexit has never been viable and would represent a complete failure of the Government\u0027s negotiating strategy.Labour MP David Lammy said the papers showed the Conservatives were playing Russian roulette with our economy.\u0026nbspDominic Raab\u0027s papers are nothing more than a cynical ploy to make whatever pathetic deal the Government brings back from Brussels look less terrible in comparison.Today shows that no matter how you voted in 2016, you need a say on the final Brexit deal. No-one voted for this disaster.1pm update: Government stands ready to deliver Brexit in the event of a no deal.\u0026nbspDominic Raab insisted that the UK Government is prepared to deliver Brexit for the British people if a deal can\u0027t be reached.\u0026nbspHe explained: By managing and mitigating the risks, by rising to the challenges and by seizing the opportunities that lie ahead.Mr Raab added lives and livlihoods in both the EU and UK should be put ahead of any narrow political interest.Raab unveiled his plans in Central London today (Image: SKYNEWS)12.40pm update: Lidington confident March exit date won\u0027t be pushed backDavid Lidington has said he was not surprised by Michel Barnier\u0027s suggestion that it was unlikely a deal would be reached before November, but is confident the March date for Britain\u0027s exit from the EU would not be pushed back.Speaking suring a briefing with reporters in Edinburgh, the Cabinet Office Minister said:\u0026nbspI was Europe minister for six years, I have seen enough of these negotiations to know that these deadlines slip.I think there definitely will need to be an agreement by the end of 2018.Mr Lidington continued: Article 50 is a matter of EU law, it is not a matter of political judgment.I think there is a real pressure from the end of the year because, with the European Parliament going into election mode it will just become more difficult to get enough MEPs in a plenary from January onwards to have the numbers to pass the super majority that is needed.And you\u0027ve got to get legislation through Westminster as well to implement a withdrawal agreement.He added: I just don\u0027t think that seeking to extend Article 50 is going to help. The Treaty is absolutely clear that it is two years or when a withdrawal agreement is reached or ratified if that is earlier.12.30pm update: Raab is unilaterally surrendering the British medicine industry, rages Batten\u0026nbspDominic Raab has been accused of unilaterally surrendering the UK\u0027s medicine industry to the EU, severely undermining the country\u0027s position.In his press conference, Mr Raab revealed Britain will unilaterally accept medicines from the EU passed by EU nations.\u0026nbspBut Mr Batten argued the EU is under no obligation to reciprocate.\u0026nbspHe said: One thing which stood out is the unilateral surrender of the UK\u0027s medicine industry to the EU. Raab said that we will accept any medicine that they produce without a reciprocal arrangement. He should have said that we are willing to do this if they are willing to reciprocate.It\u0027s all very well Mr Raab using UKIP sounding rhetoric, but to make Brexit work you actually have to believe in it.In the immediate future this will not be an issue since having been members of the EU for 45 years, all areas of our industry are in compliance with existing EU regulations.However in the mid to long-term HM Government is in a strong position to agree mutually beneficial arrangements since the UK is a major customer of EU-based businesses.Why can\u0027t HM Government ministers be stronger in their defence of British interests and rightly optimistic about Britain\u0027s future when we free ourselves from EU domination?                \u0026lsquoMay will SHACKLE us to EU forever\u0026rsquo - Rees-Mogg says \u0026lsquoCHUCK CHEQUERS\u0027                Borrowing down and employment up in Brexit UK, says Leo McKinstry8.30am update: Rees-Mogg calls on May to chuck ChequersBrexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg has implored Theresa May to \u0026ldquochuck Chequers and \u0026ldquobelieve in Britain in his latest bid to spearhead a Brexiteer revolt in the Commons.Writing in a letter addressed to grassroots Conservatives, Mr Rees-Mogg described the Prime Minister\u0026rsquos Chequers plans as the \u0026ldquowrong deal for Britain.The backbench Tory and 60 other colleagues signed the letter, which states the UK \u0026ldquodoes not need to do a deal with the EU, but the bloc \u0026ldquoneeds to do a deal with us at all costs.In the letter, leaked to the Daily , Mr Rees-Mogg said: \u0026ldquoThe Government would be wrong to be fearful of Britain enjoying an independent future.\u0026ldquoTheresa May\u0027s Chequers proposals would shackle us to the EU forever.\u0026ldquoWe would be out of Europe yet still run by Europe.\u0026ldquoThis is why the Prime Minister should \u0027chuck Chequers\u0027 and instead seek a Canada-style free trade agreement with the EU to make the most of the global opportunities that lie ahead.\u0026ldquoIt is time the Government realised that the EU stands to lose much from no deal being agreed and stopped being cowed by the EU\u0027s threats.\u0026ldquoIt is time to face down vested interests in the establishment and put democracy first.\u0026ldquoYet most of all, it is time \u0027to chuck Chequers\u0027, respect the referendum, be out of Europe, take back control and believe in Britain.8.20am update: Government to publish no-deal plans to tackle \u0027hair-raising scare stories\u0027The government is publishing advice about how to plan for the possibility of a no-deal Brexit in order to tackle hair-raising scare stories.\u0026nbspBrexit Secretary Dominic Raab, who will brief Westminster on more than 80 UK no-deal preparedness notices, is expected to say a good deal is in sight but we have a duty, as a repsonsible government, to plan for every eventuality.\u0026nbspHe will add: \u0026ldquoThese technical notices - and the ones that will follow - are a sensible, measured and proportionate approach to minimising the impact of no deal on British firms, citizens, charities and public bodies.Mr Raab is expected to say that many of the \u0026ldquochallenges presented by a no deal would also affect the EU, adding: \u0026ldquoFor our part, if the negotiations fail, we will continue to behave as responsible European neighbours, partners and allies.

We still have a probably good 18 hours or so until we are able to nail down where this is going to go but it\u0026rsquos going to be a major story either way.An update from the Central Pacific Hurricane Center in Honolulu at 1 pm BST said: General motion is expected to continue today, with a gradual turn toward the north-northwest.On Friday, a turn toward the north is anticipated as Lane\u0027s forward motion slows even more. A turn back toward the west is expected on Saturday.

Id wee in a bowl and pour it on the carpet but this made things worse as children who wet themselves are often accused of being possessed.Mardoche says he became withdrawn and felt he had no-one as his father was in the DRC.My relatives were clever. Although I was threatened, I wasnt beaten up. They were careful not to get caught.They took me to several pastors and advised me that the situation with my possession was so serious I would need to be sent back to the DRC.Thankfully, his school contacted social services. He ended up spending three months in a psychiatric unit as he became suicidal, before being placed in foster care.He is one of the lucky ones - if hed returned to the DRC it is likely he would have died due to the brutal exorcisms performed there.There, children are sliced by razor blades and knives in order to cut out the witchcraft, and have chilli pepper rubbed in their eyes.Dr Hoskins says: I also saw a little girl who was emaciated due to being starved for days - shed also not been given any water despite the boiling heat. She was almost at deaths door.Sometimes, children are pushed to the brink of death during exorcisms.Occasionally the perpetrators cross the line and end up killing the children in the process.This is what happened to 15-year-old Kristy Bamu, who was found dead in a bathtub in a council flat in East London on Christmas Day 2010.He had been staying with his sister Magalie Bamu and her boyfriend Eric Bakubi, when he was accused of bringing kindoki into their home.Kristy sustained 130 separate injuries after being attacked with an armoury of weapons - including metal bars and ceramic floor tiles smashed over his head - over a three-day period of exorcisms.He died due to drowning after being submerged in the bath towards the end of the ceremony.While in 2001, the torso of a young African boy, known only as Adam was found floating in the River Thames. He is believed to have been the victim of a brutal exorcism ritual.And Dr Hoskins says there could be many more cases of children that have been murdered that have gone unreported.Nobody is really sure how many cases there really are - of this kind of abuse and also children dying from it - because nobody wants to tackle it, he says.If you talk to anyone from these communities, they will say that pastors are pushing witchcraft beliefs on families.But because it is a belief system theres a perpetual fear [from the authorities] of stepping on peoples toes and causing offence.Half of UK police forces dont even record incidents and many local authorities are also unable to provide figures.We havent got past this political correctness when dealing with these case, adds Dr Hoskins.Because it is related to a belief system you hear from the Met police officers or even social services that they arent here to tackle beliefs, so nothing is done to stop it.But there needs to be a change because these belief systems tip over into abuse.Dr Hoskins says the witchcraft belief has roots in fundamentalist Christianity - where the words of the Bible are taken literally - and with traditional West and Central African superstitions beliefs.Theres a passage in the Bible that says sometimes a demon will be cast out and find seven more powerful ones, so even children that undergo exorcisms can be dragged through the whole system again a few months down the line, he says.But why is it children that are targeted?It is scapegoating, plain and simple, explains Dr Hoskins. Years ago, it was older women - the old crones who were branded witches.Many of these African countries have seen major problems in the last few years, such as civil war, economic deprivation and corruption - and when things go wrong in peoples lives they will blame a weaker party.Theres overpopulation too - Ive had people in these countries say to me that they cant afford to keep their children so they will force the idea of witchcraft on them in order to drive them out on the streets.Many children dont recover from the trauma of their abuse. Ive had them tell me their lives have been destroyed, says Dr Hoskins.Mardoche is one of the lucky ones: taken out of his abusive home, he built up his confidence through continuing to play football and now is a motivational speaker.He also works with various organisations to help teach people to spot the signs of children being accused of kindoki, and a film about his life, called Branded, will be released this autumn.However, he still lives with the effects of his experience.I find it difficult to get close to, and trust, other people, he admits. And at the time, I wanted to die. When youre constantly told youre evil, that youre to blame for your mothers death you start to believe it. Its not something that is easy to get over.My heart sinks every time I hear of another child being accused of being a witch, adds Dr Hoskins.The Government needs to take action to protect these young people and outlaw this belief system - we need criminal sentences for these pastors as what they are doing is abuse.We take a hard stance on terrorism in the name of religion, so there is no reason for us not to outlaw this. It leaves children mentally, emotionally and physically scarred for life.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Even those of us who will never hit the big time have an Instagram audience waiting to “like” our every selfie.So this is just the logical next step towards making cosmetic surgery available to the masses, rather than the few.Some have argued that Superdrug Botox is actually a good thing, because it bridges the gap between the elite Harley Street options — where you pay several hundred pounds for an appointment with an “aesthetic doctor” — and the more backstreet treatments carried out by hairdressers with just a few hours of training.I disagree. Being able to buy a syringe or two of Botox when you are out shopping for your hairspray legitimises — and normalises — the act of injecting poison in your skin in the name of beauty.Being able to buy Botox over the counter, so to speak, makes it seem like no big deal — just another tick in the “maintenance” box, and as reasonable as tinting your lashes or getting your ears pierced.And that is the problem. All decisions we make about our appearance boil down to personal choice. And if it makes someone feel better to tinker cosmetically or surgically with their natural looks, that’s their choice. No one should judge them for it.But there is a wider problem.Increasingly, women think that whatever they look like naturally isn’t good enough. More and more, the “solution” is invasive cosmetic enhancement.A mainstream shop making Botox available for less than 100 quid is surely only going to add to the pressure some women feel to change their appearance using more than just make-up.Superdrug presents itself as responsible because it will refuse to treat under-25s, when other clinics will.That is shocking — not so much that some clinics WILL treat under-25s but that anyone so young could think they need Botox.You can’t blame Superdrug for this epidemic. It is simple supply and demand.The question is: Why the growing desire among women to look frozen?It’s not like you can get away with saying you’ve not had it when you have, because it’s so obvious.I’ve got a friend whose husband jokes that she needs to hold up little signs saying “happy” or “angry” when she feels an emotion, since her face is so paralysed by botulism.While I’m a big believer in your body, your choice, I’m also a believer in scratching the right itch.The truth is if you feel good about yourself, you look good. If you feel bad and lack confidence, nothing, no amount of Botox or fillers, will ever change that.Just look at Meg from Love Island, above, who, even after an estimated £40,000 worth of plastic surgery, is still massively insecure.Because it’s not what’s on the outside that counts, it’s what’s on the inside.The problem is our society tends to give far too much weight to the outside. That is especially the case for women, but increasingly for men, too.I realise all of this is easy to say, harder to act on. I’m as susceptible as the next person to comparing myself with ­others more beautiful — and possibly more airbrushed — and finding myself lacking.I’m just glad that, when that happens, I know the thing that will make me feel better is far more likely to be self-acceptance than Botox.After all, if you tighten a prune you don’t get a grape — you just get a tight prune!So the really big question is, how to achieve self-acceptance when we are surrounded by all these images of perfection?Well, we are all on our own journey with that one but I’ve got some suggestions which might help.The first is to focus on what you have, rather than what you don’t. And the second is to never, ever compare yourself to anyone else.Forget Botox, you can have that advice for free.You’re welcome.We all enjoyed cheering on the Three Lions players that would quickly become our heroes during the World Cup in Russia this summer.Sadly, those heady days are over and we were reminded of the seamier side of sport this week with the arrest of England rugby union ace Danny Cipriani.His embarrassing brawl outside a Jersey nightclub came hot on the heels of England cricket’s Ben Stokes’ trial over his clash with two men during a night out.Stokes was cleared, but what links these sorry sagas is our drinking culture, which dictates that consuming excessive amounts of alcohol is a normal way of letting off steam.Sportsmen are supposed to be role models, as they influence young people and need to keep themselves in good physical shape.But as long as we think it is OK to binge and push our bodies to the limits rather than sip a few drinks, then violence, injuries and stupid mistakes will continue to be a regular feature of our nights out.And if you are an England sports star, then public shame is just one of the tragic consequences – along with the end of your career – that you might have to face.Why should anyone be surprised at the news that sexual harassment in the police force is rife?Let’s face it, it happens everywhere. So why should the police be any exception?I thought they might hold themselves to higher standards. But no.A new survey reveals that dirty jokes, inappropriate touching, leering and being pressured to have sex are daily issues for many police staff.In a survey of almost 1,800 police staff in England, Wales and Scotland, half had heard sexualised jokes and one in five had received a sexually explicit email or text from a colleague.Shockingly, one in five had also been touched in a way that made them feel uncomfortable.Our head of police at West Ham is a woman.She is smart, tough, brave and would never put up with this type of behaviour.Part of the problem is that many women accept these actions as “normal” and don’t even know how to object. We must learn to stop putting up with it.But it is much more important that men learn what is OK and what is not.End of.Jacinda Ardern – the Prime Minister of New Zealand, who has continued to work since becoming a mother in June – was criticised this week for “using her baby as a prop” after she was seen breastfeeding her daughter at a public meeting.I guess whoever coined that phrase has never had the experience of looking after a baby who needs to be fed – right NOW.Nor will they have dealt with the very loud consequences of that failing to happen.Instead, what about congratulating Jacinda on doing such a great job of being a working mum?We said farewell to two legends last week, let’s remember them with this wonderful meme....So interesting that the day after A-level results arrived, more than 26,000 university places were still available.An Ipsos Mori poll found that while most students still think university is “important”, that is down from 86 per cent five years ago to 75 per cent now.Since a degree is expensive – and no guarantee of a job – you can see why people are questioning the validity of one.However, there is no viable alternative.There are just 10,000 degree-level apprenticeships available, compared with 300,000 university places, according to Sir Peter Lampl, of the Sutton Trust.We need to think how we prepare young people for work and we need more technical qualifications at degree level that offer the chance of a bright future.GOT a story?

The public are wise to it.Our poll makes it clear that fudging Brexit would unleash serious anger among the electorate. The Government should take notice.Almost half of voters already reckon that the political classes in Britain are making heavy weather of Brexit, in the vain and misguided belief that they can get the public to change their mind.Meanwhile, the drop in support for Theresa May in the polls and Ukip’s rise is a further indication of what the public thought of her Chequers proposals.Millions more will abandon the Tories if Brexit ends up being fudged.Remoaners and Brussels have done their best since the Leave vote to make us think we made a terrible mistake and that the cards are stacked in the EU’s favour.Well, today’s poll is clear. We didn’t and they’re not.DEFENCE Secretary Gavin Williamson was right to stand up to France after they tried to bill us £2million for helping them stamp out a jihadi insurrection in Mali.Mr Williamson reportedly threatened to ground our choppers in retaliation.

It is whether the PM herself will seize the initiative and signal her own plan to jump before she is pushed.The undeclared contest has transformed Britain’s negotiating stance — from Theresa May’s meek, slow-motion surrender to a strident demand for a decent, honourable settlement. The good news is that while MPs have been away on holiday, Brussels has begun to blink.At long last it has dawned on our EU neighbours that they have more to lose from a messy Brexit than we do.Forfeiting the UK’s £40billion ransom payment — plus our annual £12billion contribution — would instantly cripple the EU expansionary budget plans and plunge poorer nations such as Greece into crisis.Car and pharmaceutical giants, not to mention French farmers, who export vast stocks to the UK, would be plunged into crisis. Cooperation on crime, security and defence would be at risk. Governments across Europe are now piling pressure on Brussels to see sense.Tory leadership wannabes have sniffed the way the wind is blowing.The Tories won’t pick another Remainer as party leader. Nor does this Government have a prayer at the next election unless it can see off Nigel Farage and his Ukip insurgents with a deal that satisfies the 52 per cent who voted Leave.This explains a sudden enthusiasm at the top for stating the blindingly obvious: Britain will survive a clean Brexit, while an obstructive Brussels will be diminished.After two years of being bossed around by EU bully Michel Barnier, senior Cabinet ministers are coming out as born-again Eurosceptics. Foreign Secretary and repentant Remainer Jeremy Hunt admits Britain will experience some turbulence, but says the EU will be damaged “for a generation”.His warning is echoed by Brexit supremo Dominic Raab, who has rubbished “Project Fear” stories about food and medicine shortages.While loyally insisting a deal is “still the most likely outcome”, Mr Raab insists Britain will cope with the alternative.Hunt and Raab are now openly jockeying for the top job — along with Home Secretary Sajid Javid, Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson, Treasury chief Liz Truss and a host of others.Significantly, Michael Gove seems out of the race after endorsing Mrs May’s Chequers sellout. So where does this leave Boris Johnson? If tens of thousands of grass- roots Tory supporters have anything to do with it, he would be way out in front. As things stand, they don’t.BoJo is out of office and fighting confected outrage over Muslim face masks. Enemies such as the priestly Dominic Grieve threaten to quit the party if he is elected.Under present rules, Boris needs enough support from fellow MPs to be one of the two candidates submitted to party members for a final verdict. His rivals will do anything to stop him — which is why party activists are demanding rule changes to allow any MP with 20 votes to enter the final ballot.Boris has gone quiet — but not for long. He is reportedly planning a nationwide tour — complete with bright-red battle bus — trashing Mrs May’s Chequers deal and calling for a clean Brexit.There will be plenty of opportunities for car-crash interviews and zipwire-style TV images. But the bookies aren’t the only ones making BoJo the clear favourite as Britain’s next Prime Minister.He names Somalis, Ethiopians, North and Central Africans and Afghans as being responsible for the knife-gang slaughter of young black and Asian men.“Race is part of the picture,” says the equality campaigner. “Failing to point this out impedes the fight against these crimes and imperils yet more children of colour.”He is right, isn’t he?But how long before this decent black man is himself accused of racism for daring to tell this unvarnished truth?Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Will our current free movement regime be rebadged as a “Labour Mobility Framework”?Such a move, speculated on in the media this week, would be politically toxic and very poorly timed. It would also betray her own instincts, which she rightly gave voice to when she became Prime Minister.Striking a chord with millions of people angry and alienated at their voices being ignored by the political elite on immigration and the downside of globalisation, delivered for her record poll ratings then and a real feeling of hope that at last people in power were listening.Yes, the main driver for the Leave vote was about democracy, independence and national sovereignty but it was also about the fundamental choice that a UK outside the EU would have: Who comes to our country and on what basis – decided by our own Parliament.Voters have noticed that the tightening of the labour market and record employment levels, as revealed by the Office for National Statistics last week, mean that at long last real wages – i.e. pay packets less inflation – are slowly rising and that belatedly big business is beginning to move away from an over reliance on cheap foreign labour, undercutting the pay and conditions of indigenous workers and giving rise to higher welfare dependency.It might seem a radical concept, but such employers might just have to pay workers decent wages, train them better, improve their skills and try hard to retain them. That’s why EU workers are still coming to the UK in huge numbers, despite ridiculous Project Fear stories to the contrary.So yes – Brexit will mean higher pay for British workers! Top businessman Stuart Rose, briefly spokesman for the Remain campaign, accurately predicted such a development before the EU Referendum.Regrettably, the multinationals’ trades union, the CBI didn’t get the message: No surprise that they now want no restrictions on foreign workers post Brexit – in other words an endless pool of cheap labour just like now.Likewise, they’re happy to defend the growing gap between average pay and that of FTSE 100 bosses.Ironically, The Prime Minister could still snatch victory from defeat on this issue, notwithstanding her lamentable record as Home Secretary on reducing net immigration to the tens of thousands.The alternative White Paper which David Davis and his Ministers were working on prior to it being dumped at Chequers, was much more evidence-based and looked to many workable international examples of mobility agreements between first world countries like Australia, the United States, Japan and Canada, as a model for future EU-UK immigration arrangements, to our mutual benefit.The policy would have been informed by the Migration Advisory Committee which reports next month, focused on what was the sensible policy for the whole of the UK and all business sectors rather than a noisy minority and their well-paid advocates.It also sought to end the systemic bias towards low paid and low skilled EU citizens over the well qualified from across the globe.It was pro controlled immigration and not about pulling up the drawbridge and that’s where most British voters are now.Will Theresa May use the opportunity to keep faith with the millions of people in the north and the midlands, in south Wales and south west, who look to her to keep her promises and defend their interests and not just those of the well heeled, the multinationals and those comfortable with the Brussels status quo?Will putative leadership contender Sajid Javid have the courage to resist further attempts at craven supplication on continuing free movement in all but name? Will Conservative MPs who benefited from the highest ever blue collar vote for their party in history, ignore their own electors’ concerns and just accept further concessions?The electoral prospects of her party depend on it.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Routine use of drugs and synthetic highs, brazenly dropped by drones flown in by crime gangs.It’s not about whether prisons are run by the private or public sector. Too many of both are in a parlous state. Cuts have bitten too deeply — and the Government has just hoped for the best.It cannot go on.

Appropriation.In the eyes of today’s politically correct policers of “wrongthink”, there is no greater crime than cultural appropriation.Cultural appropriation is when people embrace the grub or music or ideas of a culture that isn’t theirs.Like when Kylie Jenner wore her hair in cornrows. Or when Katy Perry donned a Japanese kimono. Or when drunken lads on a university campus put on sombreros as they neck shots of tequila.All of these things have been branded cultural appropriation by today’s potty warriors against “offensiveness”.And to this blacklist of things we must never appropriate, we can now add non-native foods.This is not the first time Jamie Oliver has been criticised for making foreign dishes. Two years ago foodies were up in arms when he put chorizo in paella — which the Spanish tend not to do.Clearly Jamie Oliver is only allowed to cook “white” British food, like roast beef and toad-in-the-hole.Not Cornish pasties or Yorkshire puddings, though.After all, what right does a man born in Essex have to appropriate the food of Northerners and people from the West Country? And presumably Dawn Butler only ever tucks into Jamaican dishes.If it is cultural appropriation for Oliver to make jerk grub, surely it must be cultural appropriation for Ms Butler to rattle up a bit of sushi?This would be the crazy conclusion to the war on cultural appropriation — none of us would ever dip into other cultures and experience their pleasures.What is most depressing about the Butler/Oliver spat is that it confirms how mainstream the miserabilist, divisive PC worldview has gone.It used to be just time-rich posh kids and snowflakes on university campuses who raged against cultural appropriation.Like the officious students at Cambridge who banned an Around The World in 80 Days fancy-dress party for fear students would wear “culturally appropriated” costumes.Or the clipboard bores at the University of East Anglia who banned students from wearing sombreros.Or the easily offended muppets at the University of Ottawa in Canada who banned a yoga class, because for white people to indulge in this ancient Indian discipline is an act of “cultural genocide”.I bet you never knew that when you do a pelvic tilt at your local gym you are being a horrible racist.Now, however, with Butler’s missive against the crimes of Jamie Oliver, this PC claptrap has crept from the fringes into the political centre. Butler is Shadow Secretary for Women and Equalities, and she is very close to Jeremy Corbyn.Is this what we should expect under a Corbyn government? Finger-wagging at anyone who deviates from PC rules?The worst thing about the clampdown on cultural appropriation is how divisive it is. The message is that we must always stick with our own cultures and never borrow from others.Didn’t that used to be known as racism?In recent years, Beyonce has been slammed for wearing a sari. Glastonbury has banned attendees from wearing Native American head-dresses. Selena Gomez was ridiculed for doing a Bollywood- inspired dance on US TV.This new racial divisiveness makes ­culture stiff and dull.Anthony Horowitz, author of the Alex Rider teen spy novels, says he was “warned off” from writing a black character. Apparently a white writer like him ­cannot understand the black experience.Is this really the world we want to live in? Where people never mix and never try to empathise with those who have had different life experiences to theirs?We should stand up for cultural ­appropriation.The global intermingling of food and fashion and art has enriched human life.As the great American novelist Lionel Shriver reminds us: “People with different backgrounds rubbing up against each other and exchanging ideas and practices is self-evidently one of the most productive, fascinating aspects of modern urban life.”Yet in their Brave New World, everyone would stick to their own people and their own ways. What a dispiriting, divided world that would be.I would far rather live in a world than has Jamie Oliver jerk chicken in it than in such a racially regimented PC nightmare.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Hold a door open for someoneLaura McIntosh from Whitworths, which commissioned the research to launch its Do Good Feel Good campaign, said: “We lead busy lives, but it’s important to find the time to do good deeds for others and help people out.“That’s why we’re challenging the nation to give it a shot and do a good deed, whether giving up a seat on public transport, letting someone out in traffic or simply saying hello to a shop assistant.Not only does it brighten their day, but it will also make you feel good too, so it’s a win-win for everyone!”Although three quarters of Brits said they often do nice things for other people, just 63 per cent reckon they are the sort of person who does ‘good deeds’.Two-thirds are most likely to do kind things for family members, and nearly half will do so for friends.But less than one in 10 will more typically carry out thoughtful gestures for strangers in need.The research also found one quarter will help out their community by attending sponsored events and one fifth will volunteer their time for local school or church events.When thinking about the last time they did a good deed, three in 10 said they have done something nice for someone else in the last week, but one in 20 haven’t done so for a month or longer.Yet 85 per cent reckoned they could do more ‘good deeds’, with one fifth saying they don’t do more because they have enough of their own problems.Four in 10 don’t have the money to do more good deeds, with 44 per cent saying they don’t have the time.And more than two fifths agreed they only really do good deeds for others in the hope their kindness will be reciprocated.The study also found 68 per cent think good deeds often go unnoticed by people around them.And just half said others will do nice things for them.One quarter said neighbours often do ‘good deeds’ for them, with one third being on the receiving end of a thoughtful gesture from work colleaguesJust one in 10 would describe themselves as being more mean spirited than kind hearted, with two-thirds agreeing the opposite is true for themselves.Laura McIntosh added: “We carried out this research as part of a campaign to encourage people to Do Good and Feel Good.We’ll be doing our own acts of kindness over the next fortnight so keep an eye out for our Whitworths Shots team who will be rewarding people for doing good, with free samples of Whitworths Shots as well as plenty of treats and surprises, making them feel good too."},{"url":null,"title":"funny pictures people day ruined","story":"Do you wish you had captured the exact moment words failed you and you crossed into the land of disbelief?

Supplies won’t dry up and prices for drugs won’t rise.Mr Raab will also make a plea to Brussels to mimic Britain by being “responsible European neighbours, partners and allies,” suggesting it would even be sensible to work together “when it comes to No Deal planning.”But on Wednesday Labour’s Owen Smith MP hit back: It beggars belief that more than two years after the Brexit vote, the Government are making speeches and publishing ‘notes’ on what happens if they can’t secure a deal.”The Best for Britain backer, warned: “no amount of contingency planning or spin can hide the fact that the peace and prosperity of our country is at risk.”Last night, Tory Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg urged the party to “respect the referendum”.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

She was given $130,000 (£100,000) to keep quiet before the 2016 presidential election and signed a non-disclosure agreement before the vote.Michael Cohen today admitted paying both Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal to not sell their story to the mediaLike Stormy, Karen shopped her story around before the election, too, telling of how he treated her like a “prostitute” after they met at the Playboy mansion in 2006.Karen eventually sold it to the National Enquirer for $150,000 (£116,000) but the publication, whose CEO is a personal friend of Trump, never ran it.Last month a leaked tape from 2016 revealed Trump and Cohen discussing reimbursing the magazine to suppress the story.The recording is reportedly one of a dozen that the FBI seized from Cohen during raids this year.But could Trump be prosecuted?Cohen’s lawyer Lanny Davis said yesterday: “If those payments were a crime for Michael Cohen, then why wouldn’t they be a crime for Trump?”Steve Bannon, Trump’s former strategist, said on Tuesday: “November (the mid-term elections) is a referendum on impeachment — an up or down vote. Every Trump supporter needs to get with the programme.”It was just four months after the birth of his youngest son Barron in March 2006, following his marriage to Melania the previous year, that Trump met Stormy.The porn star — whose real name is Stephanie Clifford — says she had “textbook” unprotected sex with Trump, then 60, at a celebrity golf tournament in Nevada, of which her adult film company was a sponsor.Stormy, who was 27 at the time, told a US magazine that he invited her to dinner and she found him watching TV in his pyjamas when she arrived at his room.She said: “I was like, ‘Ha, does Mr Hefner know you stole his outfit?’ I was actually really mean to him.“He got all huffy and tried to play it off and was like, ‘Oh, I just thought we would relax here’.We ended up having dinner in the room.“He talked about himself and bragged about his photo on a magazine.I said, ‘Someone should take that magazine and spank you with it’.“So he turned around and pulled his pants down a little, he had underwear on and stuff, and I just gave him a couple of swats.”Stormy, who appeared in 2007 romcom Knocked Up, said Trump told her not to worry about his marriage to Melania.The pair had sex, which was “nothing crazy”, according to the model.Stormy added: “I actually don’t even know why I did it, but I do remember while we were having sex, I was like, ‘Please, don’t try to pay me’.”She told US TV show 60 Minutes in March — in an interview watched by an incredible 23million viewers — of how she was allegedly THREATENED by a mystery man to keep quiet.The thug allegedly approached her in a car park in Las Vegas, prompting her representatives to release a sketch of the culprit.Stormy recalled: “A guy walked up on me and said, ‘Leave Trump alone. Forget the story’.“Then he leaned around and looked at my daughter and said, ‘That’s a beautiful little girl. It’d be a shame if something happened to her mum’.Then he was gone. I was rattled.”Cohen, who worked at the Trump Organisation for more than a decade and continued to serve as Trump’s personal lawyer after the 2016 election, has admitted paying off Stormy.In April this year, aboard Air Force One, Trump insisted he did not know Stormy had been paid by Cohen.This was contradicted a month later by Trump’s new lawyer, former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, who said the President had paid Cohen back.After Cohen’s court admission on Tuesday, a delighted Stormy, who pulled out of Celebrity Big Brother last week, tweeted: “How ya like me now?! #teamstormy.”She had been performing at strip clubs across the US as part of a Make America Horny Again tour, before being arrested last month for touching a customer at the Sirens club in Ohio.The charges were dropped the following day.Last month her husband of eight years, heavy metal drummer and adult film actor Glendon Crain, filed for divorce, seeking sole custody of their seven-year-old daughter.Glendon accused his wife of adultery.Stormy, speaking of Trump on TV’s Loose Women this week, said: “I think he’s a man who’s gotten in over his head.”By contrast, former Playboy bunny Karen, 47, has kept a lower profile, despite describing in interviews how she bedded Trump “dozens” of times during a ten-month affair.While Stormy hoped that Trump would not try to pay her after their night together, that is exactly what he tried to do after meeting Karen at the Playboy mansion in 2006.The model, then 35, told how she and Trump had sex on their first date — but she went home “crying in the back seat of a car” after he tried to pay her.She said: “After we had been intimate, he tried to pay me.Later that year she was given an apartment in New York City as a Christmas gift by Trump.She said that Trump would often brag about his daughter Ivanka, 36, and that he would tell her she was just as pretty as her.But she also recalled feeling guilty when she went to Trump’s apartment and he showed her Melania’s separate bedroom.Karen said: “I thought maybe they were having issues. I couldn’t wait to get out of the apartment.”During their affair she also featured in a photo with Melania and Trump at a party, at which she says she “tried to keep her distance” from the now First Lady.Karen expressed regret over the affair, adding: “When I look back, I know it’s wrong. I’m really sorry for that.I know it’s the wrong thing to do. There was a real relationship there and I was kind of out of sight, out of mind with everything else.”Karen, named the 1998 Playboy Playmate of the Year, added: “He always told me he loved me.He would call me ‘baby’ or he’d call me ‘beautiful Karen’.“There were feelings between the two of us.I didn’t know he was intimate with other ladies.I thought I was the only one.“The only regret I have about the relationship that I had with Donald was the fact that he was married.If he weren’t married, I wouldn’t have any regrets because he treated me very kind.”Whether Karen and Stormy will be Trump’s undoing remains to be seen.Richard Johnson, a US politics professor at Lancaster University, doubts whether Republican senators would be willing to convict a Republican President if he was impeached.But as Trump laughs off the scandal on Twitter, he is likely to need to save his sense of humour for the rocky months ahead.A ballot in the House of Representatives determines if the case goes to a second vote in the Senate, which can then decide to force the President out of office – but only if two-thirds agree.If Trump goes, Vice President Mike Pence will take over.Bill Clinton was impeached in 1998 and 1999 on charges relating to a sexual harassment lawsuit – but later acquitted. In 1868, President Andrew Johnson was acquitted by one vote.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But that’s where we have got it so wrong.It comes as no surprise that nearly 50 per cent of UK schools are failing to achieve the target 25 per cent of A-level entries in STEM subjects — science, technology, engineering and mathematics.The nation is crying out for STEM skills. It is estimated there is a STEM-worker shortfall of 40,000 — and it is set to rise. We are facing a national crisis.Yet schools are rewarded on delivering grades, not different subjects. And this relentless focus on grades means youngsters are potentially being deprived access to high-paid and fast-growing careers.Research shows interest in maths and science dramatically declines during secondary school.When it comes to gender, there is a big difference. Interest in STEM subjects drops by 56 per cent among boys and 74 per cent among girls.Quite often girls underestimate their performance and, although they get better grades in maths and physics at GCSE, fewer of them take the subjects at A level than boys.There is this perception that you have to be a genius to do maths or science, but that is not true.Often teachers will say unless you get a grade A in maths or science at GCSE, don’t even bother taking it for A level. The reality is, even if you get a lower grade in the subject, it is still viewed very well by employers. Even if you take just one STEM subject, it will open up so many more doors.This is one of the reasons I created Future Finder, a free app to show young people the relationship between subject choices and their career pathway.After all, this is about preparing them for a job, not getting them to the top of the school system.Science is also fun, it is creative. It’s not dull and nerdy, which is how it is often perceived.We need to tell youngsters there are such jobs as autonomous vehicle engineers, gamification designers and carbon capture technicians, because you can’t be what you can’t see.Sixty-five per cent of children entering primary school now will end up working in jobs that don’t yet exist. And unless young people are learning the right skills, they’re not going to get them.Nearly 30 years ago, when I set up a data analysis company with my husband Clive, people threw data away because it was too expensive to keep. We went on to create Tesco Clubcard, the world’s first supermarket loyalty card.We were only a small business, but we had the skills to figure out something Tesco couldn’t on its own — exactly what its customers were buying.It revolutionised the way we shop, the supermarket doubled its market share within the year and we went from employing 30 staff to 1,500.We were at the forefront of a new science and it was an amazing time.I’m incredibly lucky and I’ve had a brilliant career. Now I want to help give back by preparing tomorrow’s talent.I was the chair of Your Life, a national campaign to encourage youngsters to consider careers in STEM.As a result of that movement, the Government now gives schools an additional £600 per pupil studying maths at A level.Figures also show that STEM subjects are becoming more popular. More than a third of all A-level entries in 2018 were in these subjects and more girls are taking STEM subjects.But we are already far behind countries such as America and China. That gap is only going to get wider too, as we estimate we will need 1.3million more science professionals by 2030.If schools are the talent factory then we need to deliver the skills the nation needs. We must start by giving extra weighting to maths and physics when it comes to measuring a school’s success.We are defined by the talent coming through our schools.

The first five are taken from three Foundation papers, while the final five are taken from three Higher papers. The system, implemented by the Government, sees grades A* to G replaced with a numerical 9 to 1 system.A 9 is the top grade and 1 is the lowest pass, with a fail still called a U.The top two marks of A and A* are roughly equivalent to a grade of 7, 8 or 9.The good pass marks of B and C have been replaced by grades 4, 5 and 6.And at the lower end of the scale, the grades D, E, F and G will now be scored 1, 2 or 3.Results also improved for pupils in Northern Ireland, where pupils sat exams under the old A*-G framework.There the proportion of students awarded A*-C grades rose by 0.7pc to 81.1pc, while one in ten received the top A* grade.A small proportion of 30,000 students in NI - around 2,900 - were awarded number grades instead due to changes by English exam boards.In contrast in Wales, where exams also continue under the old system, the percentage of pupils achieving the key pass benchmark of five A* to Cs has fallen for a second year running to 61.6pc.The new system was introduced in England to toughen up GCSEs and to allow more differentiation among the brightest candidates - with only 732 students achieving the clean-sweep of 9s in all their subjects.These exams were piloted in Maths and English in 2017 before being were rolled out across 20 other subjects in English schools for the first time this year.Todays results showed that boys are closing the gaps, with 17.2pc scoring an A or a 7, up from 16.4pc last year, while girls results remained static at 23.7pc.Meanwhile popular subjects are shown to include computing, with 11.8pc more entries this year.Foreign languages were up 0.4pc this year and the most popular GCSE was the science double award, making up 14.6pc, followed by maths, English and English literature.1.

Many years in the making, these new GCSEs are more challenging and will better prepare students for further study or employment.Students picking up their results today can be confident they have achieved the grades their performance deserves."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/NINTCHDBPICT000428224327.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"british airways lose engagement ring flight london las vegas","story":"James Stannard stashed the heart-shaped diamond ring in fiancee-to-be Laura Dilworths check-in luggage to stop her stumbling across it.But he was left horrified when the case went missing after touching down in the city -  and was later found ransacked with no sign of the engagement ring.The heartbroken couple, of St Albans, Hertfordshire, complained but an independent claims ombudsman has since ruled the airline was not liable for the cost of the ring.Laura told The Sun Online: Im devastated weve had to go through something like this.It was meant to be a wonderful and life-changing experience, but instead it could have ruined our relationship.We both feel like were cursed now.

The couple own other properties too.Baroness Shami ChakrabatiThe shadow attorney general and has said that she is against the reintroduction of grammar schools because they “segregate” young children.But it was revealed her 13-year-old son was admitted to the selective Dulwich College, which charges fees of £18,000 a year.Speaking to ITV she denied being a hypocrite, saying: “I live a charmed and privileged life, much more now than I ever did when I was a child, but people on the Left have often had charmed and privileged lives.“I live in a nice big house, and eat nice food, and my neighbours are homeless, and go to food banks.And not forgetting... Jeremy CorbynThe Labour boss grew up in leafy villages and large houses including the seven-bedroom Yew Tree Manor in Chetwynd - once part of an estate owned by the Duke of Sunderland.According to Rosa Prince, Mr Corbyns biographer, he enjoyed a thoroughly upper-middle-class, scruffy country upbringing.He attended Castle House Prep school and then a grammar - before going travelling around Jamaica and Latin America in a fashion similar to todays gap yearsI think there can only be one reason why he is doing this, which is to create an atmosphere of resentment and prejudice, to presumably suit his political purposes.Bob Seely MP described Mr Corbyns team as a bunch of posh Marxists.But there are others in his team who come from more down to earth backgrounds.Shadow Education Secretary Angela Rayner left school when she got pregnant, and went on to work as a care worker.Rebecca Long-Bailey, who grew up in Old Trafford, began her working life in a pawn shop, and also worked in call centres, a furniture factory and as a postwoman before she went on to become a solicitor. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The Chinese are very active word of mouth marketeers themselves, so by embracing their language and social media platforms, thats the thing that really seems to be working for us.The restaurant had already been popular with locals, but now the Chinese tourists have given it an international reputation.Most of the Chinese foodies visiting the restaurant buy its traditional cod and chips, but the shop has had to cater to some unexpected requests.More than £7.2 billion of British goods were exported to China in 2010 alone, and demand has been rising ever since.Among favourite buys are Land Rovers and Burberry clothes, as well as Scotch whisky.Burberry even launched a 21,500 sq-ft flagship store in Beijing to capitalise on their Chinese popularity.Tony said: They generally want hot water because they bring their own Chinese tea, and its generally tea leaves rather than tea bags.And then some of them actually want a pint of beer, so were fully licensed and have beers on draught.The best seller is a pint of Yorkshire bitter to go with their proper Yorkshire fish and chips - they absolutely love it.When Xi Jinping dined with David Cameron in 2015, he also tried Greene King IPA, causing a surge in demand for the beer in China.Scotts Fish and Chips opened in December 2012 and has won awards thanks to its rave reviews on TripAdvisor.Chef Manager Roxy Vasai was also nominated for Young Frier of the Year in 2016 which celebrates young talent in the fish and chip business.Tony puts the restaurants success down to its core values of great value and service.The tourists get a discounted rate of £9.00 for cod and chips.Tony said: Everybody gets a warm welcome when they walk in the door and the Chinese are always smiling.They want to eat their fish and chips, take their pictures, and then go on to the next attraction."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/NINTCHDBPICT000428389882.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"no deal brexit papers dominic raab","story":"The cost of using your card in Europe will likely increase, according to a new set of documents on the No Deal scenario.The papers also revealed the Government plans to slap VAT on deliveries from Europe, increasing the price of most goods by 20 per cent.Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab published the 25 documents in order to show that Britain can thrive even if we leave the EU without signing a deal with Brussels.They contain advice to firms and individuals on how to protect themselves from short-term disruption if No Deal does come to pass.The papers show:But there will be a knock-on effect if the EU doesnt guarantee the same arrangements for British banks, the paper says.It reads: The cost of card payments between the UK and EU will likely increase, and these cross-border payments will no longer be covered by the surcharging ban.That means companies will have the right to charge consumers extra fees for using credit cards - potentially leading to bigger bills for customers of firms like Ryanair and Airbnb.Another blow would come from the end of current arrangements which mean that low-value goods being delivered from Europe to Britain are exempt from VAT.The documents - dubbed technical notices by ministers - also show that even in a No Deal scenario, the Government will seek to strike a series of limited mini-deals to stop trade between Britain and Europe grinding to a half altogether.And firms were advised to employ a customs broker to help them do business in Europe and negotiate new border checks between Britain and the continent.Despite todays announcements, Mr Raab said he is confident that hell be able to strike a comprehensive deal with the EU over the next few months.And he mocked suggestions that the military would be deployed to secure Britains food supply - saying: You will still be able to enjoy a BLT after Brexit.Speaking in London, Mr Raab revealed that another 9,000 civil servants could be hired to make sure the UK is ready for all Brexit scenarios.He said: Our institutions will be ready for Brexit, deal or no deal.And he highlighted the potential advantages to Britain from No Deal - including scrapping the £40billion divorce payment we have agreed to pay Brussels.The No Deal documents cover sectors such as financial services, the nuclear industry and international charities.They reveal that British pensioners could be unable to claim payments without a deal on cross-border transfers between Britain and Europe.But ministers will avoid disruption to the NHS by unilaterally allowing drugs and medical devices to enter Britain from the EU without new checks.Earlier today, Mr Raab denied that No Deal would lead to widespread chaos.He told the BBCs Today programme: There are risks here, but lets not have the risks blown out of proportion, out of context,I dont think the word turmoil will appear in the technical notices.He added that there is already a stockpile of 200 vital medicines in case of border disruptions, and pledged to ensure there will be a six-week supply of the drugs.But Mr Raab also said the No Deal plans will probably never be needed because he is close to striking a deal with EU envoy Michel Barnier.He insisted: Im still confident a good deal is within our sights.We have got agreement on about 80 per cent of the issues.Shadow Brexit Secretary Keir Starmer claimed the release of todays technical notices was a sign of panic from ministers.He said: No Deal has never been a viable option. It has never been credible and I dont think the Prime Minister thinks it is a viable option.Dressing up the severe consequences as if that could be accepted or that could somehow be smoothed, is not to reassure anybody."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/NINTCHDBPICT000428185460.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"bird photograph of the year 2018","story":"Peruvian photographer Pedro Jarque Krebs scooped £5,000 for wowing judges with his piece, Black Friday.Mr Krebs felt the title was appropriate because the flamingos reminded him of the fights on the renowned day of shopping.This group of American flamingos were captured mid-fight in a Madrid sanctuary.Competition organiser and judge Rob Read said: Bird Photographer of the Year 2018 attracted an impressive standard of photography and it and it was going to take a truly impressive image to win.Black Friday is an image which is nothing short of explosive it made an instant and lasting impression on a panel of judges who are determined to push the boundaries of perceived convention.Naturalist and TV presenter Chris Packham said: Here is evidence of our great love of birds.You can sense the ambition, see the dedication and feel the passion of the men, women and children who have striven to capture the unparalleled wonder of nature in these images."},{"url":"https://e3.365dm.com/18/08/2048x1152/skynews-istock-neanderthal_4398349.jpg?20180823015427 ","title":"corbyn proposes digital bbc to rival netflix and facebook funded by tech giants","story":"And he said the BDC could work with other institutions a Labour government would set up such as a National Investment Bank and a Strategic Investment Board for increased public engagement and control.\"Imagine an expanded iPlayer giving universal access to licence fee payers for a product that could rival Netflix and Amazon,\" he said.\"It would probably sell pretty well overseas as well.\"     Mr Corbyn appeared to dismiss the BBC\u0027s large digital platform, saying it was \"mainly a broadcaster\" and the BDC would be \"purely digital\".The Labour leader slated the state of Britain\u0027s media, saying when it comes to news and current affairs \"our media is failing\".To open the media up and \"make it more plural\", he called for journalists to be able to elect their editors, saying  does this so there is \"no reason\" it could not happen everywhere.Mr Corbyn said, despite what people would think, he did admire journalists - his first job was on a local paper - and even called reporters who risk their lives for freedom \"heroes of our time\".\"Not many people know this about me but the media is very close to my heart,\" he said.\"I think about them every single moment of the day - and sadly they think about me every single moment of the day as well.\""},{"url":"https://e3.365dm.com/18/08/2048x1152/skynews-gcse-stress-exam_4398364.jpg?20180823042859 ","title":"gcse pass rates rise after major shake up of grading system","story":"Alongside making exams tougher, the government has brought in a numerical grading system, with 9-1 replacing the grades of A*-G.After a trial last year, 23 exams were graded in this way in England, with all entries expected to be marked with numbers instead of letters by 2020.The sciences, popular foreign languages, history and geography have all moved over to the new system, following on from English and maths, which moved over last summer.Only 732 pupils in the whole country scored a clean sweep of top marks, consisting of all 9s.

Pensioners who have contributed to schemes in Europe now risk losing access to their pension funds if they are paid into a UK bank account, according to leaked documents obtained by the Sun. Current Brussels rules state that pensions from member state countries must be paid into EU accounts, meaning UK residents would be forced to open accounts on the continent to collect their allowance. Britain is expected to leave the UK in March 2019 as fears of a no deal Brexit grow in Westminster and abroad.  The UK will become a third country if it crashes out of the single market without a deal, severely curtailing access to pension benefits for OAPs. The stark admission shows Ministers are braced for lost access to pensions for UK expats in the EU.  The revelation is amongst 25 \u0027technical notes\u0027 contingency plans published by Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab on Thursday - who says his department has a duty to plan for every eventuality. He added the plans are “a sensible, measured,and proportionate approach to minimising the impact of no deal on British firms, citizens, charities and public bodies.” "},{"url":null,"title":"jeremy corbyn accuses private companies","story":"NewsJeremy Corbyn accuses private companies of profiting from the misery of asylum seekersHe spoke out after Serco announced a plan to change the locks on the homes of would be immigrations whose applications had been refusedShare\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspCommentsByJason BeattieHead of politics20:47, 22 AUG 2018NewsLabour leader Jeremy Corbyn at Possilpark parish church in Glasgow to meet with asylum seekers who are being threatened with eviction by Serco.

Labour\u0027s leader claimed most of our citizens think our newspapers churn out fake news day in, day out as he outlined his plans today in Edinburgh. Mr Corbyn - who very briefly worked as a reporter on the Market Drayton Advertiser 48 years ago - has regularly criticised the media but also praised public interest reporting and the Manchester Evening News. He suggested letting journalists elect their own editors and the public electing members of the BBC board to break the stranglehold of elite power and billionaire domination over large parts of our media. Amazon and Netflix could face paying a \u0027digital licence fee\u0027 and the Corporation could be forced to reveal the social class of its bosses, workers and contractors.  The owners and editors of most of our country’s newspapers have dragged down standards so far that their hard working journalists are simply not trusted by the public, he said. It’s a travesty. A free press is essential to our democracy, but much of our press isn’t very free at all. Mr Corbyn claimed our news media is failing due to an unhealthy herd instinct, and the unhealthy sway of a few corporations and billionaires shapes and skews the priorities and worldview of a powerful section of the media. He added: I want to see journalists and media workers set free to do their best work, not held back by bosses, billionaire owners, or the state. The suggestions are not yet Labour party policy - they are still in development. Here are seven of the most significant.  Mr Corbyn said: In the digital age, we should consider whether a digital licence fee could be a fairer and more effective way to fund the BBC.  A digital licence fee, supplementing the existing licence fee, collected from tech giants and Internet Service Providers, which extract huge wealth from our shared digital space, could allow a democratised and more plural BBC to compete far more effectively with the private multinational digital giants like Netflix, Amazon, Google and Facebook. 2. The licence fee could be cut for poorer households  Charging tech giants could also help reduce the cost of the licence fee for poorer households, Mr Corbyn said. TV licences are already free for people over 75 or discounted for people who are blind or in residential care. 3. Journalists could elect their own editors  We should also think about ways to empower journalists, audiences and readers and reduce the power of media bosses and owners in the private sector, he said. One of the more radical and interesting ideas I’ve heard, which limits the power of unaccountable media barons without state control, is to give journalists the power to elect editors and have seats on boards for workers and consumers when a title or programme gets particularly large and influential. If, for example, an outlet gets a certain audience share, then its journalists could be given the right to elect their editors, making them accountable to their staff - and their journalistic ethics - as well as to corporate bosses and shareholders. 4. BBC bosses, staff and even contractors could be forced to reveal their \u0027social class\u0027  The BBC could lead the way by setting best practice with complete transparency on the makeup of its workforce by publishing equality data, including for social class, for all creators of BBC content, whether in-house or external, he said. 5. The public could elect BBC board members Mr Corbyn said: One proposal would simultaneously reduce government political influence on the BBC while empowering its workforce and the licence fee payers who fund it. That would see the election of some BBC Board members, for example of executive directors by staff and non-executive directors by licence fee payers. To help decentralise the BBC, national and regional boards could also be expanded, with elections by BBC staff and local licence fee payers. All boards should be representative of the country, with a minimum representation for women and minority groups. He claimed: These elections need not be difficult to run and could build on the BBC’s current experiments with digital sign-ins.  6. Freedom of information laws could be expanded The Tories have shown disdain for FOI, the Labour leader said. We have already said that we would expand the [2000 Freedom of Information] Act so it covers private sector providers of public services. But I think we should be more ambitious. Currently, ministers can veto FOI releases. On two occasions, this veto has been used to block information about the UK’s decision to pursue military action against Iraq. That can’t be right. We will look at ending the ministerial veto to prevent the Information Commissioner being overruled. 7. Local newspapers could become charities "},{"url":null,"title":"most unpleasant no deal brexit","story":"NewsNo Deal Brexit plans REVEALED: All the grimmest small print as Tories issue 25 crucial warningsTories have published 25 notes warning of the consequences of No Deal Brexit.

Calming fears of the unlikely event like an air steward, he added: You will still be able to enjoy a BLT after Brexit, and there are no plans to deploy the army to maintain food supplies. But as reassuring as this must be to everyone, by no means is it all good news. Mr Raab sensationally admitted the government is poised to recruit 9,000 new civil servants to work on Brexit - on top of 7,000 already - and said: Real livelihoods are at stake here.  Mr Raab also announced plans to recruit 1,000 more Border Force staff, on top of current recruitment for 300 border staff that is already underway.  Buried in hundreds of pages of small print of his No Deal \u0027technical notices\u0027 - of which there will eventually be about 80 - are some proper nasties that would make life more difficult in the UK. Already the plans have prompted outrage. Shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer said: A no-deal Brexit has never been viable and would represent a complete failure of the Government\u0027s negotiating strategy.  Welsh First Minister Carwyn Jones added: The writing is on the wall. No-deal would be a catastrophic failure of the UK Government that would cause huge disruption and serious, long-lasting economic and social damage to all parts of the UK. TUC general secretary Frances O\u0027Grady said the reports confirmed no-deal Brexit would be devastating for working people. Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) National Chairman Mike Cherry said: The dangers of a sudden and unplanned no-deal Brexit have today been laid bare. So what do the documents say? We\u0027re rounding up what we\u0027ve found in the worst of the small print. 1. It will cost you more to use your credit card  The cost of using a credit card to buy goods or services from an EU company is likely to rise. That is because cross-border payments will no longer be covered by the EU\u0027s very recently introduced credit card surcharge ban. In 2015, British consumers were charged \u0026pound166million. Remain-backing peer Lord Adonis, of the Best for Britain group, said: No one voted for this two years ago.  Companies based in the EU, such as Airbnb and Ryanair – both used by millions of people – would no longer be bound by rules limiting what they can charge UK customers who pay by plastic. Who even knew that card payments were going to be affected by Brexit. It\u0027s time for a people\u0027s vote. 2. It will cost more and take longer to buy anything from the EU  This one is somewhat obvious but the papers confirm it in all its horrifying detail. If there’s no deal, UK-based payment service providers such as PayPal would lose direct access to the EU’s central payments structure.  This mean customers “could face increased costs and slower processing times for EU transactions”, the papers say. Meanwhile, the papers sketch out a whole load of new hoops UK businesses would need to jump through before importing goods from the EU. They include registering for a UK Economic Operator Registration and Identification Number and submitting import declarations to HM Revenue and Customs. Businesses are being advised directly by the government to look into buying up warehouse space for goods awaiting customs approval.  A stockpile of six weeks\u0027 worth of 200 medicines already exists due to the threat of French lorry strikes. But now the government is asking pharmaceutical companies to ensure they have an additional six weeks supply of medicines in the UK - on top of their own normal stock levels. The warning comes in a letter to pharma firms today by the Health Secretary Matt Hancock. Brexit Secretary Mr Raab told the BBC: There are potential issues around the border in the worst case scenario. So it\u0027s right, too, we will be working with industry around stockpiling of medicines for a working assumption of six weeks. 4. UK farmers face NINE-MONTH wait for exports that could bankrupt them  UK farmers face a crippling nine-month wait for approval to export organic goods to the EU. That is because logos on packaging would need to change, with UK producers being forced to drop the EU\u0027s organic food logo.  Yet the farmers would not be allowed to apply for this change until 30 March 2019 - and there is a nine-month wait. We are exploring alternative approaches that should speed up this process, say the technical notes - but they don\u0027t explain what those approaches will be. Lib Dem MP Tim Farron, of the Best For Britain anti-Brexit group, said: A nine month wait for organic farmers to sell their produce into their biggest market would see farmers up and down the country wiped out. The Government’s disastrous mishandling of these negotiations looks almost certain to lead to British organic farmers being put out of business – nobody voted for that. NFU President Minette Batters said: Not only would this be hugely disruptive but it threatens livelihoods and businesses in the UK. 5. Expat Brits could lose access to their pensions  It doesn\u0027t look good for Brits living abroad who still have a bank account in the UK.  They may face restrictions on their ability to borrow money and in accessing certain insurance.  In particular, UK expats in the EU could lose access to their pension income and other financial services, the papers warn. Lending and deposit services, insurance and annuities - which people rely on for a regular pension income - could all be affected. The notes warn that UK citizens abroad may lose the ability to access existing lending and deposit services, insurance contracts (such as life insurance contracts and annuities) due to UK firms losing their rights to passport into the EEA.  If there\u0027s no deal, any parcel from the EU to the UK worth up to \u0026pound135 would have VAT charged on top.  It could be charged to the overseas firm sending the parcel - which in turn would charge VAT on customers at the point of purchase. This means a hike of around \u0026pound20 on mid-value parcels being sent into Britain in a No Deal Brexit. 7. EU workers will lose an important voice in the workplace  No new requests to set up European Works Councils will be accepted after a No Deal Brexit. These are bodies within a company that represent European employees and keep up communication between them and management about the progress of the business. Labour - who repeatedly claimed Brexit could be an excuse to water down workers\u0027 rights - slammed the plans. Shadow Business Secretary Rebecca Long-Bailey said: The Prime Minister has waxed lyrical about protecting workers’ hard-won rights after we leave the EU. However, as is typical with this Tory Government, it was nothing but meaningless empty rhetoric. By not allowing new European Works Councils to form, nor having a contingency plan to replace them, the Tories are leaving British workers at a disadvantage compared to their EU colleagues. Leaving workers out of the loop and out of negotiations with management about pay and their terms and conditions. 8. New medicines will face a major chunk of red tape  New medicines will need UK approval before they can be made available to patients in the event of a no-deal Brexit. The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), which regulates drugs in the UK, will take on the functions of the EU if an agreement is not reached by March 29. Products will have to go through national assessment before they receive market authorisation to be sold in the UK. The notice states: After EU exit, to market a product in the UK, an initial market authorisation application will need to be submitted to the MHRA and will go through a national assessment. MHRA will take a streamlined approach to approving UK market authorisation applications that places no greater burden on industry and ensures that patients can access new and innovative medicines at the same time as EU patients. Most new medicines currently come to the market through a licensing route overseen by the European Medicines Agency (EMA). 9. Brits could face longer queues at Dover  We\u0027re still not sure on whether Kent\u0027s main motorways will be turned into a lorry park as some experts have warned. There is still no clarity on whether customs will be collected at the border delaying lorries coming into the UK.  But the note does admit that officials will need to minimise delays.  It says: HMRC will work closely with industry to ensure its interventions are conducted in a way which minimises delays and additional burdens for legitimate trade, while robustly ensuring compliance.  10. There\u0027ll be new horrifying pictures of lungs on cigarette packs  We know, we know - get your tiny violin for costs incurred to tobacco firms. But really, tobacco companies will have to come up with some new horrifying pictures of people’s lungs - because the “existing picture library is owned by the European Commission”. The Government says cigarette and tobacco packets will have to have the new pictures from day one of when we leave the EU. 11. Bad news for hunters?  The European Firearms Pass would no longer be available for people in the UK taking their personal firearms to the EU. They should still be allowed to take them as a temporary export.  However, they would need to be sure that the individual country will let them re-export them - i.e. bring them back to the EU. 12. Britain\u0027s men could have to do more masturbating.

Draft contingency plans include a mass import of generators to ensure sufficient capacity. The news comes as the Government today publishes the first in a series of papers setting out consequences of no deal. They are thought to cover aviation safety, nuclear power, medicines, rights of Brits living in the EU, haulage and fishing. But the Tories are said to be hiding Belfast energy plans because they are so “incendiary”.  Business Secretary Greg Clark is believed to have discussed a deal to keep the lights on in Northern Ireland when he visited on 6 August. A UK government spokesperson said: “It is of course right that we prepare for any eventuality, including the unlikely event that we do not come to an agreement with the EU. “As outlined in the EU Exit White Paper, negotiators have already made good progress on a legal provision to underpin the Single Electricity Market in the Withdrawal Agreement and the UK will work with Ireland and the EU in an effort to ensure that the Single Electricity Market is maintained in any future scenario. Tanaiste Simon Coveney downplayed concerns. He tweeted: Stories about electricity in N Ireland post Brexit should be kept in context. The all-island energy market is one of the great North/South successes that all sides are determined to protect. Tomorrow Brexit Minister Dominic Raab is expected to play down announcements as part of the duty of “a responsible government, to plan for every eventuality”. He will urge the EU to be “responsible” and “pragmatic”. And he says the UK will take “unilateral action irrespective of EU reciprocation” to assure EU citizens in the UK that they will not be “turfed out”.

The mutinous comments are a major blow to the ex-chief whip, who spent months after his Cabinet promotion courting the media and holding high-profile political rows.

According to the newspaper, Mr Williamson came out with the idea of putting really expensive guns on tractors at a summit on the equipment budget. Witnesses were described as open-mouthed and didn\u0027t know where to look. Mr Williamson has since denied making the comment, according to the newspaper. But during a meeting with Polish counterparts, he was also said to have suggested disguising a missile defence lorry as a Coca Cola truck. No one really knows why, a disgruntled staffer told the Sun.

The whistleblower says he snapped the photos on his final day when the toilets were strewn with rubbish and the floors were covered in grime. He claims staff didn\u0027t have any hand wash to use after going to the toilet, and workers at the Cabot Circus shop in Bristol were forced to use a dirty old mop without cleaning products. The man accused the firm of disregarding the welfare and hygiene of its workers, telling Bristol Live that its one of the reasons he quit.  He claims he was immediately shocked at the poor state of the rooms when he joined the sports fashion store, and colleagues said he wouldn\u0027t want to go in the toilets because they are so gross. Having worked in a number of other shops in the city, including H\u0026ampM and Primark, he said he had never seen that level of uncleanliness in the work place.

It really feels like they could not care less about the welfare and hygiene of their workers. I\u0027ve never worked in a place like that before, it felt uncomfortable and disgusting. He said on his first day he was asked to clean the staff area which he explained involved picking up all the rubbish and taking out the bins.  The man, who worked at the shop for a month, added: We tried to mop but as you can see from the picture the mop is very dirty and we had no liquid to use. I know they ask staff to sweep up sometimes but if you want people to clean then you need to give them the stuff to do it with. “Same for the surfaces and the bathroom, there was no cleaning products.

And while pupils in the north and the Midlands still achieved well over 60% passes at grade C/4 or above, marks were lower overall with the West Midlands coming bottom with 63.1 percent. In England London produced the highest amount of students achieving grade A/7 and above at 25.2% and the north east saw the least with 16.7%.

The \u0027little house\u0027, as it is known, is a scaled down, two-storey, white-washed thatched cottage gifted to Princess Elizabeth and her sister Margaret by the people of Wales in March 1932, to mark Elizabeth\u0027s sixth birthday. For the last eighty years the house, dubbed \u0027the most glamorous wendy house ever\u0027 by Princess Beatrice, has been a play den for subsequent royal generations. It measures 24 feet long and eight feet deep, according to the Daily Mail, and has five feet rooms. The front door opens onto a small hallway with a kitchen.  A staircase goes up to a bedroom and a bathroom, which, when it was first built had hot and cold running water, a heated towel rail and electricity. Inside it had all the furnishings you would expect in a real home, including a tiny radio, a little oak dresser, a miniature blue and gold china set and linen with the initial ‘E’ paintings on the walls, comfy armchairs, fireplaces and even a fully-laid table and chair set. A bookcase was filled with Beatrix Potter’s little books. Designed by architect Edmund Willmott as a link between the Welsh workers who lived in cottages and the Princesses. Stunning archive pictures from the 1930s show the then Princess Elizabeth and her sister Margaret posing outside the ‘little house’ which was moved to the grounds of the Royal Lodge of Windsor. In 2012 Princess Beatrice revealed she had lovingly oversaw the restoration the cottage over a course of a year.  She said: Granny was very clear that for all the fabric she wanted very little designs. It’s such a little house that she wanted little flowers and patterns’ she said. It’s beautiful. I’ve been lucky enough to play here and now Granny’s a great-granny, so now Savannah [Peter and Autumn Phillips’s daughter] can enjoy it too.

Her parents Billy Mower and Rebecca Champ had family over to their house in Gillingham, Kent for a family barbeque in May last year. Assistant coroner Katrina Hepburn explained how this was just another normal day for Macey and that she received lots of kisses and cuddles from her family. She said that Macey was described as a normal healthy baby who was developing well, Kent Live reported.  The barbeque went on from 3pm until 8pm and Macey was regularly fed.

Cindy Moore, 29, used to weigh 17 stone and wear a size 24, but after dropping nearly seven stone and six dress sizes, she started flaunting her new look in racy Instagram photos. Dressed in fishnet bodysuits, schoolgirl-style skirts and extra small bra tops, Cindy says she posts the pictures for herself rather than anyone else. The mum from Manchester said: “I think people just think you post these pictures because you want sex or you want a man but I post the pictures because I think - wow!  You look great. I just post it because it makes me feel good.  “When I put a certain outfit on I just feel powerful strong, sexy - and slutty! “The sex doll look is big lips and big boobs. I don’t know if it was the look I was aiming for at first – people just said I had that look.” In spite of her doll-like appearance, Cindy has only had one breast augmentation, but has regular lip fillers and maintains her hair extensions. She claims looks are in part due to her natural face and love of make-up. “My mum says I have a sexy face, so if your mum says that then, your mum doesn’t lie,” Cindy laughs. “The boob job was quite a bit and with make-up and all I’ve probably spent close to \u0026pound10,000. “I would like to go a lot bigger, probably about 2000cc.” Before her double Ds, Cindy was an A cup and although her increased bust size improved her confidence, Cindy struggled with the weight she put on as a young mum to her nine-year-old daughter Lacey and son Max, seven, Cindy said: “Before I had my kids I was always extra small in clothes size and then after I had my kids I just gradually gained the weight. I had my daughter, I gained weight then I had my son and I gained weight. “And then at the time I was going out with a guy who was into bodybuilding so I was feeding him up all these meals with loads of carbs because he wanted to get really muscular and what happened in the process is he went to about nearly 17 stone in muscle and I was 17 stone in fat.”  At her heaviest, Cindy says she was “about size 24 to 26 and nearly 20 stone.” Vowing to get fit and be a more active mum, it wasn’t until Cindy split up with her ex that the pounds really started to drop off. She said: “Just to keep my mind off what was going on with us I thought: ‘I’m gonna focus on making myself as healthy as I can be and getting in good shape ‘so I just started working out all the time. “Now I’ve lost the weight it’s so nice I can wear what I want. It gives you that new lease of life and when my kids see me they run up to me and they are proud of me whereas before they used to put their head down.” Working out five times a week and well on her way to a six pack, not everyone, however, has reacted to Cindy’s weight loss positively. Cindy said: “When I am out and about in public I get a lot of people staring at me and a lot of people look at me - guys will whistle at me and look at me but nobody will talk to me. “When I was bigger lots of girls wanted to be my friend and as I started to lose the weight I went back to be just being on my own again.” The mum-of-two has also faced criticism for posting overtly sexualised photos on social media while bringing up two children under the age of ten.

The new grades were phased in in 2017, starting with three subjects last summer, with most others expected to adopt the system by 2019. Once that happens all GCSEs taken in England will receive numerical grades, but teachers say the switch is causing unnecessary confusion and will ultimately increase pressure on pupils. Here is everything you need to know about the new GCSE grades and how they will impact your children. What is the new grading system?  Pupils are graded from 9-1 rather than A*-G, with 9 being the top grade and 1 the lowest. The new scoring system was first brought in for English language, English literature and Maths. That means students taking GCSEs will receive a mixture of number and letter grades when they receive their results.  Why were the grades changed? The new grades were introduced as part of a new curriculum that was introduced in 2014 in a bid to drive up standards. The government said new GCSE content will be more challenging and fewer grade 9s will be awarded than A*s. Courses are designed for two years of study and are no longer be divided into different modules. Students take all their exams in one period at the end of their course. The idea is to create more differentiation at the top end of the scale to allow sixth forms and universities - and employers - to understand what level the young person is at.  There are actually two pass marks now as schools will be judged by the proportion of pupils that achieve a standard pass and above a grade 4 as well as being held to account for the proportion of pupils that get a \u0027strong\u0027 pass - grade 5 or above.  Is a 9 the same as an A*? How do the new and old grading systems compare? No, not really. The new grading system is a grade 7 is equivalent to an A, while 9 is above an A*. A grade 4 is basically a C. The idea is very few will get a 9 as they will be rationed.  If you get 7s and 8s that\u0027s very good.  Grades 6, 5 and 4 are comparable to a B or C, while a 3 is similar to a D. Grades 2 and 1 are comparable to E, F or G. The new system has kept U for ungraded. What are the new grades?  The top is 9, lowest is U.  Do I have the grades needed for sixth form? This will depend on your sixth form. Speak to the admissions officer at your preferred sixth form to check you have the grades you need.  The same applies for vocational courses.   Why are the reforms being criticised? The NASUWT union said the reforms are creating huge uncertainty for schools and will heap more pressure on pupils. It also fears the new scale will close some educational opportunities for students. The union says there is confusion over grade boundaries.

Victory came on Tuesday when Environment Minister Michael Gove vowed to ban the sale of puppies and kittens by pet shops and other dealers supplied by commercial puppy farms.  This will mean that anyone wanting a pet will have to go to rescue centres or deal directly with the breeders, so they\u0027ll be able to see the conditions in which the dogs are kept.  “I\u0027m over the moon,” said Paul O\u0027Grady, presenter of the long-running hit show For The Love Of Dogs featuring Battersea Cats \u0026amp Dogs Home. “The campaign has been smashing, it\u0027s great what\u0027s happened, all power to you.”  Paul\u0027s work filming dogs at Battersea means that he routinely sees first hand the grisly evidence of puppy farming. “I\u0027m not hardened to it, each case sickens me,” said Paul, the proud owner of five dogs. “You can always tell a female dog that\u0027s been overbred, the teats are on the floor, the vets can tell when they\u0027ve had too many litters. “I\u0027m constantly saying it on the show, never buy a dog over the internet, go to a rescue centre or a reputable breeder and ask to see the mother, and the puppy should never leave the mother until it\u0027s the right age. “You get internet sellers selling puppies that have not even been weaned. They will die, they will have all sorts of diseases.” Dragon\u0027s Den star Deborah Meaden called the government backing of Lucy\u0027s Law “fantastic news, adding: Thanks to a committed band of supporters”. Another Dragon, Jenny Campbell, tweeted “Awesome result”.  Ricky Gervais posted: “Unethical puppy and kitten farms \u0027to be banned\u0027 in England!”, while Broadcaster Kirsty Gallacher wrote: “What a victory, what a day!”  The message from model Jodie Marsh of Celebrity Big Brother to the army of Lucy\u0027s Law supporters was: “You are wonderful human beings!!!!!!!! What an achievement.”  MPs from across the political spectrum were full of praise.  Conservative Andrea Jenkyns, who spoke-up for Lucy\u0027s Law in Parliament, tweeted “fantastic news”. Labour\u0027s Chris Evans posted: “We need to make sure the legislation has teeth now so it’s a real deterrent against this cruel practice.”  Caroline Lucas of the Greens said: “This is great news! Government has finally listened to campaigners who have long been calling for a ban on third party puppy sales.” Numerous charities told of their delight on social media, such as Animal Advocate which wrote: “Can\u0027t thank everyone enough for making my \u0026amp their dream come true.” Rescue charity The Animal Team posted: “Thank you for all that you have done to stop the misery of puppy farms, together we are making a difference”. The K-9 Angels called it a “Truly a great day for animal welfare”, adding “Thanks to all Lucy\u0027s Law supporters”. From the National Animal Welfare Trust there was the message: “Today is a great day for animal welfare and the NAWT is thrilled that the government has announced that they are committed to implementing #LucysLaw to ban third party sales of puppies and kittens.” Will Travers of the Born Free Foundation wrote: Animal champions every one of you - and a brighter day dawns for puppies and kittens. News of the victory went global, thrilling dog lovers campaigning against puppy farming in their own countries.

Princess Diana\u0027s former butler Paul Burrell has said he thinks Prince Harry is taking a leaf out of his mother\u0027s book by freezing Meghan\u0027s dad out. The 60-year-old described how Diana would have been furious if someone had betrayed her trust in the way Thomas Markle has - and causing the newlyweds problems.  In this week\u0027s New! magazine, he said: I\u0027ve been in similar situations where people said things about Princess Diana, and the way she dealt with it was by freezing them out. It looks as if Harry has taken a leaf out of his mother\u0027s book. Diana said, \u0027Once someone burns the bridge of trust towards you it\u0027s very hard to repair it. He added that the apple doesn\u0027t fall far from the tree.  Last month, Thomas Markle said his daughter is ignoring him and has changed all her numbers since marrying Harry - but warned he won\u0027t be silenced . He has since claimed that he hung up on Harry after a row on the phone over his interviews with the media and the alleged staged paparazzi photographs. Meghan\u0027s family have slammed her as being inhumane for cutting out her dad. Speaking to the Mirror , her brother Tom Jnr, 51, said: “Throughout our lives, dad always put Meg first, above me and my sister, but if what he is saying is true it appears she is abusing his love for her.  Meghan\u0027s estranged half-brother has also questioned why the royals don\u0027t treat them like the Middletons - and hopes to patch things up . However, Burrell reckons there\u0027s one key thing that distinguishes Meghan from Diana in all this family turmoil. He said that life is not going to be easy for Meghan, but said the Duchess of Sussex has something that Diana never had - a man stood beside her who truly adores her.

The Albany School in Hornchurch, Essex has seen this year\u0027s GCSE results shoot up by an impressive 10 percent in just a year. Headteacher Val Masson, who introduced the behaviour policy to improve grades, has dismissed claims the policy is old-fashioned and plans to introduce even stricter rules in the future. Under the scheme pupils are banned from talking to each other walking between lessons and three times a day in the playground when lining-up before classes.  Ms Masson said the new rules have transformed the classrooms and led to a spike in results, particular in core subjects such as English and Science. She now plans to bring in stricter behaviour policies by introducing four weekly compulsory silent revision sessions. She said: “These fantastic results showcase the impact this new behaviour policy has already started to have on our students in a very short space of time. “We have some way to go but with our new compulsory silent revision sessions for Year 11s being introduced next year, we expect results to get even better.  “These teaching methods have been called old fashioned but I would describe it as pure common sense. “Students deserve the right to learn in a calm, quiet and academic atmosphere. Education is crucially important to the life chances of young people. We have to get it right for them. “These results show that we are on the right track and are giving students the chance to fulfil their potential.” Ms Masson, who took up her role in April 2017, said results for Ebacc subjects - core subjects including English, Maths and Science - went up by 10 per cent thanks to the academic atmosphere created by the rules.

In the note, Natasha Abrahart described how the “last few days have been hard” and she had been having “suicidal thoughts. The 20-year-old also suggested she had already attempted to take her own life, but her cry for help reportedly went unanswered, a pre-inquest has heard.  Natasha was in her second year of studying Physics at the University of Bristol, which has been hit by a string of suspected suicides. The student was the 10th of 11 students at the university who are believed to have taken their own lives between October 2016 and May 2018, Bristol Live reports. Natasha was found dead in her Park Street flat, Bristol, on April 30 this year. A coroners court was told the university had first been aware of Natasha’s mental health difficulties in October.  Things escalated in February this year, and she had concerns around missing lectures and being docked marks for her absence. She had emailed a member of staff at the School of Physics in February, saying she was having suicidal thoughts. However, no one at the university’s student wellbeing service got in direct contact with her and the last time she emailed the university was more than two months before her death. The court was told her personal tutor had barely had any contact with her, and no one checked if she was okay. Her family questioned if the university “could and should” have done more to help her. She had also been in the care of Avon and Wiltshire Mental Health Partnership (AWP) NHS Trust when she died. A pre-inquest review on Wednesday, laid out the witnesses which will give statements or appear in Avon Coroners’ Court when the inquest resumes later this year.  The court is expected to hear from her personal tutor, lecturer, GPs, the university’s student health service, AWP and mental health charity Off the Record. During the short hearing, senior coroner Maria Voisin was told there had been no contact with the student wellbeing service, despite university staff knowing she was unwell. Tom Stoate, who was representing the family, said: “We feel the university could have and should have done something. There was no direct contact with the student wellbeing service.” He questioned if that was the “appropriate response” from the university, given the nine Bristol students before Natasha who had killed themselves. Mr Stoate added: “There had been no further contact with any tutor or the School of Physics. We have got questions if that is sufficient, in particular for someone so vulnerable she had attempted suicide. “There was very limited contact between Natasha and her personal tutor. What we want to know is why there was such limited contact when the role of the personal tutor was to support her.  “We want to know what adjustments were made to accommodate the vulnerabilities Natasha appeared to display.” The coroner will also be asked to look into how Natasha had “fallen through the gaps” and if communication between AWP, the GP service and the university could have been better. A spokesman for the university said: “We offer our sincere sympathies to Natasha’s family following her tragic death and will co-operate fully with the coroner to ensure any lessons learnt are built into the support we provide our students. “Mental health and wellbeing is fast emerging as the single biggest public health issue affecting young people today, both here in the UK and globally. “We are taking every step we can, to work with our students to help them build the life-skills and resilience to cope with the pressures they face, and to identify vulnerable students as early as possible so we can support them with their mental health issues. “Our whole-institution approach will help us reach out to our students more proactively. We are putting in place a structure of preventative services and policies to try and avoid our students reaching crisis point. “Mental health leads from the NHS and Public Health England are actively engaged in the planning and development of this approach.” The case continues with another pre-inquest review later this year.

And a new study of more than 1000 primary school children might just back up that claim. Research by Keep Britain Tidy has uncovered that a staggering third of youngsters aged 5-11 have NEVER ridden a bicycle.* It means millions of kids are missing out on what has long been considered a fun-filled rite of passage, up there with learning to swim or mastering the monkey bars. Cycling is an incredibly important skill for kids to have - not just for the fun of it but the independence it gives you as you grow up, being able to visit friends, get to school and explore the countryside. How to get your kids involved  A great way for parents to get kids started on two wheels is with a balance bike. These give them skills that will translate well when they get on a big bike. They start by pushing themselves along and as their confidence grows they can lift their feet and coast along.    The Carrera Coast Balance Bike (above), \u0026pound68 (save \u0026pound7), is a great starting point for kids aged three to five. Or go for the Apollo Wizzer Balance Bike Pink (below) at \u0026pound50 (save \u0026pound55).  Once they\u0027ve learnt that skill then they can upgrade to a bigger bike. Some kids go from a balance bike and never need stabilisers.  Older kids will love the Apollo Starfighter (above), \u0026pound60 (save \u0026pound40). Its 16-inch wheels are perfect for ages 5-8 (depending how tall your child is), and there\u0027s even at attached foam shooter gun! Don\u0027t forget to pick up a helmet, too. A well-fitting helmet can seriously reduce the risk of a head injury, so you should get your kids in the habit of wearing one whenever they are out on their bikes.  Feel free to let your kids pick a helmet that suits their personality. That way there will be no arguments when it comes to popping it on. Halfords stock a range of fun \u0026pound10 helmets, including designs like the Apollo Cupcake Kids Bike Helmet, Stars Toddler Bike Helmet, Apollo Police Patrol Kids Bike Helmet or the stylish Polka Dot Toddler Bike Helmet (above).For extra safety, get your little ones a set of X Rated Kids Knee \u0026amp Elbow Pads for \u0026pound15. Other childhood traditions which are under threat… 1. Playing conkers   Despite the myths, the Health and Safety Executive has never demanded that kids wear goggles to play conkers, and a lot of schools don\u0027t actively ban the sport. (You can check if yours does.) But this misconception might be why 72 per cent of kids have never played conkers. If you are worried about your little one getting injured while going head-to-head with a real shiner, Halfords does have a stylish set of Draper Expert Anti-Mist Safety Glasses (above), \u0026pound6.99. 2. Building a den One of the most surprising stats is that 60 per cent of kids have never built a den. This is sad, because it’s so easy to with either bits you have around the house or by spending a few pounds to make something excellent. If you have a tent it makes a great starting point. You can connect boxes to the door to make an exciting tunnel and you can fill the tent with pillows and cushions to make it soft and exciting.

Amanda Kelly, 26, struggled with thoughts of suicide and alcohol addiction when she was at her lowest point. Her life began to spiral when she felt alone and isolated at university, and she turned to alcohol and junk food to cope. Amanda told the Manchester Evening News that she struggled for years until she made the decision that it was time to sober up for good.  At university, she would often skip class and call in sick to her nursing placements, and eventually dropped out. Amanda, from Stretford, Greater Manchester, said: “I failed because I was drinking, and I was drinking because I was depressed because I was failing. It was a vicious circle. Things began to fall apart when she began her nursing degree at the University of Chester in 2010. She said: “I really enjoyed it at first, but it was long placements, 14 hour shifts, and I still had to keep on top of my assignments and university work.  “I lost touch with friends, and I relied on junk food and comfort food. “I’d eat a sausage and bacon sandwich every morning and a meal deal at lunch, then in January 2011 I met my current partner (Chris Iacovou). “We spent every day together and would eat takeaways, and we had a canteen in our student accommodation so would eat there all the time. They did salads and stuff but I’d never go for them, always the unhealthy things like chips. “At the time I wasn’t really a big drinker, and I didn’t go out much because I was so busy with the course. “But then I started to fall behind, I failed one of my assessments three times and was told I’d have to resit the year if I didn’t want to fail completely.”  This was a huge blow for Amanda, who in 12 months had gone from a size 12 to a size 16. She drifted further from her friends and started to isolate herself. Amanda said: “I started drinking, I’d sit in my room on my own and go through a couple of bottles of wine a night, as well as vodka. “I was really depressed, I started to self-harm and I had a bit of a breakdown, I was failing my degree and I had no friends. “My family lived back home in Firswood, and although they were supportive they didn’t see what was going on. “When I started back at uni I was in a new class, because of the drinking I was missing class and calling in sick to placements.” Amanda dropped out of her course and moved back in with her parents, with Chris, 26, staying in Chester to complete a Masters degree.  She got a zero-hours contract as a receptionist, but would find herself only working a few hours a week. She said: “It was then that things came to a blow. “I’d start drinking at lunchtime and would come home to my parents every night trashed. “I would drink in my bedroom without them knowing.” In 2014 Chris moved to Manchester, and the couple got a flat together in Stretford. Amanda was still in her zero hours contract job, and money was tight.  She said: “My drinking got really bad then, we got into debt, and then all the girls on my course graduated. “I didn’t even have a proper job. I felt low and worthless, I just didn’t want to be here anymore.” In May 2015, Amanda decided to try and take back control of her life and visited the Job Centre. She came away with her dream job as a nursing assistant at the Manchester Royal Infirmary. She added: “It gave me something to get up for in the morning. “My manager knew about my depression and anxiety and was really supportive. I’d never drink on shift, but I was still drinking at home. “I was also a size 18 and hated my body, I’d lost all self confidence by this point.

But one single woman came up with a controversial and very unusual method to find \u0027the one\u0027. Instead of asking just one potential love interest on a date, Natasha Aponte invited hundreds. They all thought they were going on a normal Tinder date, but when they arrived they realised that wasn\u0027t the case when they saw her getting on stage with a microphone. She then told the crowd she was going to start whittling down the men with a series of questions and challenges. Whoever won, would get to go on a date with her.  Her unusual idea received a mixed reaction, and while some of the men saw it as a bit of fun and got involved, others were extremely angry. A video shared on social media shows a man complaining about what\u0027s happening, and he\u0027s then thrown out by security staff. One of the men who arrived ready for his date, shared the story on Tinder. He said he matched with the attractive young woman and they were talking for an hour on the app before exchanging numbers. But before long she told him she had a huge work presentation coming up at work, so said she wouldn\u0027t be able to chat or meet up for a couple of weeks. The man thought he had just been fobbed off, so didn\u0027t really think about her again. Until a few weeks later when she sent another message asking him if he was free the following night, inviting him on a date to watch a DJ date in New York\u0027s Union Square.

Three of those defeats came against Inverness Caley Thistle, Morton and Queen of the South in league outings.There were also draws against Dumbarton, Inverness and Dunfermline, meaning a total of 15 points that were expected to be taken were, in fact, shipped.That proved crucial as United finished 13 points behind champions St Mirren and one adrift of second-place Livingston, meaning they kicked off at the first stage of the promotion play-offs, while Livi had the benefit of a two-week break before beating them in the semi-final.Before last week’s Irn-Bru success with a side that was a mix of kids and fringe players, and against very young opposition, there was little to suggest this season would bring an improvement.Over 90 minutes, the Tannadice outings in the Betfred Cup against Arbroath and Alloa were drawn and the opening day of league business ended in a painful 3-2 defeat against Dunfermline that saw the Pars dominate more than the final score suggested.That United must improve at home start is important, not just in terms of their promotion challenge but also economically.The new regime under chairman Mike Martin have invested in a new squad and that’s cost money, some of which they’d like to think will be recouped by fans paying at the gate to watch their team chalk up regular victories at home.Decent income has already come from season ticket sales that are now approaching the 4,000 mark and, if that’s down on previous years, it remains a number that would be the envy of many Premiership clubs.It would be no surprise, however, if that cash has already been spent on the rebuilding of the squad, making supporters who pay on turning up for games a vital source of further funds.In not buying season books, many have adopted a wait-and-see policy so far as attendance is concerned. If United are going well they will come, if not, they’ll find something else to do.That makes wins at Tannadice vital and, in fairness, despite the problems the team’s experienced there in the past 12 months, there are now some encouraging signs.United looked impressive in Dumfries and could’ve scored more than the two goals.And in new arrivals Pavol Safranko, Nicky Clark and Craig Curran, they have strikers who bring as close as anyone is going to get of a guarantee of goals.A more direct style this term should also help, though, ultimately, the proof of this pudding is going to be in the eating.Hopefully, from Saturday the fans can start getting tucked in to what becomes a regular menu of home wins.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"She did it  Swindon star Maisie Sly s film wins at the Oscars","story":"                          Swindon\u0027 own Maisie Sly has topped off her trip to Hollywood in style, after the film she starred in, The Silent Child, was announced as the winner Best Live Action Short Film at the 90th\u0026nbspAcademy Awards."},{"url":null,"title":"pet-collar-melts-into-cats-neck-in-heatwave","story":"                          A WOMAN has issued a stark warning to other cat owners after her furry friend\u0027s newly-bought collar melted into its neck - leaving serious burns."},{"url":null,"title":"glasgow-pride-board-member-steps-down-as-event-refunds-total-6500","story":"                          REFUNDS to Pride Glasgow revellers who were denied entry to the event last month totalled \u0026pound6,500."},{"url":null,"title":"mcdonalds-to-create-thousands-of-apprenticeships","story":"                          MCDONALD\u0026rsquoS has pledged to create 43,000 apprenticeships across Europe by 2025, including a substantial number in the UK."},{"url":null,"title":"popes-visit-an-opportunity-to-end-the-cover-ups","story":"                          THE Pope\u0027 visit to Ireland is an opportunity to end the cover-up of abuse, Sinn Fein\u0027 vice-president said."},{"url":null,"title":"summer-sessions-2018-forecast-ahead-of-bellahouston-park-event","story":"                          POURING rain and blustery winds won\u0027t dampen the spirits of hundreds of Summer Sessions revellers making their way to Bellahouston Park tonight."},{"url":null,"title":"glasgows-belle-and-sebastian-join-forces-with-scots-orchestra-for-one-off-show","story":"                          A GLASGOW band will join forces with Scotland\u0027s national orchestra to celebrate a new \u0026pound21million hospice."},{"url":null,"title":"orange-order-refuse-to-re-route-parade-away-from-church-forcing-council-to-impose-new-route","story":"                          THE ORANGE Order has refused to re-route a parade away from the church where a priest was allegedly attacked and faces having a new route imposed on it."},{"url":null,"title":"new-bridge-next-step-in-major-renfrewshire-development-project","story":"                          A NEW bridge over the Black Cart will connect cyclists and pedestrians to a major investment area being developed in Renfrewshire."},{"url":null,"title":"davis-cup-returns-to-the-emirates-arena-for-world-group-play-off","story":"                          THE Emirates Arena will play host to Great Britain\u0027 Davis Cup World Group play-off against Uzbekistan."},{"url":null,"title":"glasgow-traffic-news-road-closures-and-delays-as-city-hosts-two-major-events","story":"                          Motorists travelling into Glasgow are being warned to expect delays caused by extra traffic."},{"url":null,"title":"austin-lafferty-what-can-i-do-about-my-noisy-neighbours-and-how-can-i-get-my-money-back-from-an-unhelpful-retailer","story":"                          I BOUGHT a display cabinet from a furniture retailer.

If the offer for the school is accepted, it would see the garden centre moved to the Riverview Drive premises.It would also see the business expanded, with the addition of free community allotments, a horticultural classroom for groups and schools, a children’s play area and a farmer’s market.Gordon McGillivray, joint owner of Parkhill Garden Centre, said: “We have put in an offer for the former Cordyce School site.\u0026#8220Parkhill is already a popular venue used as a meeting place for local people and businesses.\u0026#8220It would be even more accessible at Cordyce for those who walk or are dependent on public transport.“The previous B977 Dyce to Balmedie road was there when our nursery business moved in 1984 from Allenvale to its present site.“Prior to the AWPR the original road was on the same level as the garden centre, there was a forest at the opposite side of the road and our own tree shelter belt at our side of the road.\u0026#8220This gave complete protection from the prevailing winter winds from the west.”The new road has been elevated to rise up, which has left the centre exposed to the winds, which is blowing salt on to the premises in winter, and knocking plants off displays in the summer.Gordon said: “We have been aware of the possible problems from the AWPR scheme for some considerable time but we were continually told by Transport Scotland that no decision could be reached before the scheme was finished.\u0026#8220The artificial wind break has not been successful.“Due to our inability to display plants outside for sale, throughout the road salt spreading season, we cannot continue to trade profitably through the winter months.”The company is hopeful that members of the public will lend their support to the proposal and the hardworking staff, with the hope that more job opportunities could be created in the move to Dyce.Meanwhile, boxer Lee McAllister has also submitted an application to Aberdeen City Council for the Cordyce School premises.The “Aberdeen Assassin” has proposed £10 million plans to turn the disused school into a health and fitness village.It would see the facility as a location for children and adults with disabilities, recovering cancer patients, people with mental health issues, recovering drug and alcohol addicts and the homeless.Proposals for the site include a multi-purpose gym and a pool.The boxer said: “If we win the bid and they are willing to work together we’d be more than happy to work alongside them.”A Transport Scotland and Aberdeen City Council declined to comment.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"unpaid work for aberdeen man who bit cop outside nightclub","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA man has been ordered to carry out unpaid work after admitting biting a police officer.Mark Durno, 28, had tried to run away from police when they approached him after nightclub door staff raised concerns about his condition.Depute fiscal Katy Begg said officers caught up with Durno at around 1.45am on Market Place, Inverurie, on July 29.As police brought him back to his feet after applying leg restraints due to his behaviour, he bit one officer on the leg.Durno pled guilty to assault and also possession of amphetamines.Defence agent Ross Taggart said his client had been drinking and “overreacted”.Sheriff Philip Mann ordered Durno, of Cloverleaf Grange, Aberdeen, to carry out 100 hours of unpaid work and fined him £200.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"dees forbes relishes locos test","story":"\t\t\t\t\tBanks o’ Dee co-manager Tommy Forbes is looking forward to the challenge of taking on Highland League Inverurie Locos.Dee meet the Railwaymen at Harlaw Park tonight in the first round of the Evening Express Aberdeenshire Cup.The tie was originally scheduled for August 1, but clashed with Locos’ involvement in the Irn-Bru Cup play-off round.Forbes said: “It’s still early in the season.

As well as hearing about numerous problems with local road repairs I also listen to concerns about slow internet speed with some areas lagging behind others when it comes to getting access to superfast broadband.I heard similar concerns when I attended the latest West Kintyre Community Council meeting. As ever, I will looking into every issue brought to my attention by local residents across my council ward.After travelling back to Islay I checked up on the state of road repairs across the island. Some progress has been made in many areas like the Hospital Road in Bowmore and Mansefield Road in Port Ellen. The potholes in Port Askaig that I had been telling our roads department about have been filled in.After calling and emailing around about the large and dangerous potholes at An Creagan Place in Port Charlotte, I have been informed that the road in this area is not the responsibility of Argyll and Bute Council. It belongs to ACHA, and since obtaining this information I spoke in person to the very helpful and hard-working staff at the Bowmore ACHA office and asked them to fill in these potholes.Aside from road concerns on Islay, quite a number of my fellow Ileachs have mentioned lack of bed spaces in Islay\u0026#8217s hospital. Being an island community obviously means that transferring more and more patients to the mainland is hardly ideal.The consensus from my constituents who I have been in contact with is that the number of beds in Islay\u0026#8217s hospital is not enough. I have contacted NHS Highland to voice my constituents anger about this situation.Cllr Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,The Marine Conservation Society (MCS) is seeking volunteers to clean up Scotland’s beaches in the 25th anniversary Great British Beach Clean from September 14-17.Volunteers also record the litter they find, and this has really helped change policy and behaviours.Last year 1,588 volunteers in Scotland took part, cleaning 111 beaches in four days. A staggering 491.4 pieces of litter were found for every 100 metres cleaned, a seven per cent rise on the amount recorded during 2016\u0026#8217s event.The fight to stop the plastic tide has only just started and we need everyone to take part now more than ever.

The Tories’ policy is set to cost around £4 million – yet boosting the wages of those receiving less than the real living wage would cost, at most, under £400,000.This smacks of utter hypocrisy from the Tories, after their comments of recent days regarding pay for forces personnel.What the Tories are choosing to overlook is the immense benefits service personnel have living in Scotland, like free prescriptions and university tuition fees for their children.  And it’s only those earning above £33k who pay a fraction more.If they are so concerned with equality – why aren’t they ensuring that all MoD staff are paid the living wage?Boosting the incomes of the lowest paid MoD staff could cost the Tories less than a tenth of what they are spending to top up higher incomes – yet once again, for people on lower incomes they are not prepared to lift a finger.The Tories’ double standards know no bounds – it’s one rule for the elite and another for the rest.Brendan O\u0026#8217Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"the sands of time are running out","story":"\t\tDorothy H CrawfordUpdated: 02/08/18, 6:33 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowAncient sayings relating to sand generally highlight its abundance. In the Bible for example: ‘I will…make thy seed as the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude.’ But despite estimates that Earth contains roughly seven quintillion, 500 quadrillion grains of sand, world stocks are running dangerously low.Chemically, sand is mostly silicon dioxide, and is non-renewable.  It is essential for manufacturing bricks, plaster, glass, microchips, and above all concrete the most popular and versatile modern building material.  Concrete accounts for 75 per cent of our demand for sand with around 20 billion tons produced globally each year.  Even so, surely there’s an almost infinite sand supply from deserts.Unfortunately not.  Sand grains come in different shapes and sizes, and while desert sand has small, smooth grains, concrete requires large, coarse-grained sand.  This is generally mined from rivers, beaches and the sea bed.  And because international control of sand mining is well-nigh impossible, sand piracy is rife, causing huge ecological damage.Recently, 24 Indonesian islands were mined to extinction, with most of the sand used for land reclamation in Singapore, the world’s largest sand importer.Our dependence on concrete is not just for new builds.  Concrete’s life expectancy is just 50-60 years, after which so-called ‘concrete creep’ allows water seepage that corrodes supporting metal structures. So more concrete is required to repair or replace old buildings.Now engineers are coming up with ingenious ideas for repairing cracked concrete, including using bacteria and fungi that produce calcium carbonate.This could heal micro-cracks but the process will be years in development, while right now the US spend around $79 billion annually on bridge and highway maintenance and there are an estimated 188 million daily trips across ‘at risk’ bridges.Many UK bridges are similarly at risk, so do we have a solution? The short answer is ‘no’, but right now the race is on to find new, more durable building materials to replace the need for sand and in so-doing preserve marine ecosystems.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures 4","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 02/08/18, 11:35 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowReader Fiona McCuish provides this week\u0026#8217s photograph, which features the Crinan Basin in colourful glory despite driecht overcast weather.

They admit to feeling this way once a month or more after scrolling through other properties on Instagram, with 25-34-year-olds feeling dissatisfied most frequently.The findings describe people having an unrealistic idea of what their home should look like, spending time worrying about flaws which would be unnoticeable to others, whilst feeling pressure to maintain a certain appearance in their home and being self-conscious of it in front of visitors.

The ball made its way through to the unmarked Robert Walker who had the simple task of tapping the ball home to open the scoring with 15 minutes played.Bute’s centre line started to dominate play and John MacCallum set up Iain MacDonald who made it 2-0 five minutes before the break.Inveraray came out stronger in the second half, enjoying the bulk of play, but it was Bute who scored a third goal with Robert Walker netting with 15 minutes remaining.The goal seemed to spark life into the Inveraray team who went on to score two goals in a four-minute spell.Craig Taylor fired home an unstoppable shot on 79 minutes, and just a couple of minutes later captain John MacKenzie made it 3-2.The visitors almost snatched a draw at the death through a Steven Cameron shot which went just inches wide of goal.Taynuilt 2 Kilmory 3Alister MacArthur scored twice as Kilmory beat Taynuilt at the Taynuilt Sports Field.Taynuilt started strongly, but while they dominated play the Kilmory keeper didn’t have a save to make the home side missed chances.The second half was only three minutes old when Alister MacArthur, who individually has scored more goals than the whole Taynuilt team this season, showed the reason why by firing the ball past Reid in the Taynuilt goal.He repeated the feat five minutes later to give Kilmory a two goal cushion.This seemed to stir Taynuilt into action and David Campbell scored from the edge of the D on the hour to reduce the deficit.Taynuilt went all out for the equaliser but were caught out on 72 minutes when Sandy Leiper ran away from his marker and laid the ball off to Ally MacLennan to slip it passed Reid and restore Kilmory\u0026#8217s two-goal advantage.It was a crucial strike as the home side pulled a goal back just six minutes later after a well-worked corner between David Campbell and Jamie MacFarlane with the latter firing a shot passed the Kilmory keeper to make it 3-2.Taynuilt laid siege to the Kilmory goal for the remainder of the game but they lacked the composure to get an equaliser.Best for Kilmory were Jones, Cunningham, and MacArthur and man of the match, Leiper.Kilmory leapfrog Taynuilt in the league and unless Taynuilt can find someone to put the ball in the net, they are going to be in the relegation dog-fight.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"past times present fun in lochgilphead","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 10/08/18, 11:29 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowOrganisers reckon 450 people came along to enjoy a dip into the past.Lochgilphead Community Council\u0026#8217s annual Celtic and Pictish Festival is gathering momentum year on year as it grows into an event with a character all of its own.Morning shoppers on Argyll Street were treated to the unusual sight of Picts, Vikings and Romans parading to Lochgilphead front green to begin the festivities. In front of the parade was musician Pat Kenny playing haunting tones on a carnyx, an Iron Age Celtic war horn.On the green there were stands selling everything from soap to artwork and woolly bunnets to garden shrubs.As well as battle re-enactments and weapons demonstrations there were living history demonstrations and workshops where adults and children tried their hand at traditional crafts such as spinning, weaving, metalworking, woodwork, dressing up and blowing the carnyx.Children took part in the Lughnasa Games, featuring various tests of Celtic warrior skills.Brian MacLennan of Lochgilphead Community Council said: \u0026#8216The day was a massive success and I\u0026#8217ve had lots of positive feedback. Having a full programme of events in the arena as well as lots workshops for adults and youngsters to take part in throughout the day, has really made a big difference this year.\u0026#8217He added: \u0026#8216I would like to give a special mention to the 19th Argyll Scouts, the MS Centre and Lochgilphead Parish Church, without whom I\u0026#8217d have had no marquees, tables or chairs, and to Bluestone Gift Shop, the Grubs Up Recovery Cafe and the new Scottish Canals Steamer Terminal in Ardrishaig who all stepped in on the day before the festival with the additional funding and sponsorship that I needed to ensure the full scale festival could go ahead as planned.\u0026#8216I\u0026#8217d also like to thank all the performers, providers and other contributors for making such a great day and would especially like to thank the volunteers who helped set up the site on Friday night and took everything down and away on Saturday evening.\u0026#8216I\u0026#8217m already thinking of ways to make the festival even bigger and better next year.\u0026#8217\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"imagination and colour at lochgilphead lego show","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 11/08/18, 6:31 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowA vast array of imaginative models were on display at the two-day Lochgilphead Lego Show.Lochgilphead Community Centre was the venue for the weekend of plastic brick magic on Saturday August 4 and Sunday August 5.Interactive workshops with Glasgow-based Bricks4Kids gave an insight into basic engineering using Lego, while the imagination room did exactly what the name suggests.

Saints had the majority of possession in the second 20 minutes but the Star back line of Kyle Selfridge, Andy Weir and Luke Naisby remained resolute along with Luke Kalache in goal.The other sides in group two were debutants Port Glasgow who ran out 2-0 winners against Neilston as two first half goals sealed the match in the Inverclyde men’s favour.Red Star’s next game against Neilston was an entertaining affair. After a goalless first half, Star took the lead through Ian McGuinness before an equaliser from Neilston after some sloppy defending. Innes Meikle restored the Red Star advantage with a long range effort which he curled away from the Neilston keeper for 2-1. Star were once again pegged back however as a free kick into the box bamboozled Kalache in the box and ended up in the back of the net. Just as it looked like the points would be shared Gregor Peacock got on the end of a Cammy MacDonald flick on and headed into the net to secure a 3-2 win for the hosts.Oban Saints and Port Glasgow took to the Astro next and the Oban side soon got into their stride and ran out comfortable 2-0 winners to move to the top of the section on goal difference.Saints stayed on to play their final group match against Neilston and they continued to play some excellent attacking football with Donald Campbell scoring the pick of the goals in a 3-0 win to secure top spot.This left Red Star and Port Glasgow to face each other in the final game to determine who would go through as runners up. Both sides were keen to secure the victory but the defences remained on top in a 0-0 draw and the Lochgilphead side made it through after picking up five points from their three matches with Port Glasgow finishing on four.Over at the Ropework, Campbeltown Pupils opened up their campaign with a 1-0 victory over local rivals Tarbert. Kilsyth, making their tournament debut, also got off to an excellent start with a 3-1 victory over Dunoon.Dunoon stayed on to play against old rivals Campbeltown Pupils in what turned out to be a feisty encounter with the Pupils running out 2-1 winners thanks to a Martin McCallum free kick in the final minute.Tarbert then took on Kilsyth in a 1-1 stalemate, with Nikki MacDougall scoring the equaliser, before fighting out another draw with Dunoon to end the campaign with two points.This left Kilsyth and Pupils fighting for the top two spots in the final match of the section and the North Lanarkshire side edged the tie 1-0 to secure top spot and a semi-final against Red Star.The first semi-final saw Oban Saints take on Campbeltown Pupils, with Saints taking the lead in the first half after Fraser McFarlane was felled in the box. Up stepped Lewis Cameron to make no mistake from the spot.Pupils weren’t lying down, however and got back into the game with a penalty of their own to equalise, and will be disappointed not to have forced a winner late on.The match was decided by a penalty shoot-out and Saints eventually came out in top on a contest that swung back and forward, providing some excellent entertainment for the crowd that had gathered.The second semi-final also proved to be an exciting affair as Red Star took on Kilsyth. The hosts fell behind early on when Kilsyth opened the scoring after their midfielder finished well from 20 yards to beat Kalache in the Star goal.Red Star equalised soon after with a Ben Forbes wonder strike from 30 yards which thundered past the Kilsyth keeper. Star took the lead when Gregor Peacock was barged in the box and Andy Weir stepped up to fire the penalty beyond the ‘keeper to give the hosts the lead. Kilsyth were causing Star plenty of problems however and were level again before the half-time whistle when a scramble in the box saw the ball deflect in off the unfortunate Luke Naisby.The winner came for Star early in the second half when Kilsyth couldn’t clear a free kick into the box and the ball broke kindly to John Kennedy, who volleyed home to secure the win and send Red Star into the final where for the second year in a row they would face Oban Saints.Into the final and the Red Star side were clearly feeling the effects of their exertions as they struggled to contain a fluid Oban Saints attack early on. Saints had a couple of good attempts saved by Luke Kalache before Matt Rippon opened the scoring after the ball broke kindly on the edge of the box.The Premier division side put themselves 2-0 up on the stroke of half time when more good play saw the ball fall to Shaun MacIver who bundled home.The second half saw Saints stretch their lead through James Ford before Cammy McDonald pulled a late consolation for Red Star but it was Oban Saints who ran out deserved 3-1 winners and won the tournament for the second year running.Saints also had the Player of the Tournament, which was awarded to Lewis Cameron who was excellent throughout the day.Red Star would like to thank all the teams and officials who took part in the competition, as well as the Stag Hotel for their excellent hospitality.Tomorrow Red Star round off their pre-season schedule with a home match against Helensburgh which will take place at the Ropework, with a 2pm kick-off.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor week 32","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 12/08/18, 6:15 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Sir,At the latest Mid Argyll, Kintyre and Islands meeting I stated a large number of my younger constituents have been contacting me in regards to the availability of housing.While a greater number of affordable rental accommodation is more than welcome, a larger amount of affordable housing to buy needs to be built across Argyll.I was also very happy at a recent meeting with my fellow Conservative councillors to discuss the huge importance of having a more streamlined planning service that helps rather than hinders economic strength across Argyll and Bute.An effective planning system plays an important role in supporting growth – promoting and enabling the homes, jobs and services that communities need, creating a more competitive local economy and minimising uncertainty and delay for those proposing or affected by development.We in Argyll are seeing a tremendous increase in our industrial output and we as a council must not place barriers in the way of future growth in this area.Councillor Alastair Redman, Islay.Sir,I\u0026#8217m calling on Argyll and Bute\u0026#8217s small shopkeepers to enter the Best Small Shops competition, celebrating the creativity of small shops and the central role they play in their local community.Argyll and Bute is a hub of small local retailers, many of which are a lifeline.The Best Small Shops competition is open to any small shop operating in the UK.

It strikes me this sort of selfish attitude is something that may also be contributing to the growing problem of drivers throwing rubbish out their windows on Argyll\u0026#8217s road network.If you can\u0026#8217t find a public toilet, at least find a tree to hide behind when you\u0026#8217re caught short \u0026#8211 and a bin to chuck your rubbish in.Name and address supplied.Sir,At Royal Mail we never forget that we form an essential part of the UK’s social fabric.We know our postmen and postwomen are valued members of the local community as they deliver letters and parcels six days a week \u0026#8211 in all weathers.

Builder John MacDonald followed with colourful tales of Archie McVicar, with whom he worked as a young man. Greta Cameron talked about the early years of the Oyster Bar, established on the estate in the late 1970s by Christina\u0026#8217s brother Johnny Noble along with fish farmer Andy Lane.Piecing together records from her father\u0026#8217s journal, estate records and blending these with the recollections of the people of the estate, Christina has created a remarkable piece of work.This book is not just about the Nobles, but the Ardkinglas community, the people who make it and have made it and the story of how they lived and worked.\u0026#8216I\u0026#8217m very pleased that so many people have come along today for our launch party,\u0026#8217 said Christina.\u0026#8216Ardkinglas is a place that is very dear to me, and the place and the people have contributed to making me who I am today.

The wealth of experience and knowledge of the staff cannot be replaced.I would certainly support a trust taking over the service, but firstly I would ask VisitScotland and Scottish Government to reconsider their closure plans.Councillor Robin Currie, Kintyre and the Islands wardSir,I am extremely disappointed over the proposed closure of the VisitScotland iCentre in Tarbert.Michael Russel MSP, Tarbert and Skipness Community Trust and myself have had frequent discussions regarding the issue and I am hopeful that the interested parties will be able to offer a proposal that ensures continuity in the service, although perhaps in a different form.Councillor Anne Horn, Kintyre and the Islands wardSir,Deputy First Minister John Swinney is now requiring local authorities to devolve powers and budgets to local schools. If councils do not respond within the next year, he has vowed to legislate for improved school governance across the country.The fear of making mistakes has led to an unwillingness to experiment and a total absence of diversity to suit individual communities. Local authorities have prevented head teachers and staff from running their schools and classes in their pupils’ true interests.Councils have failed to recognise the very significant contribution which broadly constituted and empowered school councils could make to the overall education system. Schools have had little incentive to cut back wasteful expenditure.The shortage of resources being allocated to education is, of course, partly to blame for the mess we are in, but it is by no means the whole story.We now have an ideal opportunity to introduce governance reforms to ensure that policies are shaped to local circumstances otherwise we could all well end up with more direction from St Andrew\u0026#8217s House.Is it too much to hope that councillors and education officials in every education authority will now play their part in restoring Scotland’s state schools to their once iconic world status?Angus Tulloch, Longniddry, East LothianSir,Through your newspaper I would like to thank the staff Alex, Mark and Alex (number two) from the George Hotel in Inveraray.Two guests staying at my holiday cottage in Cairnbaan lost their car keys while on a day trip to Inveraray.

The Labour list MSP hit out as it was announced rail users traveling to Glasgow from Kilmarnock will have to shell out an additional \u0026pound55 for season passes. Regulated rail fares are set to rise by 3.2 per cent, in line with the retail price index rate of inflation, from January. That will see a season pass increase from \u0026pound1692 to \u0026pound1746. Commuters in Ayr would see an increase of \u0026pound78 from \u0026pound2452 to \u0026pound2530 for a season pass. Mr Smyth said: “These rail fare rises are unwanted, unwelcome and unnecessary. “It is simply unfair that commuters in Ayrshire are being burdened with these rip-off rail fares for less than satisfactory services.  “The cost of rail fares being paid by passengers is simply unacceptable, with passengers from Kilmarnock having to fork out \u0026pound1746 a year to travel to and from work. “Scottish Labour is clear: it’s high time working people stopped having to pay such excessive fares to simply line the pockets of private companies. “Only Labour is fighting for a publicly owned railway which will serve the many, not just the few.” Elsewhere, an annual Lockerbie-Edinburgh fare will now cost \u0026pound5250 – up \u0026pound162 – after the Scotish Government decided peak fares were to increase. Transport secretary Michael Matheson said the rises were “unwelcome” and stressed action had been taken to minimise them.  Increases in off-peak fares in Scotland will be held at 2.2 per cent as the government have pledged to cap them at 1 per cent below inflation. All fares in England will rise by the RPI rate of inflation. Mr Matheson said: “This means in Scotland average fares increases are lower than England and Wales.” In recent months staff from rail union RMT have staged protests in cities around the UK. Mick Cash, general secretary of the RMT, said it was “nothing short of a scandal” that ticket prices were up to five times more than fares in Europe. Lib Dem MSP Mike Rumbles MSP said the rises are the last thing hard-up passengers need.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnLabour PartyScottish LabourGlasgowAyrKilmarnockEconomyTransportLockerbieKilmarnock NewsTransport ScotlandCheap travel"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"musical tribute concert honour loved","story":"NewsMusical tribute concert will honour loved onesFollowing on from the success of last year’s event, the Joan Price Memorial Concert will take to the stage once again next month.Share\u0026nbspByAbi Smillie16:27, 22 AUG 2018NewsColin Price and Pauline Moriarty join together for the tribute concert (Image: Ayrshire Post)Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA musical tribute concert will honour the lives of two well loved members of the community. Following on from the success of last year’s event, the Joan Price Memorial Concert will take to the stage once again next month. Joan Price, a beloved trombone player, was tragically killed in a road traffic accident in January 2017 by two boy racers who are now serving jail sentences. Joan’s fellow band members wanted to do something to honour her memory and decided to organise a concert featuring all three bands which she had played for. Kilmarnock Concert Brass, Irvine \u0026amp Dreghorn Brass Band and Dunaskin Doon Band will join together on September 1 to pay tribute to the Troon gran. The brass band show will now be an annual event, with each band taking it in turns to nominate a charity. This year Kilmarnock Concert Brass has chosen Beautiful Inside \u0026amp Out (SCIO) as the worthy recipients. Beautiful Inside \u0026amp Out (SCIO) supports bereaved families of suicide victims and any troubled person by providing and funding services such as counselling, music, play and drama therapy.  The charity was set up by mum, Pauline Moriarty, originally from Ayr, following the suicide of her 13-year-old daughter, Jenna. The concert will honour Joan and Jenna with traditional marches, big band hits, movie themes and film scores. Tasty treats and a raffle will be on offer during the interval. Colin, Joan’s husband said: “Our family is delighted and honoured that the three bands have decided to make this concert an annual event in Joan’s memory. A lot of hard work goes on behind the scenes to make a concert like this happen and I’m indebted to everyone who has helped or who is playing on the night. “Last year’s concert was a fantastic night of entertainment and I’m looking forward to meeting many old and new friends again this year.” Pauline Moriarty added: “We are so touched the bands have chosen to raise funds for the work of a Beautiful Inside \u0026amp Out (SCIO). It is such a lovely tribute to Joan Price and it will help us to potentially save lives.” Joan Price Memorial Concert will take place on Saturday, September 1 at 7pm at Kyle Academy on Overmills Road in Ayr. Tickets, \u0026pound7 (under 12s and over 65s \u0026pound5) are available by emailing secretary@ddband or messaging Dunaskin Doon Band on their Facebook page. A limited number of tickets will also be available on the night.

Fraser and Freya Russell have qualified for the National final of the American Golf Junior Golf Championships. The pair, who live in Troon and attend Marr College, progressed from the qualifying competition held at Leven Links Golf Club and now go forward to the final which will be televised on Sky Sports later this year. Competing in the gross score stroke play competition, 14-year-old Fraser, who incredibly plays off a five handicap at Royal Troon, put in a superb performance to take the qualifier with a score of nine over par. Not to be outdone by her older brother, Freya, 12, put in a fantastic performance to score 32 points in a stableford off a handicap of 13 in the girls’ net score competition. That was enough to take top spot and secure a spot in the final at Gainsborough Golf Club, where she will take on the UK and Ireland’s best girls. Speaking after the qualifier, Fraser said: “I am delighted with how I played, it will be a great chance for me to play golf on a good stage and I can test myself against some of the best.”  And younger sister Freya is looking forward to the continuing her golfing journey as she commented: “I love to play different golf courses, meeting new friends and getting to play golf with other girl golfers.” The pair play their junior medals on the Portland Course at Royal Troon, but due to their impressive handicaps they are allowed to enter in competitions that are played on the par 71 Old Course. They are both coached by Royal Troon pro Kieron Stevenson. Both Fraser and Freya represent Ayrshire for their age levels, and Freya has been playing with the West of Scotland U18 team since she was just nine.

The Silent Child follows Libby, a profoundly deaf child born to a hearing family who struggle to communicate with their daughter.  As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.

The film was directed by Rachel\u0026rsquos fianc\u0026eacute Chris Overton, with a \u0026pound10,000 crowdfunded budget.  Maisie earned her role following a nationwide search, during which over 100 children auditioned for the part.

She said: \u0026ldquoI know it has been quite a journey for some who have come through a process that many of us who have lived in this country all our lives do not have to go through.  The citizenship process involves a series of tests which those applying have to pass, quizzing them on all aspects of British life.  Mohamed Sherif, 31, an engineer from Musselburgh, has lived here for 10 years and is originally from Libya. He said: \u0026ldquoIt is a lot easier to have citizenship than have to spend a lot of money on renewing visas.  \u0026ldquoWe know we want to stay in this country so it made sense to apply.

It connects us to our ancestral origins and reasserts our relationship with nature, of which we are also a part. There are few such important gifts that we can give our children, and ourselves, than a regular forest bath.  The term forest bathing of course comes from Japan, where it was first coined in the 1980s to describe the mental health benefits of regular meditative time spend in the woods. But the spiritual and mental uplift that nature provides has long been known, and here in Scotland the Celtic tradition in particular has a powerful relationship with trees and the nature.  But we are forgetting it all. We are forgetting who we are and from what we came. And we are suffering as a result.  Another recent term is nature deficit disorder, a phrase created by Richard Louv who wrote Last Child in the Woods in 2005. While it is not an actually recognised medical condition as such, putting a name on the effects of nature deprivation has made people more aware of it.  So for my final journey of discovery this summer, I took a friend who is unused to spending time in nature for a walk in Butterdean Wood. I cannot put into words how important this place is for my family and my soul. My children have grown up, and are growing up, in this wonderful wood. It\u0026rsquos a cradle of nature where you can feel simultaneously lost and found, for the trees envelop you, as if to say \u0026ldquowelcome back.  It\u0026rsquos horrific to think that a number of years ago there was a plan to cut the wood down, but thanks to Gregor Neil Robertson and others, a campaign to save the wood, supported by Friends of the Earth, was successful.  My friend suffers from depression and anxiety. When I told him I planned a walk in a wood he protested. He has weight issues as well, and going for a walk is something he knows he should do, but doesn\u0026rsquot enjoy.  \u0026ldquoYou will enjoy this walk, I reassured him.  \u0026ldquoDon\u0026rsquot think so, was his reply, but he nonetheless finally agreed to come along, after I\u0026rsquod promised it would only be a short one.  There are different options when you begin to explore the wood, but my family have a favourite part and so that\u0026rsquos where I took him. Trees have a way of bringing feelings to the surface and soon my friend was talking about stuff.  We first wandered through the pine wood. It\u0026rsquos planted with mainly non-native pine trees but has a wonderful atmosphere.  I told him of the story about the brownie who hides in the wood, because he is fearful of humans whom he believes to be cruel after witnessing a farmer\u0026rsquos son whip a horse.  The story took us to what my children call the \u0026lsquofaerie bridge\u0026rsquo. It is here that the wood changes in character. Once across the bridge the wood is more mixed, with mainly deciduous trees: oak, rowan, ash, sycamore, beech and hazel, but also the occasional Scots pine.  \u0026ldquoCheck for something metal on you, I told my friend. He looked at me funny. \u0026ldquoEh?  \u0026ldquoSomething made of iron or metal of some kind, I reiterated.  \u0026ldquoWhat for?  \u0026ldquoWell, because the faeries live in the part of the wood across the bridge, but iron undoes their magic. So you are safe if you are wearing something made of it, I explained.  \u0026ldquoSeriously?  I just smiled. He was lucky, he had a metal strap on his watch. And so we ventured over the bridge.  This part of Butterdean Wood is vivid green in high summer. We soon reached a junction in the path.  \u0026ldquoOK, this is the short way back, we\u0026rsquoll take that. I was keeping my promise that we\u0026rsquod only go on a short walk. But my friend protested.  \u0026ldquoOh naw, let\u0026rsquos go on for a bit more, I\u0026rsquom actually enjoying this.  And so we ventured further, past the tall beech tree which still has the rough end of a rope tied round one of its upper branches. It was here, in summers about 10 years ago, my now grown-up daughters would swing on the rope swing I made for them.  We sat here for a short while so my friend could take a breath. He noticed the silence, which was then softly broken by the swish of tree tops swaying in a breeze. We sat for perhaps two minutes, not looking at each other, but just being present under the canopy of nature.  \u0026ldquoOK, he said, \u0026ldquoyou\u0026rsquore right, it is magic.  I smiled and nodded.  We walked, at a guess, over three miles through Butterdean Wood on this day. I introduced him to different trees and we paused often, soaking in the power of it all. It\u0026rsquos a place of constant minor changes, as all woods are, and it\u0026rsquos only when you visit them regularly that you notice the changes.  As we left, my friend commented on how much better he felt, how his anxiety had eased and that he\u0026rsquod want to come back with his son.  \u0026ldquoButterdean Wood would be a gift for your son, I said, \u0026ldquolet him bathe in the forest too.  We all need this, and on a regular basis. We need to find time for it, find a wood we can reach and bathe in. It benefits our health in so many ways but it also helps us to connect and have a relationship with nature. It should be a birthright of our children to run free in the wood, to explore and become part of it.  Later in the week I returned with my children. We followed our trails of memory, my older daughters walking in their own footprints of younger years, which are now overlaid with the imprint of their younger siblings. I searched but saw no signs of autumn.  But soon the summer will end, and the heatwaves of 2018 will become part of our folk memory.  Autumn in Butterdean is nature\u0026rsquos show, but it\u0026rsquos not ready for that yet, it\u0026rsquos still fully clothed in summer\u0026rsquos colours."},{"url":null,"title":"disgraceful-state-of-north-berwick-toilets-slammed","story":"  The quality of the toilets on the town\u0026rsquos Quality Street has long been lauded by residents and visitors alike, but last week it drew criticism from one resident, who contacted the Courier to offer her concerns.  Helen Mulgray wrote: \u0026ldquoI was shocked to see how the cleanliness of the toilets had deteriorated.  \u0026ldquoThese once highly praised, award-winning toilets have been degraded to become offensive and at times a health hazard \u0026ndash no soap to wash hands and no toilet paper unless [it is] picked off the floor.  She described the condition of the toilets as a \u0026ldquodisgraceful memory of a visit to North Berwick for the thousands of visitors that flock to the town every summer.  East Lothian Council is currently proposing to cut the permanent toilet attendants at the county\u0026rsquos public loos and instead see them maintained by an extended team of mobile attendants.  Ms Mulgray slammed the council for the proposal, adding: \u0026ldquoImplementing the proposed plan to do away with full-time attendants means this mess will be a permanent sight for visitors to the toilets.  \u0026ldquoIt takes no account of the crowds coming from the beach until late, busloads stopping at the car park, and events like the Fringe [by the Sea] and the [Highland] Games.  \u0026ldquoIs saving money this way more important than the tourist image of North Berwick?  Ms Mulgray added that when she returned to the toilets last Monday, they were \u0026ldquospotless.  She put the improvements down to the fact that the usual full-time attendant had returned from annual leave.  Ms Mulgray wrote to the council to express her concerns about the toilets being allowed to deteriorate last week and, in a response seen by the Courier, Lorraine Faulds, senior officer of facilities management, wrote: \u0026ldquoLooking at your specific concerns with North Berwick toilets, it has been maintained by a combination of permanent and mobile attendants for more than six years.  \u0026ldquoThis pattern has ensured appropriate levels of cleanliness throughout the year and includes recognition of the busier summer months.  \u0026ldquoWe are aware that at any toilet, on any occasion, whether by intent or accident, toilets or sinks can be blocked by paper or left as debris.  \u0026ldquoFortunately these remain isolated incidents at our sites and North Berwick toilets actually have a more frequent attendance by the mobile attendants than some of our other sites.  She said the emptying of sanitary bins would increase from once a week to twice due to Ms Mulgray\u0026rsquos complaint of them \u0026ldquooverflowing.  The letter added: \u0026ldquoWe take our service provision extremely seriously and aim to maintain the very high standards of our public toilets.

It comes as the number of lairs at Deer Park Cemetery, opposite where the proposed new burial ground would be sited, reaches a dangerously low figure.  Ward councillor Norman Hampshire stressed the importance of new burial spaces being created in the town.  Mr Hampshire, chairman of the council planning committee, was unable to comment on the merits of any specific application because of his role on the committee.  But he said: \u0026ldquoI have been told by officers, early next year there will be no spaces available in the cemetery.  \u0026ldquoIt would mean people in the community would need to be buried outwith the town, which would not be acceptable to people. There is a desperate need for [a new] cemetery within Dunbar.  The proposed new cemetery comes as part of a controversial planning application approved by the planning committee last year.  More than 100 houses are set to be built on land at Newtonlees Farm, despite the site being outwith the sites identified at that stage by the council\u0026rsquos Local Development Plan and recommended for refusal by planning officers.  Mr Hampshire ultimately had the casting vote on the Gladman Developments scheme after the vote at the council meeting was tied at 4-4.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe original proposal had been to extend the existing cemetery.  \u0026ldquoHowever, when the consent was given for a housing development along with the golf course at Dunbar Golf Club, the land was not secured at that time by the council.  \u0026ldquoThere have now been more burials in the cemetery and the way the layout is the bit of land that was available to purchase would not have created the substantial extension that would have been viable for the future in Dunbar.  \u0026ldquoThat is why the council had to look at alternative sites to create a new cemetery.  \u0026ldquoThe two cemeteries are very close to each other.  \u0026ldquoThere will be parking still available in the old Deer Park site and some new parking created within the new cemetery.  \u0026ldquoI think the two will work well together and be a cemetery which is available for a long number of years and satisfy the needs of the Dunbar community.  Deer Park Cemetery opened in 1953 and is expected, according to East Lothian Council, to reach capacity by the summer of 2020.  There are a total of 1,300 lairs in Deer Park cemetery, which are expected to be full within 18-24 months.  A spokeswoman for the council said: \u0026ldquoThe size of the proposed cemetery is approximately 1.2 hectares offering 2,000 lairs, 700 ashes-only lairs and an area for woodland burial.

That has led to questions being asked as to how the current doctors\u0026rsquo surgery, on Newton Port, will cope with the increase in people.  Fiona-Frances Adam, one of the town\u0026rsquos community councillors, raised the issue with councillors.  She asked: \u0026ldquoWhat are they going to be doing?  \u0026ldquoAre they going to extend the surgery with all the incoming people?  \u0026ldquoThey are stretched.  Land was previously earmarked for a new doctors\u0026rsquo surgery to be created on the site of the new East Lothian Community Hospital, which is currently being built on the site of the former Roodlands Hospital.  The new hospital is expected to be complete in 2020 but no planning application has been submitted for a GP surgery at any site in the town, including the hospital and within the new Letham Mains development, which is sandwiched between the B6471 and the A6093.  Jan Wilson, chairwoman of the community council, said: \u0026ldquoWhere the surgery is at the moment is central.  \u0026ldquoI think as far as I am led to believe there is supposed to be a doctors\u0026rsquo surgery in the Letham Main development.  A spokeswoman for East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership told the Courier that discussions had been taking place with Haddington GPs on how to support the growing population for \u0026ldquosome time.

Nicola Pryde, director of the nursery group, which is already open on Meadowpark and has another facility in Dunblane, Stirling, said that the new centre had been opened to meet demand as the town sees more families moving in.

Councillor Brian Small, leader of the opposition Conservative Group on East Lothian Council, said: \u0026ldquoObviously the fact that 4,000 households are without work is worrying.  \u0026ldquoWork isn\u0026rsquot only important for the financial benefits to those in employment, it also generates health and social benefits for them.  \u0026ldquoHaving something to get up in the morning for is good for you.  \u0026ldquoBut we have to welcome that East Lothian is better than both the UK and Scottish average but there is still more that can and should be done to get people back into work.  Peter Dicker of East Lothian Foodbank, based in Tranent, said: \u0026ldquoAlthough the statistics for the increase in the population in work is encouraging, the foodbank can only comment on the fact that over the same period that the statistics were compiled for April 2017 to March 2018 we here at East Lothian Foodbank experienced a 12 per cent increase on the number of referrals we had sent to us \u0026ndash this 12 per cent compares to a national average of a 13 per cent increase on referrals (Trussell Trust stats).  \u0026ldquoSince the introduction of Universal Credit in April 2016 we have seen an increase in people being referred to us by over 45 per cent (April 16 to March 17 was 37 per cent increase).  The figures from the ONS estimate that last year 14 per cent of households in East Lothian were workless, lower than the Scotland-wide average of 18 per cent.  County MP Martin Whitfield said: \u0026ldquoClearly the increase in the local employment rate over the last year is welcome. However, the fact there are still many people out of work remains a concern. It underlines the complacency of the UK Government, which is simply not doing enough to help people into work.  \u0026ldquoEast Lothian Council, through its East Lothian Works employability service, is doing a good job supporting jobseekers, but both the UK and Scottish Governments must do more to enhance prosperity and create new jobs.  East Lothian MSP Iain Gray added: \u0026ldquoI welcome the fact that East Lothian\u0026rsquos employment rate is higher than the Scottish average. However, too many local people are still not in work. We need a fundamental shift in how we grow our economy.  \u0026ldquoWe also need to ensure opportunities for creating these kind of jobs locally are maximised at the former Cockenzie Power Station site and the new innovation park at QMU.  A spokesperson for East Lothian Council said: \u0026ldquoUnemployment figures in East Lothian are following a positive trend as there are over three per cent more people in employment now compared to last year.  \u0026ldquoThe council continues to strive to grow East Lothian\u0026rsquos economy and to make it the best place in Scotland to live, work and do business and we would very much hope our employment figures will continue to rise year-on-year as a result of this work.  \u0026ldquoIt is difficult to comment in detail on the figure of 4,000 households being classed as out of work as it\u0026rsquos unclear, as yet, exactly how this figure has been calculated.  \u0026ldquoIt is also important to note that the roll-out of full service Universal Credit in East Lothian has had an effect on the recording of our out-of-work levels so this too needs to be looked at more closely.  \u0026ldquoEast Lothian Works continues to support people of all ages and abilities to gain skills, re-train and undertake courses and work experience to get them back into rewarding employment, working closely with employers and education providers. There are also many initiatives to support the most vulnerable in our society, including those living in poverty, including projects initiated by our area partnerships designed to meet the needs of our very different communities across East Lothian.  Across Scotland, the most common reason people gave for not being in work was being sick or disabled \u0026ndash 37 per cent of out-of-work individuals cited illness or disability as the primary reason.  Students made up 13 per cent of the group, and 18 per cent were early retirees, with 10 per cent of jobless people in the area officially \u0026lsquounemployed\u0026rsquo \u0026ndash looking for work and able to start within two weeks.  A spokesperson from the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) said: \u0026ldquoSince 2010 the proportion of workless households is down in every region of Great Britain.  \u0026ldquoThe unemployment rate remains at its lowest since 1971, but we\u0026rsquore committed to ensuring that everyone who wants to work has the opportunity to do so \u0026ndash while making sure there is a safety net for those who can\u0026rsquot.  The DWP has also said that the majority of employment growth has been in both full-time and permanent roles.  David Leese, policy analysis manager at charity the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, said that workless families in particular were at a much higher risk of poverty.  Figures from the DWP for 2016-17 show that in workless households nearly 75 per cent of children were growing up in poverty, compared to only five per cent of children with two working parents.  \u0026ldquoIf a child lives in poverty, it affects their health, their education, their family relationships and their plans for the future, Mr Leese said. \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos not right that any child lives in such insecure circumstances."},{"url":null,"title":"east-lothian-courier-pet-idol-see-the-top-50","story":"  Pictured here are all the 50 pets still in the running.

Among the East Lothian pubs to have permanently closed during this period are the Elphinstone Arms in Elphinstone The Hub in Tranent the Bay Horse in Haddington and The Hayweights, Burgh and Mrs Forman\u0026rsquos in Musselburgh.  The figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) show that in 2010 there were about 55 pubs and bars in East Lothian but by 2017 that had fallen to about 45.  Michael Peters, who is behind The New Pheasant in Haddington \u0026ndash which opened this week at the site of the former Pheasant, which shut in 2009 \u0026ndash was not surprised by the figures.  He said that there were a variety of reasons for the decline in the number of pubs, including the lowering of the drink-drive limit in Scotland in 2014, issues with breweries, and the state of the economy.  Mr Peters felt that there was a real need for pubs in towns and villages and said: \u0026ldquoI am not biased but every town needs a pub.  \u0026ldquoIt is not just for drinking but socialising and the community \u0026ndash nothing would be happening. Most things that happen \u0026ndash golf trips, football, anything like that \u0026ndash it is organised when you are in the pub.  \u0026ldquoWhere do most people socialise?  Across the UK, 5,745 pubs closed over the same period, and there are 54 local authorities across the country where 30 or more shut.  Pubs have been pointing the finger of blame at the taxman for their troubles, complaining about the duty on beer, VAT levels and the cost of business rates.  Britain\u0026rsquos Beer Alliance, a group of organisations in the pub and brewing sector, has started a campaign called Long Live the Local with a petition and calls for people to write to their MP to have beer duty reduced.  The latest data from the ONS shows that between 2016 and 2017, 655 pubs and bars across the UK called time for the last time.  In East Lothian there was a slight upturn in that period, with numbers up by about five.  A change in consumer habits, with people drinking at home more often, has been blamed for fewer people visiting pubs.  There are 21 areas of the country that have bucked the decline and have more pubs now than they had in 2010. Top of the list is Hackney in East London, which had 55 more bars in 2017 than it did in 2010."},{"url":null,"title":"tims-tales-the-mermaids-magic-storm","story":"  AFTER our return from a final camping trip in the midges and mist, my youngest daughter started school. She needed an early-morning shower to remove the lingering smell of wood smoke in her hair this morning before getting ready.  She protested a bit, as she said she liked the smell of wood smoke because it reminded her of camping in the Highlands. But soon she was all excited to be dressed up, smart and clean for school. She is attending Prestonpans Infant School, as her big sister did before her, and as I did when it was the primary school.  She looked so smart and business-like as she walked into class with a beaming smile. We shared this moment with many other parents, who were taking the same photos and shedding similar tears. Only the day before, Skye had climbed the side of a mountain in Glencoe as if she had once been a mountain goat and proclaimed she wanted to live by a waterfall.  Now, all dressed to conform (although hair still looking slightly wild as she likes it), she has entered a formal system which in my day did its best to (literally) beat out any original creativity that didn\u0026rsquot fit in with teachers\u0026rsquo expectations.  But as our daughter walked through the same doors I had once gone through, I was uplifted by a hopeful expectation that when we come to pick her up she will be less smart, less clean and her hair even wilder. That\u0026rsquos what school should be like for a wee girl not yet reached five. And I know she is in good hands in that respect at Prestonpans Infants.  But as I kissed her goodbye this morning, she asked: \u0026ldquoCan we have tea by a campfire in the woods? The campfire had been the communal focus during our camping trip. As darkness fell, the spirit of the fire glowed brighter and danced with our imaginations as we told stories and riddles with each other. I of course agreed, but her comment helped me think of which tale to tell this week.  Much of our summer has been spent exploring the wonders of East Lothian. We explored beaches and caves. We climbed hills and moors. We swam and paddled in rivers, climbed trees and sat under them having picnics.  But wherever we went there was one thing that we always saw, even in quite remote places: litter. Sometimes there was more, sometimes there was less, but we couldn\u0026rsquot escape it. My children notice it I suppose because I mention it. Our children pick up other people\u0026rsquos litter as we walk, so we now need an extra rucksack to carry it.  \u0026ldquoWhy do people do this? asked my nine-year-old after she had watched a family sitting in a car in a car park by a beach. They had been eating sandwiches and drinking juice, and then threw all the packaging out of the windows. The plastic juice bottles rolled about in the breeze and the sandwich packaging blew away and got caught in some sea buckthorn bushes nearby. The family then drove away, no doubt having had a nice day at the beach, but leaving their rubbish for others to enjoy.  I make no apologies for sounding angry at this. And I do not blame the children, it\u0026rsquos the adults who frame this behaviour. I understand people want to keep their cars tidy but I couldn\u0026rsquot answer my daughter\u0026rsquos question as we sat watching someone else\u0026rsquos rubbish desecrate a beauty spot. I just can\u0026rsquot understand the mindset. So all I said was: \u0026ldquoWell they just don\u0026rsquot know any better I suppose, or maybe just don\u0026rsquot care.  \u0026ldquoThat\u0026rsquos so sad, she replied, then went very quiet. Then she came up with an answer to the problem: a story:  \u0026lsquoThe king of the sea told all the mermaids not to go close to the shore because of the dangerous litter that humans pollute it with. One mermaid asked what litter was and the king replied it was many things, such as broken glass and plastic which kills sea creatures, as well as making the place humans live look ugly.  \u0026ldquoWhy do they do this? asked the mermaid. The king shrugged his shoulders, and said: \u0026ldquoThey must be less clever than the animals they kill.  But one day the mermaid disobeyed her king and swam to the shore close to the beach at North Berwick. But her tail was cut by broken glass and then she got caught in plastic bags floating on the surface. She was in trouble and a fisherman saw her.  He helped her remove the bags and gave her cream for her cut tail.  \u0026ldquoWhy do you people do this? she asked him. He felt ashamed because he also would throw litter. He promised her he would never do it again. But there was so much rubbish in the sea that they agreed they would try and collect it.  So the mermaid gathered her friends and collected the rubbish. The fisherman\u0026rsquos boat was soon so full that it nearly sank, and when he returned to the harbour people saw the mountain of rubbish he had caught. They laughed at him, thinking he was not a good fisherman because all he had caught was litter and rubbish.  \u0026ldquoLook, said the fisherman, \u0026ldquothis is what we are doing to the sea and the land. Why do we do this? But nobody cared.  \u0026ldquoThis is impossible, we can\u0026rsquot collect all of it, said the mermaid, \u0026ldquoand every day the wind blows more into the sea.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos hopeless, people will never change, said the fisherman. But the mermaid was angry: \u0026ldquoThey must change or else we will all die, including them too eventually.  Mermaids have powers to control the wind. They can whip up storms and so she decided she would make a very unusual, magic storm.  The wind blew not everywhere but where the litter lay. It blew all the rubbish thrown by the humans back into their houses and cars. People woke up with broken glass in their beds and plastic bags covering their children. Their homes were piled high with dangerous and ugly rubbish. When they tried to get rid of it, it just blew back in.  The countryside and sea became wonderfully litter free because of this magic storm, and when people littered the storm whipped up again and blew it straight into their house or car. They couldn\u0026rsquot escape from it. People were living knee-deep in the rubbish they had thrown out of windows or not recycled.  So soon they stopped littering because now they understood what it meant for the other creatures. Finally they cared, because they were the ones who suffered most. At last they got the wisdom of the animals.\u0026rsquo  This story, I think, would make the perfect start to any school day."},{"url":null,"title":"new-world-record-set-at-haddington-rugby-club","story":"  A total of 458 men, women and children took to the pitch at Neilson Park on Sunday as part of the Haddington 700 celebrations. Currently the world record for players involved in a continuous game of rugby is 442.  Now Haddington RFC president Keith Wallace is waiting for official confirmation that a new record has been set.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe day was a fantastic occasion despite the worst day of weather all summer, and we were delighted by the huge effort and support from the club and the rugby and local communities in getting past the record.  \u0026ldquoAs a celebration of the town\u0026rsquos 700 years of the Royal Charter it was a great success, with the match kicked off by Provost John McMillan, and great support from the town, with particular thanks to the boys\u0026rsquo football team who arrived late on, like the cavalry, to help get us over the line.  \u0026ldquoMore than that, though, it was brilliant to see players [aged] from five to 73 enjoying our great game, with several cases of three generations from the same family playing at the same time, including one connected family group of 18.  \u0026ldquoThis is the power of rugby. We look forward to seeing many of our record-breakers back at the club in the near future.  \u0026ldquoWe would also like to thank the Royal Bank of Scotland, sponsors of RugbyForce day of which we were one of two top prize winners, without whose support the event would not have been possible \u0026ndash in particular their many staff, including a good number from the local branch who helped massively on the day.  The match between Haddington President\u0026rsquos XV and Haddington Barbarians XV was kicked off by Provost John McMillan.  The councillor, who previously played for Murrayfield 3rds, said: \u0026ldquoIt was a real honour. I have not played rugby for well over 40 years and it was an amazing day, with a great turnout.  \u0026ldquoIt was very well-organised, despite the horrific weather. It was a great community thing and I was impressed how many people were there \u0026ndash men, women and children of all ages.  \u0026ldquoIt was a great tribute to the club but also the community.  Following their \u0026pound1,000 win for their successful application as part of the Royal Bank RugbyForce initiative, delivered in partnership with Scottish Rugby, Haddington\u0026rsquos event organisers will now submit evidence of the record for verification from Guinness World Records.  Haddington RFC will also use the prize money to contribute towards a recruitment drive to increase playing numbers at all levels and fund community engagement projects.  Haddington RFC\u0026rsquos charity partner Wooden Spoon were also in attendance on the day.  Mr Wallace, who took part in the early stages of the mammoth six-hour match, thanked current Scotland internationalists Stuart McInally, Willem Nel and Sarah Law while there was also an appearance from ex-Lions and Scotland forward Finlay Calder, who grew up in Haddington.

Pupils returned on Wednesday, with Ms Cook planning a series of assemblies to introduce herself to the students.  She said: \u0026ldquoI would like to make Knox Academy a flagship school in East Lothian \u0026ndash Scotland, potentially.  \u0026ldquoI want all young people to leave to a positive destination but be healthy and happy as they move through the school and really enjoy their school experience.  \u0026ldquoI want pupils to enjoy education in the widest sense, not just the curriculum but wider activities, and to develop as rounded individuals when they leave school to meet the demands of an ever-changing society.  Ms Cook, who lives in the county, previously worked in Edinburgh at a number of schools, including Drummond Community High School, Leith Academy and Tynecastle Academy.  The teacher, who has a background in physical education, started on Monday.  Two in-service days gave her the chance to meet the staff before pupils arrived.  She said: \u0026ldquoThe staff seem fantastic, a creative group of people. They really are keen for the school to engage with the challenge.  Ms Cook has also vowed not to remain in her office at the school but instead wants to get out and about and speak to the pupils and staff.

And it takes the masterplan a stage further with more detailed ideas for each of the zones proposed in its vision, including calling for the Scottish Government to be invited to base its HQ for its proposed state company on the site, as well as suggesting offshore windfarm company Inch Cape \u0026ndash which wants to place a substation on the land to bring energy ashore from proposed turbines \u0026ndash should also be encouraged to put its Scottish base there.  The community council document comes in the wake of a brochure produced by neighbouring Prestonpans Community Council promoting its vision of a Port of Prestonpans cruise terminal at the former power station site.  That proposal sparked anger among supporters of the masterplan vision, who accused the Prestonpans group of ignoring the views of the local communities.  It led to the launch of \u0026lsquoGreenhills: delivering the Masterplan\u0026rsquo, a campaign by local groups and businesses backing the consultation document.  Now Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council has drawn up a draft brochure which sets out why it supports the plans and proposes a range of detailed ways it could be taken forward.  That includes putting head offices for Inch Cape and the Scottish Government energy interests in one part of the site, identified as its \u0026lsquoEnergy Quarter\u0026rsquo.  It also floats the idea of flooding the power station footprint to create a marina \u0026ndash as suggested by a local fisherman \u0026ndash with associated retail and leisure facilities, attracting businesses such as a film studio or 3D printing innovation to the site, or even creating a brewery.

Mother Nature has been kind and the pipe is, by and large, under sand once again \u0026ndash though there are concerns it is likely to be exposed again in future if a permanent solution is not found.

The town\u0026rsquos community council has long voiced concerns over the issue and claims houses overlooking the iconic West Beach are \u0026ldquoin danger.  North Berwick Community Council (NBCC) contacted Scottish Water over the issue and the company\u0026rsquos response was read out at a NBCC meeting last week.  A letter from Brian Lironi, director of corporate affairs, said: \u0026ldquoWe are not able to re-lay this section of pipe. However, following an inspection of it, we plan to carry out some work on the casing around the laterals and raised manhole columns.  \u0026ldquoThis work will take place outside of the bathing season when the laterals are more exposed and the beach is less busy. This should help to improve the aesthetic of the pipe.  The letter added: \u0026ldquoOn the point of erosion, we do not believe our pipe is to blame for this. With that said, I am asking for this to be looked at in more detail as it is important that we take an evidence-led approach. This will not happen during the bathing season.  Mr Lironi said the community council would be kept informed of any developments.  Spring 2018 was not the first time that severe weather saw the sewage pipe badly exposed. The pipe was clearly visible in the aftermath of storms in December 2010 and it took many, many months before the tides re-covered it with sand."},{"url":null,"title":"in-this-weeks-courier","story":"  HADDINGTON...

The new facility at the Moray base is expected to be completed in 2020 to coincide with the initial operation of the UK\u0026rsquos new P-8A Poseidon maritime patrol aircraft.  These new planes - versions of the Boeing 737s operated by airlines like Ryanair - are a belated replacement for Nimrods which used to monitor the Scotland Iceland gap.

Stretching two-and-a-half metres long, the creature lived 228 million years ago and swam in warm coastal waters at a time when the earliest dinosaurs were getting established on the planet.  Experts at the National Museums Scotland, who worked on a study of the fossilised remains, said that it was probably just as at home on the land where it could root around in the mud for prey and items to eat.    The turtle probably swam as well as walked  Like turtles today, it most likely had a bony \u0027beak\u0027 to tackle its food but was equipped with legs instead of flippers, meaning it would have felt at ease out of the water.  And while it lacks the carapace and plastron (shell) that is so characteristic of the species, the \u0026lsquoscaffolding\u0026rsquo for the building of the shell is clearly in place with extremely broad ribs spreading out to the sides forming a wide, oval-shaped body\u0026nbsp - just like a modern-day turtle.\u0026nbsp  Dr Nick Fraser, Keeper of Natural Sciences at National Museums Scotland, co-authored the study of the newly-discovered fossil along with colleagues at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the Field Museum of Natural History and the Canadian Museum of Nature.  When he first saw it, the imprint was still encased completely in rock, and only the vague outline of the body could be seen.    The fossil skeleton  Dr Fraser said: \u0026ldquoEven then it was clear that this was a bit of a monster and unlike anything else I had seen in these very rich deposits.  \u0026nbsp\"A turtle was just one of many things that went through my mind, but I was truly stunned when I saw the whole fossil fully prepared.\u0026nbsp  Life on earth 228 million years ago, dubbed the Triassic epoch, was going through a series of rapid changes, following the separation of the super-continent Pangea into distinct landmasses by continental drift.  \u0026nbspThe era saw the first of the dinosaurs appear, although they mostly small, with monsters such as Tyrannosaurus Rex still millions of years from evolving.  However, it was also marked by a mass extinction of other non-dinosaur reptiles, such as semi-aquatic crocodile cousins called phytosaurs, big four-legged meat-eaters called rauisuchians and four-legged armoured plant-eaters called aetosaurs, along with a huge number of\u0026nbsp creatures living in the sea.  One of the more bizarre animals known to science from the period is the dome-headed reptile Triopticus Primus, who came equipped with a bony \u0027helmet\u0027 on the top of its head.  Yet while these creatures died out, the fossil turtle\u0027s lineage would survive until the modern day, although vastly changed through evolution.    The animal had a beak-like mouth  Dr Fraser said: \u0026ldquoThis impressively large fossil is a very exciting discovery that gives us another piece in the puzzle of turtle evolution.  \"It shows that early turtle evolution was not a straightforward, step-by-step accumulation of unique characteristics but was a much more complex series of events that we are only just beginning to unravel.

Outlander, written by US novelist Diana Gabaldon and starring Irish actress Caitriona Balfe, is said to be \u0026ldquoat the vanguard of the renaissance of Scots as a language.    And with two lavish film productions on the way \u0026ndash The Outlaw King is set to premier in Toronto next month, while Mary Queen of Scots is due to open in the UK in January \u0026ndash interest in embracing the mither tongue is expected to soar.  Ethnologist Dr Irene Watt, whose researches cover the ethnology and folklore of Scotland, said the future for Scots was \"starting to look optimistic\" partly as a result of popular culture like Outlander.  She added: \u0026ldquoThe past for Scots may have been bleak, but the present is improving and the future is starting to look optimistic.  \u0026ldquoOutlander is part of the rehabilitation, putting Scots back on the lips of our ancestors where it belongs, in its central place in Scottish identity and heritage.\"  Outlander, now in its third series, has already been attributed to a remarkable tourism boom, with visitors from across the world descending on film locations associated with the series, which follows nurse Claire Randall as she time travels from the 1940s to Scotland of 1743.  Outlaw King, meanwhile, stars American actor Chris Pine in the leading role, while Mary Queen of Scots is played by Irish-American actor Saoirse Ronan.  Dr Watt, lecturer in Scottish culture at The Elphinstone Institute, University of Aberdeen, said Outlander in particular was putting to an end the Scots tongue being \"derided as backward.... forced out of education, media and business life\".  She added: \u0026ldquoScots is beginning to feature in the media, with Outlander at the vanguard, and is backed by the Council of Europe charter on Minority Languages.  \u0026ldquoThe Scottish government has some initiatives in place for its promotion and teaching, although they are not particularly well funded.  \"In wider Scottish cultural life ... Scots is reappearing in places it has been absent for generations. There suddenly exists a plethora of excellent books such as Harry Potter in Scots, The Gruffalo in Scots, the new Sanners Gow book of folktales.  \"The language is finding itself back in favour in academia, with researchers studying Scots\u0027 effect on the brain and the National Library of Scotland appointing a \u0027Scots Scriever\u0027 to produce new work in the tongue.  The use of Scots started to dilute after the Act of Union 1707, with English seen as the mark of the new Britain and the Scots tongue regarded as a \u0026ldquoshibboleth for Jacobitism, she added.  However, according to the 2011 census, Scots has 1.6m speakers in Scotland, making it one of the largest minority languages in Europe.  Scots expert Alistair Heather, who writes in Scots for The Herald and The National, said the revival of the language is already well underway, with Scots now included in teaching at undergraduate level at Aberdeen and Glasgow universities, while the Open University is building a module for Scots language distance learning.  \u0026ldquoThere has been a real cultural shift over the last few years, he added. \u0026ldquoDevolution has had a lot to do with it \u0026ndash if you have a parliament you want to have a recognisable identity. That cultural exploration from devolution and from the independence referendum, along with what has happened to Gaelic as a result of BBC Alba and the Gaelic Language Act 2005, had lots of Scots speakers asking where their language was going.  \u0026ldquoNorth of the Tay you find Scots is far more common, with people speaking it all the time.  Scots is now included in teaching in various undergraduate courses including teaching training and Scots literature, while the Open University is building a module for Scots language distance learning.  \u0026ldquoFrom the 1920s onwards parents thought if children spoke Gaelic they would be thought of as wild highlanders,\" he added. \"Perfectly nice people would think that if their kids spoke broad Scots they won\u0026rsquot get a job.  \u0026ldquoBut now that\u0026rsquos gone, there\u0026rsquos a new confidence and people are looking to share their identity.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos similar to what we\u0026rsquove seen with the Maori renaissance in New Zealand where in 1970 it almost died.  \u0026ldquoAs English becomes a global language it\u0026rsquos harder to express regional identity, and we need another language to keep our treasure trove of national attributes."},{"url":null,"title":"gers-business-welcomes-signs-of-oil-recovery","story":"  CBI Scotland Director Tracy Black said they showed the public finances continued to \u0026ldquomove in the right direction, thanks in large part to higher oil prices helping the North Sea industry.

Mike Tholen of Oil \u0026amp Gas said the increase in Scotland\u0026rsquos geographical share of North Sea receipts from \u0026pound266m to \u0026pound1.33bn showed a \u0026ldquostriking transformation since the price downturn.  He said: \u0026ldquoImprovements to operational efficiency, careful management of costs and a stable fiscal regime have ensured it is better placed to weather volatility in international oil markets. This golden formula must now be maintained as we look to maximise economic recovery.  Scottish Chambers of Commerce Chief executive Liz Cameron said GERS painted a \u0026ldquomixed picture with positive signs in oil, but a fiscal position \u0026ldquomore challenging than the UK\u0026rsquos.  She said: \u0026ldquoThe Scottish and UK Governments both have a part to play in ensuring continued stability for Oil \u0026amp Gas firms, and investment must continue in the vital infrastructure required to streamline access to markets for businesses.  \u0026ldquoGovernments must do all they can, in partnership with the private sector, to encourage small and medium sized firms to export and trade with businesses across the world.  \u0026ldquoThis will further bolster the economy against domestic shocks, and boost our ability to maintain sustainable growth and tackle the fiscal deficit in the long term.  Gillian Martin, SNP MSP for Aberdeenshire East, said there was growing confidence in the North East, with oil production expected to be 20 per cent higher this year than in 2014.  She said: \u0026ldquoThe North Sea looks set once again on an upward trajectory, however, we cannot be complacent. With up to 20bn barrels of oil left, the Tory government must use its powers to stimulate exploration and investment, and ensure our oil and gas sector can capitalise on a decommissioning market that is forecast to reach \u0026pound17bn. It is the least they can do.  Scottish Green MSP Patrick Harvie said GERS was a reminder of Scotland\u0026rsquos over-reliance on oil and gas extraction when a transition to clean renewable energy was needed.  He said: \u0026ldquoWhile other parties use this annual publication as justification for how Scotland couldn\u0026rsquot be a small, successful independent country, or how great the SNP government thinks it is, they\u0026rsquod do well to remember that both our prosperity and our climate depends on moving to a clean economy.  Former Tory MEP Struan Stevenson, now Chief Executive of Scottish Business UK, added: \u0026ldquoWhile the figures do show some improvement in Scotland\u0026rsquos finances thanks to a small recovery in North Sea oil, it\u0026rsquos increasingly clear this one commodity cannot be relied upon to deliver stable returns each year.  \"Scottish business needs a level of certainty and these figures are a stark reminder of the uncertain future which lies ahead if the proponents of independence continue to gamble with the Scottish economy."},{"url":null,"title":"edinburgh-based-locogen-group-leading-the-way-on-renewables-targets","story":"  Andrew Lyle, managing director of the Locogen Group, an Edinburgh-based pioneer in the renewable energy sector, is at the very heart of this drive toward zero carbon and he is similarly optimistic about the global prospects outlined by Bloomberg.  As he is for Scotland and the rest of the UK by 2050, though while he believes that the Scottish Government has been supportive of the agenda locally, is concerned that a lack of direction and policy in Westminster is creating uncertainty which will be challenging for mature onshore wind, solar and hydro in the short term.  The firm has been busy over the past two years and in 2016 it set up a presence in France. \u0026ldquoWe recently got planning consent for our first wind project and we have a pipeline of further wind and solar projects in the planning system and in development, says Lyle.  \u0026ldquoFrance is very supportive of renewable energy projects and has strong long-term policies and targets so we see this as a key market in the future.  Locogen had been primarily operating in the areas of wind, solar and hydro power but has also increasingly diversified into renewable heat. It recently purchased a Glasgow based biomass and heat pump company and now has a team in Glasgow which is developing district heating and heat pump project projects \u0026ndash shared loop district heating schemes that serve multiple properties.  Lyle is enthusiastic about the potential in this area, an enthusiasm fuelled by the fact that Locogen is on the cusp of signing two leading-edge projects in the sector. \u0026ldquoOur first community heating contract is a week away from being signed. It\u0026rsquos a joint venture with a community group to deliver our first district heating scheme, which will be commissioned before December, he says.  This, he adds, is a shared loop, ground source heat pump project and the first in Scotland to provide heat via a shared loop heat pump network to privately owned homes. A second project, just weeks away will see Locogen as the contractor in a similar programme. \u0026ldquoThe fact that we are involved in the first of these projects in Scotland is pretty fantastic,  says Lyle.  \u0026ldquoWithout a doubt the area of shared loop district heating and heat pump projects is going to majorly increase in significance in the coming years as there are so many benefits deriving from this over the other forms of district heating.  While Locogen is still undertaking wind and solar projects \u0026ndash such as the impressive Solar PV project at 10 sites around the UK for the M\u0026ampCo clothing chain, with an expected annual generation of 643,000 KWH \u0026ndash he says that the scale of the market for wind and solar been hit by the removal of the Feed-in Tariff and the Renewable Obligation schemes. \u0026ldquoWhen you look at a windfarm, you can go down the route of a corporate PPA [Power Purchase Agreement] and some of the very large companies are now 100% renewable via windfarms on PPAs.  \u0026ldquoAt the smaller, community scale it\u0026rsquos more challenging but there is real opportunity in renewable heating and district heating and we see it in the new build housing and social housing sector, where we can offer an ESCO [Energy Supply Company] arrangement to deliver these projects. And that is our goal: to provide ESCO services and deliver renewable heating to these buildings, he says.  In May this year Lyle addressed 280 delegates at Low Carbon Scotland on Scottish policy and renewable opportunities for the public sector. The event is a unique annual conference that addresses Scotland\u0026rsquos current carbon position and facilitates discussion among those leading and driving policies.  \u0026ldquoLow Carbon Scotland was a very good chance to discuss the issues and the opportunities within the sector. Looking at the public sector, I was trying to show where the opportunities lay, focusing on behind the meter wind and solar technologies, biomass heating, heat pumps and district heating schemes, says Lyle. Now with 26 staff between Scotland and France, Lyle \u0026ndash who is also a director of Scottish Renewables \u0026ndash believes there is definitely room for expansion. \u0026ldquoWe are keen to open an office in London, he says. \u0026ldquoThe mayor has announced an Energy for Londoners scheme and the Mayor\u0026rsquos Energy Efficiency Fund so there is a huge opportunity to work with businesses and housing associations, developers and the public sector to deliver renewable and low carbon energy projects in London.

Le Roy discovered Weah playing for a club in Cameroon in the late 1980s and recommended him to Wenger, the then coach of Monaco in France.  Wenger took the advice, signed the Liberian who went on to play for Monaco, Paris Saint-Germain and AC Milan, and became the first \u0026ndash and still only \u0026ndash African to win the Fifa world player of the year award in 1995.  Liberian sports minister D. Zeogar Wilson said Wenger will be given the Humane Order of African Redemption with the rank of Knight Grand Commander.  Wenger and Le Roy, the current Togo coach, are both expected to attend Friday\u0026rsquos ceremony, government officials said.  But Darius Dillon, an opposition politician, criticised Weah for using the nation\u0026rsquos highest honour and the office of the president to recognise people who only played a role in his \u0026ldquopersonal life.  \u0026ldquoThe nation\u0026rsquos highest honour cannot be given to somebody who has not done something directly for the country, Mr Dillion said.  Other political opponents have questioned the decision with Emmanuel Gonquoi, of the Economic Freedom Fighters of Liberia, calling it \u0026ldquoa complete waste of time.  Weah is Liberia\u0026rsquos best sportsman ever and the golden years of his career coincided with civil war in Liberia.  Mr Wilson, the sports minister, said he disagreed with the criticism.  \u0026ldquoDuring the heat of the civil war the only good thing that came out of Liberia was George Weah and his soccer prowess, he said.  \u0026ldquoHow can we not honour these guys who made him get where he got?  Weah dedicated his award to Wenger when he was named world player of the year and has said the former Arsenal coach was the most important influence on his career.  He invited Wenger to his inauguration as president in January, although Wenger could not attend.  Wenger has also praised Weah.  \u0026ldquoThe life of this guy is a real film, Wenger said earlier this year. \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos unbelievable. It can make a fantastic film.  The 51-year-old retired from football in 2003 and turned almost immediately to politics, failing in his first attempt to become president of Liberia in 2005.  His victory by a landslide in last year\u0026rsquos election highlighted his inspiring story \u0026mdash he was born in a slum surrounded by swamps on the outskirts of the Liberian capital Monrovia and overcame early hardship to become an international soccer star and then president of his country."},{"url":null,"title":"dominic-raab-pledges-unilateral-action-to-keep-trade-and-transport-flowing-in-no-deal","story":"  In a speech outlining the Government\u0026rsquos planning for a possible no-deal the Brexit Secretary will say the Government would not risk triggering a tit-for-tat battle with Brussels by imposing new border checks or travel restrictions.

Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab is due to give a speech on Thursday to coincide with the release of the first of a raft of papers on more than 80 subjects.  It follows his assurances that EU citizens living in the UK will not be \u0026ldquoturfed out if no deal is agreed with Brussels, as he vowed to \u0026ldquomove swiftly to safeguard their future.  Mr Raab said he is confident of reaching an agreement, but sought to reassure those living in Britain that ministers would act quickly to secure their position if the UK crashes out of the EU.

He said: \u0026ldquoWe are making progress with the negotiations. We remain of the view that we are hopeful or optimistic about there being a good deal agreed in the autumn of this year.  \u0026ldquoWe saw Mr Barnier yesterday suggesting it might not be in October, but it might slip until a little bit later and frankly that doesn\u0026rsquot surprise me.  \u0026ldquoI was Europe minister for six years. I\u0026rsquove seen enough of these negotiations to know that these deadlines slip. I think there will need to be an agreement by the end of 2018.  But he said there was a \u0026ldquoreal pressure for Brexit to happen on 29 March 2019 as planned, and it was not practical or desirable to extend the Article 50 process.  Besides requiring the unanimous agreement of all 28 EU states, the European Parliament would switch focus to its own elections in the New Year, making it difficult to get enough MEPs together in a plenary session to pass a deal and get legislation through Westminster.  There would also be a new European Commission being appointed next year and the European budget to settle, with EU leaders moving on to other issues.  He said: \u0026ldquoFrom our point of view, I don\u0026rsquot see an extension as being in our interests. What we need is a real focus upon getting the detail of the Brexit negotiations sorted, done and dusted.  \u0026ldquoYou need a deadline in order to make people focus because there are always lots of other things that are consuming the bandwidth.  \u0026ldquoIf you delay things there\u0026rsquos the risk you don\u0026rsquot give yourself extra time to sort it out, you just end up in a situation where people\u0026rsquos attention wanders.  \u0026ldquoThey don\u0026rsquot focus on cracking the last challenging problems.  He said the UK government had also shared its technical notes on a no-deal Brexit with the Scottish and Welsh governments, incorporating \u0026nbspfeedback on devolved areas.  He added: \u0026ldquoA chaotic Brexit isn\u0026rsquot in anybody\u0026rsquos interests which is why the government is working so hard on a negotiated outcome, and we believe that the package which is expressed in the Chequers white paper provides with a good pragmatic way forward which will deliver for Scotland and every other part of the UK."},{"url":null,"title":"scotland-ranked-in-top-five-travel-experience-destinations-by-website","story":"  Experiences such as a tour of the Loch Lomond and Trossachs National Park and a four-day tour of the west Highlands and Isle of Skye helped boost Scotland to fifth place in the world rankings by travel website TripAdvisor.

The company’s response was to suspend him from his post in order to explore options, but then later sacked him, despite them having been advised by medical experts on the condition, that with some suitable adjustments to his working conditions, he could continue to be a valuable employee.        The employment tribunal which heard the case has now issued its ruling that BrewDog unlawfully discriminated against Mr Ross and treated him unfavourably because of his condition.The company, which has been valued at £1.8bn were told to pay compensation to Mr Ross in the sum of £12,052.New legislation which passed into law in 2015 prevented the tribunal from ordering that BrewDog staff undergo further equality training.A spokesman for the company said: “This was a really difficult situation for every member of our team involved in it, and clearly for the Tribunal panel too as their decision on the outcome was split.                                                                                                         “We worked with James in order to find a suitable alternative role within the business where his safety would not be compromised, but James wanted to keep his packaging role. “We ended up in a position where we had to balance James’ wishes with the best interests of the team around him, and while we regret that an agreement couldn’t be reached, we have a moral responsibility to prioritise the safety of our team. “We wish James all the best in his new role and his upcoming studies.”RNIB Scotland, which supports blind and partially sighted people, said: “Many employers still assume this group would be difficult or even impossible to employ.                                                                                                        “We know of journalists, teachers, bankers and physicists working in Scotland with sight loss.“It’s about encouraging employers to consider what people can do, not what they can’t.”                                                                    "},{"url":null,"title":"housing development for inverurie site","story":"        A new  housing development may be about to get underway in Inverurie following a recommendation to grant planning approval for a new development by CALA Homes.

Some reports suggest it may be more than just a fanciful notion.When first contacted by Wick historian Harry Gray about the recent restoration of the \"Iron Wellie\", we had visions of a giant Wellington boot unearthed from the Caithness moors. That theory was firmly booted into touch after a visit to this unearthed marvel on the northern side of Wick Bay.The Iron Wellie is in fact a spring water well situated down a flight of recently restored Caithness flagstone steps close to the Soldiers\u0027 Tower on the North Head.Charlie Bain of Wick Paths Group explained how together with Denny Swanson, Tommy Munro and others from the Royal British Legion Scotland they recently restored the site of the spring.\"The steps down to it were overgrown and damaged,\" he said. \"We also replaced the pipe the water flows through and there is a marker stone at the top of the steps.\"Denny Swanson said he remembered bringing the water to his mother who suffered from arthritis for most of her life.\"She sent me down every second day for a bottle of \u0027Iron Wellie water\u0027, as she called it. She maintained it helped her arthritis and it certainly seemed to take some of her pain away.\"After Harry symbolically cut a ribbon of barricade tape the group, together with Charlie\u0027s dog Jet, went down for a taste of the water that many in the area depended on in bygone times. It is speculated that the inhabitants of nearby Tinkers\u0027 Cave would have consumed the water. The Wick worthy Tudor James resided close to the site and lived to a ripe old age.Harry said that the Iron Wellie was also known as the Chalybeate Spring and its taste has been described like \"sookin\u0027 pennies\".\"Chalybeate waters, also known as ferruginous waters, are mineral waters containing salts of iron \u0026ndash hence the local name Iron Wellie,\" he said.\"There is no written history of this well but it was certainly known in the 18th century and by the turn of the 20th century it was sometimes referred to as \u0027Jocky Simpson\u0027s Wellie\u0027. Who Jocky Simpson was, is lost in time.\"Harry said that \"generations of Wickers\" out for a walk along the braes or exiles home on holiday would nearly always stop for a drink from the wellie.\"We as youngsters firmly believed that the water did us good despite the taste and it was a welcome drink when playing around the North Head or when fishing or swimming from the rocks,\" he said.\"Young lads get hungry and we would sneak a turnip from Bob Cormack\u0027s field above the wellie, dock it on a stab [for the uninitiated that means removing the ends of the neep by striking it against a fence post] and we then cut off the skin and washed the neep in the Iron Wellie water before sitting on a rock and devouring it.\"Harry laughed at how present-day health and safety regulations would make drinking the water seem like a risky act \"but none of us became ill or died from it, perhaps proving the efficacy of the wellie\u0027s water\".Perhaps in the future Wick will host thousands of pilgrims queuing up for a taste of the rejuvenating powers of the Iron Wellie water.Thursday 23 Aug 2018 1:37

agency employee, others should not be deterred from launching similar action.DeeAnn Fitzpatrick had claimed that she experienced bullying and harassment while employed as a fisheries officer for Marine Scotland at Scrabster harbour, but a tribunal this week ruled against her in the case.Speaking to the Groat, Iain Gregory, the deputy manager of Caithness Citizens\u0027 Advice Bureau (CAB), stressed that bullying regularly takes place in the workplace, and each year he hears numerous complaints.\"Clients feel that they have been the victim of unfair dismissal, discriminatory treatment, bullying or other types of incorrect treatment,\" he said.\"Anyone who feels they have been the victim of such conduct or treatment should never be deterred from reporting the matter.\"DeeAnn Fitzpatrick had claimed that she experienced bullying and harassment after she became a \"whistleblower\" while employed as a fisheries officer at Marine Scotland at Scrabster.The 49-year-old Canadian national told an employment tribunal in Aberdeen recently that she felt intimidated after being sent anonymous cards between 2015 and 2017, and claimed she was targeted with sexual harassment, for being a woman, and because of her age.In a previous hearing, Ms Fitzpatrick had also alleged that she was taped to a chair and gagged by colleagues in 2010.The employment tribunal, however, ruled against Ms Fitzpatrick in its decision on the case.In its judgment, it said it could not agree whether the cards came from current colleagues, and is understood to have been unable to consider the chair allegation as it was said to have taken place more than three years before the complaint was brought.Mr Gregory says that each year CAB deals with a \"substantial number\" of bullying cases, each of which is examined carefully and then detailed evidence is obtained.He says in many cases CAB is able to resolve matters without progression to the Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service (ACAS) or to a tribunal \u0026ndash \"perhaps by raising a grievance with the employer or by negotiation\".He added: \"However, there are numerous cases which require referral via ACAS and we can often resolve issues at this point by using the \u0027Early Conciliation\u0027 process.\"He underlined that it is \"comparatively unusual\" for a case to proceed to tribunal, with only a \"small percentage\" going that far.\"While it would be inappropriate to comment on any case in which we were not involved, I would stress that people should not under any circumstances be dissuaded from pursuing their rights,\" Mr Gregory said.\"The system exists to ensure that your case can and will be properly considered and we can advise you and make sure that you understand it.\"Thursday 23 Aug

NHS Highland recently approved the move to public consultation, which has been widely welcomed.The preferred option includes the development of a proposed care hub/village at the Dunbar Hospital site in Thurso and the Pulteney House care home site in Wick.The plans also include a multimillion-pound upgrade for Caithness General as part of an overall \u0026pound30 million investment for the area.The option of developing Wick\u0026rsquos Town and County Hospital will also be included in the consultation.The Wick event will be held on Monday, August 20, between 6pm and 7pm, while the Thurso one takes place the following evening at the same time.People planning to attend either should contact Christian Nicolson of NHS Highland on 07870513114 or email christian.nicolson@nhs.net to help ensure adequate seating can be provided.The health authority says further events will be arranged in due course and dates will be widely publicised.Thursday 23 Aug 2018 1:37 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116965.jpg","title":"Wildlife cruise passengers get close up view of orca pod","story":"\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspIt happened on Sunday during a Pentland Venture wildlife cruise when five orcas, including two calves, came into view \u0026ndash to gasps of delight from onlookers.Fred Fermor of John O\u0026rsquoGroats Ferries said: \u0026ldquoAs luck would have it we had more than 100 passengers on our wildlife cruise that day.\u0026ldquoI was taking a walk round the stacks and witnessed the spectacle from the shore.\u0026ldquoIt was great to hear the excited chatter and shouts from the passengers when they saw the orcas approach the Pentland Venture which by that time was just bobbing around.He added: \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a case of letting people see these magnificent creatures while respecting their space and habitat.\u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos great to think that Caithness can offer such experiences and that folk will go back to the far corners and tell their friends what a wonderful place we live in.The orcas were photographed from Duncansby Head by Colin Bird, former area group co-ordinator for Sea Watch Foundation, who started the annual Orca Watch at Duncansby.He said: \u0026ldquoThe ferry has been a great help in providing sightings of cetaceans in the Pentland Firth over the past 15 years.These sightings have helped form a greater understanding of the movement of orcas between Iceland and the north of Scotland.As reported in the Courier, local wildlife photographer Karen Munro saw seven killer whales on Friday close to the shore at St John\u0026rsquos Point, where they \u0026ldquoharassed seals for about an hour. They moved on towards Stroma and she alerted the ferry team.Mr Fermor said: \u0026ldquoThe orcas stayed at Stroma for a while and although some distance from John O\u0026rsquoGroats it caused a bit of a stir onshore and Karen generously let visitors view the whales through her powerful telescope.Meanwhile, Sea Watch Foundation says its latest National Whale and Dolphin Watch event looks like being the best in the past two decades in terms of the unprecedented variety of species of whales and dolphins seen around the British Isles.The event involved thousands of volunteers from all around the British Isles and was conducted between July 28 and August 5.This summer\u0026rsquos stable weather is one possible explanations for the high number of cetacean sightings in the country as a whole, with higher temperatures bringing warmer-water species and creating the conditions for plankton fronts to develop \u0026ndash attracting shoals of fish and, in turn, whales and dolphins.Meanwhile, Sea Watch Foundation says its latest National Whale and Dolphin Watch event looks like being the best in the past two decades in terms of the unprecedented variety of species of whales and dolphins seen around the British Isles.The event involved thousands of volunteers and was conducted between July 28 and August 5.Thursday 23 Aug 2018 1:38 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"August 23, 2018 at 6:00 amThis week\u0026#8217s 56-page edition of The Orcadian is now available in shops and online, here.

No personal information will be gathered as part of this.Evidence suggests that across Scotland more than a quarter of people in education have struggled at some point in the previous year to access sanitary products with some girls and young women having missed school or skipped classes because they didn’t have access to products.The Scottish Government, local authorities and the university and college sectors have therefore committed to providing free access to sanitary products in all schools, colleges and universities in Scotland beginning from the new academic term.Further information can be found at  www.young.scot/periods.\u0026nbsp\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Accompanied by a support boat, Mr Cameron, 40, reached the shore on the other side, near Duncansby Head, sometime just before 8.20pm tonight.Mr Cameron decided to take on the seven-mile swim across the Firth in memory of his girlfriend Ena Brown, who died suddenly earlier this year. Money raised through the challenge will be going to the Kirkwall Maternity Ward, where Ena had worked.Speaking tonight, Monday, following the swim, he said: \u0026#8220It was a grind, I was swimming for over four hours and I never stopped for one second, I just ploughed on the whole way.\u0026#8220It was quite choppy to start with but it got better as I went on. Things eased off after about an hour or so. I knew I had it in me, I was just worried about the conditions changing and having to pull the plug, so I couldn\u0026#8217t relax during the swim. I went through all sorts of emotions \u0026#8211 I was confident and I had moments of doubt.\u0026#8220That last hour was a real grind, I must confess. I could see Duncansby Head in the foreground and I didn\u0026#8217t think I had long to go, but I was scared to ask. I had thought I had about 15 minutes to go, but I had an hour-and-a-half to go. It was real tough going.\u0026#8221\u0026#8220I\u0026#8217ve done marathons, I\u0026#8217ve won Scottish championship surfing titles, but that\u0026#8217s the toughest thing I\u0026#8217ve done.Asked how he felt following the swim, he replied: \u0026#8220I feel a big weight off my shoulders. If this hadn\u0026#8217t happened this week we would have been looking at next summer. I feel I\u0026#8217ve achieved something, I know this has been done before once or twice before, but this is something I will remember for the rest of my life. It\u0026#8217s very rewarding.

Indeed, the evidence suggests that the capital grants previously available have made a real and positive impact.“Everyone agrees that encouraging new blood into farming is vitally important, including here in Orkney. At a time of real uncertainty for the sector, there is a need for the government to help provide what stability it can.“It is all the more surprising therefore that the minister has chosen to take this decision now.  I have written to Mr Ewing, who is due to visit Orkney next month, asking for a reassurance that the government does not intend to walk away from supporting new entrants and ensuring agriculture in Scotland has a bright future.”               \u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Made with footage culled from up to 240 cameras that captured both the initial launch and the nine-day mission that followed, the film is a vital scientific document, a portrait of late \u0026#821760s America and a visually cogent exploration of man\u0026#8217s place in the universe.With an original score by Charles Morrow and a commanding narration by Laurence Luckinbill, the documentary won a special award at the Cannes Film Festival. However, for the next few decades, it was practically forgotten even the original printing elements were lost.Christopher Riley is a film producer, director and writer specialising in science, engineering and history. His work has been celebrated by BAFTA, the US Television Academy, the Royal Television Society, the Sundance Institute and the Grierson Trust.He is a regular contributor to  newspaper and presents science documentaries for BBC Radio 4. In 2007 he tracked down Theo Kamecke — who was working as a sculptor in upstate New York — and found that he held the only remaining 35mm print. Working closely with Theo, Moonwalk One was re-mastered, combining a unique 35mm director’s cut with newly transferred 16mm NASA flight film media, to create a new HD digital master of the film.This will be the first chance to see the new high-definition Blu-ray version of the film which is due to be released next year.Moonwalk One: The Director\u0026#8217s Cut is on at West Side Cinema, Stromness Town Hall, Saturday, September 8 at 7.45pm. The film has been programmed to coincide with #skyranMOON and the Museum Of The Moon at Stromness Academy.            \u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The 3.6km section between Glendoe and Loch Tarff has been particularly challenging and would not have been possible without funding support from SSE, Highland Council and the Scottish Government and European Union totalling \u0026pound250,000, as well as the full support from Glendoe Estate over whose land the trail has been constructed. The opening of this section opens up the South Loch Ness Trail to more walkers, mountain bikers and horse riders and, particularly on this section of the trail, to those of limited mobility.\"Mr Ambrose added that the creation of the LochNess360\u0026deg trail will bring new opportunities for businesses, communities and deliver major economic benefit to the area in the long term.\"It will achieve this because it will attract visitors who may spend up to six to seven days completing the full circuit,\" he added. We know from feedback that there is already substantial interest from key European markets, particularly Germany, and VILN hope by spring 2019 to confidently go out to markets and promote it.

Her cooking was what initially drew clients to come to the centre and her baking, he said, was \"legendary\".This theme was echoed by speeches from Ina Mackenzie, Mina Stewart and Kerry Watson. Laela Maclean composed a poem which reminisced and poked good-natured fun at Cis\u0026rsquos life in Lochcarron and the Centre.Cis\u0026rsquos husband Sandy kept the feet tapping with musical interludes on his accordion \u0026mdash including one tune called Christine Ross of Lochcarron, initially written for Cis by the late Iain Crichton, from Stornoway.Christine Houser, Donar MacIver and his son, Stephen MacIver sang Gaelic songs \u0026mdash the eyes of some of the older guests lighting up as they joined in the choruses.Cis was aided by Morag MacCuish to cut her retirement cake which had been made by Harry Gow, her favourite baker. She made a speech thanking everyone for their presence and for the gifts she had received from the clients, staff and board members.The event provided a lovely send-off for Cis. The afternoon ended with everyone joining hands to sing Auld Lang Syne accompanied musically, as in life, by her husband Sandy.Thursday 23 Aug 2018 1:38 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

Hopes for a visitor trail around an area that was heavily militarised during WWII are now full steam ahead after the project team behind the Aultbea museum secured almost \u0026pound73,000 from the Scottish Land Fund towards the purchase of a former butcher\u0026rsquos shop it has been renting to house the display.People from 19 countries outside the UK were amongst the 5500-plus visitors dropping in between May and October last year and that number is set to mushroom as the facility is improved and plans for a wider trail developed.The project\u0026rsquos chairman Francis Russell told the Journal: \"To some extent we have become masters of our own destiny. This opens up new avenues of funding. The location on the NC500 is very important.\"We ask people when they come in how they heard about us and some say it was while they were driving by. It puts us on the map. We\u0026rsquoll look at the feasibility and cost of a major refurbishment and possibly an extension. We could do with much more space.\"Fellow project volunteer Elizabeth Miles said the boost \"will allow us to get on to develop it the way we would like\".She said: \"Owning the site will open new possibilities. We will look to create a WWII trail where everywhere gets visited. We\u0026rsquore hoping to really do something with it.\"Research found the NC500, which passes the makeshift museum, brought 29,000 extra visitors in its first year, adding an extra \u0026pound9m to the Highland economy.The \u0026pound72,820 award will contribute towards the purchase of the former butcher\u0026rsquos shop and surrounding land.Honorary president of the RACP George Milne said the aim is to create a multi-site museum for current and future generations to learn about the convoys.He said: \"The overall aim is to establish a unique multi-site museum in Wester Ross. Around Loch Ewe we hope to create a permanent exhibition centre, a WWII Trail with interpretation panels, a memorial garden, and the preservation of selected wartime buildings to honour all who served in the Arctic convoys to and from Russia from 1941-1945.\"\u0026nbspThe 75th anniversary of the last convoy to sail from the area will be marked in 2020, with relatives of servicemen and visitors from around the world expected to come in their droves.Gairloch Heritage Museum, which itself secured backing from the Heritage Lottery Fund and Highlands and Islands Enterprise for a \u0026pound2m project to convert the old anti-aircraft operations room in the centre of the village into a state of the art new facility, welcomed the news.It said: \"Congratulations to our friends at Russian Arctic Convoy Museum on procuring the funds to purchase their exhibition centre. Their volunteers have worked really hard to achieve this. We are delighted to see this investment in their project, which recognises a very important aspect of the heritage of our area.\"Thursday 23 Aug 2018 1:38 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

All my sculptures contain a memory and I felt it apt that this particular work should be imbued with the feeling of being held in a loving embrace, feeling safe and secure enough to develop your potential.\"The Shelter of Your Arms is one of a collection of pieces created by Ann on display throughout the garden and in the Sawyer Gallery within Inverewe House.Operations manager Kevin Frediani said: \"As a result of the Gulf Stream meeting the Highlands, Inverewe Garden is a nirvana of unusual and wonderful plants and wildlife. Through our arts and exhibition programme we are providing visitors with another dimension to the garden and new way to enjoy Scotland\u0026rsquos national and natural treasures, as our reputation as a centre of arts and culture grows.\"The exhibition is open now and runs until August 30.Last month, NTS unveiled its vision of a proposed new 20m viewing tower within the garden.The plans, which have been submitted to Highland Council for consent, would see an observation tower overlooking Loch Ewe.If given the go-ahead, the tower would provide unique panoramic views for visitors with, according to the NTS, minimal impact on surroundings and could be used to host educational talks.A spring 2019 opening is planned if all goes according to plan.The attraction has enjoyed a surge in visitor numbers after recent investment including the renovation of Inverewe House, the development of the new Sawyer Gallery and Bothy Caf\u0026eacute and new glasshouses.Thursday 23 Aug 2018 1:39 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

We wanted to take positive action to help the red squirrel population spread into the local woodlands as safely as possible. The combination of bridge and road signs definitely appears to be working well, which is great news.\"It\u0026rsquos safer for reds to travel in the tree canopy rather than on the ground, so it\u0026rsquos likely that if they have the option of using a bridge rather than crossing the road, they will take it. We also installed feeders at each end of the bridge to encourage the squirrels to use it.\"Since the bridge and road signs were introduced, there has only been one known red squirrel road death locally, with none reported so far in 2018.

Smart Metering Systems (SMS), which connects, owns, operates and maintains energy metering assets and databases, has inked the tie-up with renewable energy supplier Good Energy.            Good Energy, based in Wiltshire, has more than 250,000 customers across the UK, adding to the 2 million-plus customers already served by SMS.             Under the terms of the agreement, SMS will supply domestic smart meters as part of the UK government’s rollout programme, which requires that domestic energy supply companies provide their customers with a smart meter to use in their homes and small businesses by 2020.SMS will provide new “SMETS 2” smart meters to monitor energy usage, which have a user-friendly advantage over the previous SMETS 1 model, as they allow customers to switch suppliers without changing meters. The majority of smart meters soon to be installed under the main phase of the government’s rollout scheme will be SMETS 2.  Alan Foy, chief executive officer at SMS, which is quoted on the alternative investment market (AIM), said: “We are delighted to be working with Good Energy as their exclusive supplier, one of the UK’s leading suppliers of energy from renewable sources, in the rollout of their smart meter programme. “Good Energy have over 250,000 customers across the UK, SMS is well positioned to support them with the smart meter rollout given our strong track record for customer services and asset ownership and management.”            John Maltby, Good Energy chairman, said the partnership would lead to a good user experience for the supplier’s customers. He said: “We are pleased to announce our partnership with SMS as the chosen supplier of our new SMETS 2 meters, as part of the UK government programme to roll out smart meters to UK energy customers.“Good Energy is focused on making sure smart meters work for the renewable energy sector. “Partnering with SMS gives us the ability to provide our customers with a market-leading smart meter, and associated products, which will enhance user experience.”            This is the latest deal for SMS, which signed a meter rental agreement in February with Utilita Energy to provide more than 100,000 meters throughout the year.The firm in March upped its dividend by more than a quarter despite a dip in pre-tax profits.

There is a commemorative stone sitting in Heriot-Watt University that is a testimony to the hubris of Alex Salmond \u0026#8211 and the cost to his own people of his flagship tuition fee policy. This week the failure of that policy was exposed for all to see and it is a heartbreaking sight.                University tuition is not free. It never has been. Universities are independent institutions. Someone, somewhere – be it the churches that founded the oldest colleges, the governments that expanded their number, or the students who studied – has always had to pay for the teaching.             There are large costs for the ­lectures, tutorials, field trips, laboratories, libraries, sports facilities and all the staff to be paid for.             Overseas students – other than those from the European Union – pay what could be described as a ­commercial rate, although many are sponsored through various bursaries or scholarships. Up until 1997, tuition fees for ­British students were paid to the ­universities by the UK taxpayer on an average cost per head. The Conservative government expanded significantly the number of places, which increased the cost of this “free” service. To afford this huge expansion the means-tested maintenance grants that covered living costs for undergraduates were replaced by student loans – repayable through  a  higher tax rate only once graduates earn above average salaries.With the election of Tony Blair’s government came two decisions the Conservatives had avoided – to start charging British students for tuition and to establish a Scottish Parliament that would have included the management of higher education.Predictably university tuition fees were unpopular charging for something that once appeared free was always going to be controversial. When the first Scottish Parliament elections came along charging tuition fees was a dominant issue.Once elected, the Labour-Liberal Democrat Scottish Executive brought in a new scheme, called the graduate endowment, which ensured the tuition fee for Scottish students (which technically would still exist) would be paid out of its education budget. In return, funds raised from the modest sum that students would ­contribute after graduation (and ­getting a well-paid job) would fund a bursary scheme open to students from poorer backgrounds.            Because of European Union rules, any students from the rest of the EU would also have their tuition fees paid for, while students from the rest of the UK would have to pay themselves – the unified education system across the UK was being broken up.When Alex Salmond and the SNP came to power eight years later he abolished the graduate endowment and cut back on the bursary scheme, claiming that tuition fees for Scots (and EU students) were now free. Technically it was correct, but as the taxpayer had funded Scottish ­students’ tuition from 2000 it was really the graduate endowment that was now free (and correspondingly the bursary was progressively harder to obtain.) For those that doubted it before – an ever-decreasing number – the SNP’s so-called free tuition fee can now be seen to have been highly ­damaging to Scotland’s young people with good qualifications and an ambition to learn more.To control government spending the number of funded places for Scots students is limited (capped). Now, with exam results issued, Scots students are finding in the clearing process that places are being given to students from the rest of the UK – because they pay three times as much, no matter how well qualified they are.            Imagine inventing a scheme that in theory discriminates against the rest of the UK but in practice discriminates against Scots, and all the while students from the EU are paid for by the Scottish taxpayer (and according to Nicola Sturgeon will continue to be even after Brexit)?The SNP’s “free” tuition fees is ruining Scots kids’ life chances. It is time for it to be scrapped and bursaries for the less well-off to be brought back while others can use their ­student loans to pay their way."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4783471.1534192405!/image/image.jpg","title":"chris bambery how scotland s own occupy movement took over edinburgh 80 years ago","story":"        Frustration and anger at rising inequality is nothing new, as a largely forgotten chapter of Scotland\u0026#8217s history of protest shows, writes Chris Bambery                In June 1933, for three days and nights, jobless protesters occupied the centre of Edinburgh, sleeping out on Princes Street under the windows of the city elite’s gentlemen’s clubs.            An army of the unemployed descended on Edinburgh from all corners of Scotland. With them were bands, field kitchens and banners. Each marcher had a knapsack and blanket. The goal of the marchers was to meet with Sir Godfrey Collins, Secretary of State for Scotland, to demand the abolition of the means test, increased relief for men, women and children and for work schemes to provide jobs. The city authorities made it clear the marchers were not welcome and they would provide no accommodation or food.            The march was organised by the Communist-led National Unemployed Workers Movement (NUWM), whose Scottish organiser was the veteran agitator, Harry McShane, but it won support from the Independent Labour Party, the trade unions and Labour Party. The Aberdeen and Dundee contingents marched south to join with the Fife contingent in Kirkcaldy. The Ayrshire contingent joined with Lanarkshire marching via Shotts and East Calder. The Renfrewshire and Dunbartonshire contingents, including a women’s section marched via Glasgow, Coatbridge, Airdrie, Bathgate, and Broxburn. The main Glasgow contingent marched to Kilsyth and Falkirk, where they joined with Stirlingshire, and onto Edinburgh via Bo’ness.READ MORE: Video: Rare footage of Edinburgh in the 1930sOn Sunday 12 June, they joined up in Costorphine for their entry into the capital. The next day 20,000 people greeted them at the Mound. The first sign of a thaw on the part of the authorities was when the Ministries of Labour, Health and Education agreed to meet delegations of marchers. But there was still no reply from Collins. A second victory was when the police lifted a ban on street collections. But Collins refused to meet with them.The NUWM members paraded through the royal palace of Holyrood with their band playing ‘The Internationale’ and other socialist tunes, and when the city council refused to provide accommodation their leader, Harry McShane, said they’d sleep on the pavement of Princes Street, the city’s most prestigious thoroughfare, as marcher William McVicar recalled: “I think someone offered us somewhere [to sleep] like Waverley Market or somethin’. And McShane and them wouldn’t accept that, they says, ‘No, no, we’re not going there.’ So they says, ‘Oh well, we cannae give you anything else.’ And of course he says, ‘Right we’ll sleep in Princes Street.’” The Edinburgh Evening News reported McShane telling the marchers as they gathered on the south side of Princes Street: “So far here we are and here we stay until another decision is reached. We can breakfast, dinner or tea here, and the men require a rest. They can have that rest in Princes Street. We have decided to give them a long lie in ‘bed’ this morning.” The Edinburgh Dispatch caught the mood among the ordinary folk of Edinburgh as they made thier way along Princes Street on that first morning: “Walking along on the carriageway one heard snatches of conversation: ‘Slept well?’ ‘How did ye enjoy yer feather bed?’ ‘Did ye feel a draught coming in during the night?’”            On the first morning, women marchers blocked the tramway while men shaved using their reflections in the windows of the big department stores. Tom Ferns remembers: “And they couldnae ha’ picked a better spot than Princes Street. Under the Conservative Party headquarters, the Liberal Party headquarters and the big luxury hotels, here was hundreds and hundreds o’ angry unemployed. Obviously a sight like that is not seen every day, particularly in the capital city of Edinburgh.”READ MORE: Astonishing press photographs capture interwar-era EdinburghAnother marcher, James Allison, said, “the police were going mad”. Yet Edinburgh police were not keen on inciting a pitched battle as Hugh Sloan recalled: “At dinner time, our field-kitchen came along and the police chief told Harry McShane, ‘This is Princes Street, you can’t feed here.’ Harry told them, ‘It was good enough for us to sleep here, it’s good enough for us to feed here.’” The marchers then demanded free transport home. Eventually the city’s chief constable and deputy town clerk told them they would provide transport if McShane guaranteed there would be no more marches to Edinburgh. He refused and the chief constable, worried about disturbances on the capital’s streets, backed down. Transport was then provided to take the marchers home.            On the last night, the marchers and their supporters gathered to burn an effigy of Sir Godfrey Collins before boarding buses and a final meal paid for by the city council. The march organisers refused to give a guarantee that no further hunger marchers would defile the city!Throughout the 1930s, the unemployed protested but the NUWM also organised children’s parties in the summer and at Christmas. A number of the marchers would go on to fight in the Spanish Civil War, including the leader of the Aberdeen contingent, Bob Cooney.The inter-war period, not just the “Hungry Thirties”, was grim in Scotland. Prior to the First World War, it had been at the cutting edge of British industry. Within a few years of the wars end the traditional industries, coal, steel and shipbuilding were in trouble. Scottish banks and companies were bought up by their bigger English rivals. Unemployment was a permanent feature, peaking in the 1930s and only ending with the demands of the Second World War.The shale mining industry collapsed, for example, as cheap imported oil cut demand for paraffin. In December 1925, “The Scotsman” reported from Tarbrax, a shale mining village then in South Lanarkshire under the headline “Situation at Tarbrax: Faced With Starvation,” which reported: “Workers from Tarbrax, to the number of nearly 400, marched in procession to Carnwath, nearly ten miles distant, on Thursday night last for the purpose of asking poor relief. Relief under the emergency clause of the Poor Law Act, which enables people in a state of absolute destitution to get relief, has been given to a number of people in Tarbrax on the recommendation of the doctor there. A meeting of Carnwath Parish Council has been called for today to consider the whole situation.”  Starvation – it’s a strong word. My father was little over a year old when the mine at Tarbrax shut. His father would have been on that cold December march before briefly finding work at another pit nearby, then giving up and coming to Edinburgh in search of work. He was without a permanent job until the end of the 1930s.

The activity, some of which dates back to 2011, included spreading political messages and attempting to hack other people’s accounts or spread malware, according to Facebook’s head of cyber security policy.Writing on the company’s blog, Nathaniel Gleischer said: “We’ve removed 652 pages, groups and accounts for coordinated inauthentic behaviour that originated in Iran and targeted people across multiple internet services in the Middle East, Latin America, UK and US.”Separate activity from Russia which targeted politics in Syria and Ukraine was also removed, he said.“There’s a lot we don’t know yet,” Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg said on a conference call with reporters on Tuesday afternoon.            “With pages in particular it should be clear to users from which country that is being operated from,” said Mr Collins.“Users should also know whether the person operating the page is deliberately hiding their identity,” he added.Facebook increased transparency around the history of certain pages and political advertising earlier this year after whistleblowers revealed Russian agents and controversial data firm Cambridge Analytica targeted voters during the 2016 US election and the Brexit vote.In July, the Electoral Commission fined official Brexit campaign group Vote Leave and reported senior figures to the police for breaking electoral law with Facebook adverts targeting voters in the build-up to the EU referendum in 2016.“We’ll see more of this activity between now and the US mid-term elections (in November). But Facebook has not really been investing in looking at this activity and the problem is probably much larger than we’ve seen,” said Mr Collins.

And for significant reserved areas, such as aviation and energy, we are at the mercy of the UK Government’s preparations.            “It would be far better for Scotland and the UK if, instead of putting effort into an undesirable ‘no deal’ scenario, the UK Government focused on securing the least worst outcome for all of us.”"},{"url":null,"title":"watch aerial footage new eric gray centre ","story":"The long-awaited Eric Gray Centre is nearing completion – as shown by aerial footage recently published by contractors DITT Construction.\n\nThe project, costing around £6 million, marks the culmination of years of planning with a feasibility study taking place in 2006. Construction began in 2016 and is expected to be completed on schedule in late summer.\nLocated at Seafield the new centre is just a short distance from the long-standing Eric Gray Centre. Once opened the centre will provide specialist assistance for adults with complex care needs and learning disabilities.\nThe building has been designed by Richard Gibson Architects and construction is being led by DITT. The drone footage was shot by Nick McCaffrey.\nThe centre does indeed look good and is on schedule well done DITT , the clients and staff are all looking forward to being in the building. It has taken many years to reach this point  and is much needed.\nI wonder what, if any, proof you have that clients and staff are looking forward to being in the building? If you do have some proof to justify your claim, are they looking forward to being in before or after completion?\nGeorge Dickson\nI have along with other parents of clients that currently use the Eric Gray Centre worked hard, and against many obstacles to finally see the realisation  of a much needed new building where all clients who are at this moment in different buildings due to there being not enough space in the old building and facilities that have run there course in time. It has been a long journey for some and a hard fight to gain the ground and then keep it  for the new building. The building will provide not only better facilities and space but will also give staff the help in coordination and equipment to do there job under one roof with less strain and expense to all.\nI also claim nothing but most people that have lived in Shetland for the last 10 years will be aware of the problems associated with the Eric Gray building, whether directly involved or not although the thinking and planning of a new building goes farther back than that.\nSome parents and staff have had a look through the new building at different stages of build, and everyone to my knowledge was impressed. I like many other parents and carers look forward to the day its complete and our daughters and sons can enjoy the help and encouragement from staff to live their lives to the best of their ability.\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"watch viking bus station to get new graffiti mural ","story":"\n\nMarc Delaye, now based in Inverness, will oversee the graffiti project in August.

Some of the themes could be, \u0026#8216What do you enjoy about Shetland?\u0026#8217, \u0026#8216What makes you proud of Shetland?\u0026#8217, \u0026#8216What is Shetland famous for?\u0026#8217.\u0026#8221\n Send any ideas, before Friday 6th July 2018, to youthservices@shetland.gov.uk or call (01595) 744490 or contact SIC Youth Services through their Facebook page.\nThe SIC\u0026#8217s education and families chairman George Smith said: “This is a really exciting project that will capture the creative talents of young people, who will design and create this substantial piece of graffiti street art.\n\u0026#8220This project will help to channel their energy, and produce something expressive and colourful that helps to transform the area of the Viking Bus Station. It will be a fitting local legacy of the Year of Young People 2018.”\n\n\nAre they going to remove the bus shelter to allow for the mural to be done\nI sincerely hope the art work or whatever, is not some form of contemporary, conceptual, expressionism or modern art rubbish, where splashing paint onto the wall is regarded as art when in reality it is utter rubbish\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.oh, but you can see the movement of the paint, the blending of colours and the meaningless shapes etc etc\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230and then give an equally rubbish title like Lerwick on a stormy night, the meaning of life or some other pointless title.\nOver the years art has very much lowered its standards significantly to make and justify it becoming more commercially viable\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.just as bad, selling a reproduction at almost the same price of the original work as a so-called \u0026#8216 limited edition rubbish \u0026#8216.\nI would think even Graffiti would be more interesting to look at\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230atleast, for the best part, you can still see what was being represented in terms of graphics and text.\nNo doubt the PC Brigade would like it because it gives the opportunity for somebody to express themselves through art and life experience\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230..despite the fact everybody else looks upon it as pointless and meaningless rubbish.\nLove the art, shame about the bus service, waiting for an area and all that. Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildlife centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,  hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me ..\n Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!\nWhy not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like 60/40 ?  It\u0026#8217s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.  Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.  It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.\nThere are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined.\n Next you\u0026#8217ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!\nI think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.\nIf you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, \u0026#8220The Arts\u0026#8221, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.  In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved ?? SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.  Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, \u0026#8220Status Quo\u0026#8221, thanks, Malcomn Younger and \u0026#8220Scottish National Ballet, \u0026#8220Highland Fling \u0026#8220, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!  Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildlife centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £15 million on that. A scientific, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.  Would not even need a bar!!!\nThe Shard in London, an amazingly beatiful structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.  Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass.   Building methods change along with building materials.  I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.\nCome on Haydn I agree there are many beautiful building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.\nThe Shard is a massive glass pyramid\u0026#8230.I\u0026#8217m wholly indifferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.\nMareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.\nIf I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used \u0026#8211 There\u0026#8217s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.\nAll the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.\nCall me old fashioned but I would love to see the modern  building business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of 25 to 80 tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles  ,all done 5000 years ago.It\u0026#8217s true you really can\u0026#8217t get the staff nowadays. I wonder if the Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops \u0026#8211 the British ways of one can\u0026#8217t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is about  to finish off  another burgeoning industry.\nI’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin (tin shed). Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up!   As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.  May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in their  bucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.\nAluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.\nI’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of the  term ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much in  identifying the material nature of that being used but more an attempt  to denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure?  Rather like calling a van a box on wheels? I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaning  comments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.\nIf it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.\n@ Haydn Gear.\nWhen there is nothing of note to differentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.\nPretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.\nUnless you already know Mareel\u0026#8217s purpose and that its supposedly an \u0026#8216iconic\u0026#8217 design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that\u0026#8217s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname \u0026#8216The Pagoda\u0026#8217 as soon as it was built.\nLet us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for \u0026#8220Mareel\u0026#8221 to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst\u0026#8217s \u0026#8220Pickled cow and calf.\u0026#8221, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions (£16?), Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel\u0026#8217s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.\nI have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel.   What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.  Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kick  out of venting there spleens in those directions.  I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primary function to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments?  I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.\nLeaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man?\nThose of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.\nPurely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda was  in any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it?  I wonder if takeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architectural  similarities.\nThe viking was a chippy when it opened.\n\u0026#8220What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.\u0026#8221 Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, \u0026#8221 is their primary function to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments? \u0026#8220, \u0026#8220I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever\u0026#8221 and \u0026#8221 Pig ignorant prats.\u0026#8221 Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!\n\nWell Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.    I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.  There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there? All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , proliferate.  Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.  I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.\nLove hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my life involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of some  by those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and to  maintain ( hoped for ) credibility from the watchful public at large.         In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.  Look what happened!      So let today’s critics mock on if it makes them feel better.\n\nParaphrasing MGM\u0026#8217s famous motto, the phrase \u0026#8220Arse gratia artis\u0026#8221, springs to mind. LOL 🙂\nAs an artist myself (mainly in graphite but also in pastel and acrylic) doing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildlife, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.\nI have been to many art exhibitions and  art shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as \u0026#8216 ripping off the customer \u0026#8216 with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody else can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.\nIt takes me about 20 hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.\nI have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!  Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products difficult to accommodate should pay a visit.   Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spence  is an all   too common feature in most  walks of life —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.    Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns is  not too far removed from the  actions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!\nSo talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.\nNobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as \u0026#8220pig ignorant\u0026#8221. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such \u0026#8220arty things\u0026#8221.  We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £16 million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained/consecrated.\nNo doubt it was deliberate  (John Tulloch) and the  opportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !\nHad you checked out Ian\u0026#8217s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I\u0026#8217d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous \u0026#8220Sam the Eagles\u0026#8221 among us. That said, it\u0026#8217s a concept I wouldn\u0026#8217t wish to see spread any farther!  🙂\n\nNo insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to \u0026#8220The Black Mountains\u0026#8221. I  will try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found in  Mareel\u0026#8217s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing else, nasty little creatures!!! (I use the scientific meaning of parasite here).\nFair  enough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.  I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.  Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artists ( or any other activity) when it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds. Too many around in all walks of life. Nice to have these little chats from a distance and always enjoy reading your submissions.  HG\nIs the winning artist of the Turner Prize, representing what many think of the Turner Prize and this of being a club for elitist artists where their work is highly questionable or just giving art the \u0026#8216 shock value \u0026#8216 when it comes to expressing what art is or should be?\nPersonally, I would do away with this and just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it \u0026#8216 And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230. \u0026#8216. lol\n“ And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.?”.

After all, anything goes these days and you could bask in the glory for the rest of your days.  Plus free drinks at the bar with all the trendies.   LoL\nThank you for the offer Haydn, but my style of art is recognizable and is representable to those people to whome I have done portraits of.\nBased on this, and the feedback from people I have done portraits of as well as people who have seen my work, I can categorically say my artwork is recognized for what it is, this of a portrait. To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say \u0026#8216 there is a strong likeness to themselves \u0026#8216 and they are very pleased with the outcome.\nAlternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.\nI could always get away with this by saying \u0026#8216 It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art \u0026#8216 and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lol\nWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.    I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself and if you look at my products you would find this to be true.   My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generate  sympathetic responses.  It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.  All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted. I hope that I’ve made it clear.\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"rubber duck wins first bergen lerwick leg of shetland race ","story":"Espen Børresen (left) and Morten Offendal celebrate their victory.

On that occasion a top-notch Shetland team came away from Kirkwall with a 3-1 win courtesy of goals by Sammy Johnson, John “Pisco” Leask and Jim Black.\nHunter also played in the legendary 9-7 victory in Orkney 10 years later when, according to Orkney veteran Eric Hutchison, every shot that Bert Sinclair hit seemed to end up in the back of the net.\nSinclair himself has an amazing memory, and has kept records of some of his incredible achievements. His eight goals in one junior inter-county match and 11 in the next three successive senior counties have already been documented, but his scoring spree in the late 1950s and early 60s is something else.\nFrom 1957 to 1964 he played in just over 200 matches, at junior and senior level including representative games, and I can only find two occasions on which he failed to find the net. If anyone anywhere in the country has a record to beat that I’d be delighted to hear from them.\nSinclair also speaks of his greatest disappointment, being dropped from the county side in 1964, apparently for missing training when he had pretty valid reasons for not turning up.\nAnother who experienced the highs and lows was Derrick Bradley, who as manager led Shetland to an unprecedented 12 wins in 13 matches, the only blip being a 0-0 draw in Orkney.\nThen he was unceremoniously ousted, apparently because a few of the players had had enough of him. Bradley retains some bitterness, but it doesn’t stop him wishing the current side all the best for next weekend.\nLen Laurenson and John Johnston recount what it was like to play for both Shetland and Orkney, while James Johnston, Shetland’s equal most-capped player, reflects on 17 caps and how he went out on a high.\nBut the final word should go to two Orkney men, Hutchison and Morgan Harcus, both of whom are still avid fans of the annual event. As well as the fierce rivalry and hotly contested games, they mention the friendships they formed with their opponents.\nThat is probably what makes this contest so special. As Harcus says, they like to hate Shetland for an hour and a half, but the rest of the time it is completely different.\n: : : : : : : :\nDid the best team really win the World Cup? That question has been asked the length and breadth of the country after France’s 4-2 victory over Croatia on Sunday.\nPersonally I thought the Croats were very unlucky. The free kick from which the French opened the scoring should never have been given, while the penalty decision to make it 2-1 was debatable. There may just have been enough hand-to-ball movement for the spot kick to have been awarded, but it took several viewings by the referee through VAR before he was convinced.\n predictor competition, partly as a result of the scoring exploits of Antoine Griezmann, I was disappointed that it wasn’t a Belgium versus Croatia final. A new name on the Jules Rimet Trophy would only have been good for the game overall.\nFrance were ultimately the strongest team in the competition – they improved and became more resilient as the event wore on – but they were definitely not the most attractive. There was something almost German-like about the winners with their dogged organisation and ability to counter-attack with deadly efficiency.\nAs for England, I would say far too much has been made of a “new dawn” under manager Gareth Southgate. The English did get further than most people expected, but they came up well short on two occasions against the Belgians and only stuttered past Tunisia and Colombia. Two of the victories, it should be remembered, were against a shambolic Panama and a Sweden team which appeared to have no interest in winning other than by penalties.\nAfter England’s exit Graeme Le Saux – now there’s a twit if ever there was one – was going on about Southgate’s “emotional intelligence” whatever that is.\nA group of players came together and played as a team, it has been suggested by both Southgate and the media. But is that the first time in the history of football that this has happened to an English team? I don’t think so.\nIt happened at the World Cups of 1966, 1970, 1990 and 1998, and also at the European Championship in 1996. I’m sure the players who took part, for instance Bobby Charlton, Terry Butcher or Paul Gascoigne, would stress the team ethic involved.\nSpeaking of Charlton, the referee for Sunday’s final, Argentinian Nestor Pitana, had the kind of comb-over which the great man himself would have been proud of.\nThere were many who doubted the wisdom of granting the staging of this year’s event to Russia. But all in all it was a very satisfactory tournament. The organisation was good, the stadiums were tremendous, there was plenty of excitement and some great individual performances, and the introduction of VAR provided several talking points.\nMy team of the tournament, with a token Englishman in the mix, is: Thibaut Courtois (Belgium) Benjamin Pavard (France), Raphaël Varane (France), Diego Godín (Uruguay), Ivan Strinic (Croatia) Ivan Perisic (Croatia), Luka Modric (Croatia), Jordan Henderson (England), Eden Hazard (Belgium) Cristiano Ronaldo (Portugal), Edinson Cavani (Uruguay).\nIf anyone questions the omission of Kylian Mbappe, I would say the young French player has been somewhat over-hyped. He certainly has pace in abundance, and a touch of skill, but is also petulant in a way that would suggest he is more of a successor to the diving Neymar than the much more honest Lionel Messi.\n: : : : : : : :\nSeveral metro stations in Paris have apparently been temporarily renamed in honour of France becoming world champions.\nAmong them are Notre-Dame des Champs, which became “Notre Didier Deschamps” and Victor Hugo which was adapted to “Victor Hugo Lloris”.\nEngland quickly cottoned on to the idea as well, with the Southgate tube stop in London being enlarged to “Gareth Southgate”.\nMaybe if Shetland wins the Milne Cup 100th centenary match next weekend the top thoroughfare in Scalloway could be changed to “Kevin Main Street”?\nOr did the county manager not name enough village players in his squad for that to happen?\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 23 ","story":"Over a hundred Shetlanders had a memorable time in Orkney at the weekend, rekindling aquaintances and reminiscing about old battles during the celebrations to mark the 100th anniversary of the Milne Cup.\nSadly this year’s football team were unable to bring the famous trophy back home again, going down to a highly charged and spirited Orkney outfit who took their chances when it mattered.\nMany supporters have been critical of the team selection, in particular the decisions to drop keeper Saul Swanson who kept a clean sheet last year, to leave striker Paul Molloy in reserve and to field James Farmer who did not seem fully fit.\nWhile it is hard to disagree with that, I also felt there was a disjointed look about the side with several players not being fielded in the positions they fulfil for their respective clubs.\nBut despite the result this did not feel like a hammering. The 5-1 scoreline flattered the home side. Shetland could easily have had another two or three goals and it has to be remembered that Orkney only got their last two with the game either entering or having gone into stoppage time.\nMolloy’s introduction 10 minutes into the second half obviously made a difference, as he went on to score the type of goal I doubt if anyone else in the squad is capable of – muscling his way into the box, holding off a couple of defenders, creating space for himself and firing home.\nBut the damage had been done in the first half – at 3-0 down Shetland were always facing an uphill struggle and it was no surprise that Orkney put the icing on the cake with a couple of breakaway goals.\nSome have suggested it was a game too far for captain Leighton Flaws, who reversed his decision to retire after last year’s win in Lerwick. I wouldn’t necessarily go along with that. Flaws, who maintains it was not the carrot of the centenary match that prompted his U-turn, looked as good as anyone in the Shetland side in the second half.\nI felt really sorry for manager Kevin Main, who spoke openly beforehand about both his hopes for the big day and his selection tactics. As someone who was described this week as “the Gareth Southgate of Shetland football”, he deserves the chance to turn this setback around.\nTwo years ago the then management team of Allan Graham and John Scott Christie, whom Main had assisted, were basically forced out of their positions after a 3-2 defeat in Kirkwall.\nThere is no way that should be allowed to happen again. Hopefully Main and his assistant Robert Geddes will now take stock and work hard towards next year, when the match at Gilbertson Park in Lerwick will celebrate Shetland Football Association’s 100th birthday.\nIt’s just a pity we have to wait a whole 12 months until a chance of revenge.\n: : : : : : : :\nA couple of hours earlier another team in blue slumped to defeat, but with Orkney’s recent record on the hockey pitch that was less unexpected.\nThere are continuing signs of improvement among the hockey players, however, in spite of an ever-increasing list of failures at inter-county level.\nA score of 4-1 was probably about right, as Orkney were much more clinical and displayed a quality of crisp passing and control which was a shade above their opponents.\nThe Shetland players work incredibly hard and show much commitment, however, especially with the added handicap of having to travel to Brae for any kind of action.\nA few caught the eye on Saturday, among them goalkeeper Megan Nicholson who pulled off at least one fine save, Cara Leask who notched the opening goal and Kristan Robertson who got the nod as Shetland’s player of the match.\nI would also mention Victoria Duthie who was in the thick of the action throughout, making several excellent runs and showing much determination both in possession and when chasing an opponent. The fact that Duthie was still limping quite heavily a few hours later was testament to how much she gave for the cause.\n: : : : : : : :\nOrkney football historian Jockie Wood addresses the Milne Cup 100th anniversary reception at the PIckaquoy Centre in Orkney last Saturday. Former Aberdeen striker Joe Harper, the evening\u0026#8217s guest of honour, is in the centre of the picture. Photo: John Coutts\nThe reception at the Pickaquoy Centre later on Saturday evening, attended by over 400 guests, was a great opportunity for former county football adversaries to meet up again.\nUnfortunately the meal was nothing to write home about – the main course of roast beef and trimmings was cold – and the acoustics of the building were downright awful.\nThe speeches which followed, if anyone could hear what was being said, were on the lengthy side. And I have no idea at all what guest speaker Joe Harper, the former Aberdeen and Scotland striker, was on about. All you could hear was the occasional “effing” this and “effing” that.\nIt was fitting, however, when Jockie Wood called on a couple of former Shetland players to take a bow. Both Geordie Hunter, or the “big game Hunter” as Wood referred to him, and the inimitable striker Bert Sinclair certainly did their bit in years gone by.\nSinclair in particular was in his element, reminiscing with Orkney opponents Alan Findlay and Eric Hutchison who also featured in the famous 1963 game when he hit the back of the net five times in the 9-7 victory.\n: : : : : : : :\nAnd finally, as this week’s column is all about the inter-county weekend, it is surely fitting to end on a high note.\nOn Sunday morning, although the match really should have taken place as a warm-up to the main Milne Cup encounter, over two dozen veterans took to the field again.\nHelped by the fact that one or two of the team are still turning out occasionally at B-team level, the blues were much fitter and faster than their opponents.\nRobert Adamson, who fills out his shirt rather better than he did 20-odd years ago, was on the scoresheet along with his former Thistle team mate Stuart Smith who netted a hat trick.\nThe others came from Delting’s Stuart Hay and the aforementioned Main, who surely merited it after Saturday’s setback, and a penalty from the oldest man in the side Bruce Williamson of Spurs.\nThe final score was a 7-1 win for Shetland, which as some wise guy put it made for an aggregate 8-6 football victory. But unfortunately not many will see it that way.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"emergency services to share hq ","story":"Ambulance and fire crews are set to move into new joint headquarters in Lerwick in the coming weeks.\nBosses from both services gave an update at a meeting of the community safety resilience board on Wednesday.\nIt will mean the ambulance service moving from the NHS-owned property at Burgh Road to the fire station at Sea Road.\nThe shift is to allow closer working between the services, to be more cost-effective, and allow the ambulance service to shift from its location which has been criticised because of access issues.\nChanges have been made to the Sea Road building layout internally and both teams are to be moved in at the site by the end October or early November.\nAt the meeting the fire service again explained its desire for a change in firefighters’ duties in future, which would see them responding to medical emergencies.\nScottish Fire and Rescue Service assistant chief officer David McGowan talked about “a transformation” of the fire service and asking firefighters to take on different roles.\nThat included things like dealing with cardiac arrests, “wider calls for medical assistance” as well as a prevention role too, speaking to people in the community.\nIn September two new state-of-the-art fire engines are to come into force in Bixter and Bressay.\nCrews at the stations are taking part in training to use the rapid response vehicles.\nCosting about £190,000 each, Shetland, along with Orkney and the Western Isles is among the first areas in the country to take delivery of the vehicles.\nThey include high-pressure lances branded “Coldcut”, which allow crews to inject a fire suppressant through the wall of a burning building to tackle flames, without having to enter.\nThe vehicles can carry a maximum of four firefighters but the service is hoping to operate them with three.\nA defibrillator will also to be installed in both units.\nNorthern and Western Isles area manager Iain Macleod also gave an update on retained fire crews in the isles.\nFetlar had seen an increase in applications with seven people coming forward.

So they certainly had plenty of practice.\nThe final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.\nDelting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.\nDevonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.\nThis is the 14th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back 36 years for Southend’s solitary success.\nApologies to older readers if I’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in 1982, but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.\nThe quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw 2-2 with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay 4-1 away from home.\nThe semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another 3-3 draw and another replay was necessary.\nAfter Delting won that one 3-2 at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.\nDelting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.\nAlthough it was tough ask to play two games in about 18 hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.\nSo on Saturday 7th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.\nGoals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a 2-0 lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.\nPlayer/manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.\nIt was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.\nBut it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.\n: : : : : : : :\nIn professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.\nThe benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the 20 clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.\nDuring the 2017-18 campaign the clubs benefited from over £2.4 billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £150 million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £94 million.\nJust where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.\nWhile players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.\nOn the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.\nIn Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.\nFollowing Rangers’ 1-1 draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.\nIt could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.\nThat was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.\nPerhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes finds if difficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.\nRogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.\nThere are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.\n: : : : : : : :\nOne of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.\nAlthough the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and 159 runs.\nMuch has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.\nUnfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.\nI’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.\nMaybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.\nThe only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped diffuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.\nSome apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.\nIn answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame.

In other areas customers have been left facing road and ferry journeys of more than 50 miles to get to a bank.\nIn 1989, there were more than 17,800 bank branches estimated to be operating in the UK. By the end of this year that number is expected to fall to fewer than 8000.\nSome projections have suggested it could drop to as low as 600 branches in five years\u0027 time.\nBetween 2015 and 2018, 48 bank closures have taken place or are under way in the HIE area including 22 in the Highlands. Some of these are the last banks in their communities.\nConsultants Indigo House Group said banking facilities need to be understood as core to community infrastructure.\nIt said access to cash remained fundamental to the viability of the small retail businesses that are prominent in rural areas. This is especially true in relation to tourism businesses where the loss of access to cash via local banks could have a detrimental effect on long term prospects.\nAlthough there are potential alternatives, including online or Post Office banking and mobile bank vans, the report warned that these options raised concerns over such issues as cybersecurity, the fragile nature of Post Office contracts and accessibility of mobile banks for less able people. Customers facing a shift from a local branch to a mobile bank also consider this a backward step.\nIn its recommendations, the report calls for a collaborative approach involving Scottish Government, HIE, local councils, community members and delivery partners, including the banks and Post Office.\nIt also wants recognition of the importance of cash to local economies and support over time for a sustainable transition to digitally based economies. This includes the creation of digital inclusion strategies to help businesses benefit fully from online banking.\nThe report also recommended a Post Office banking strategy that would include securing the long-term sustainability of contract Post Offices to support rural economies and infrastructure.\n\nThursday 23 Aug 2018 1:39 PM\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.strathspey-herald.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117085.jpg","title":"Dalwhinnie makeover starts to take shape","story":"Tom Ramage\n\u0026nbsp\nDALWHINNIE is on the verge of a major makeover at its southern entrance.\nFor too long dogged by a disused, overgrown compound and a rusting old water treatment works, villagers are now beginning to hope that things could change dramatically over the next few months.\nAll being well, they heard on Tuesday, a \u0026pound2.3 million upgrade by Scottish Water could get under way in the new year which would leave the village with a new treatment works by this time next year.\n\"There\u0027s a long way to go,\" said the north\u0027s corporate affairs manager Gavin Steel when the Strathy met with an SW team in the village hall, \"but we\u0027re hopeful that all the many stages will be gone through on schedule.\n\"We are having to consult with a lot of different individuals and organisations \u0026ndash not least the national park authority, the Highland Council, the Scottish Environment Protection Agency and landowners \u0026ndash but this is work which will have to be done on behalf of the community.\n\"Quite simply the current system has reached its sell-by date.

The tourism industry’s treatment of seasonal workers has also come under the spotlight in reports which island firms say has painted an unfair picture of local business.\nThe letter, which was co-ordinated by local MSP Kate Forbes and tourism promotional body SkyeConnect, said: “Nearly everybody on the islands is linked in some way to tourism, and the economic opportunities of the tourism industry support the rural and remote communities of Skye, Raasay and beyond.\n“The tourist industry can be a relatively unpredictable industry and so it concerns us to see sensationalist stories in the national press, for a second year running, which could jeopardise the jobs, businesses and income of local people.\n“We would hate to see an industry which has taken many years to develop undermined by a few stories which don’t fairly depict the efforts of hardworking people across the area.”\nThe letter also backs recent investment in infrastructure at some of Skye’s most popular sites.\nIt adds: “The Isle of Skye and Raasay, like many areas of the Highlands and Islands, is home to communities whose future is dependent on good jobs, steady incomes and business opportunities. Tourism makes a critical contribution to the local economy, and indeed the wider Scottish economy, and indirectly enables people to live, work and raise a family on the island.\n“As such, we write to categorically assert that Skye and Raasay is well and truly open for business.”\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Run-Rig-1977-ADJUST-e1534430676612.jpg","title":"highland exodus to stirling as runrig get set for final","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\n\nAfter 45 years, Runrig will bring the curtain down on a remarkable musical career this weekend when they play their last ever shows.\nAn exodus of west Highland and islanders will be among the throng at Stirling’s City Park in the shadow of the town’s famous castle this Friday and Saturday.\nThey will be there to enjoy and celebrate one final time with a band which owes its roots to Skye and North Uist, and became an international flag bearer for Gaeldom’s language and tradition.\nSpeaking to the Free Press ahead of the ‘Last Dance’ shows, guitarist Malcolm Jones said he held conflicting feelings but there was excitement none the less at a final performance which will chart over four decades of music.\nHe added: “I would say we’re all approaching these final concerts with mixed emotions. There is certainly great excitement surrounding them and anticipation is high amongst both band and audience.\n“The Stirling concerts will be celebrations of our long musical journey, albeit tinged with the realisation that these are farewell appearances and so naturally emotions will be high – this is something we experienced recently at the farewell concerts in England and Europe – all spectacular events but nevertheless very moving.\n“We’ve been overwhelmed by the response to the announcement of the Stirling concerts – all the positive comments, the stories about what our music has meant to so many people, the sadness as the end approaches. But overall there will be a huge amount of love and positivity at Stirling and that’s what will carry everyone through these days ahead.\u0026#8221\nJones has been with Runrig all his adult life, having first joined the band on stage as a 17-year old at a dance in Portree’s Skye Gathering Hall in late 1977. He hopes the set list – which will be lengthy – will give a full reflection of the groups’s journey from a three -piece Scottish dance band playing island village halls to one which has sold out major venues across Scotland and Europe.\nHe said: “Compiling a set list is always a dilemma, with such a large back catalogue to choose from. Of course, there are certain songs that have to be included, otherwise we’d be lynched – but it’s also nice to pick some lesser-performed songs, possibly giving them a fresh twist.\n“Our set will be a good bit longer than usual – the problem was trying to keep the length down to sensible proportions – in essence, it will hopefully represent the band’s whole career, a celebration of our music and the unique bond with our audience.”\n century – the history of their native communities has shaped Runrig’s lyrics and songs. Jones believes that staying true to their roots – fusing them with the popular rock and pop influences they listened to in their teenage bedrooms \u0026#8211 has made sure the band’s popularity has endured through the generations.\n“We’ve been fortunate that throughout our long career we’ve continually gained new fans of all ages, at home and abroad, which has sustained us, even as fashions come and go around us,” he adds. “I guess there must be something in the lyrics, the melodies and the ethos of the band that has attracted such loyalty amongst fans, something universal that transcends our shared background in the heartland of the Highlands and connects with the wider world.”\nAuthenticity has been the hallmark of a band which can essentially still trace its origins to the three Portree streets of Fraser Crescent, Kitson Crescent, and Balmoral Road.\nThe original Run-rig dance band was founded by the Skye-raised sons of North Uist Calum and Rory MacDonald, along with Blair Douglas in 1973, and a year later the trio were joined by Donnie Munro, who became the band’s singer for more than two decades. Munro, who left in 1997 and was replaced by Canadian singer Bruce Guthro, will be on stage as a special guest this weekend.\n\nJones’ hopes for a legacy of music that people can continue to enjoy, and be inspired by, seem assured.\nHe adds: “Even though the band’s touring and performing life will have finished, I hope that people will continue to enjoy and discover our music for many years to come, perhaps giving inspiration to musicians that will follow on from us, in the knowledge that if you stick to your own path, be true to your musical roots and retain an open mind, great things may happen.”\nAs for the future – the band say it might be the end for Runrig, but it won’t mean retirement or the end of their music-making careers.\nSaid Jones: “The first thing to say is that there will be a long wind-down period – for instance we’ll film and record Stirling, so that will have to be worked on and brought to some sort of completion, plus there is the whole ongoing administration of the band archive and legacy which may lead to some interesting sideline projects.\n“Beyond that, we’ll all still be involved with our own individual performing, writing and music-making projects – that’s something you never retire from.\n“Personally, I’ll miss the band dreadfully but on the positive side I’ll spend more time on Skye plus I’ll have time to learn some new accordion tunes!”\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27433  ","story":" Declan Kearney\nSinn Féin National Chairperson\nWe all need to be able to draw inspiration from history, past sacrifice, leadership and determination.\nLifelonganti-apartheid campaigner and veteran of the national liberation struggle inSouth Africa, Ronnie Kasrils was in Belfast and Derry recently to launch hisnew book ‘A Simple Man’.\nMartinMcAuley asked me to interview Ronnie for a Sinn Féinvideo.\nMy lastquestion was to ask what continues to inspire him and his vision for thefuture.\nHeexplained how much today’s youth inspire him, and in particular young AhedTamimi from the occupied territories in Palestine.\nLastSunday Ahed was released from prison.\n\nI mether daddy in Ramallah three months ago.

Arising out of the local experience of sectarian discrimination, the march helped to set in train a series of events that would change Irish politics forever.\nNationalists in the Six Counties had begun to explore new ways of highlighting the reality of discrimination. They had looked to Governments in Dublin for decades but found little help there. The IRA’s Resistance Campaign had ended in 1962, having failed heroically against the overwhelming military superiority of the British Army and RUC. However, the imposition of internment without trial, the banning of Sinn Féin and the use of the B Specials as a rural terror force, all exposed the violence that lay beneath the surface of the Orange state. \n which read: ‘Protestant girl required for housework. Apply to the Hon. Mrs. Terence O’Neill...’\n\nFive years after O’Neill’s accession nothing had changed. Unemployment and emigration among Catholics was far higher than among their Protestant neighbours. In County Tyrone, with a population of just over 73,000 Catholics to 60,500 Protestants, there were only 52 Catholics employed in local government as against 300 Protestants. Such discrimination was highlighted by the Campaign for Social Justice established by Patricia and Conn McCluskey in Dungannon in 1964. \nParallel with these developments, the IRA and Sinn Féin were rethinking their strategy with more emphasis to be placed on open campaigning against injustice in the North. The Wolfe Tone Society was established as a forum for debate and to circumvent the Stormont ban on the Republican Clubs, the name which, in turn, had been adopted to evade the ban on Sinn Féin. Members of the Wolfe Tone Society, the Campaign for Social Justice and others were involved in the formation of the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association (NICRA) in February 1967.\nIt was direct action on the ground that propelled the nascent Civil Rights Movement onto the streets. The Brantry Republican Club in County Tyrone had campaigned for council housing to be built but when 15 houses were built in Caledon only one of them was allocated to a Catholic. The house next door was allocated to a single Protestant woman, the secretary of a unionist politician. \nLocal people decided to protest. The main organiser was Annie Mary (better known as ‘Nana’) Gildernew, grandmother of Sinn Féin\u0027s Michelle Gildernew. Over a period of several months in 1967/68 a local family and supporters occupied a house in the Caledon estate. When they were evicted the case was raised in Stormont and began to make headlines beyond Tyrone. This was the spur for the march from Coalisland to Dungannon which received the endorsement of NICRA. \n\n\nIn a pattern that was to become all too familiar in the months ahead, Ian Paisley organised a counter-demonstration for Market Square in Dungannon. This was then used as a pretext by the RUC to ban the NICRA parade from the Square. \nAbout 2,500 took part in the NICRA march from Coalisland to Dungannon. The march was stopped short of Market Square by an RUC cordon. The main speaker was Austin Currie MP, later a Fine Gael TD. Also speaking was Gerry Fitt, West Belfast MP. Fitt who, years later, was lifted into the House of Lords by Margaret Thatcher, declared that they would go on until they had “Civil Rights and a 32-County Republic”.\nBut the real leaders of the Civil Rights Movement which began that day were the rank and file, the ordinary people of Tyrone and beyond who marched for justice and freedom. \nThe first Civil Rights march from Coalisland to Dungannon was held on 24 August 1968, 50 years ago this week.\n\n\ntest\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27459  ","story":"Sinn Féin spokesperson for Business, Innovation and Enterprise Maurice Quinlivan TD\n Callum Smyth\n\n“The government is currently missing its own targets when it comes to reforming the apprenticeship system.

The onset of the Tory Brexit, backed by the DUP, also represents an attack on the rights of people in the north. \nThe main speaker at the end of the commemoration at the Square in Dungannon will be former Sinn Féin MLA Mitchel McLaughlin. \nSpeaking ahead of Saturday\u0027s march, the former Northern Assembly Speaker called for a huge turnout. \"Let\u0027s exceed those who turned out on the very first civil rights march in August 1968 and let\u0027s ensure that a very clear and committed demand is presented to the governments - the Irish government as much as the British government - to address those issues of a rights based society that are enshrined in the Good Friday Agreement,\" he said. \nThe parade will begin in Coalisland at 3pm on Saturday and make its way to Dungannon. \n\n\ntest\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27461  ","story":" Michael McMonagle\n\n“The denial of rights, equality and respect is as wrong today as it was fifty years ago. - Mitchel McLaughlin\nHundreds of people took part in a commemoration in Tyrone yesterday to mark the 50th anniversary of the first civil rights march to be held in the north. \nThe march retraced the steps of the original march from Coalisland to Dungannon and was attended by Sinn Féin representatives from across the north. \nIt was led by Mid Ulster Sinn Féin MP Francie Molloy, who took part in the original march 50 years ago as a steward. \nMarchers carried replicas of the posters carried by the original march, reading \u0027One man, one vote,\u0027 \u0027Equal housing now\u0027 as well as banners referring to the Caledon housing protest which was the motivation for the march. \nContemporary posters on the threat posed to Brexit to rights were also carried by marchers. \n\nIn 1968 the original march was stopped before it reached the Square in Dungannon by the RUC because loyalist protestors staged a counter demonstration. \nThis time, however, the march reached its destination where speeches were made by Francie Molloy, local MLA Colm Gildernew and Fermanagh/South Tyrone MP Michelle Gildernew. \nThe main speaker of the march was veteran republican and civil rights activist Mictchel McLaughlin. \nIn his speech, the former Assembly Speaker said tat much has changed in the last five decades and that we are on the verge of a major shift towards Irish unity. \n\"The Orange state is now gone and we now have a peaceful and democratic way forward. \n“This is a very different place than it was in 1968 and I am convinced that we are now on the verge of another seismic shift towards a new, agreed and united Ireland that will provide a prosperous and shared future for all our citizens,\" he said. \n\nBut Mr McLaughlin also warned that our rights are still under threat today from Brexit and the right wing alliance between the Tories and the DUP. \n“My deep concern is that there are still people who want to deny rights and equality to their fellow citizens today. \n\"People in the north still face attacks on their electoral and civil rights, alongside the continued denial of rights to LGBTQ couples, women, Irish language speakers, and bereaved families seeking a coroner’s inquest.\n“Today, we are experiencing an unacceptable blockade on rights, imposed by the DUP and facilitated by the British government.\n“Rights are also under threat by a right-wing Tory Brexit and there are unwelcome echoes of gerrymandering and the hollowing out of democracy by the recent Boundary Commission proposals.\n“The denial of rights, equality and respect is as wrong today as it was fifty years ago,\" he added. \n\n\ntest\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/200/2018/AP-New-top-side-logo.jpg","title":"27462  ","story":"Sinn Féin Vice President Michelle O\u0026#039Neill.\n Michael McMonagle\n\n“We must specifically acknowledge the damage done by the Catholic Church to the lives of many women and children in the mother and baby homes, the Magdalene Laundries and a succession of abuse scandals and cover ups.- Michelle O\u0026#039Neill\nThe visit to Ireland by Pope Francis this weekend is an opportunity for the Catholic church to address the ongoing legacy of abuse, Sinn Féin Vice President Michelle O\u0027Neill has said. \nMichelle O\u0027Neill made the comments ahead of the historic visit to Ireland of Pope Francis this weekend to attend the World Meeting of Families which is being held in Dublin.

The high level exam results are, in part, the outcome of a longer term development process strategy, where individual pupil profiles are used to provide for a tailored curriculum and a sound work ethic.\n  \nPrincipal, Mrs Lutton, offered congratulations to all the pupils. \n  \nShe attributed their success not only to their own hard work but also to the support of their parents.\n  \n She also expressed thanks to the teaching and non-teaching staff for their ongoing professional commitment and loyalty to the young people of Cambridge House Grammar School.\n \n                  \n    \n          \n"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_935996.jpg--.jpg?1534838149000\n","title":"another year of excellence at st louis","story":"  \nST LOUIS Grammar is celebrating outstanding A Level results.\n \n\n  \nAt present, almost 96% of the 170 Upper Sixth students attained three A* to C grades.

The top two achievers were David Byrne and Eimear Smyth each with a phenomenal 4A* grades each in Biology, Chemistry, English, Maths and Physics. These superb results have enabled both students to earn places on prestigious courses. David will study Molecular Engineering at Imperial College, London and Eimear will begin Veterinary Science in UCD.\n  \nMany students have secured first choice university places across the United Kingdom, this includes: Lancaster, Strathclyde, Liverpool, Stirling and Hull to name but a few. The excellent qualifications achieved by students have allowed them to embark on exciting and varied undergraduate courses such as Film Studies, Teaching and Computer Science. A number of students will be starting higher national degree apprenticeships, a pathway which has become increasingly popular in recent years.\n  \nPrincipal, Mr Rafferty, commented, “I am delighted by the way this year’s cohort have risen to the challenges of new A Level specifications. It is a credit to our students and teachers that over 51% of A Levels were awarded A*- A grades and over 82% were awarded A* - B grades. With such a large cohort of students studying such a wide range of A Level subjects, these results are simply superb.\n  \n“This year’s results reflect all that our school mantra, ‘Excellence, Empowerment and Endeavour’ stands for. Our school continues to send students on to high demand courses such as Dentistry, Medicine, Law and Veterinary as well as highly sought after positions in the business sector with PwC and Deloitte. \n  \nIt is testament to their families and staff that the Class of 2018 will now go on to make significant contributions to society.

We can\u0027t forget their big sister Kaia who has kept us all smiling.\nThe family\u0027s agony began on June 8 last year when Caden, a pupil at St Brigid\u0027s Primary School, was diagnosed with aplastic anemia, a rare blood disease where bone marrow fails to produce sufficient blood cells.\nSabrina, who has taken time off from her job at Limavady Grammar School to care for Caden, recalled: Bruises started appearing all over his body and Caden was tired, so we knew something wasn\u0027t right.\n    \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n    \n          \n\n full newspaper \u0026#187\n\n    \n\nSend this page to a friend \u0026#187\n\n  \n// \n\n\n      \nSend to a friend\n  \nPlease complete the following form to inform a friend about this page.\n  \n    \n    \n      \n        \nYour Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n      \n        \nYour E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n                      \n        \nComment\n        \n\n      \n                    \n                  \n      \nIn order to process your information we must ask you to enter the letters in the image into the box:\n      \n        \n          \n            \n            \n\nplay audio version\n\n            \n\nReload Image\n\n          \n          \nVerify Code:\n          \n        \n      \n    \n                   \n          \n\n*\n Mandatory field - please complete\n          \n              \n      \n    \n  \n\n    \n  \n     \n        \n      \n        \nNews Search\n        \n          \n          \n        \n        \nsearch news, sport and features across all publications\n      \n    \n                      \n      // \n      \n                                                                                                                                        \n                      \n      \n        \n\nNorthern Constitution\n\n        \n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n          \n\nMagherafelt\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\n\n\n        \n          \n\nAntrim\n\n          \n\nBallymena\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\nThe Chronicle\n\n        \n          \n\nBallycastle\n\n          \n\nBallymoney\n\n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n                  \n      // \n      \n      \n        \n          \nSubscriber Login\n          \n            \n              \nUsername:\n              \n            \n            \n              \nPassword:\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n          \n        \n      \n            \n              \n\n\n                          \n\n\n            \n\n\n                      \n\n\n          \n  \n    \n    \n\u0026copy Copyright 2018 Alpha Newspaper Group\n    \n\n        // \n        \n\n    \n      \n        \n\nTerms \u0026amp Conditions\n\n        \n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n              \n    \n  \n      \n    var gaJsHost = ((\"https:\" == document.location.protocol) ?

The Skoda man felt the format incurred unnecessary expense in terms of fuel costs.\n\u0026#8220The fuel isn\u0027t cheap and the cars run on it whether you are driving a stage or the road sections, said Bogie. A remote service after Friday\u0027s first two stages would work for everyone.

And it’s an ideal venue to host birthday parties and school or group outings.”\n\nAir-tastic currently has two trampoline parks, located in Bangor and Cork, with a number of other Air-tastic trampoline parks planned to open in Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland in due course. \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nFor further information on Air-tastic and the Craigavon trampoline park opening visit www.air-tastic or search Air-tastic Craigavon on Facebook.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n            \n    \n"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8602227.1534344744!/image/image.jpg","title":"can you help a history project","story":"\nDid you ever work in the old Mayfair manufacturing company in Portadown? If so, then Mayfair Business Centre would like to hear from you.  \n\n                \nThe present day Mayfair Business Centre is inviting former workers who were employed at the sewing factory to discuss their memories and experiences of working there. This unique history project is being supported by Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council as part of the PEACE IV Shared Spaces and Services programme.\n\nUrsula Kearns from Mayfair Business Centre said: “We are really keen to speak to any women and men who worked in the factory during the 1960s and 1970s, including those who were made redundant when the factory closed. We want to hear and collect their experiences and memories and we want those stories to be recorded and shared. The intention would be for the former workers to meet together on a regular basis over coming months. It will be informal and will be a chance for old friends and acquaintances to meet up. We intend that the project will be led by those taking part, so we expect that it will touch upon other work-places as well as people’s social lives. It’s also intended that the project will result in a permanent exhibition within Mayfair.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nInterested?

authority offers assurance about future of school crossing patrols","story":"\nThe Education Authority (EA) has given an assurance that school crossing patrols will be in operation when children across Northern Ireland return to school in the coming days.\n\n                \nA spokesperson for the EA offered the assurance in response to media coverage revealing that the authority had considered removing “lollipop men and women” in a bid to save money.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nA letter obtained by BBC News NI revealed that the EA faces an estimated funding gap of £58 million in 2018/19.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nIt highlights a number of “difficult choices” the authority is faced with in order to cut costs, including the possible removal of school crossing patrols, withdrawing uniform allowances and making compulsory redundancies in schools.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nAccording to the BBC, EA board members regarded the possibility of scrapping school crossing patrols – and other potentially controversial savings measures – as “unpalatable” and decided that any decision to make such cuts should be down to the Department of Education.\n\nThe letter also suggests that “traffic control measures” are not the EA’s responsibility, but that of the Department for Infrastructure and the

for school crossing patrols in the current financial year.”\n\nManned crossings are seen as a vital for the safety of children crossing busy roads, and the DUP’s education spokesman said any move to remove lollipop men and women would be “unacceptable.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n“While undoubtedly the Education Authority and the department have to explore every option to live within budget, this idea cannot be regarded as a serious suggestion and it is clear that the members of the Education Authority would reject any attempt to propose it,” said Peter Weir MLA.\n\n“The safety of our children must be paramount, and there is no need to remove the current process for assessing individual placements of lollipop people provision.”\n\nThe Strangford MLA continued: “This bizarre suggestion does however highlight two key issues. Firstly, the extent to which education is effectively subsidising other elements of government particularly on road safety and transport and there needs to be a debate about where financial responsibility is borne. \n\n“Secondly, it further shines a light on the heavy pressures facing education in Northern Ireland, and the need for strategic changes and reform which need commitment on an Executive-wide basis, which again highlights the damage being done by a single party putting their narrow interests ahead of proper decision making and the restoration of government.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n            \n    \n"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8602298.1534346604!/image/image.jpg","title":"fifty years on from first civil rights march","story":"\nOn August 24, 1968, Northern Ireland\u0026#8217s first civil rights march took place between Coalisland and Dungannon. \n\n                \nOn the march were teachers, students and politicians who all wanted the same thing, equality and civil rights.

This is the first time the event has been staged in Ireland.\nPope Francis will arrive in Dublin on Saturday, almost 40 years since Pope John Paul II came and addressed the faithful at capacity Masses in Drogheda, Knock and Phoenix Park. Pope Francis’ first engagement will be meeting President Michael D Higgins before visiting St Mary’s Pro-Cathedral and then the Capuchin Day Centre, which provides hot meals, clothing and showers for the city’s homeless. Pope Francis will then preside at the Festival of Families in Croke Park.\nHis visit will conclude on Sunday with a closing Mass at Phoenix Park. An estimated 500,000 people are expected to attend with thousands more watching the live footage from around the world.\nRector of Clonard Monastery Fr Noel Kehoe said that the parish is running a bus to the weekend events in Dublin “on Friday” and that he will be staying “to attend both the festival of Families and attend the Papal Mass”.\nParish Manager at St Oliver Plunkett Parish Glen Phillips told the Andersonstown News that Pope Francis’ visit had created “such a buzz within the parish”.\n“We have a coach leaving tomorrow (Thursday) so that parishioners can attend the WMOF Congress in the RDS.\n“A number of families from the parish will also be attending the Festival of Families in Croke Park on Saturday and we are also running a coach to the Papal Mass in Phoenix Park on Sunday.\n “There is such a buzz around the parish as the Papal visit approaches. Many older parishioners remember Pope John Paul II’s visit and many young parishioners were brought up on stories about it. Pope Francis is re-invigorating the Church and many parishioners want to be part of that and show support for him,” he said.\nSt John’s Church was proudly displaying its bunting and Papal flags as parishioners filed out from Mass on Wednesday morning. Parish Manager Conor Neeson explained how some of the decorations had stood the test of time and dated back to John Paul II’s visit.\n“We will have a number of buses on from Friday morning taking parishioners down to Dublin for the Pope’s visit. As part of the Falls Road Pastoral Community, parishioners from Corpus Christi, St John’s, St Mary’s, St Paul’s and St Peter’s Cathedral will all be travelling this weekend. There is a great sense of occasion and I’ll be staying behind to organise the parish hall for the Mass on Sunday as we will be screening it live,” he said.\nChair of the Pastoral Council Annette Hinchcliffe said she will be attending the Mass along with her teenage children and had also been part of history when she travelled down on the train to see John Paul II say Mass in 1979.\n“Many of our elderly population in the parish would have loved to have attended the Mass on Sunday but a lot of the instructions about once people get off their buses is the walk to Phoenix Park which is a possible three miles. We thought it would be nice to bring everyone together to give them a flavour of the day so that they wouldn’t just be watching it in the house. Our parishioners will have an opportunity to come to the parish centre to watch the Mass and be with the other people in their parish,” she said.\nParishioner Frances McEvoy told us: “I’m going down today (Wednesday) for the different discussions and events that are taking place over the next couple of days each day ending with a Mass and I’m looking forward to enjoying the weekend celebrations as well.\n“I was in Phoenix Park whenever John Paul II came and I think this Pope has the same charisma. I think he will be very welcomed despite all that is going on at the minute.\n“It’s very exciting. I was in Rome before Christmas staying with friends and I was at one of his meetings, when he meets the people on a Wednesday. The atmosphere when he walks in is just incredible. There is definitely  something about him. I think despite in terms of some of the negative publicly there has been around the visit he will speak to the people and he speaks from his heart,” she said.\nAt an extremely busy The Holy Shop in city centre’s Chapel Lane sales assistants Maura McShane and Teresa Nolan told us how there had been “great interest” in their Pope Francis memorabilia ahead of the highly anticipated visit.\n“We have rosary beads, candles, framed photos of Pope Francis and prayer cards all to mark his visit for the World Meeting of Families,” explained Teresa. “He is a very popular Pope and the amount of our customers going this weekend to see him is unreal,” she said.\nMaura said that many people were calling in since staff created their window display and there was a real “excitement” with people ahead of the weekend.\n"},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37244033.ece/ecc87/AUTOCROP/w620h342/ambulance_service.jpg","title":"11 minute wait for ambulance after 999 call","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

Ireland businesses have been told to start making preparations for a no-deal Brexit by contacting the Irish Government to discuss potential arrangements if the UK and the EU fails to broker a deal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({})\n\n\nFirms that export and import from the EU may also have to apply for licences to continue to do so.\n\nThe advice forms part of the nine-page ‘Trading with the EU if there’s no Brexit deal’ technical notice - one of a raft of documents published by the Brexit department advising businesses and the public on what they need to do to prepare for a no-deal scenario.\n\n\n \nNo-deal Brexit could cost consumers millions and hit pensions, papers reveal\n \n\n\nAnnouncing the publication of the documents the Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab again reasserted the government\u0027s commitments to Northern Ireland and how they were committed to ensuring there was no hard border at the Irish border.\n\nHe said it was important people and organisations had \"clear and practical advice and re-assurance\" in the event of a no deal.\n\n\"We are trying to make sure people have the information they need, the lead time they need and some guidance about the practical way through some of the difficulties in the unlikely eventually of a no deal.\"\n\nFor those Northern Ireland businesses that trade with the Republic they are advised to contact the Irish government about preparations they may need to make as ministers there have “indicated they would need to discuss arrangements in the event of a no-deal with the European Commission”.\n\nThe document states: “Businesses should now consider the impacts on them in a no-deal scenario, which would mean a requirement to apply the same customs and excise rules to goods traded with the EU that apply for goods traded outside of the EU, including the requirement to submit customs declarations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Northern Ireland businesses that trade over land with the Republic have been told to contact the Irish government about preparations they may need to make (Brian Lawless/PA)\n\n\n\n\n“Businesses should consider whether it is appropriate for them to acquire software and or engage a customs broker, freight forwarder or logistics provider to support them with these new requirements.”\n\nThe notice adds: “Engaging a customs broker or acquiring the appropriate software and authorisations from HMRC will come at a cost.”\n\nOn trade in Northern Ireland the technical paper states that the Government stands ready to “engage constructively” to act in the best interests of the people of Northern Ireland in the event of a no-deal.\n\nHowever, the department urged businesses in Northern Ireland to contact the Irish government for advice, stating: “The Irish government have indicated they would need to discuss arrangements in the event of a no deal with the European Commission and EU member states.\n\n“We would recommend that, if you trade across the land border you should consider whether you will need advice from the Irish government about preparations you need to make.”\n\nThe document concludes by stating that the Government “will provide further information on action to take to prepare for this scenario over the coming months”.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"gcse results northern ireland girls continue to outperform

Northern Ireland’s students have once again demonstrated good outcomes across all grades, reflecting the hard work that takes place in our schools and colleges.\n\n\"Students here continue to achieve higher outcomes in comparison to their counterparts in England and Wales.\n\n\"There are some patterns worth further analysis, such as the continued widening of the performance gap at A*-C grades between males and females.\n\n\"Subject choices remain stable with over 40% of students here now studying a STEM qualification.

Zeplin, Blaise, Maverick, Ace and Jupiter on the other hand, were some of the less common names given to baby boys in 2017.\n\nIn terms of girls’ names, Grace has once again taken second place in the top 10, whilst Olivia comes a close third. Roise climbed the greatest number of places to join the top 100 names for girls, moving from rank 151 in 2016 to rank 90 in 2017. Isla and Charlotte both joined the girl’s top 10 for the first time in 2017.\n\nCompared with boys, a greater number of girls’ names have held the top spot since the reporting of first names began in 1997.  Some of the less common names given to baby girls in 2017 were Lady, Divine, Rio, Star and Vogue.\n\nAlmost 1,000 new baby names were registered in 2017 that had not been registered since the reporting of baby names began in 1997. Blockbuster movies, popular television series, current celebrities and memorable places continue to appear to be influencing factors for some parents.\n\nOf those registrations containing details of the father, almost 500 boys were given their fathers’ name as a first or additional name.  However fewer than 100 girls were given their mothers’ name.\n\nMore generally, the statistics published today highlight that the popularity of baby names in 2017 (both boys and girls) varied, for example, by District Council, age of mother, country of birth of mother and month of registration.\n\nTop 10 baby names in Northern Ireland, 2017\n\n\nBoys:\n\n\nJames  – 243 Babies\n\nJack  – 226 Babies\n\nNoah  –  189 Babies\n\nCharlie  – 185 Babies\n\nJacob  – 180 Babies\n\nHarry  – 169 Babies\n\nThomas  – 158 Babies\n\nDaniel  – 147 Babies\n\nOliver  – 143 Babies\n\nLogan  – 125 Babies\n\nGirls:\n\nEmily  – 216 Babies\n\nGrace – 202 Babies\n\nOlivia  – 179 Babies\n\nIsla  – 153 Babies\n\nAnna  – 142 Babies\n\nSophie  – 132 Babies\n\nElla  – 128 Babies\n\nAmelia  – 127 Babies\n\nCharlotte  – 124 Babies\n\nSophia  – 121 Babies\n"},{"url":null,"title":"why 15bn bridge to scotland could be the answer to","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

Apart from the obvious support from London and Dublin, EU sources could include the cross-border INTERREG programme, the European Investment Bank, the TransEuropean Network and HORIZON 2020. The EU PEACE programme could be another valuable source because the bridge would still respect the Good Friday Agreement by promoting peace and prosperity in the region. Private funds would also be a must, and China a clear contender. With Chinese interest in access to new markets, investment for the world\u0027s most prolific bridge-builders could prove irresistible.\" Former Economy Minister, Strangford DUP MLA Simon Hamilton, reaffirmed the party\u0027s position that a solid connection between Northern Ireland and Scotland could be a catalyst for economic growth between the two regions.\n\nHe said: \"The DUP made the proposal of a feasibility study into a tunnel or enclosed bridge across the North Channel to the Scottish coastline in our 2015 manifesto. \n\n\"Some people are foolishly using Brexit to build a border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK, a border which the Prime Minister stated she could not accept and which would damage the constitutional integrity of the UK. \n\n\"There is growing support for our manifesto proposal. \n\n\"It\u0027s time to be progressive and forward thinking.\"\n\nEarlier this year Ards and North Down Borough Council agreed to engage with a Scottish Government feasibility study of the idea of a bridge, with Donaghadee mooted as a potential starting point on this side of the Irish Sea.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"businesses advised to consult customs brokers in preparation for nodeal brexit","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

Ireland businesses that trade over land with the Republic have been told to contact the Irish government about preparations they may need to make as ministers there have “indicated they would need to discuss arrangements in the event of a no-deal with the European Commission”. \n\nThe advice forms part of the nine-page “Trading with the EU if there’s no Brexit deal” technical notice — one of a raft of documents published by the Brexit department advising businesses and the public on what they need to do to prepare for a no-deal scenario. \n\nThe document states: “Businesses should now consider the impacts on them in a no-deal scenario, which would mean a requirement to apply the same customs and excise rules to goods traded with the EU that apply for goods traded outside of the EU, including the requirement to submit customs declarations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Northern Ireland businesses that trade over land with the Republic have been told to contact the Irish government about preparations they may need to make (Brian Lawless/PA)\n\n\n\n\n“Businesses should consider whether it is appropriate for them to acquire software and or engage a customs broker, freight forwarder or logistics provider to support them with these new requirements.”\n\nThe notice adds: “Engaging a customs broker or acquiring the appropriate software and authorisations from HMRC will come at a cost.” \n\nOn trade in Northern Ireland the technical paper states that the Government stands ready to “engage constructively” to act in the best interests of the people of Northern Ireland in the event of a no-deal. \n\nHowever, the department urged businesses in Northern Ireland to contact the Irish government for advice, stating: “The Irish government have indicated they would need to discuss arrangements in the event of a no deal with the European Commission and EU member states. \n\n“We would recommend that, if you trade across the land border you should consider whether you will need advice from the Irish government about preparations you need to make.” \n\nThe document concludes by stating that the Government “will provide further information on action to take to prepare for this scenario over the coming months”. \n"},{"url":null,"title":"ryanair and pilots union reach agreement after 22 hours","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n

But outbreaks have occurred at Muslim, Christian and Hindu religious events, at sports events, and at large-scale open air festivals in the past. \n\n\"When they occur, they most commonly involve vaccine preventable diseases such as measles, influenza, mumps and hepatitis. \n\n\"Other reported outbreaks are mainly of gastrointestinal infections caused by a number of different pathogens,\" Dr O\u0027Riordan said. \n\n\"Given the nature of this historic papal visit, a large number of young children and elderly visitors are expected to attend the final mass, including many international visitors. \n\n\"In the current context of ongoing measles spread in Europe, it is highly advisable that all attendants, especially young children, ensure that they are up to date with their vaccinations,\" Dr O\u0027Riordan added.\n\nAccording to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, the measles outbreak is continuing across Europe, with more than 30 deaths reported in 2018. \n\nThe Papal visit is expected to attract 15,000 overseas visitors and the final mass will draw a crowd of around 500,000 people. \n\nThe World Health Organisation (WHO) defines a mass gathering as \"a planned or spontaneous event where the number of people attending is sufficient to strain the planning and response resources of the community, state or nation hosting the event\". \n\nDr Jack Lambert, specialist in infectious diseases at the Mater Hospital, Dublin, said the reality is people risk contracting diseases during mass gatherings.\n\n\"There are real outbreaks, as with the Hajj in Saudi Arabia in the past… but most of the population in Ireland are protected against diseases like measles,\" Dr Lambert said. \"But, in saying that, if one person with measles is walking around 15,000 people and coughs, some individuals might get it.\" \n\nHe cautioned, however, that while infectious disease spread is not impossible during the Papal visit, it is \"highly unlikely\" and the risk is \"minimal\". \n\nPope Francis will attend the \u0027Festival of Families\u0027 in Croke Park on August 25 and a final mass in Phoenix Park on August 26. A significant policing plan has been put in place, along with major traffic diversions.\n\nIrish Rail will provide capacity for up to 250,000 journeys for those travelling to the Papal Mass.

Dublin for Francis before he arrives for the World Meeting of Families festival.\n\nHuge security barriers have been erected around Phoenix Park ahead of the Papal mass and other parts of Dublin where he will visit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe security bill is likely to cost tens of millions of euros with the Irish Government and Catholic Church footing the bulk of the costs.\n\nThe pontiff, who will be in Ireland for less than 48 hours, will stay at the Apostolic Nunciature of the Holy See in north west Dublin.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoenix Park, Dublin, where Pope Francis will perform the closing mass (Laura Hutton/PA)\n\n\n\n\nIn May last year, Pope Francis appointed Archbishop Jude Thaddeus Okolo as the apostolic nuncio to Ireland, the first African priest to hold the role.\n\nThe apostolic nuncio is the papacy’s diplomatic representative in Ireland.\n\nIt is understood that the high security bill will be lower than the last VIP visitors, the Queen and President Barack Obama.\n\nOver 36 million euro was spent on the 2011 visits.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(PA Graphics)\n\n\n\n\nThousands of Gardai, military personnel and members of the Defence Forces will be deployed around Dublin and Knock in Co Mayo when he visits the Knock Shrine on Sunday morning.\n\nGardai have been patrolling the Knock area since June after it was confirmed the pontiff would visit the pilgrimage site as part of his trip.\n\nA number of road closures will be in place while the Pope’s route through the city will continue to be searched and secured ahead of the visit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(PA Graphics)\n\n\n\n\nExtra policing resources and overtime is expected to push up the Garda bill which is thought to be around five million euro.\n\nThe Garda’s air support, the Defence Forces, Emergency Response Unit and the the Air Corps will be on standby as back up.\n\nThe Pope will make his way though Dublin city in his Popemobile, making him more visible to the large crowds.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"class dismissed teenage

I especially liked doing Swinub, and of course my favourite, Piplup.\n\n“The Pokemon Golisopod was especially difficult – he’s very detailed, and my initial sketch looked almost nothing like him. It wasn’t fun.”\n\nElena has been drawing since the age of three and has been a Pokemon fan since she was eight. “It’s our 10-year anniversary.” she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Elena Fortune)\n\n\n\n\nAnd

like to do stickers or a T-shirt too.”\n\nSo if you want a copy, keep an eye on Elena’s \nshop\n.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"244310","story":"\nA Derry man with 352 criminal convictions has been jailed for damaging a shop a week after being released from prison.\n\nDamian Joseph Young, 52, of no fixed abode, appeared at Derry Magistrates, sitting in Omagh, charged with criminal damage to a door on August 20.\n\nThe court was told that a shop owner in Omagh had contacted police to say a man fitting Young\u0027s description had kicked a door causing multiple cracks and damage valued at £250.\n\nDefence solicitor Seamus Quigley said the defendant was chronic alcoholic, before adding that ‘the chances of doing anything about that are long since gone’.\n\nHe said Young had been
