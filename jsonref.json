The brain registers the majority of information about flavour via millions of olfactory (smell) cells, so that is why the cider must be swirled in the glass to release aromas. A wine glass is best for doing this, but don’t fill it to the brim as the cider needs space to breathe so the aromas develop. Gently swirl the cider a couple of times and sniff it. Then take a sip and let the cider cover the tongue. More aromas will be released and travel to the nasal cavity through the back of the throat. Think about what you smell and taste, the cider’s body, the texture, the overall drinking experience. Then repeat. That’s how to taste cider! All-occasion quaffing: Thatchers Gold Thatchers’ flagship cider, Gold, is a blend of several apple varieties. Eating apples bestow Thatchers Gold fruitiness and a satisfying “bite”, while cider apples including two of the undisputed superstars – dabinett and Harry Masters Jersey – give body and depth to the flavour. Thatchers Gold is an eminently quaffable cider for all occasions with ripe and juicy green apple aromas and flavours bursting from the glass, a sherbet-like mouthfeel with gentle carbonation, and a refreshing tang. If you are a wine drinker looking for a cider to suit your palate then Thatchers Gold will appeal to fans of viognier. Pair with grilled sea bass, or satay vegetables if you’re veggie. Cheshire cheese is a great match too its slight saltiness will contract the cider’s underlying sweetness. Crisp and cloudy: Thatchers HazeThatchers Haze brims with fruitiness from a blend of fruit bowl favourites: discovery, falstaff, gala and jonagold. Cider made from eating apples tends to be light-bodied and crisp, and Thatchers Haze is no exception. A solid entry-level blend for those wishing to explore cider more deeply on the nose and palate it has green apples, pears, banana, a hint of lemon, an effervescent mouthfeel, and a sweet tangy finish. The cider’s distinct natural cloudiness is thanks to jonagold apple juice adding a sweetness that makes Thatchers Haze match especially well with spicy foods, such as falafel burgers, or spicy pork stir-fry. For wine drinkers, if you imagine riesling with that easy-drinking fruitiness and refreshing acidity, then Thatchers Haze will appeal to the same palate. The solo star: Thatchers KatyWhile most ciders are made from blending different apple varieties, Thatchers Katy is a single-variety cider. Made from the popular eating apple of the same name, it is fresh and fruity with a subtle sweetness, a refreshing acidity, tingling carbonation and crisp, tangy finish. Thatchers ferments Katy apples with a type of yeast that sparkling wine producers use, enhancing the flavour. However, there’s evidence to suggest it was 17th-century West Country cider makers who first experimented with secondary fermentation to add a natural sparkle to the drink, some time before champagne was invented – so you could say that cider was the original sparkling tipple. Take the flute challenge – pour a glass of Thatchers Katy and a glass of prosecco and blind taste them – which is the wine and which is the premium cider? Thatchers Katy is perfect as an aperitif and for dining. Food-wise, go for lighter textured food with delicate flavours, such as grilled cod and asparagus risotto. For a cheese match, the savoury salty flavours of parmesan are a contrast to the fruity sweetness of Thatchers Katy. Sweet explosion: Thatchers RoséWaves of strawberry, raspberry and cherry flavours refresh the mouth. Thatchers Rosé cider is made exclusively from those dessert apple favourites cripps pink, gala and fuji. Sweet fruitiness pops and fizzes across your tongue, before the mouth is filled with a zingy texture. It’s a light and easy-drinking cider that suits being well chilled. Drink it for refreshment at a picnic, or treat it as a dessert cider to be enjoyed with Eton mess or summer pudding. Full-bodied and spiced: Thatchers Rascal Imagine if apple pie came in a glass. Rascal is the cider equivalent, with a scrumptious array of flavours including red apples, pears, demerara sugar and spice. Created with a blend of cider apple stalwarts – redstreak, dabinett and tremlett’s bitter – this bold cider contains tannins that give the cider a fuller mouthfeel than the ciders made with eating or dessert apples. Tannins attract fats and proteins, cut through the texture of dense and fatty food and refresh the mouth. So pair with hearty meals such as a Sunday roast or mac and cheese, followed by apple crumble and custard. Equally, this is an excellent sitting-in-your-favourite-pub-and-chatting with your friends type of cider.

I didn’t think about the terroir of grape-growing, the nose of whisky or what wine to pair with raw tilapia. On sunny days, I just thought about the most enjoyable way to quench my thirst. Now, the clank of a metal bottle opener and the hiss of a cold Thatchers Cider opening is enough to bring me back to the Meadows in Edinburgh, for a post-lecture picnic with friends. Stretched out on the grass as the rays warm my skin, the air is filled with the smoky smell of barbecue. Summer walks have been made all the sweeter with a sip of cider at the end. Arriving at a sweep of beach, blanket at the ready, or settling at the end of a pier as the sun sets. The cool fizz of cider tickling down my throat while the sky streaks violet and hazy pink is an unbeatable feeling. On an emotional level, clinking bottles with a friend at the end of the day is the perfect reward. On a practical level, a couple of bottles of ice-cold Thatchers in your rucksack on the way to the sea cools your back – ideal. Cider is the taste of a barbecue with my family – the only way we were allowed to see each other in summer 2020. My dad cooked venison burgers for the first time, an attempt to impress me, the “food and drink writer”, making jokes about not wanting a bad review. Despite the burger buns being a bit frozen in the middle, I gave it 1010. The sun was shining, family was gathered, the cider was flowing and for a brief second it felt like normality again. The epitome of the “better times” we’re all looking forward to. I can’t always suppress the drinks writer in me and did have to note that the iron-y tang of venison burgers goes particularly well with the light sweetness of Thatchers Katy. On the slopes of the Mendip Hills, Thatchers grows 458 different varieties of apple in perfect conditions – more than 25 varieties of them are used for ciders. The autumnal rain, summer sun and lack of winter frost combine to create juicy, flavour-filled apples. They have a cider for every taste bud: sharp and cloudy, sweet and pink. As a drinks writer, I’ve sampled more ciders than I care to remember. Thatchers Katy is the choice for sunny days and balmy nights. While Thatchers’ other ciders are made from a combination of different types of apple, Thatchers Katy is made from just one type. Red as a fairytale apple and sweet as strawberries, Katy apples are the pride of the crop and first to be run through the mill. It’s what you want to be drinking to get that real thirst-quenching moment, with only a hint of sweetness that doesn’t overpower. It sits between sweet and dry, with a crisp finish, so it’s incredibly drinkable. Being an apple-based drink, it goes best with anything pork. But its lightness also carries well with salads and summer food. Think charcuterie boards laden with spicy salami, salty prosciutto, and garlicky mortadella. The slight sweetness to Thatchers Katy cuts through the saltiness of prosciutto beautifully. Hand-held picnic food – scotch eggs, sausage rolls, and pork pies – tends to be savoury-heavy, so goes down a treat with a sweet cider, paired best with a sunset view, of course. But it also mixes well with fruity dishes – a salad sprinkled with glistening pomegranate seeds and topped with ripe avocado. The delicate fizz works particularly well with the creamy squish of avocado. Meat and salad, barbecues and picnic food it’s as though Thatchers Katy was designed for summer. So, it’s no wonder cider is the British summer drink of choice it pairs naturally with grilled meat and fruity salads, it’s easy to drink, and that hit of sweet apple sings of good times. For me, cider evokes memories of barbecues with friends and family, sunsets over the sea and picnics in the park, and Thatchers Katy is my cider of choice this summer, for its strawberry sweetness and crisp finish. If you need me, I’ll be sipping a cold cider in the park, or on my way to the shore, two bottles clinking away and cooling my back. To better times.

It brings the cumulative total to 4,457,923.LBC reports that it understands it will initially be housed in Terminal 3 but would later move to Terminal 4. It comes after transport secretary Grant Shapps said yesterday he wanted passengers arriving from higher risk countries to be segregated from others. Research seen by the  suggests more than 140,000 people in north-west England had long Covid – meaning they had symptoms for at least 12 weeks – last year. Health teams in coronavirus hotspots said they were increasingly concerned about the long-term impact on children and young people, who account for the vast majority of cases of the highly transmissible Covid variant first identified in India. When asked if he knew that Bashir had forged bank statements, he replied: “I didn’t know and in fact if I had he wouldn’t have got the job.” Harding refused to comment on whether he had discussed rehiring Bashir with then director-general Tony Hall, saying: “The way I think about it is that I was running BBC when Martin Bashir was hired back into BBC News, and so the responsibility for that sits with me.” Asked whether Lord Hall, who had “intimate knowledge of what Mr Bashir had done around the Diana interview” had “any hand” in recruiting him back into the corporation, Harding replied: “So what I’m saying is BBC News hired Martin Bashir, and so the responsibility for that sits with me.”Edwards, who anchored the BBC’s coverage of the recent funeral of the Duke of Edinburgh, also tweeted: “There is no excuse or justification for what happened in 1995. We are all sickened by it and the subsequent handling of it. For today’s BBC News team - 25 years on - to be lectured on probity and trust by certain parts of the media is somewhat vexing.” However, he later took down the post, tweeting: In a speech to the G20 health summit, Johnson drew a parallel between the pandemic and the plague at the start of Homer’s epic poem The Iliad. A total of 49,682,934 Covid-19 vaccinations have taken place in England between 8 December and 20 May, according to NHS England data, including first and second doses, which is a rise of 601,960 on the previous day. NHS England said 31,354,838 were the first dose of a vaccine, a rise of 234,818 on the previous day, while 18,328,096 were a second dose, an increase of 367,142.Among the 15,000 volunteers who took part, many say they are considering quitting or getting alternative jabs – despite the potential health risks – because the vaccine passport function on the app is not properly set up to accommodate them. People in England who have had two doses of an approved coronavirus vaccine were able to use the NHS app to confirm their vaccine status for international travel this week. But the app is unable to display details of those who have had their jabs as part of a clinical trial, with frustrated participants left feeling “disadvantaged” as a result. PA has the story: Last week’s figure was 0.8 to 1.1. These estimates represent the transmission of Covid-19 two to three weeks ago, due to the time delay between someone being infected, developing symptoms, and needing healthcare."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/606f7fb6939721c71531d390d113a4d3f05f5e82/0_360_4868_2922/master/4868.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=496f133e0ee66ffa57e883145109b0fb","title":"us pga championship 2021 second round live golf","story":"Please ignore the very last line of the sixth entry, though.

Friends and family of retired Colonel Ralph Puckett, Jr, who will receive the Medal of Honor this afternoon, were also spotted posing for photos outside the Palm Room doors.“My congratulations on how the Biden-Harris administration is building back better with the world’s most successful vaccine deployment and fastest economic recovery and blazing a trail for inclusiveness and unity by restoring the soul of America,” Moon said. Those comments echo Biden’s remarks on the 2020 campaign trail, where he described the presidential election as a “battle for the soul of the nation”.Joe Biden will award the medal to retired Colonel Ralph Puckett, Jr, who served in the Korean War. This marks the first Medal of Honor ceremony since Biden took office. In a statement released on Wednesday, the White House explained how Puckett distinguished himself for “conspicuous gallantry” by repeatedly putting himself in harm’s way to help his unit capture a hill in Korea in November 1950. “Leaving the safety of his position and with full knowledge of the danger, First Lieutenant Puckett intentionally ran across an open area three times to draw enemy fire, thereby allowing the Rangers to locate and destroy the enemy positions and to seize Hill 205,” the White House said. The Medal of Honor ceremony will start at the White House at 1 pm ET.“This afternoon, I’m hosting H.E. Moon Jae-in, President of the Republic of Korea, at the White House for a bilateral meeting,” Biden said on Twitter. “I look forward to renewing the ironclad alliance between our two nations while working side-by-side to tackle our shared challenges.” Moon’s trip makes him the second foreign leader to visit the White House in person since Biden took office in January. Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga met with Biden at the White House last month. Moon visited with Kamala Harris this morning, and the vice-president expressed appreciation for the relationship between the US and South Korea. “We are connected through our shared democratic values,” Harris said. Two groups have now filed a lawsuit challenging the new voting restrictions in Arkansas, which were approved by Republican legislators there last month. “In more than a decade working on elections, audits and recounts across the country, I’ve never seen one this mismanaged,” Morrell said in a Washington Post op-ed. Morrell described the high level of security at the arena, recounting how observers for the firm Cyber Ninjas, which is overseeing the review, followed her as she took notes on the process.  Even more alarming, Morrell said, was the complete lack of a sophisticated process to ensure volunteers were accurately counting ballots. “Each table had three volunteers tallying the ballots, and their tally sheets were considered ‘done’ as long as two of the three tallies matched, and the third was off by no more than two ballots,” Morrell said. “The volunteers only recounted if their tally sheets had three or more errors — a threshold they stuck to, no matter how many ballots a stack contained, whether it was 50 or 100. This allowed for a shocking amount of error.” Morrell concluded that Cyber Ninjas will likely release a damning report once the review is concluded, but she insisted the problems lie with the audit, not with the ballots. She said, “This is not an audit, and I don’t see how this can have a good outcome.”“A devastating letter written by Arizona Senate President Karen Fann on voting irregularities, and probably fraud, in Maricopa County during the 2020 Presidential Election,” Trump said in a statement last week. He added, “The Fake News and Lamestream Media is doing everything they can not to cover this major story. They just refuse to talk or report about it. They don’t want the United States or World to see what is going on with our corrupt, third world election.” This blog has covered this many times, but just to reiterate: there is absolutely no valid evidence of widespread fraud in the presidential election -- either in Arizona or in any other battleground state. Suggestions of widespread fraud are lies.The Arizona secretary of state, Democrat Katie Hobbs, has sent a letter to Maricopa county officials urging them to replace the voting machines involved in the county’s controversial recount of its November election results. In her letter, Hobbs suggested the machines may have been vulnerable to tampering due to “the lack of physical security and transparency” during the Republican-backed recount. “I have grave concerns regarding the security and integrity of these machines, given that the chain of custody, a critical security tenet, has been compromised,” Hobbs said. Hobbs’ letter will likely only intensify Democratic accusations that the recount is a potentially harmful charade meant to appease Donald Trump, who continues to peddle lies about widespread fraud in the presidential election. Hobbs’ concerns also underscore the effects of Trump’s claims, even though he has presented no evidence to support them.

His comments come as data from the Covid-19 Genomics UK (COG-UK) Consortium reveals that the India variant has been detected in 4,717 positive Covid samples to date, with the India variant found in around a fifth of analysed positive specimens dating to within the past 28 days.  The rise has also been reflected in case data, which unlike the Cog-UK data does not include potential duplicates, with figures released by Public Health England (PHE) last night revealing there have now been 3,424 confirmed cases of the B.1.617.2 variant in the UK, up from 1,313 cases confirmed by last Thursday. Both of these datasets are likely to underestimate the current situation as there is a time lag between samples being collected and the variant in positive tests being determined. Christina Pagel, professor of operational research at University College London, who is a member of the Independent sage group of experts said the rise in cases of the India variant is not yet fully reflected in overall Covid case numbers because of the decline in cases of the Kent variant that has been dominating in the UK. Anthony Costello, professor of global health and sustainable development at University College London and a former director of maternal and child health at the WHO who is also a member of Independent Sage noted that while Covid vaccines appear to offer protection against the variant, some people can still become very ill with the disease. The CBC cited a formal Notice to Airmen issued by civil aviation authorities. Ottawa first announced the ban on 22 April as cases of Covid-19 in India soared. As we reported earlier, the UK government said on Friday it was up to airports to ensure people returning from “red-list” countries are separated from other travellers.Johnson drew a parallel between the pandemic and the plague at the start of Homer’s epic poem The Iliad.  He said in a speech at the G20 health summit:  The chairman of euro zone finance ministers Paschal Donohoe told a news conference: The long-term “scarring” effects of the pandemic could include declining business investments, as it did in the financial crisis a decade ago, European Economics Commissioner Paolo Gentiloni  told the news conference, while the disruption to young people’s education and training remains another big worry. European Commission forecasts show the 27-nation EU will reach pre-pandemic growth levels around the middle of 2022, with some, like Germany and France, already there at the end of this year and others, like Italy or Spain only at the end of 2022.  But China and the US will rebound more quickly, forecasts show, and the eurozone will have to act soon to boost its growth potential if it is to stay among the top performers, the French finance minister Bruno le Maire said.  NHS England said 234,818 first vaccine doses had been administered on the previous day, taking the total of first doses to 31,354,838, while 367,142 second doses were given, taking second shots to 18,328,096 overall.Italy’s state audit court on Friday raised objections to the public financing for the project, throwing its future into doubt, Reuters reports.  The court said of the €50m ($60.96m) of public money directly pledged for ReiThera, too little was dedicated to the research and production of the vaccine and too much to a general strengthening of the company, including the purchase of its headquarters.  ReiThera’s vaccine, developed with Germany’s Leukocare and Belgium’s Univercells, has concluded Phase II trials and the firm is in early talks with Brussels to supply the EU.   The scheme is due to come into effect on 1 June and will apply to hotels, restaurants, and cultural venues.  Customers can decide whether to pay VAT on their bills to the state, or retain the amount as credit to spend elsewhere in the tourist sector in the following financial quarter.  Only people tax-registered in Portugal will be eligible for the scheme.  Customers provide their tax number when paying the bill, and their credits will be logged in an online portal.  Similar schemes have been tested in other countries to incentivise local consumers to support industries which usually rely on foreign visitors for income, such as the UK’s ‘Eat Out To Help Out’ scheme offering discounts at restaurants and Ireland’s ‘stay and spend’ scheme offering taxpayers a 1 euro ($1.22) refund for every 5 spent in the local hospitality sector up to 625 euros.  Portugal’s scheme will cost 200 million euros and be financed by the country’s EU recovery fund budget.  Restaurants have reopened but with capacity restrictions on indoor seating and closing time set at 10.30 pm. Bars and clubs are still closed.  Borders opened to tourists from EU countries with low incidence rates and British tourists who have a negative Covid-19 test last weekend. French officials have been lobbying countries in Europe to step up the sharing of vaccines with developing countries and have complained privately about the US export ban on vaccines and key vaccined ingredients. The forum would be “for vaccine-developing and producing countries and other stakeholders to explore ways of promoting fair and equitable distribution of vaccines around the world,” Xi said at the G20 Global Health Summit, urging major countries to make more vaccines available to developing nations, Reuters reports."},{"url":null,"title":"capel street pedestrian plans expanded by dublin city council","story":" There are plans to reduce traffic and parking on Dublin’s Capel Street to facilitate outdoor dining.Photograph: Gareth Chaney Collins PhotosDublin City Council is to expand its plans for pedestrianisation on Capel Street, following criticism of its proposals for outdoor dining facilities when Covid-19 restrictions ease.The council earlier this month proposed pedestrianising a small section of the street at its northern end and eliminating almost all on-street parking to create space for tables and chairs. However, councillors, traders and sustainable transport groups described the move as unambitious and disappointing.The council has said it will now trial the pedestrianisation of the street in sections “on an incremental basis” over six weekends from June 25th. From next week the council will go ahead with work to extend footpaths to facilitate outdoor dining ahead of its resumption on June 7th. It will also begin the implementation the pedestrianisation of a 60m section of the northern end of the street.Banning cars from this section, between Parnell Street and Ryder’s Row, would result in minimal disruption to traffic as motorists, who are permitted to drive north only at this point, would still have the option of using Ryder’s Row.All but six parking spaces between Mary Street and the quays will be removed and replaced with footpath extensions.Between Mary Street and Little Britain Street, five general parking spaces and one disabled parking space will be retained, but the council said other disabled spaces would be relocated to streets in the “immediate vicinity” to ensure no reduction of numbers. Loading bays would also be relocated to “better align with non-hospitality businesses,” the council said.More than 4,500 people made submissions on the Capel Street proposals earlier this month with 85 per cent in favour of plans to increase pedestrian space the council said.Meanwhile cars will be permanently banned from several areas around Grafton Street from Monday.However, while South William Street, Drury Street, South Anne Street and Dame Court would all have car free areas, their full pedestrianisation has been curtailed because some car park owners, including Brown Thomas said they could not facilitate the measures.Parts of these four streets, as well as Duke Street, were pedestrianised on a trial basis over weekends last July and August, with parking spaces turned into outdoor seating areas for cafes and restaurants to accommodate more people during the Covid-19 restrictions.The council held a public consultation process on the plans last November and 97 per cent of respondents were in favour of their implementation.The council had initially hoped to have the measures in place ahead of the easing of Level 5 restrictions last December, but this was delayed until January. The plans were put on hold again when restrictions were reintroduced. Work has now begun with a view to completion in just over three weeks time.Under the council’s plans, South Anne Street will be fully pedestrianised, as it was during the trial. Dame Court, the street that runs from Exchequer Street down to the Stag’s Head pub, would also be fully pedestrianised. Drury Street will be pedestrianised just after its junction with Fade Street to the Drury Street underground carpark.The South William Street pedestrian zone will be substantially smaller than during the trials. It had been pedestrianised between the Brown Thomas carpark exit and Chatham Row, but this required reversing the direction of vehicles leaving the car park, with a stopgo system in place at Exchequer Street.The council said it asked the car-park owners if it would be possible to reverse their entry and exit arrangements to make South William Street an entry point to the car park with exit from Clarendon Street. “This would then allow for the majority of the street to be pedestrianised,” the council said.The car-park owners said doing so would pose “insurmountable structural difficulties that cannot be overcome”. In addition they said the trials caused considerable congestion internally to the car park and its business dropped by 30 per cent from the first week of the trial.As a result, only the small area between the car-park exit and Exchequer Street, a 30 metre stretch, will be pedestrianised from 11am. However, the only vehicles using the street will be those exiting from the Brown Thomas car park.Only one business used the outdoor furniture on Duke Street during the trial. There is also a private car park, a delivery yard and construction site that require access, the council said, and it decided not to go ahead with the street’s permanent pedestrianisation."},{"url":null,"title":"climate","story":"Common feature of all proposals is a substantial tax on emissions from fossil fuelsDublin Climate Dialogues chairman Pat Cox says solution not for governments aloneAnalysis: Decarbonisation provides big opportunity if mix of policy, finance and innovation is right"},{"url":null,"title":"covid 19 indian variant a black cloud on horizon says holohan","story":"Chief Medical Officer Dr Tony Holohan has expressed his concern over the threat caused by the Indian variant of Covid-19 and its increased transmissibility. Video: RTÉNphet is closely monitoring variants of concern and is concerned about possible higher transmissibility of the Indian variant, according to Dr Tony Holohan. File photograph: Colin Keegan Collins DublinThe Indian variant of Covid-19 poses a threat to the progress made in suppressing the virus, according to chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan.The National Public Health Emergency Team (Nphet) is closely monitoring variants of concern and is “concerned” about possible higher transmissibility of the Indian variant and its spread in other countries, as well as early reports of its impact on vaccine effectiveness, Dr Holohan said.“The public are keeping the disease under control and the HSE is increasing the number of people vaccinated every day. But the variant may nevertheless pose a risk to the progress we have made. Nphet will keep a close eye on this as we move towards the end of May and consider the advice we need to provide to Government on any further easing of restrictions.“For the most part, the sky is mostly blue but with a black cloud on the horizon which is the Indian variant,” Dr Holohan said.Nphet was “genuinely concerned” about this variant, particularly in the light of new evidence from the Public Health England suggesting vaccines may less effective against it after a first dose.Asked whether the UK should be added to the list of countries for which mandatory hotel quarantine was required due to the number of Indian variant cases, Dr Holohan said you would have to be concerned about the “significant quantity” of transmission there. Nphet would keep the matter under review.A further 524 cases of Covid-19 patients were reported by Nphet on Friday. Further Covid-related data is unavailable due to the cyber-attack on the HSE.The number of people hospitalised and in ICU is stable, the daily incidence is stable and the amount of people protected through vaccination continues to grow, according to Prof Philip Nolan, chair of the Nphet epidemiological modelling advisory group.“We have confidence that if we can continue to limit transmission of Covid-19 through our inidual behaviour and compliance to public health advice, the vaccination effect will lead us to further easing of measures in the near future.”A total of 72 cases of the Indian variant, B.1.617.2, have been identified in Ireland, according to Dr Cillian de Gascun, director of the National Virus Reference Laboratory.“Given the size of our unvaccinated population and the apparent transmissibility of this variant, we would encourage people to remain vigilant and to continue to adhere to the public health guidance as the vaccine programme rolls out.”Most people who are not yet vaccinated are continuing to be cautious, according to Prof Pete Lunn, of the behavioural research unit of the Economic and Social Research Institute. “Our data are consistent with the majority of people waiting until they are vaccinated before increasing their activity again.”Dr Holohan again urged Leaving Cert students to be cautious ahead of their exams in order to avoid the risk of infection.On Friday morning, 107 Covid-19 patients were hospitalised, of which 38 were in ICU. There were 19 additional hospitalisations in the past 24 hours.Northern IrelandMeanwhile, six Covid-linked deaths took place in Northern Ireland in the latest week statistically analysed.Those in the week May 8th-14th took the total number of coronavirus-related deaths recorded by the Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency (Nisra) to 2,968.The Nisra data provides a broader picture of the impact of Covid-19 than the death toll reported by Stormont’s Department of Health.The department’s statistics focus primarily on hospital deaths and only include people who have tested positive for the virus.Nisra obtains its data from death certificates on which Covid-19 is recorded as a factor by a medical professional, regardless of where the death took place or whether the patient tested positive.The statistics agency reports its Covid-19 data with a week lag.The department’s death toll stood at 2,149 on May 14th.Of the 2,968 deaths recorded by Nisra by May 14, 1,964 (66 per cent) occurred in hospitals, 774 (26 per cent) in care homes, 14 (0.5 per cent) in hospices and 216 (7 per cent) at residential addresses or other locations.Nisra reported that up to May 14th, the deaths of 1,011 care home residents were linked to Covid-19.The figure includes the 774 deaths that took place in care homes, and a further 237 care home residents who died in hospital having been taken there for treatment.Care home residents make up about 34 per cent of deaths linked to Covid-19 in Northern Ireland, according to Nisra.In the week of May 8th-14th, seven coronavirus-linked deaths were officially registered in Northern Ireland, some of which took place before that week as deaths can take a number of days to register. – Additional reporting PAEverything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"covid 19 vaccine tracker what s available in the republic of ireland and what else is coming","story":"It has been over a year since the first case of Covid-19 was confirmed in the Republic of Ireland. Since then, over 250,000 people have been diagnosed in the State, and more than 4,900 people have died.Globally, over 150 million people have been diagnosed and over 3\u0026nbspmillion have died since the virus was first identified in China in December 2019.Four of these have been authorised for use in the EU - one from AstraZeneca, one from BioNTech-Pfizer, one from Moderna and another from Johnson \u0026amp Johnson (Jannsen).The EU has put in place purchase agreements with Sanofi-GSK\u0026nbspand Curevac, and\u0026nbsphas concluded exploratory talks with two other vaccine producers - Novavax and Valneva.Ireland, along with all other EU member states, will get a proportional amount of every vaccine that is approved for use by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) according to its population.But how do these other vaccines work, and when will they be approved for use here? Have there been any reported side effects? And when can you expect to receive a vaccine?The  Vaccine Tracker will be updated daily as the country embarks on the largest inoculation programme in the history of the State.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 70°C.EMA approval: Granted on December 21st.Overview: Developed by New York-based Pfizer and German company BioNTech this vaccine has a brand name of Comirnaty. It uses messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, which has instructions for producing a protein from Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. The person’s immune system recognises this protein as foreign and produces antibodies and activates T-cells (white blood cells) to attack it, giving them immunity. The vaccine will last for six months when stored at -70C, and five days when stored at between 2 and 8 degrees Celsius. The EU has approved the withdrawal of six doses from each vial.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, headache, muscle and joint pain, chills and fever. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 546,000 in April, 738,000 in May and\u0026nbsp844,000 doses in June, with 5.4 million doses in total expected by the end of 2021.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 20°C.EMA approval: Granted on January 6th.Overview: Developed by Boston-based company Moderna, this vaccine is manufactured for EU states at partner plants in Switzerland, France and Spain before being distributed across the continent. Like the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine, it uses mRNA technology to produce a Sars-CoV-2 protein, which the body then attacks to give immunity. It will last for up to six months when stored at - 20°C. The first Moderna vaccine was given in Ireland on January 16th.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, chills, fever, swollen or tender lymph nodes under the arm, headache, muscle and joint pain, nausea and vomiting. Less common was redness, hives and rash at the injection site. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 383,000 by June and 870,000 doses by the end of 2021.How many have been vaccinated here?EMA approval: Granted on January 29th.Overview: The OxfordAstraZeneca vaccine (also known as Vaxzevria) was thought of as a potential game-changer because it can be transported and stored at 2 degrees to 8 degrees for up to six months, making it much easier to move around and administer. It is also much cheaper, costing about $3-4 per shot, compared with $20 for the PfizerBioNTech jab, with the former being made on a not-for-profit basis for the duration of the pandemic.It is based on a harmless chimp cold virus that cannot grow inside human cells. Scientists have tweaked this virus so that it carries genetic material containing the instructions for a protein of the coronavirus. Once the vaccine has been administered, our bodies produce the coronavirus protein, triggering an immune response.During the trial, a dosing error led to the serendipitous finding that when clinical trial participants were given half a dose followed by a full dose, the vaccine had a higher efficacy than when participants were given two full doses, with 90 per cent efficacy in the former case and 62 per cent efficacy in the latter. This led AstraZeneca to announce in November a new global trial of the vaccine with the half dosefull dose regime.In January, a bitter row broke out between the European Union and AstraZeneca after the pharmaceutical company drastically revised downwards the number of doses it could deliver the bloc.\u0026nbspWhile the EMA approved the use of this vaccine for all ages, doubt was cast over its efficacy in the over 65s due to the lack of data from Astrazeneca’s clinical trials in this cohort. As a result, Germany, Austria, Sweden, Poland and Belgium have opted not to approve this product for their older population.Following suit, Ireland has also decided to use the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine for the over 70s where possible, not the AstraZeneca jab.It would not be the first time this jab led to a\u0026nbspsignificant reorganisation of our vaccination plans.Reports of serious blood clots, mostly in women aged under 60, led the\u0026nbspNational Immunisation Advisory Committee (Niac) to first defer the use of the vaccine on March 14th, before resuming it\u0027s use on March 20th.However, on April 12th, Niac\u0026nbsprecommended that AstraZeneca should not be given to people aged under 60, once again leading to a reorganisation of the rollout. This was revised to people aged over 50 on April 27th.\u0026nbspHow many will Ireland get?\u0026nbspLatest projections are 224,000 in April, 262,000 in May and 327,000 in JuneStorage: Lasts for up to two years frozen at –20° C, and up to three months refrigerated at 2–8° C.EMA approval: Approved on March 11th.Overview: The EMA started a rolling review of this single dose vaccine from Janssen, the Belgium-based subsidiary of Johnson \u0026amp Johnson on December 1st .On January 29th the company announced the results of its Phase 3 trial: the vaccine had an efficacy of 72 per cent in the United States, 66 per cent in Latin America, and 57 per cent in South Africa.This vaccine uses double-stranded DNA to deliver a protein from the SARS-CoV-2 virus into the body, thereby creating immunity. It is different from others on the market in that it requires just one injection. The EU has agreed an initial contract for 200 million doses, with an option to buy 200 million more.On February 16th the company applied to the EMA for\u0026nbspseeking authorisation for its single-dose vaccine, and it was approved on March 11th.However, on April 13th the company paused deliveries of its vaccine in Europe pending an investigation of rare blood clot cases that have halted its rollout in the US. The blood clotting conditions reported in recipients of the Johnson \u0026amp Johnson vaccine in the US are the same rare condition linked to the AstraZeneca vaccine.On April 20th, the EMA\u0027s review of these issues found a possible link to very rare cases of unusual blood clots with low blood platelets, and agreed a warning should be included in the product information.\u0026nbspHowever, it concluded\u0026nbspthe overall benefits of the vaccine\u0026nbspin preventing Covid-19 outweigh the risks of side effects, and so Janssen announced it would resume deliveries to the EU. In Ireland,\u0026nbspNiac recommended that the jab be used only for people over the age of 50.How many will Ireland get?\u0026nbsp2.2 million doses in total,\u0026nbsp600,000 between April and June.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: US company Novavax has developed a Covid-19 vaccine which stimulates an immune response by delivering spike proteins into the body. These spike-proteins are grown and harvested from insects. Similar technology is used in the production of vaccines for influenza and HPV. The European Commission has concluded exploratory talks with Novavax with a view to purchasing up to 200 million doses. The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 3rd.Overview: In September the EU signed a deal to purchase 300 million doses of this vaccine. It is based on the same technology as one of Sanofi’s seasonal influenza vaccines - more conventional than the mRNA used by Pfizer and Moderna - and it was thought it could play a big role in ending the pandemic. However, despite positive results from Phase 1 trials, news came in December that Phase 2 trial results showed an insufficient immune response in older adults. Phase III studies were expected to start in December, but the companies now plan to begin a phase 2b study in February with a different formulation of the vaccine. Even if their new formulation is successful, they do not expect the vaccine to be available until the end of 2021.Storage: Will last for at least 3 months at 2–8°C.Overview: The German company CureVac began its final Phase 3 trials in December, with results expected in the first quarter of 2021. It uses the same mRNA technology as the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines, but can be kept at normal refrigerator temperatures. The company has signed a deal with the EU to supply 405 million doses, pending regulatory approval.The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 12th.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: Valneva is a French company which has created a Covid-19 vaccine based on their Japanese encephalitis vaccine. It delivers a chemically inactivated coronavirus and uses an adjuvant (immunity booster) to create immunity. It entered clinical trials in December and reported positive results from these initial phase 1 and 2 trial in\u0026nbspApril 2021, while announcing it was entering\u0026nbspphase 3 trials on 4,000 people.On January 12th the European Commission concluded exploratory talks with the company for the supply of 30 million doses, with the option to buy a further 30 million.When might you be vaccinated?The HSE is currently vaccinating people in the top nine cohorts:\u0026nbsppeople aged 65\u0026nbspand older who live in long-term care facilities (cohort 1), frontline healthcare workers (cohort 2), people aged 70 and older (cohort 3), people aged 16 to 69 who are at very high or high risk (cohort 4 and 7) and those aged 50 to 69 (cohorts 5 and 9).\u0026nbspThe next groups to be offered a vaccine after this will be residents of long-term care facilities aged 16-64 (cohort 8), followed by people aged 64 years and younger, alongside people aged 64 and younger who are living or working in crowded settings.

Photograph: Asif HassanAFP via GettyThe interval between doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine is being reduced from 16 weeks to 12 weeks, according to the Health Service Executive.The interval will be reduced progressively from May 24th, HSE officials told a briefing on Thursday.On proposals to reduce the age from which people can receive the AstraZeneca and Janssen vaccines from 50 to 40 years, HSE chief executive Paul Reid said these would require “significant change” to the operational model being used up to now in the vaccine rollout.A move to a “choice-based model” – as people would be able to opt for other vaccines if they did not wish to get the AstraZeneca and Janssen doses – would mark a different approach to the one used up to now.Mr Reid said this would require careful consideration. There are “some concerns” over the delivery schedule for the Janssen vaccine, he pointed out, with just 60,000 doses received so far. Supply details for June are not yet available.A further 18 cases of the B.1617.2 variant first identified in India have been identified in Ireland, HSE chief clinical officer Dr Colm Henry told the briefing, bringing to 59 the total number of cases. In addition, 22 cases of another sub-type, B.1617.1, have been found.While this was of some concern, the measures taken in Ireland have slowed down the spread of the variant, he said, thereby allowing the vaccination programme to “run through the population” as quickly as possible.Mr Reid said 43 per cent of the adult population had received one vaccine dose, with more than 2.2 million vaccines having been administered up to Wednesday.This includes 1.6 million people who have received their first dose. Last Thursday saw the highest number of vaccines administered to date, 56,000.Missing GP dataSome 250,000 vaccines were administered last week but this did not include data from GPs, which could not be included because of the cyber attack.Over 320,000 people in their sixties, and 186,000 in the 50-59 age group, have received their first dose of vaccine.At the start of the week, the 14-day incidence of Covid-19 was 124 cases per 100,000 population.

They’d want me to be happy.”’ “For me what happened to the kids was an act of insanity. I can’t see it any other way. I can’t understand it any other way,” says Andrew McGinley, the father of Conor (9), Darragh (7) and Carla (3), whose mother Deirdre Morley was found not guilty of their murder by reason of insanity in the Central Criminal Court on Thursday.In the well-kept home in Newcastle, Co Dublin, they shared as a family before their world shattered on January 24th, 2020, the children’s presence is still everywhere. They are in the completed Lego sets displayed in Perspex boxes on the windowsill, the paintings on the wall, bean bags in the front room that he recently had repaired and refilled – because he could not bear to part with them. They are in the Marvel jigsaw on the kitchen table that the boys never got to finish. It went awry after Carla tried to help with it, he remembers with a sad smile.He has begun to distribute some of their toys to people who might benefit from them, but there are certain things he has held on to. He has kept a small pile of toys to give in time to their mother Deirdre, or “Dee” as he still calls her.“There’s a lot of emotions, there’s a lot of difficult and complicated emotions. But for me, I want to live a positive life.”He has to pause for a moment.“And I want to do that, you know, in order to keep their memories alive . . . Because you could get could get swallowed up by everything else and at times I do,” he says, his voice breaking again.“My mantra is, ‘I know that they wouldn’t want me to be sad. They’d want me to be happy.’ So yeah, sometimes I have to remind myself that . . . I want to move forward positively.”This week has been hard, but “the trial for me was a process that had to happen. For me, nothing is more difficult than finding your three children dead,” he says.In a statement issued after the verdict, he said he was no closer to understanding why his children had died. What he does know is that their mother loved them. The court heard repeatedly that they were “very, very deeply loved” and “cherished”.“I can see now, Dee, she didn’t want me to know the full extent of her illness. And certainly for her family as well, she wanted to put her best foot forward,” he says.“You’re sitting in the courtroom, you’re listening to some of the counselling sessions she had with the professional services, and you’re seeing a totally different person, and you’re hearing about a totally different person. So I think the two parties needed to come together, the professional services and the support circle. I would be convinced had that happened, that Conor, Darragh and Carla would be alive today.”He now wants an inclusive investigation into her diagnosis, treatment and medication prior to the family tragedy to help the family “understand the insanity” that took his children’s lives.The court heard that his wife was diagnosed as suffering from a moderate depressive illness prior to the children’s deaths. The psychiatrists who gave evidence before the court came to slightly differing conclusions regarding her diagnosis. One, Brenda Wright, diagnosed her with bipolar affective disorder type II. Mary Davoren said it was difficult to diagnose her but “at a minimum she suffered from a recurring depressive disorder”.Within a few weeks of her admission to the Central Mental Hospital in January 2020, Deirdre Morley felt back to the “real me” on an anti-psychotic that she described as a “wonder drug”.“It would make sense to involve families more in the care of anybody with a mental health illness, because you are relying on responses that can possibly be skewed by the illness. For us as a family, we’re sitting in the courtroom, we were listening to the evidence from the two expert witnesses and we’ve just ended up with more questions than at the start of the trial,” he says.“When we look at the medical records, we can see flags raised and we’ve just been left with questions. I have been in touch with Dee, and I’ve met Dee, but I’m not going to comment further.”He says “the trial was never going to give me the answers I needed, it was an act of insanity I’ve accepted that . . . I don’t think you can come to any other conclusion.”But what he wants is for “the professional services who were treating Dee, over the last couple of years prior to the children dying, to meet with me and the Morley family, so that we can understand. We’re left with an awful lot of questions that this trial was never going to answer, but we need those answers . . . We all thought she was getting the best care, and we hope that she was, but we have questions.”He wants lessons learned about the need for a “more inclusive and collaborative approach with families. I would strongly recommend to anybody who has a loved one within the care of the mental health services, they need to get in there and become an advocate for their care, they need to be aware of their treatment, their medication, all the facts, everything.”But for now, he is focused on “living a positive life” for the children.This has meant fulfilling promises he made to the children. In Conor’s case that was a promise to help him set up a YouTube channel. Conor was “quiet enough” but creative and funny. He remembers a day he spent with Conor not long before he died, noticing “he was turning into a wee man . . . he was a smart kid and a sensible kid and he had such a great sense of humour.”He promised seven-year-old Darragh he would start coaching Rathcoole boys football team, something he has done. He is surprised whenever he is asked if it is painful to be around his sons’ friends. “It’s funny that people would think that way. I enjoy it.”As for Carla, “she could have bought and sold the world”, he says his eyes filling with tears again. He promised her that he would make a snowman with her one day. In her name, he’s going to organise a snowman colouring competition. “Because they died so young, maybe in a way it’s giving them life.”For all the unfathomable depths of his grief, it gives him solace to know that his children knew they were loved and that no matter how busy he was with work, he always made time for them. “If you have kids, they’re your family. All five of you. I used to try and get home to take my last call at home,” he says.“If I saw them on the trampoline, I’d go out and join them . . . I don’t think there was a playground in the whole of Dublin that we hadn’t visited at one stage or another. We were always doing stuff.”In his darkest moments – and there are many, like Father’s Day, which was for him the lowest point – what gives him hope is “thinking about the kids and doing all these projects. Some days, the alarm goes off, and I try to keep a routine going, and what gets me out of bed is my love for them, quite simply.”The other things that has provided some comfort over the past year has been the kindness of other people. He also understands that some people have found it too difficult to be around him.“There’s people that I haven’t seen since the funeral. People who would have been here for the wake, I haven’t seen them since. And you know, I’m okay with that. And I just think maybe they feel awkward, or maybe they don’t know what to say. Nobody does. A lot of people would have said to me, ‘I don’t know what to say here’. And I always responded the same way. ‘So let’s start with hello. And we’ll take it from there.’ ”Somebody sent him a “grief graph”, outlining the various stages that they thought he would experience. But for him, there are no neat stages, there is just trying to find a way to keep going. “We’re all so different. And we will all deal with it in our own way. And I do know that some people may think I should be curled up in a ball instead of being on Twitter. But I’m on Twitter because Conor wanted to be online, and wanted to be there. So I’m trying to do that for him.”He will keep going so that he can keep the children’s memories alive. “To do that, it is the charity, As Darragh Did, it’s Conor’s Clips (the YouTube account), it is the snowman for Carla, it is the books. That’s what I have to do. And that’s what I want to do. My mantra is, ‘I know that they wouldn’t want me to be sad. They’d want me to be happy.’ Sometimes I have to remind myself of that.”Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"national tidy towns competition returns in 2021 after covid cancellation","story":"Minister for Community Heather Humphreys: more than 800 TidyTowns Groups have  been awarded grants of up to €1,000The National Tidy Towns competition is back after being cancelled in 2020 – for the first time in 60 years – due to the Covid-19 pandemic.The competition’s return for 2021 will see a few tweaks to ensure safety of participants and judges. More than 800 Tidy Towns groups have been given a special grant of up to €1,000 to support their efforts, and they will be asked to submit an electronic entry, with a new prize category to recognise the role played by volunteers during the Covid pandemic. There will also be a special award for young people in line with the Government strategy Our Rural Future.Minister for Rural and Community Development Heather Humphreys on Friday announced the return of the competition, which is sponsored by SuperValu supermarkets. The 2021 competition will take place in the same format as previous years, albeit with a specific emphasis on electronic entry and remote adjudication of each town’s entry, the organisers said. Overall winners announced before the end of the year. The organisers said groups should continue to adhere to public health guidelines, and it has been acknowledged the pandemic might have impacted on volunteers’ ability to deliver on all of their plans. It was for this reason a new award category was aimed at groups that have continued to serve and look after their communities despite the difficulties posed by Covid-19, Ms Humphreys said. She announced a €1 million fund in December to support the Tidy Towns groups, and on Friday she confirmed that more than 800 TidyTowns Groups have now been awarded grants of up to €1,000 under this fundIan Allen, managing director of SuperValu noted that 2021 marks 30 years of SuperValu’s continuous support and sponsorship of the competition. “As one of the longest-running community and sustainability initiatives in Ireland, TidyTowns is an incredibly important programme that all of us at SuperValu are immensely proud to be a part of.” he said.

Photograph: Laura Hutton The Portobello Plaza in Dublin’s south inner city will remain closed for the next three weekends.Dublin City Council said the decision was taken following a meeting with local residents, public representatives and gardaí due to large crowds gathering and anti-social behaviour in recent weeks.The plaza will close between Friday and Monday until June 11th “with the situation monitored on an ongoing basis”, the council said. Large fences were erected around the area last weekend, with the council citing some behaviour at the site recently as “completely unacceptable”.Fine Gael councillor James Geoghegan, who was at the meeting on Thursday, said he didn’t support the move.“I don’t think that’s a solution and I’m disappointed there hasn’t been in conjunction with this really short-term plan, which is just blocking off the plaza, it doesn’t seem to me that we have been presented with the medium term solution,” he told The . “On the one hand you have residents who are being really badly affected, including defecation on their doorstep, urination on their walls, the smell of hash when they open up their window but then on the other hand you have an awful lot of people who want to enjoy that public space in a responsible way. “The balance definitely isn’t right by just locking off the square with horrible looking fences.”Cllr Geoghegan said he believes there should be a consultation with local residents as to a longer-term solution, “because my fear would be that we just keep shutting off this area every weekend”. Independent councillor Mannix Flynn, who also attended the meeting, said he “absolutely” supported the temporary closure of the plaza.“I think it’s really important that this respite happens. It’s a temporary measure which is only for the weekends in order to get a handle on what’s happening on the plaza itself. “The canal remains open, people can move within the area. There is plenty of opportunity for amenity within the general area,” he said. Cllr Flynn said the decision “wasn’t taken lightly” and the situation will be reassessed as to how the plaza can be managed and reopened at weekends next month. “It hasn’t just been the pandemic which has made the area a bit busier. This has been going on for a long time,” he said. “It started first at the Barge end and then it moved its way up. Our job is to look after the health and safety of the local community and they have had a horrendous time . . . it’s not a draconian measure, it’s in keeping with protecting the community. “There has also been a huge amount of damage done to wildlife along the Grand Canal.”Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons may 2021","story":"Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2020 by clicking here or call 0844 871 1514. To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to https:telegraph.newsprints or call 0191 603 0178Martin Bashir Diana BBC interview: Boris Johnson \u0026#39very concerned\u0026#39 about report - latest newsCoronavirus latest news: New \u0026#39triple mutant\u0026#39 variant under investigation in YorkshireComment: GP\u0026#39s roles might be evolving, but the BMA isn\u0026#39t helping by acting like it doesn\u0026#39t care about patientsUK scientists uncertain if Indian variant is more transmissiblePrince Harry insists Oprah interview was done in \u0026#39most compassionate way possible\u0026#39Jeremy Paxman diagnosed with Parkinson\u0026#39s diseaseHalf of vulnerable people still shielding despite guidance lifting a month agoPrince Harry insists Oprah Winfrey interview was done in \u0026#39most compassionate way possible\u0026#39 Glasgow faces another fortnight of tougher Covid curbs and plan for national return to normality at riskSecret El Salvador murder ring suspected as up to 40 bodies found in ex-policeman\u0026#39s gardenSpain to welcome back UK tourists from Monday - but Number 10 still says don\u0026#39t goUK Weather: \u0026#39Unseasonable\u0026#39 rain sees wettest May for five yearsSwansea riot: Vigil descends into mob mayhem as cars set on fireGaza ceasefire faces first test as Palestinians clash with Israeli forces at Jerusalem holy siteWhy a trade deal with Australia matters for Boris JohnsonPeople now less likely to take up surge test offer, despite Indian variant growthChildren whose mothers live in areas with high air pollution more than twice as likely to have asthmaLady Gaga had a \u0026#39psychotic break\u0026#39 after teenage sexual assault left her pregnantComment: Labour\u0026#39s opportunism in the Batley and Spen by-election could result in defeatAstrazeneca Covid vaccine Q\u0026ampA: What we know about blood clots, side effects and risks Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"analysis bridge north koreas secretive border says chinas cold","story":"In the middle of a bridge soaring over the Yalu River in northeast China is a white line painted on the ground, flanked by surveillance cameras, traffic lights and a blue sign indicating the destination ahead: North Korea.For now, the crossing in the border city of Dandong remains quiet, though it’s poised to soon become busy with traffic. Workers began conducting safety inspections last week – preparations that suggest the long-delayed New Yalu River Bridge may soon open, allowing official trade to resume between China and North Korea, which closed its borders after the coronavirus outbreak emerged in Wuhan. It was one of the first countries in the world to do so, given concerns its public health system would buckle if mass disease spread.“We’ve been here for a few days already and will probably be here until early June,” an inspector told the  in mid-May. He is on a team of eight that will soon cross to the North Korean side to examine the bridge, though officials from both sides are still negotiating terms. China has reaffirmed its alliances with nations including North Korea and Russia after the US began pursuing more multilateral engagement. Under President Joe Biden, the US has ramped up efforts to court Asian allies, including Japan and South Korea, in efforts to bolster cooperation on the North Korean nuclear threat and China’s growing influence. On Friday, Mr Biden will welcome South Korean President Moon Jae-in to Washington for an official visit. The meeting could shed light on the US approach, as the Biden administration has been reviewing how to deal with North Korea – with more sanctions, summits or both. The visit also comes as ties between Washington and Beijing have frayed, potentially making China less inclined to collaborate on dealing with North Korea – even though its leaders are concerned about the nuclear threat. China’s ties to the North helped to blunt the impact of United Nations sanctions meant to deter Kim Jong-un’s nuclear ambitions. Smuggling routes and legal trade along the 880-mile border supplied North Korean markets and factories with building materials, machine parts, fuel, food and consumer goods. But the North’s decision to seal its border over coronavirus concerns has been crippling. From January 2020 through the first quarter of this year, China’s official trade with North Korea crashed to $550 million (£400 million), compared to $2.8 trillion in 2019. Chinese exports to North Korea dropped to $3,000 in February, the lowest in years. “Clearly the situation inside, in North Korea, is dire, so it stands to reason we’re at a point that some relaxation (of the border closure) might happen,” said Scott Snyder, senior fellow for Korea Studies at the US-based Council on Foreign Relations. Re-opening trade with China could also indicate that North Korea may ramp up weapons testing again, after a relatively quieter period during the coronavirus pandemic. ”They’re not testing not because they’ve had a change of heart, but because they’re dealing with domestic crises,” said John Park, director of the Korea Project at Harvard University’s Kennedy School of Government. “They hit the pause button, and if they stabilise and are going to open up bits of trade, that’s a sign they’ve figured out a way to manage this.”Then, “does that mean they take their fingers off the pause button? Does that mean they go back to doing what they said they were going to do before Covid, and that was to demonstrate more potent capabilities?”North Korea has recently again started using shows of force, firing off two short-range ballistic missiles in March – its first such launches in a year, and in defiance of UN Security Council bans on ballistic missile tests. Rumours among traders in Dandong on when border crossings might be allowed again range from next month to early next year. Exactly when depends on the North’s risk appetite with coronavirus. Officially, Pyongyang has told the World Health Organisation that it has had zero cases, though experts doubt the veracity of its claims. Either way, there are signs in the city – spliced from the hermit kingdom by the Yalu River, lined with watchtowers and border guards with guns and masks – that China is laying the groundwork for trading with North Korea.The government of Liaoning province, where Dandong is located, invited bids in March for the safety inspection the  found was underway. Official procurement documents said that the New Yalu River Bridge – a three-kilometre stretch connecting China to North Korea – was “about to be put into operation.Another tender notice, also from March, sought contractors to build a cargo inspection area, logistics warehouse and other facilities to support port operations on the Chinese side of the bridge. Many in Dandong are eager for the border to re-open and activity to resume. Three street vendors told the  that they were running out of smuggled North Korean cigarettes to sell. Few restaurants stock Taedonggang, a beer produced by a state-owned North Korean brewery.Shopkeepers, desperate to make a sale, are quick to offer discounts to passersby – soaps, perfumes, noodles, handbags, and vitamins that North Koreans going back and forth used to buy. An elderly woman who tailors traditional Korean robes was praying in her shop one morning for customers to return.Before the border closure, North Koreans would place large orders for colourful outfits ranging from 170 yuan (£20) for children to 3,600 yuan (£400) for high-end women’s dresses. But these days she’s lucky to sell smaller textiles, such as makeup pouches for 10 yuan (£1.10) each, to Chinese tourists. “Business has been terrible,” she said, making it difficult to cover her monthly shop rent of 3,000 yuan (£330). “I hope the border opens soon.”  More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"bitcoin defence against monetary madness","story":"But hold on. For all the volatility in the market, we need crypto-currencies like Bitcoin more than ever. Sure, the price swings may be a little, er, extreme. Yet in a world where central banks are printing cash with abandon, and where governments have settled on a consensus that they can spend without limits, there is value in an alternative to state-controlled money.Bitcoin, a decentralised currency, with no central bank, whose supply is governed by a computer process known as mining, may look a little surreal – but it is not nearly as crazy as what our governments are up to.Over a year, it has been even crazier, rising from less than $10,000 to peak at $65,000. Other crypto-currencies have been wackier still. Ethereum doubled in the last month, then halved again. Ripple was up 50 per cent, then down again. Dogecoin, created as a parody of the craze, quadrupled in value, then slipped all the way down again. The PM’s hair on a photo op by the sea in Hartlepool looks stable by comparison.Plenty of central bankers, and finance ministers, will have been quietly pleased about that. Indeed, the plunge was initially sparked by restrictions on Bitcoin in China that could be followed by other countries. The volatility in the price will deter people from investing in crypto-currencies, and from using them to buy and sell. After all, you need very strong nerves to put your savings into an asset that can halve in price in the blink of an eye. And it makes each one far less useful as a means of exchange.But there are reasons to be very suspicious about the schadenfreude of the central bankers and their friends in the world’s finance ministries.True, crypto might be new and crazy. But so is the policy consensus across the developed world. In the United States, President Biden campaigned as a moderate, but in office he has started spending on a scale that has not been witnessed since the wartime economy of the 1940s. In Italy, the unelected technocrat and former central banker Mario Draghi is pushing the budget deficit up to levels not seen since the First World War (and remember, this was already the world’s third biggest debtor) in a wager on restoring growth.The European Union has started deficit spending at scale for the first time with its €750 billion Coronavirus Rescue Fund, with no word yet on any taxes to pay for all the borrowing. We may think the Johnson administration in the UK is addicted to spending money, and in some ways it is, but it is fairly conventional compared to the rest of the G20.All of it is being paid for by central banks. The European Central Bank has expanded its balance sheet, a rough proxy for newly minted money, to \u2028€7.6 trillion, or 76 per cent of the zone’s GDP. The Bank of Japan is now on 132 per cent of GDP, the Federal Reserve on 34 per cent, and our own Bank of England on 38 per cent. It is a form of hyper-Keynesianism the likes of which the world has never witnessed before.Maybe it will work, and lift growth, or maybe it will end up in a 1970s-style inflationary spiral. We will see over the next few years. One point is for certain, however. It is a bold experiment, and one fraught with uncertainty.Ordinary investors have few defences against that. Gold is one, but it is a long time since that was a mainstream part of the financial system, its supply is variable, and the price fluctuates. Property usually holds its own, but it is already expensive in most of the developed world.The original idea behind Bitcoin and the other crypto-currencies was to create an independent currency, outside of the control of the state, that could be used as a way of storing value, and exchanging goods and services, without central banks. In fairness, it has not got there yet, or proved that it can fulfil that role. It is still going to be a long time before crypto-currencies become a mainstream, accepted part of the financial system.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"palestinians need stop living past","story":"Sometimes it is difficult for a people to face the stark truth about themselves, but the latest Gaza conflict makes it unavoidable: the Palestinians need to get over their historical complaints, which largely date back to the foundation of the State of Israel in 1948.To listen to some in the anti-Israel movement today – which extends far further into Britain’s media than it should – one might imagine that the Palestinian exodus of 73 years ago was somehow an occurrence unique in modern history. The truth is very different. For all sorts of geopolitical reasons, many groups were forcibly or voluntarily moved during the troubled decade of the 1940s. There were no fewer than 20 different groups – including the Sikhs, Muslims and Hindus of the Punjab, the Crimean Tartars, the Japanese and Korean Kuril and Sakhalin Islanders, the Soviet Chechen, Ingush and Balkars – who were displaced in that period, many in their tens or hundreds of thousands.None of the specific circumstances are directly comparable. But all of these peoples chose to try to make the best of their new environs except one, and most have succeeded. Some, such as those who emigrated to the United States, have done so triumphantly. The sole exception has been the Palestinians, whose leaders again and again chose to embrace fanatical irredentism and recurrent intifadas regardless of the interests of their people. The rubble seen in Gaza today is all they have to show for it.The Palestinian militant cadres chose the terrorist path while every other one of the displaced people of the late-1940s chose the peaceful one of moving on with their national stories, looking forward, rather than back to a past that has grown rosier through the distorting prism of hindsight.After the Second World War, more than 3 million Germans were forced to leave their homes in the Sudetenland, Silesia and lands east of the Oder and Neisse rivers, where their forefathers had lived for centuries. They embarked on the 300-mile journey westwards under conditions of extreme deprivation, carrying only what they could pack on to carts and into suitcases. Having reached the new borders of East and West Germany, they settled and made no irredentist claims to the new Poland and Czechoslovakia. Today, they and their children comprise some of the most successful people in Germany.The same period saw massive population transfers in the Punjab and North-West Frontier territories of India, where some 16 million people crossed between the new states of Pakistan and India, and modern historians are finally coming to agreement that somewhere between one-half and three-quarters of a million people died in the appalling communal massacres that ensued. While there are severe border disputes still between the two successor countries over Kashmir, no one from the Muslim, Hindu and Sikh communities is agitating for restitution of the lands their forefathers farmed or shops they once owned in the Punjab.Before his death in 1953, Joseph Stalin moved entire ethnic groups from one side of Eastern Europe and the USSR to the other, sometimes numbering millions. They were “relocated” to Siberia, the Crimea or Central Asia, often hundreds of miles from their homelands and under the harshest conditions. In all, forced internal migrations of the Tatars, Volga Germans, Ingush, Balkars, Karachays, Meskheta Turks and other ethnic groupings numbering some six million led to the genocidal deaths of up to 1.5 million, including 46 per cent of the Crimean Tatars. Yet there are no appreciable irredentist movements among these former Soviet citizens they have made the best of their new situations rather than carrying on an ultimately hopeless struggle to return.Tragically, it has been the Arab states’ cynical policy for over seven decades to keep the Palestinians boiling with indignation. For those Palestinians who have continued to live in refugee camps even into the fourth generation, 1948 was indeed a catastrophe, but many other peoples have learned to deal with the same or worse by moving onward and upward. The State of Israel is here to stay, and until the Palestinians are able to accommodate themselves to that fact, they will never find happinessAndrew Roberts is the author of ‘Churchill: Walking with Destiny’More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"possible sympathise prince harry also despair handled situation","story":"The Prince Harry debate is like Brexit: you’re either for him or against him. He’s either bravely raising awareness of mental-health problems, or he’s a snivelling, spoiled brat who doesn’t know he’s born.I’m in a lonely position in the middle. When I watched, with embarrassing fascination, that 90-minute interview with Oprah a couple of months back, my immediate reaction was of sympathy. Anyone who’s seen the debilitating impact of depression on a close friend or loved one won’t lightly dismiss its potency, nor lazily assume that royals must somehow be immune.In any case, wouldn’t anyone suffer mental-health problems having been through what Harry has – losing his mother when he was a boy, being paraded in front of the world’s media while grieving, having every youthful indiscretion photographed and condemned? I’d have turned to drink and run away to America too, with or without Meghan.Yet, I despair at Harry’s approach, now he’s escaped. And the root of it all appears to be ego. Each inidual member of the royal family is pretty unremarkable, with the normal range of human weaknesses, amid, for most, an admirable sense of duty. For example, with the exception of Prince Charles, they are atrocious public speakers – yet that’s the very thing they often have to do. They’re in the public eye for no other reason than by accident of birth or marriage. It’s purely the institution that makes them noteworthy.Yet some of them struggle to accept this. Edward VIII craved a role after his abdication, and was apparently shocked to discover that nobody thought he should have one. In the 1980s, his great nephew Prince Edward came up with the wheeze It’s a Royal Knockout, which was so awful I break out into hives just thinking about it. Sarah Ferguson landed herself in all sorts of scrapes after her orce. And, most damagingly, Prince Andrew dismissed the advice of his officials, chose his own PR strategy (because, of course, as a royal, he must be brilliant at it) and merrily chatted away to the BBC’s Emily Maitlis, creating the world’s most damaging crisis interview, ever.And now we have Harry. Notwithstanding our sympathy for him, we can acknowledge that he was an unremarkable student at Eton, who then went into the army. He has no standout talent, as far as I can see. Yet he seems to think that he has a duty to lead the fight for people suffering mental health problems – and raise awareness of an awful affliction about which the world is increasingly aware and sympathetic anyway. And he thinks that because Oprah is taking an interest, he must have something important to say.Well, Oprah is interested not because of his insight, but because he is, for a short time, a big news story – the errant Prince who’s telling all. For the media, there’s nothing better than a mixture of celebrity and conflict, especially if there’s a whiff of casual racism mixed in (“How dark will the baby’s skin be?”). And it’s even better if Harry can be placed on a flimsy American pedestal and then smacked down as soon as he makes the inevitable slip, by trashing the First Amendment. Smart move, Harry.Meanwhile, Oprah, I’m sure, doesn’t give two hoots about the impact of his revelations on the rest of his family, not least his grieving grandmother. I doubt she gives two figs about Harry or Meghan at all. Why should she? She’s paid to make compelling TV, and she’s doing it tremendously well.Harry must learn the hard way, as Edward VIII did, that he’s going to be less and less relevant. Okay, he’s big news now. But the foundations of that stardom are built on sand. He’d be wise to go off quietly and use his vast wealth to get the mental health support he needs away from the glare of the cameras.Then, I’m afraid, he needs to ready himself for living a life about which the rest of us have very little interest.

They have proven, beyond all doubt, that lying doesnapost work.In , after meeting Bashir for the first time, Prince William reportedly told Princess Diana: Heaposs a sly creep, Mummy. A quarter of a century later, that opinion is shared by any who glance at the fallout of the BBC inquiry into its failures around the explosive Panorama interview that year. The fact Bashir faked documents, lied about her in-laws, played on the fears of a vulnerable woman, and groomed her brother to help him get access, is foul journalism. Not only was it unethical, and potentially criminal, they could be so easily refuted that they could only ever destroy the trust of the princess and undermine the credibility, not only of the reporter, but the organisation he worked for. Every journalist in the world will, now, have to overcome what he did when seeking an interview with almost anyone.The Press are enjoying kicking the BBC, which kicked them so hard over phone-hacking. Politicians are relishing the chance to haul Auntie over her own coals, for once. And there are two princes who find it easy to criticise media coverage, and harder to talk about the wearing of seatbelts. As a result, there are a lot of things in Lord Dysonaposs report into the affair not getting the attention they should - and quite a lot thataposs been forgotten entirely. . Princess Diana was desperate to do an interview  Diana officially separated from Prince Charles in December , following a shocking biography by Andrew Morton which detailed her bulimia, personal misery, and her husbandaposs affair with Camilla Parker-Bowles. In March the following year, Dyson found that she rejected the offer of a BBC interview with Sue Lawley.Then in June , her husband gave an ITV interview to Jonathan Dimbleby in which he admitted adultery. It was shattering and humiliating for Diana, and, the report found, she would probably have agreed to be interviewed by any experienced and reputable reporter in whom she had confidence, even without the intervention of Mr Bashir. In August  her friend Baroness Jay approached the BBC on her behalf. The suggestion was for a Panorama interview with then-diplomatic correspondent Nicholas Witchell, focusing on her charity work and future role in public le. Dyson writes that: It is clear that Princess Diana was now very keen to talk to the BBC. Later that month, Dianaaposs staff were organising a meeting with Witchell and she wrote a memo saying I am v keen to be in this meeting and asking what time it would be. Panorama bosses switched Witchell for Bashir. Lord Dyson does not say why, nor whether it derailed the project, or made no dference. He also does not explain why, when the princess was already negotiating with Panorama , Bashir approached her brother to gain access.But itaposs clear that,she didnapost talk to Bashir, sheaposd have talked to someone . . The Panorama interview did not cause Dianaaposs orce  In his statement yesterday, Prince William said: The interview was a major contribution to making my parentsapos relationship worse.By the time the interview aired, his parents had each conducted multiple affairs his mother had attempted suicide she had co-operated extensively with Morton on his book, revealing her bulimia and naming Camilla Parker-Bowles she and her husband had both fed stories to favoured journalists secret tapes of her being called aposSquidgyapos, and her husband fantasising about being Camillaaposs tampon, had been leaked to the Press and aired on premium-rate phone lines and the Prime Minister had announced the Walesapos official separation three years earlier.And of course, her husband had allowed Jonathan Dimbleby more than a year of access for a documentary in which he admitted cheating, trashed his parents, and was seen chatting to his geraniums.It is hard to see how the Panorama interview could possibly have made that marriage any worse. It would always have led to orce, but perhaps one that was slightly less embarrassing to the young prince.. Princess Diana was paranoid long before she met Bashir  Prince William said the interview with Diana contributed signicantly to her fear, paranoia, and isolation. The Dyson report is clear that Bashir met her for the first time on September , , and found that he had shown her brother fake bank statements to convince him that household staff were selling information to the Press and the security services. There were claims, too, that some royal reporters were taking bribes, that cars, phones, and watches were bugged, and a lie that Royal nanny Tiggy Legge-Bourke had an abortion.Yet by the time of the interview, Diana had been under the influence of crackpot clairvoyants for years. They subsequently were sources of hundreds of newspaper articles, wrote books, and even now claim to be speaking to Diana in the afterle. Dyson found that two years earlier, in , Diana had written to her butler Paul Burrell that Charles was in love with Tiggy.He also found that, in his meetings with Bashir, Charles Spencer had revealed that he had taken out an injunction against a former staff member over fears he was selling stories about his family. And on October , , Diana had a meeting with her personal lawyer Lord Mishcon in which she made a series of paranoid claims. Dyson reveals a note made at the time, which says: Efforts would be madenot to get rid of her , now and then, then at least to see that she was so injured or damaged as to be declared unbalanced. She was convinced that there was a conspiracy. Dyson concludes: I am satisfied that, by the time of the meeting, Princess Diana had paranoid fears about ious things including that she was being spied on and was in danger of her le. Bashir undeniably played on her fears, perhaps made them worse - but they were pretty bad before he showed up. . The interview did not lead to her death in a Paris car crash  The fallout from the interview was so bad that the Queen urged Charles and Diana to orce. During talks, the princess offered to give up the title of Her Royal Highness, reportedly infor more personal freedom. She also dropped her Royal protection, which she had come to distrust as her paranoia grew. But with her brother injuncting his own staff, and Royal households notoriously leaky, she would probably always have suspected her bodyguards. Journalists have frequent, unofficial contact with police officers for all sorts of reasons - with Royalty, itaposs usually so the police know whoaposs a genuine reporter and whoaposs a nutter. A paranoid Diana could easily have misconstrued that as a betrayal. Her brother said he draws a line between the interview and her death. When she died two years later, she was without any form of real protection, he said. Former editor Andrew Neil writes today that, had the BBC admitted what had happened in its first investigation in , she might have realised that the aposEstablishmentapos was not out to get her and that there was no need to cut herself off entirely from it. Butyou remove Bashir and his lies, you still have years of misery, mistrust, and fury at the Royals who left her to tumble down the stairs, cut her wrists, and struggle with the effects of extreme anxiety and massive media attention.And had she orced Charles but kept her taxpayer-funded protection, as she travelled to UN conferences and African minefields, used Mediterranean yachts and pop starsapos mansions, dated heart surgeons and playboys, there would have been outrage in the media, in Parliament, and among the public that an ex-Royal was still costing millions. She would have been under huge pressure to drop it and fund it herself as soon as she stepped back from Royal duties, because thataposs exactly what happened to Harry last year.The chances of her retaining that security when she died in August , a full year after the orce was complete, is next to non-existent. . Nothing has changed or looks likely to  Prince Harry said: Our mother lost her le because of this, and nothing has changed. Well, yes and no. Diana was vulnerable from childhood, treated horrically by many of those that she loved, and betrayed by many of those she trusted. She was a global icon of womanhood, and as such was repeatedly exploited and mistreated by men. Her chances of a happy old age were as slim as those of Marilyn Monroe, or Anne Boleyn. We are unable to say it, because a young girl marrying a prince is supposed to be the answer to everything, but Diana was a tragedy waiting to happen. But heaposs right in that nothing has changed. Journalists have always been excellent at snfing out things that smell bad, like foxes whoaposve had a whf of raw chicken. They had Bashir and his lies early on, and  years later they have persisted to get the BBC and its cover-up, too. That cover-up was conducted by idiots, who had the journalistic nose of Lord Voldemort. Knowing that Bashir had lied to them  times, they did not smell a rat and instead called him a man of integrity. Lord Dyson found him to be incredible, unreliable, and, in some cases, dishonest - a summing up that will be in his obituary. It seems that the more useless a person is, the higher in any organisation they are promoted. In this case Bashiraposs boss Tony Hall made it all the way to Director-General. Royals are still determined to give interviews. Diana managed two in her entire le, but her youngest son has given so many people have perhaps not noticed that in his latest heaposs accused the Royal Family of total neglect, the same as his mother did quarter of a century ago, and with signicantly less impact.Yet the Royals are still rewriting history as it suits, finding it easier to attack the media that they are desperate to speak to for saying things they donapost want to hear. Harry and William have every right to criticise Bashir and the BBC, and to be furious over the loss of their mother and her unhappiness. But her death was due to a thousand things that went wrong over decades. The last two to which she fell victim were a drugged and drunk driver, and not wearing a seatbelt, something which in  cost  lives in the UK. Her sons have yet to find the time to campaign on either of these things.Nothing has changed. A sly creep committed a foul act with absolutely no reason to do so, an organisation run by prats protected itself in the short-term at the expense of its reputation in the long-term, and a complicated woman exploited all her le has been exploited, yet again. The same things will happen today, and tomorrow, in any given group of humans. Judging from the fact it has  separate inquiries underway into unethical behaviour, lies and institutional failures, itaposs happening right now in Downing Street.While bashing Bashir, we ignore the fundamental issue which is the utterly toxic way Royal women are treated, an issue raised by Boudica, Empress Matilda, and every single queen and princess since. Lying about that wonapost make it go away. And it is proof of what every journalist knows is true: what they donapost tell you is the story.

Nicola Sturgeon today announced new travel restrictions linked to particularly serious outbreaks of the Indian iant in England. From Monday, travel restrictions will be imposed between Scotland the three local authority areas - Bedford, Bolton and Blackburn and Darwin. The First Minister said: If you are planning to visit these areas in the next few days please consider whether you need to make your visit or whether it can be delayed. She said it was hoped these rules would not be in place for very long, but added they were a further way of helping us reduce the risk that any more of this new iant comes into Scotland while we are trying to deal with outbreaks of it we have right now.Ms Sturgeon said it makes more sense to review coronavirus restrictions on a weekly basis, after announcing Glasgow will be the only area to remain in Level  of Scotlandaposs measures.Speaking at a Scottish Government coronavirus briefing on Friday, the First Minister said authorities are fairly certain the increase in cases in the city is being driven by the Indian iant - referred to by Ms Sturgeon as April- - with extensive public health measures deployed over the past  days.  The number of cases per , people in Glasgow has increased from  last week to . in the seven days to May . East Renfrewshire, which earlier this week had a higher seven-day average rate of cases than Glasgow, will remain in Level . Ms Sturgeon also said improvements in Moray mean it can join the rest of mainland Scotland in Level  on Saturday. Infection levels in Moray, in the north-east of Scotland, are down from  cases per , people last week to , with test positivity falling from .% to .%. In Level , people can hug and meet indoors - subject to restrictions - travel across the UK and overseas, and hospitality venues can open later than in Level  and serve alcohol indoors. Ms Sturgeon said the total number of cases in East Renfrewshire is signicantly smaller than in Glasgow, with only  on Thursday compared to  in the city, and could be traced to specic household clusters.  Asked whether Glasgow could face restrictions for a longer period because of the numbers, she said: The reason Iaposm not saying weaposll come back in three weeks now is I hope the overall duration of these higher level restrictions in Glasgow will be shorter than was the case earlier this year and at the tail end of last year. I think it actually makes more sense to review on a weekly basis, because we donapost want to keep Glasgow in higher level restrictions any longer than is necessary... because of the scale of the public health interventions that we have in deployment right now. And in determining where to put travel restrictions we just have to be mindful of peopleaposs travel patterns - people might live in the south side of Glasgow but in the city they donapost necessarily stay in the south side of Glasgow all the time because they work where and vice versa. Welcoming the changes in Moray, Chris Littlejohn, NHS Grampian deputy director of public health, said: I have no doubt this will be incredibly welcome news for the people of Moray. Bringing case numbers back down has been a community effort. Public bodies like the NHS and local councils can put in every measure we like, but without community support they will not make the same dference. Thank-you to everyone in the area for all that they have done. I hope the behaviour we have seen in Moray becomes a habit for people, not just there, but across the Grampian region. The death toll under this daily measure - of people who first tested positive for the virus within the previous  days - remains at ,. The daily test positivity rate was .%, up from .% the previous day. There were  people in hospital on Thursday with recently confirmed Covid-, down two from the previous day, and of these four people were in intensive care, down one from the day before.FOLLOW USMirrorPoliticsFollow @MirrorPoliticsCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnNicola SturgeonBoris JohnsonNHSScottish GovernmentHospitalsPoliticsCoronavirus"},{"url":null,"title":"voice mirror bashir disgrace should","story":"NewsopinionVoice of the Mirror: Bashir disgrace should not tarnish BBC but it must never repeatThe BBC still strives to deliver impartial journalism and Martin Bashir’s personal ignominy should not be allowed to tarnish the whole of the corporation - which must ensure that such a situation can never happen againmirrorShareCommentsByVoice of the Mirror:,  MAY Newsopinionthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soonCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror video prince-william-panorama-interview-holds-,customFields:,enableJWPlayer:true,jwPlayerSiteID:hPpIvH,jwPlayerMediaID:xCadRV,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : #

Bashir’s deceitful and unethical behaviour was an abuse of his position and a clear breach of the high journalistic standards on which his former employer prides itself. The BBC then added to the disgrace by failing to investigate properly the underhand tactics used to land the  interview. The whole sorry affair has caused understandable anguish for the late Princess’s family and friends. Earl Spencer has claimed there is a link between the programme and his sister’s death two years later.  The BBC has rightly apologised but its expressions of remorse will count for nothing unless it ensures that such a situation can never happen again. Bashir’s reputation rightly lies in tatters but his personal ignominy should not be allowed to tarnish the whole corporation, which still strives to deliver impartial journalism. Buck passers The Government has set aside £billion for the Covid test and trace system. Despite the eye-watering amount lavished, the programme is still not working properly.  We now learn that technical glitches were partly responsible for the spread of the Indian iant, with councils unable to respond to the outbreak because they could not access the data on positive tests in their area. Yet earlier this week, Health Secretary Matt Hancock implied it was the failure of people to get vaccinated that was behind the surge. This now comes across as an attempt to sht the blame for the Government’s own failings. Instead of trying to pass the buck, ministers should start taking some responsibility.

And when full-time mum Katherine, , who hit on the tattoo idea for Bennyaposs th birthday, posted a picture of the inking on Facebook to mark World Downaposs Syndrome Day on March  this year, the response was overwhelming.Katherine, of Newcastle-upon-Tyne, Tyne and Wear, said: People were saying it was stunning artwork. It was great to get nice feedback. William is buried nearby with my mum Mary Cowey, who passed away aged  from cancer in . I just said straight away, aposI want William with my mumapos - thataposs where he had to be. We kept putting off engraving his name on the headstone. We will have to do it this year after the response to the tattoo and with Covid causing people so much heartache.  Fuel company delivery driver Benny - who has two adult children, Kayleigh, , who was a travel agent and chef Daniel, , from his first marriage - had a vasectomy at , thinking he did not want any more children. Then he met Katherine in  and had it reversed a year later. Despite being told he only had a  per cent chance of fathering another child, he and Katherine had four children who survived - twins Josh and Steph, , Cameron, , Hannah, , and Alexander, four, together - as well as tragic William and four miscarried babies. And a more loving father you could not find, according to Katherine, who came up with the idea of the th birthday tattoo, because he was still finding it so hard to come to terms with all the loss - particularly, when it came to William. She said: “He wanted something so he could feel close to William forever.  We have a little memorial patch in our garden and a cherub statue, but he wanted something . We decided on the tattoo - but it took an awfully long time to complete, as we would run out of money and have to stop, save up, and then Kayley would carry on with it when we could afford some more. “But she was very kind, because when she heard our story about our losses she agreed to do it for a reduced price of £,, when she normally charges £ a day. He had quite a lot of long sessions. It also has to heal between sittings so it took about six months to complete from start to finish. Katherine had four miscarriages before William died on November , . While they are represented by stars on the tattoo, it also shows her cradling “rainbow baby” Alexander - who was born after her losses - and her four older children looking up at William as an angel in the sky at sunset, as well as Bennyaposs two eldest children.  When William was born, the couple regarded him as their “miracle” baby after the miscarriages, which were for unknown reasons. But he was suffering from a “double bubble,” where his bowel was not joining his stomach, as well as having a hole in his heart. Katherine said: “I was already  weeks pregnant when a routine scan first picked up the double bubble, but even then no one mentioned Down’s Syndrome. “I googled it and saw the two things often came together, so then I had a test and the Down’s was confirmed. “The doctors offered to terminate the pregnancy and said I was allowed that up until labour. I was obviously devastated and cried for days, as I didn’t know anything about Down’s syndrome.  “But then people with children with Downaposs started contacting me and when I met one of them, I realised it didn’t matter. I wanted to have William and it wouldn’t make any dference to how much I loved him and cared for him.” Despite being induced a week early at  weeks, he was Katherine’s biggest baby, weighing lb oz. But at one day old, William had to have surgery on his bowel. Then four days later, when a problem developed with a heart valve, he had an emergency heart operation. Five days later he was transferred from the Royal Victoria Infirmary in Newcastle to Leeds General Infirmary - while Benny had to stay in Newcastle to look after the other children.  Soon after, William needed more surgery on the hole in his heart, but he passed away just three days before his operation was due, when his organs shut down. His parents had to register his birth and his death on the same day. Despite going on to have so many children together, at first Katherine and Benny could not fall pregnant. She said: “To our delight, after  months of trying, and six weeks after we got married, I got pregnant with twins Josh and Steph, who we had in . Then we had Cameron after that and Hannah in . “I didn’t get pregnant again, even though we weren’t using contraceptive, but we knew there had been a complication when Benny had his vasectomy reversed, so we thought that was it. “Then I suddenly fell pregnant out of the blue by accident, which led to my first miscarriage at  weeks. Then I lost twins at  and  weeks, and a fourth baby at  weeks. All of them had appeared healthy at the  week scans.  “Even though I hadn’t wanted more than four children, with each miscarriage, I became more determined to have another healthy baby. “Then William came along seven years after my fourth child, Hannah.” Overcome with grief after William passed, the couple vowed to try for one more child and were blessed  months later with Alexander in December . Katherine said: “Now we are one big happy family together. We go on holidays with Benny’s eldest daughter, Kayleigh and her children, who are  and  months. We were even pregnant at the same time. But William is forever in our minds. “We have a patch in our garden dedicated to him with a cherub statue and a plaque that says ‘William’s Garden’. “He is also buried with my mum with another cherub, but we are now planning to have the headstone engraved with a special message for him.  “Bennyaposs tattoo sums up our family and we love it, but because of the British weather hardly anyone gets to see it as he doesn’t get his shirt off.“I get more comments for my tattoo of just a fairy, mushrooms and butterfly, which goes from my arm to my back. But when Benny does show it occasionally, people just go, ‘Wow’.” Meanwhile, Benny will never forget the son he loved and lost and will forever cherish the tattoo he has as a permanent reminder. He said: “People have been so kind to us. One Christmas we had  motorbikes turn up with the bikers dressed as Santas, bringing dozens of presents for our four children, because they heard what had happened with William after one of my familyaposs friends told his mates in the Easy Riders North-East group. “I would cry alone after losing him and I wondered what he would be like. But now I hope he is looking at my back now and thinking, ‘Daddy did that for me.aposFOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnTattoos"},{"url":null,"title":"my narcolepsy caused paralysis hallucinations","story":"NewsMy narcolepsy caused paralysis and hallucinations - but working out gave me my le backEXCLUSIVE: Belle Hutt, , dropped out of school due to bullying after she was diagnosed with narcolepsy.

Your information will be used in accordance with ourPrivacy Notice.Thank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeBelle Hutt was studying for her GCSEs when she began struggling to stay awake in class. Despite getting a full night’s sleep, she was battling with an urge to close her eyes and snooze. “I had no idea what it was, so I’d just get up and go to the loo to wake up. Then I’d come back and be fine,” she told The Mirror. Over time, the bouts of exhaustion became more frequent, until eventually they were happening every day. Things came to a head when Belle was  and something strange happened in a biology exam. “In the middle of the exam I started to write a note out to my dad in perfect handwriting. I didn’t even realise I was doing it,” she explained.  “It was like I was dreaming before I’d even shut my eyes.” Later, Belle went home and told her worried mum, Debbie, what had happened. Meanwhile, she was still having daily sleep attacks and struggling to stay awake during the day. As her th birthday approached, Belle was getting ready to learn how to drive and had taken her theory test in anticipation. But Debbie was concerned. “My Mum wanted me to see a doctor before I got behind the wheel as she wasn’t comfortable with me driving,” Belle said. After seeing her GP, the teen was advised to go to bed earlier and stop looking at her phone late at night. “That didn’t seem right to me - I was already going to bed so early because I was exhausted,” she said.  In time, she was referred to a sleep specialist. After several tests, Belle was diagnosed with severe narcolepsy, a chronic sleep disorder. As the doctors explained the diagnosis, Debbie asked what could be done to cure the condition. “The doctors bluntly said: ‘There’s no cure. It’ll only get worse’,” Belle recalled. As her symptoms worsened, she noticed people making fun of her. “I was always the first to fall asleep at parties so people would draw on my face and do silly things like that. “After a while I stopped going to parties. I didn’t even worry about missing out because I was so exhausted.” In time, the bullying became so bad that Belle decided to leave school. By now, she was having sleep attacks between three and four times a day. Instead of allowing herself to nap, Belle fought the urge to fall asleep. But this brought on hallucinations and cataplexy. Cataplexy, commonly associated with narcolepsy, is a sudden loss of muscle strength triggered by an intense emotion such as laughter.  “It would only last for a few seconds, but sometimes I just wouldn’t be able to talk,” she explained. Perhaps the most frightening symptom Belle experienced was hallucinations when she was wide awake. “I’d be at home alone and I’d hear people open my front door, walk up the stairs and walk into my bedroom. I’d see them looking at me. It was so real,” she told The Mirror. “Because I was so scared, that would trigger cataplexy and I wouldn’t be able to move.” For three years, Belle battled to stay awake through the sleep attacks, trying to keep active instead. Belle said: “I started personal training when I was , I just had a few clients I’d see one-to-one from the gym in our garage. “I felt like I’d never be able to work for anyone  so this was my only option.” Around the same time, she met her now-fiancé, Maikel. After three years of dating, Belle moved to Amsterdam to live with him. “I thought I wouldn’t be able to work and needed someone to look after me,” she said. But eventually, a friend told her about People’s Place Gym in the city, which was looking for fitness class instructors. “I started working there and they were so good about everything. They’d let me take mats and blankets for naps during the dayI needed them.”  After leading a few classes at the gym, Belle realised something. “I felt such an incredible buzz and I was so awake. I realised I could lead three classes a day and fit in naps in between,” she explained.Things were going well until coronavirus raged around the globe and gyms across Europe shut their doors. Instead of sitting around waiting for them to reopen, Belle took matters into her own hands, and began leading live workouts on Instagram every morning.And it’s worked wonders for her narcolepsy symptoms. “I started doing % more exercise than I was before, leading workouts every day,” she said. “Since becoming fitter and stronger, I’ve not suffered from cataplexy for about a year. It’s given me so much more control over my day.” She now runs the @BelleHuttLiveCommunity on Instagram, leading live workouts every day for more than  people who attend her classes.  She also uses her personal account @BelleHutt, which has more than , followers, to dispel common myths about narcolepsy. “People think I just need more sleep than anyone , but actually I find it hard to sleep through the night,” she told the Mirror. “I take medication at night now which helps me sleep for longer, but before that I was getting two hours of broken sleep a night.” She described narcolepsy as having a disrupted body clock, so the body gets confused about when it needs to sleep. Using her  to explain the condition, she also wants to tackle parody depictions of the sleep disorder. “I’ve seen comedy characters who have narcolepsy as people who just fall over and sleep in the middle of the day, and that’s really not what it is,” she explained. After discovering the wonders of regular exercise, Belle wants to inspire people to move their bodies for their own mental wellbeing. “So many people label exercise as for fat loss, but I want people to realise it’s great for your mental health. “You don’t have to be at the gym, or even wearing trainers. You can be dancing around the living room in jeansyou want, but it feels so great to move your body.”FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnPersonal trainerBullyingFitness"},{"url":null,"title":"aristocrat who lost stately home","story":"NewsAristocrat who lost stately home and his family fortune now cant afford to insure carDavid Brudenell-Bruce, the Earl of Cardigan and descended from Henry VIIIs we Jane Seymour, became embroiled in a row with trustees of the ,-acre Savernake Estate in WiltshiremirrorShareCommentsByOllie Buckley:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY NewsBrudenell-Bruce, , is the Earl of Cardigan and descended from Henry VIIIs we Jane Seymour \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

David Brudenell-Bruce, , is the Earl of Cardigan and descended from Henry VIIIaposs we Jane Seymour. He lost his £ million fortune and -bed stately pile - the ,-acre Savernake Estate in Wiltshire - after a row with trustees. The earl, the estranged father of The  Voice star Bo Bruce, was at one point forced to live in a run-down farmhouse on the estate. The spat meant he even ended up having to wash in his local swimming pool and claim benefits.Got a story  Email webnews@mirror. Now the Old Etonian has withdrawn his appeal against a recent driving ban after a judge warned his disqualication could go up or down. He was due to appeal a three-month driving ban imposed after he was convicted of doing mph above the speed limit in an uninsured Lexus in Marlborough on November , . Speaking outside Swindon crown court on Thursday he said he had not been able to afford to insure the car. The earl added he felt disbelief that the court can offer me its verdict before the case even starts. Asked what he would have said to the judge in mitigation, he said: I would have explained the nightmare scenario of bringing up a seven-year-old autistic child and a mother who doesnapost drive and they are both entirely dependent upon me.  Itaposs a nightmare. Thereaposs no public transport in the forest. When I came back from the first hearing I got as far as Marlborough, as Iaposm going to do now on the X bus from the bus station, [and] rang up to get a taxi up to Savernake. The one taxi firm said nothing at all today, one said it would be three hours. You canapost tell a seven year old girl with dficulties that thereaposs going to be a three hour wait. The earl was caught by police just a month after he was given six penalty points for driving an uninsured car back in . Ben Irwin, for Brudenell-Bruce, told Swindon Crown Court on Thursday that his client was withdrawing the appeal. It followed a warning from Judge Jason Taylor QC that the court would be looking at the sentence afresh and the disqualication could go up or down.  Judge Taylor said: It might well be we take a dim view that somebody who having been convicted of having no insurance a year later is driving again with no insurance. If he had such important family circumstances, he was on notice that he should be complying with the law because he was in a precarious position. In March, Swindon magistrates imposed eight points on the earlaposs licence - then banned him as a totter as he had accumulated more than  penalty points. But they reduced the disqualication from the typical six months to three months after the earlaposs lawyers said his family - in particular his young daughter - would face exceptional hardshiphe was banned from the roads. Following an application from prosecutor Jonathan Ransen, the bench ordered that Brudenell-Bruce, who still lives on the family estate, pay £ in costs.

The earlaposs lawyer had also previously said his client was of limited means and his legal fees were being paid for by another, who was not named in court. The Savernake Estate, which includes a stately home and Britainaposs only privately-owned forest, had been in the earlaposs family for almost , years. The legal saga began when Brudenell-Bruce - who was estate manager - left England in  after he fell ill with depression. But when he ed with his new American we, the trustees refused to give up control of the ancestral estate, sparking a bitter feud between the parties. His son Thomas had also supported the estateaposs trusteesapos plan to sell the mansion for £.million. A series of Old Master paintings of his ancestors were also sold, which trustees said was needed to clear the earlaposs £ million overdraft. The earl previously told the Times heaposd just about forgiven his son for the move. The pair agreed to run the large estate together from now on and the earl confirmed he would never sell the rest of it.FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnCourt case"},{"url":null,"title":"bbc boss said charles never","story":"NewsBBC boss said Charles will never be able to marry Camilla now after Diana PanoramaThe BBC’s head of weekly programmes Tim Gardam was criticised by Lord Dysons damning report on the infamous interview, which Prince William blames for problems between his parentsmirrorShareCommentsByKelly-Ann MillsReporter:,  MAY Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soonCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror video william-harry-condemn-bbcs-handling-,customFields:,enableJWPlayer:true,jwPlayerSiteID:hPpIvH,jwPlayerMediaID:WpWsOK,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : #

The BBC’s head of weekly programmes Tim Gardam reportedly made the comment after watching a clip before the programme was aired and watched by almost  million people around the world, according to the Daily Mail. Diana spoke for the first time of Charlesaposs affair with Camilla in the Bashir interview, famously saying: Well, there were three of us in this marriage, so it was a bit crowded. It would take years for Camilla to win over the public and become an accepted part of Charlesapos le, after he had scorned the Peopleaposs Princess. But the alleged comment turned out to be incorrect, as Charles would go on to marry Camilla in , some  years after the interview was broadcast and eight years after Diana was killed in a car crash in Paris.  Mr Gardam was criticised in Lord Dysonaposs report into the BBC scandal, which saw journalist Martin Bashir mock up bank statements in a bid to convince Princess Diana to do the interview. Lord Dyson said Mr Gardam ‘too readily accepted’ that Bashir was telling the truth. Mr Gardam, who went on to work for Channel  and is now the chief executive of the Nuffield Foundation, was also criticised for brushing off the disappearance of a graphic artists worries about missing computer disks and his ethical concerns.  Princess Dianaaposs sons have both made scathing attacks on the BBC interview with Prince William calling for it never to be aired again. Speaking after the report was published, the prince said: She was failed not just by a rogue reporter, but by leaders at the BBC who looked the other way rather than asking the tough questions.  Calling for the documentary never to be aired again, William, , said: In an era of fake news, public service broadcasting and a free press have never been more important. These failings, identied by investigative journalists, not only let my mother down, and my family down they let the public down too. Prince Harry, in a separate statement added: The ripple effect of a culture of exploitation and unethical practices ultimately took her le.

The victim, , was cycling in West Chiltington, West Sussex with his father when he was struck from behind by a Renault Twingo. Keith Vernon, , was at the wheel of the vehicle - which knocked the youngster over his handlebars and into the road. The motorist then continued to drive over the boy, police say, despite the desperate warnings of horried onlookers. Vernon ignored the pleas of the members of the public and reversed over the boy, seriously injuring him and destroying his helmet.Have you been affected by this incident  Email webnews@mirror. He then fled the scene with the bike still trapped beneath his car, it was said. Shocking pictures show the mangled remains of the car, the helmet and the bike. Emergency services raced to the incident, which occurred about .pm on October , and the boy was taken to hospital. He suffered a broken collar bone, a fractured vertebrae, a fractured pelvis, a dislocated hip and a burn covering the left side of his face. Sussex Police say he is now recovering. The force attended the address of the registered owner of the Twingo, which was discovered unattended and having mounted a kerb, with the victim’s bike still trapped beneath. Retired Vernon, of West Chiltington, was then breathalysed and found to have mcg of alcohol per ml of breath in his system. The legal limit is mcg.  He was subsequently arrested and charged with causing serious injury by dangerous driving, drink-driving and failing to stop after a road traffic collision. He pleaded guilty to the offences at Worthing magistrates’ court on February  and before appearing for sentencing at Hove crown court on May . There he was jailed for two-and-a-half years’ imprisonment and was disqualied from driving for four-and-a-half years. His sentence was reduced for his early guilty plea. Her Honour Judge Barnes said Vernon deliberately made a conscious decision to drive when drunk. She did not accept that he had not seen the cyclists, and added that he had a desire to protect himself before anyone .

The judge said she did not accept that Vernon did not know the child was under his car She also commented how any father could put himself over a child was beyond belief. She added that Vernon made the decision to go home, despite stating he was traumatised, and made no attempt to call  orto the scene. The judge also said there is no blame whatsoever to be put on the cyclists. Sergeant Richard Hornsey, formerly of the Serious Collision Investigations Unit, said: Vernon was driving home after drinking in a local pub and was over the drink-drive limit when he collided with the cyclist. This was clearly a traumatic incident for those directly involved, but it has also affected the wider community. Vernon ignored the pleas of the bystanders, which included the child’s father, and they described the wheels of the car spinning as Vernon tried to drive away while the child and the bicycle were trapped underneath. The child was wearing a cycle helmet which received signicant damage but protected him from a more serious head injury. Vernon drove for over a quarter of a mile through the village with the bicycle trapped under his car, but at no point did he stop to checkthe cyclist was still underneath, which shows a complete disregard for the safety of other road users.FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnCrime"},{"url":null,"title":"eight neighbours share 240000 lottery","story":"AdvertorialEIGHT neighbours share £, Lottery win - and reveal epic idea to celebrateThe lucky lot each won £, playing Peoples Postcode LotterymirrorShareByDave MastersDigital Commercial Editor:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY Advertorialthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soonCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror video christina-new-tredegar-street-wins-,customFields:,enableJWPlayer:true,jwPlayerSiteID:hPpIvH,jwPlayerMediaID:EsKidV,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : #

They hit the jackpot after their postcode,NP LG, in the Welsh town of New Tredegar, was drawn as a big winner.And theyaposre already planning a bumper street party to celebrate the le-changing news. Among the winners are an NHS nurse, a set of relations and a winner who recently suffered heartbreak at the hands of covid. Support worker Gareth Walbeoff, , lost his father to the pandemic in January. He said: My poor mum was having to isolate for  days, so only I could go to console her, none of the other family could go. “Then she unfortunately fell and broke her back, she’s up and about now and my niece is taking her to a hospital appointment today. My niece is really good to mum, I couldn’t manage without her. She’s got three children and my nephew has a little girl as well. What I’m going to do is pay for all these kids to have a good holiday in a big -star, luxury caravan in Tenby for two weeks!  He also congratulated his neighbours and added: “In this street we all are like one big family. When it’s safe to do so we’re going to have one hell of a street party!”Gareth wasn’t the only member of his family to get a call from lottery ambassador Danyl Johnson . One of the other winners was -year-old Alan Vaughan whose partner, Nicola, is Gareth’s cousin.Another winner from the street was NHS nurse Tina Watkinswho learned of her windfall while on a break at work. As the cheque was revealed, the -year-old clapped with joy and said: “Woo!  grand! Oh that’s fantastic, thank you very much!” Her co-workers cheered on hearing the total and Tina said she would buy her manager, who was holding Tina’s camera phone over the call, ‘a nice big cake.’ Tina already had plans for some of her winnings: She added: “I’ve got a house renovation going on, so I can plough it into that and buy my son a car. What a lovely surprise, I can finish off what I want to do with the house without having to save. “Maybe a holiday next year. Our holiday to Fuerteventura was cancelled this year, but we might go further afield now.” People’s Postcode Lottery ambassador Danyl Johnson sent his congratulations to all the winners. He said: “What a fantastic surprise for our winners in New Tredegar! I can tell it is a really close community, so I was thrilled to bring this great news. “Congratulations to them and all our other winners today, I’m sure they’ll enjoy their winnings.” Everyday throughout the April draws one postcode was announced as a £, prize winner.

It is the first saliva-based PCR test to reportedly be given approval for holidaymakers.HALO Founder Jonathan Biles told the Sun: “With our new Day  and  test service, we will provide British travellers with a painless, safe, reliable and cost-effective way to approach travel.“Our new Day  and  testing service will continue our relentless focus on quality.

The Department of Health and Social Care did not comment when contacted by The Mirror. This comes as results of a University of Oxford trial show a comprehensive testing system is key to resuming international travel. The experiment, which involved data from almost  travellers on flights from the US to Heathrow, also showed passengers would be happy to pay for their own tests.  Researchers at the Oxford Internet Instituteused flights operated by British Airways and American Airlines for the trial, which took place between November  and March . Travellers took a PCR test  hours before departure, a LAMP test upon arrival at Heathrow - a type which s results more quickly than the PCR - and a third PCR taken three to five days after ing. According to the researchers, just one per cent of travellers who took the first PCR tested positive and so did not travel, and none of those who touched down in the US tested positive, suggesting the first test was effective. Of the travellers who took the third test after arriving in the UK, .% of travellers tested positive. In a joint statement on the findings, American Airlines, British Airways and oneworld said: The trial findings underline the important role that testing can play in the safe reopening of international travel, including hugely signicant routes between the US and UK.  The airlines said they would be ready to partner with governments to offer affordable testing options, adding the study further reinforces that customers are willing to undergo testing as an alternative to quarantine. Some .% of travellers said they were happy to adhere to testing requirements as an alternative to quarantine after international travel and % were prepared to pay for affordable testing. The majority were prepared to pay £ or less for each test, and % said they would pay more than £. Findings of the Oxford study will be shared with governments and stakeholders. Professor Philip Howard, professor of internet studies at the OII, said: As many countries make progress on vaccinating their citizens the debate over reopening travel safely is becoming increasingly important.

The animal group which led the original pet killing investigation - SNARL - is looking into the slaying which they believe is linked to the Croydon Cat Killer. Katherine, a student beautician from Catford, Lewisham, said: Iaposd be able to managehe had died in a normal way, but this is really disturbing. Tonysaid the head and tail are usually brought back a week or so later. Iaposm constantly looking for them. I canapost put him to rest until Iaposve found all his body. I donapost think Iaposll ever come to terms with this.  Please keep your cats in at night and be extra vigilant - especially at the moment when there is a killer around. I would hate for anybody  to go through the same pain. This killer has to be found. politan Police spent over £, and , hours during their investigation into the cat deaths, but in  they ruled the serial cat killer did not exist and the mutilations were caused by foxes. No evidence of human involvement was found in any of the reported cases and there was no CCTV footage, identiable patterns, forensic leads or witnesses. CCTV footage that was recovered showed foxes carrying bodies or body parts of cats.  Tony Jenkins, founder of South Norwood Animal Rescue and Liberty, collected the pet, and then contacted Katherine as he had heard about her search for Theo. The heartbroken cat owner identied her cat from photos, due to his distinctive markings. The woman then called the police and said they were kind to her, but could not look into Theoaposs death due to a lack of CCTV and because the investigation had closed. She said: When Tony called back my heart just sank. Tony said the way Theo was killed and the fact that his head and tale were missing linked Theo to the Croydon Cat Killer.  It is so clearly not a road traffic accident or foxes. Foxes would not take the heads and bring them back. There would be more blood, claw marks or teeth marks. If a cat was hit by a car you would see dirt and broken bones. Tony is sure that cats are mutilated with knives. There arenapost foxes walking around with knives - I hope not anyway. I suffer with anxiety and depression. Theo really helped me get away from my worries and fears. I canapost look at photos of him and I keep waiting for him to come home. Itaposs just so horrible. Itaposs known that murderers have started off by hurting animals, and move to humans when thataposs no longer gratying. Itaposs only a matter of time.  Tony,  from Croydon, London, is a retired project coordinator and is now a full-time animal rescuer and investigator. He said: The conclusion of the investigation doesnapost explain why these are predominantly happening in the southeast of England but we have cars and foxes over the whole of the UK. There was no decrease in these killings in lockdown when there were less cars on the road. The investigation only did  post-mortems because they are expensive. They closed it after finding fox DNA on five bodies, and puncture marks on five, and because CCTV footage showed a fox carrying a cat. Yes foxes do scavenge dead cats, but they would take the body because they would most likely need to feed a family. Vets that examined bodies concluded the cuts were made with a kne and by the same person.  Tony said he usually posts a description on the SNARL Facebook page whenever a mutilated cat is found and owners of pets contact him.Because most of the dead and mutilated cats are microchipped, it is easy to match them with owners, he said. Otherwise, he uses details such as markings on their bodies to identy the cats from ownersapos photographs. Some people say these are just cats, Tony added, but for the owners itaposs as devastating as losing a member of the family. Previous reports from cat owners and press suggest these killings have been going on for around  years. An earlier investigation in  was closed down in . The apparent slaying of Katherineaposs Theo comes after MP for Carshalton and Wallington, Elliot Colburn, called for the Met to reopen its investigation.

It is thought that people had initially gathered to remember Ethan Powell, , who passed away suddenly on Tuesday. The cause of the local manaposs death is yet to be established - as is the spark for the chaotic scenes on Thursday. Video shows a group of people with their hoods up sending a car flying down a hill in the cityaposs Mayhill area. Have you been affected by this incident  Email webnews@mirror.  The motor appears to have been pushed towards another torched vehicle, with onlookers cheering as it crashes into a wall. Swanseaaposs council leader has described those involved as yobs and said the behaviour was absolutely disgusting. South Wales Police has pledged to take action to identy the offenders after the riots, said to have involved hundreds of people. The forceaposs chief constable Jeremy Vaughan said: Saddened and furious at events in Swansea last night. So many families will have been tormented by those responsible, rest assured we will stop at nothing to find them.  We will work hard with others to help and support local residents who deserve better than this. Walesapos First Minister Mark Drakeford also condemned the violence. He said: The violent scenes in Swansea last night were completely unacceptable and will not be tolerated anywhere in Wales. Thank you [South Wales Police] for bringing the situation under control and continuing to monitor it closely this morning.  Locals had been urged to stay indoors while police worked to bring the incident to a safe conclusion. Some have since reported bricks being thrown through their windows by the gathered yobs - forcing to sit in their houses in fear. South Wales Police said on Facebook that the disorder had been contained in the early hours of Friday. Superintendent Tim Morgan said those involved can expect to face robust action.

But the situation then escalated into violence, criminal damage and a wanton disregard for public safety, he said. A relative of Mr Powell has also slammed the violent scenes and those who took part. They told WalesOnline: He would have been heartbroken to have seen what happened. He would have been trying to stop it - it is not something he would have wanted to see. We canapost understand why there were people there laughing. To see that going on in Ethanaposs name is devastating. Friends have organised three memorial balloon release events to popular Mr Powell, including one this coming weekend.FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnTeenagersCrime"},{"url":null,"title":"terrified boy asks are going","story":"NewsTerried boy asks are we going to die mummy  as  yobs set cars on fire at vigilA vigil held for Ethan Powell, who collapsed and died on Tuesday evening aged just , turned into a riot with cars torched and motors sent freewheeling down a hillmirrorShareCommentsByAdam AspinallNews reporterMilo BoydReporter:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soonCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror video swansea-riots-chaos-vigil-turns-,customFields:,enableJWPlayer:true,jwPlayerSiteID:hPpIvH,jwPlayerMediaID:Rylfndrl,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : #

The vigil was being held for Ethan Powell, who collapsed and died on Tuesday evening aged just . After a balloon release on Thursday, thugs ran amok torching cars and throwing bricks through windows. Ethan’s cousin Tegan Davies said the first part of the vigil was “brilliant”. But she said of the violence that erupted in the Mayhill area of Swansea: “This has gone way out of hand! “I know Ethan loved an argument with the police but this has gone next level, kids and people living by are absolutely petried.  The videos I’ve been sent are disgusting, I know Ethan would never have taken it this far. “Bikes and balloons we said, not a f***ing riot!” One mum who asked not to be named said the terrying riot had left her children deeply scared.“It was terrying, she told The Sun. My six-year-old boy asked mewe were all going to die. My -year-old daughter says she never wants to spend another night here.  A brick was thrown through her window and a car was torched outside her home. One video of the mayhem shows yobs sending a car freewheeling down a road. Other rioters set cars on fire. Ethan collapsed hours after watching Swansea City’s playoff game against Barnsley on television with his grandad. His cause of death has yet to be confirmed. Local Sylvie Bennett said: “I am shocked at the disrespect shown to Ethan Powell. “He wouldn’t want this and neither do his family want this. So know that Swansea is not proud of you as you are all a disgrace.  “You have not done him proud you have dishonoured him. You’re the scum of the earth.” First Minister of Wales Mark Drakeford condemned the “completely unacceptable” scenes that would “not be tolerated anywhere in Wales”. He thanked South Wales Police “for bringing the situation under control and continuing to monitor”. Chief Constable Jeremy Vaughan said the force would “stop at nothing” to find the offenders. He added in a tweet: “Saddened and furious at events in Swansea last night. “So many families will have been tormented by those responsible, rest assured we... will work hard with others to help and support local residents, who deserve better than this.” Local Welsh Parliament member Tom Gfard called the scenes “disturbing”. Welsh Secretary Simon Hart said: “A tough night for the police dealing with such reckless behaviour.

I don’t knowthey’re dead or alive.” This is what one Uyghur living in the UK, a mum-of-three who can’t be named for her own safety, told the Mirror. This is a common story amongst Uyghur Muslims living in the UK, whose relatives back in China are victim to what many have called a genocide. Imprisoned in camps, they are made to learn Chinese history, the language and watch state-produced broadcasts, documentaries and speeches by leading politicians as a part of their ‘re-education’. Women are subject to forcible sterilisation and endemic rape and many Uyghur Muslims are sent off for forced labour. Current estimates are that there are more than one million people in these camps, and analysis of satellite images suggests there are at least  camps. The Chinese Communist Party announced a policy in  as a part of “a people’s war on terror” after a terror attack that the authorities blamed on Uyghur Muslims. This policy is believed to have led to the creation of ‘aposvocational education and training camps in the Xinjiang province in the west of China.  The Chinese government says it’s clamping down on terrorism and separatism in the region and that these camps help assimilate Uyghur Muslims and other minorities. Uyghur Muslims are often incarcerated for something as simple as outwardly practising Islam, having WhatsApp on their phone, or travelling abroad. None of the Uyghur Muslims who live in the UK and spoke to the Mirror can be named for their own safety. One Uyghur Muslim told the Mirror: “My relatives are detained and I don’t want to speak in case they get punished.” In the UK, Uyghur Muslims live in fear for loved ones, cut off from them, not knowingthey’re dead or alive, in the camps or at home. Here is what some of them told us:  Lost Family“I speak to friends I’ve known - years, and they’re still really shocked I can’t contact my parents. For them it’s a story they read on the news, not something that happens to us,” the mum-of-three, who hasn’t heard from her parents since , said. She told the Mirror the story of when she last heard from her parents. “I sent money for a mother’s day gt for my mum. But she was telling me ‘don’t send anything, don’t send anything we’re fineapos. “But as her child I wanted to thank my mum. I sent the money, and my brother went to the bank to get the money.  “I didn’t know what was going on, or why my mum was saying ‘don’t send me anything’ and after I sent money and my brother collected it he disappeared for three days. “I called and askedthey’d got the money and they said ‘don’t talk about it’. Their voice and everything was dferent. I asked why and my mum started crying. She said it was only after asking her sister that she was told what had happened. Her brother had been arrested and interrogated by the Chinese government after collecting the money. After three days of questioning, a lot of the questioning about her and why she was sending him money, he was released and her mother told her never to ring her brother again. This happened in March , and by June her family’s landlines were disconnected and she hasn’t heard from then since. Something as simple as sending money or gts in and out of China, or travelling has led to many being arrested, interrogated and put into the camps. She doesn’t knowthey’re dead or alive, free or in camps and she is far from the only one. This was a common story amongst Uyghur Muslims in the UK - almost all of those the Mirror spoke to hadnapost heard from their family in years.  A police state One doctor who came to the UK in the last few years is no stranger to this. “Don’t go back to your hometown, we are going to college, don’t try to find us, we will find you in the future,” his parents told him. “When she said college,” he told the Mirror, “she meant the camps.” This was March ,  and he hasn’t heard from them since and doesn’t even knowthey’re dead or alive.  In August , before he left his home city to begin his medical training, he took a picture outside his mosque - something reminiscent of any student taking one last picture of their home town before leaving for university. He was taken to a police station and held there for a week, during which he was interrogated and questioned repeatedly on why they had taken the picture. It is outwards shows of adherence to Islam like this that sees Uyghur Muslims punished in their homeland. Growing up, he told the Mirror how police visits had been a regular occurrence. “From - my grandfather was arrested again and again because he was a very rich Muslim man, he said. “My uncle left China, and every year police would come to our home three or four times a year and ask my mother where is her brother, did we have contact with him, why didn’t he come back,” he said. When this man ed to China in , after four years away, he was arrested again. This time he was hit, spat on and slapped as they asked why he had left for Turkeyand when released, they threatened himhe spoke up. Everyday casual brutality of their relatives, and sometimes themselves, was something a number of the people we spoke to brought up. One womanaposs husband had been arrested for six months before they left in . During this time he had a nail pulled out, and was left with psychological problems that still haunt him today. He has some psychological problem and he doesn’t accept treatment for it, she said. I had nightmares. I couldnapost sleep. One college student, a young woman who grew up in Norway and then the UK, described the shock of ing to China to visit her relatives. “When I visited my relatives when I was eight, I did see a lot of pressure on them, she said. “They’ve never had passports. The police always check these families to make sure they’re not going anywhere andthey want to go to another city they have to get permission from the police. “If we want to go to another neighbourhood, there were two policemen with a gate and weapons, they’d check people, and ask where are you going, what time are you going, when will you be back, andit was okay we’d be let go. “For example the girls my age weren’t allowed to wear hijabs, police would forcibly remove the hijabs. When the police came to the house, my aunt was hiding all their religious objects, the qurans and everything. “I saw how those people were scared for their lives. If they see the police they used to be so scared, and panicked. Despite living in the UK, thousands of miles from the camps in the Xinjiang region, she said how heavily the news often hit her, how inescapable it was.  “I’m aware of what’s happening there, just recently we were hearing news of rape and I couldn’t fall asleep for days, I couldn’t concentrate, she said. “These women are being tortured in a horric way, how are my cousins and aunts being treated  What condition are they in today  I had nightmares, I couldn’t sleep. “Now slowly I’m getting back to normal. But especially the first couple of days I just lost myself. “I was in a horrible condition just listening to these news, she said. This came about after reports of systematic rape and abuse in the camps this year.Lost GenerationThe impact on those living in the UK is huge, and not just for the adults whose parents and siblings are directly affected. Their children, the younger generation, have also been hugely affected as well. During the Covid- pandemic, families have been separated, unable to hug or be with one another like never before in this country. This has rightly become a huge issue, with so many eager to hug their grandparents again. For so many young Uyghur Muslims today, however, this is just their lives, and they won’t be able to hug their grandparents, possibly ever again. One student, at one of the country’s top two universities, spoke to the Mirror about what it’s been like for her. She had only been back to China once, but even as a young child she couldn’t escape the reality of the treatment of the Uyghur Muslims.

There was a lot of hush hush in some areas, there were soldiers marching down the street. “As a child you realise something’s dferent. I don’t think I ever fully knew the extent of it though.” She always knew she was a Uyghur Muslim, but as she grew up she became increasingly aware of the true extent of what the Uyghur population in China were going through. During family gatherings, when she’d play upstairs with the rest of the children, the adults would talk about it sometimes. She said: I didn’t usually sit with the adults, but you’d come down and they’d all be in tears. “My children everyday they ask me, they’re ten and six, when can we see grandfather and grandmother  I try to explain but they don’t understand. Another said: “When my eldest hears from friends about talking to their grandparents she doesn’t understand it, she once said ‘grandma, grandpa don’t love me anymore’ I try not to let her be overwhelmed by it, but it’s so hard.” Alongside losing their family, the younger generations of Uyghur Muslims are losing their culture, their people, their history and their story.  Escape from Xinjiang But getting out for their children was a reason why so many escaped. One Uyghur Muslim businessman told us: We left from China in , I had to leave because of my second baby, the government didn’t allow us to have a second baby because of laws so we had to leave from China. Alongside the forced sterilisation and IUD implants, there are laws limiting the births of ethnic minorities in China. Like many of the other Uyghur Muslims we spoke to, he had firsthand experience of the police oppression in Xinjiang, and after leaving how it affected his family. “We want to get in touch [with his family], but once we get in touch with them they get in trouble. “Other family members I haven’t spoken to for four years, we don’t know whether they’re alive or in concentration camps. “When I was in China, I knew that two of my younger sisters were in prison, they’re under , one was sentenced for eight years and one was sentenced for six years,” he said. Like the other Uyghur Muslims who left, it was dficult due to internal policing as Uyghur Muslims need to get permission to travel. “Leaving was very hard, I had money so I was able to bribe the police officer to get a passport which was the only way out.  “It was a big risk to get the flight. We had to cover her [his we’s] body, she was eight and half months pregnant. Then two weeks after getting to Turkey, we had our second child,” he said.They werenapost the only family who had to hide their pregnancies, one woman said: “I had to hide I was pregnant, I had to wear underwear to look slim and hide being pregnant. It can cause damage for the baby but we didn’t have a choice.” They travelled for one month to get to safety in Norway. But even after leaving China, and first moving to Turkey, the first Uyghur Muslim man who spoke about hiding his weaposs pregnant belly wasn’t safe. “I remember when I was in Turkey, my mum came to visit, she was a primary school teacher and had worked for the government for  years but because she came to visit she was put into a concentration camp. “They forced my mum and sister to call me and beg me to come back, but I couldn’t, I had four children,” he said. These calls to Uyghur Muslims abroad were not uncommon.  The Mirror has seen a transcript of one such phone conversation, where a Chinese police officer from Hotan City tries to convince, and then threaten, a Uyghur Muslim into ing to China or spying for them abroad. Across the conversation, via messages and voice notes, the officer tries to befriend the Uyghur Muslim. At first they say they’ll be fine toand that they’ll be able to talk to their family, then they ask them to be their “eyes” and “ears” in the Uyghur community abroad. This is far from an unusual case - one college student in the UK told the Mirror how her family had been through a similar thing. “Basically when my dad, he had to escape from his homeland in , he ran away to Kazakhstan, and they met my mother there, but the Chinese government were pressuring the Kazak government tothe Uyghur’s to China. For that reason my parents had to escape.” Since moving to the UK, they all said they felt safer, and had received only a few phone calls between them.  Why is the world still waiting and doing nothing  “They’re killing us,” one mother said as she cried. The heartbreaking stories of losing contact with families, of not knowing whether they’re dead or alive, getting news dripped in online through social media or newspapers has become just the way of le for too many of them in UK. One mum-of-two explained how after years of searching, she’d finally heard rumours that her brother had died, but the person who told her blocked her because they felt guilty. “So now I’m trying to contact her again to find out where she learned that from and from who. “I have another two sisters, in  I heard from somebody  in the groupchat who said he knows her cousin who’s in a concentration camp. I’m trying to find out, but nobody knows,” she said. It’s not just the Uyghur Muslims but Kazakhs, Kyrgyz and other ethnic Turkic and Muslims as well who are imprisoned in the camps. Even those not imprisoned in the camp live under constant terror from the police, with checkpoints on every street, constant surveillance, ID cards, and laws discriminating against them. The Chinese government says that these camps are necessary to fight back against separatism and terrorism in the region. That they help teach the people inside and help combat poverty. But stories from within the camps simply don’t match up to this, they point towards the growing call from many, that this is genocide.An independent report by the Newlines Institute for Strategy and Policy found the Chinese governmentaposs actions violated every single provision of the UN Genocide Convention - violating just one is enough to count as genocide.

Yet in recent years, itaposs become more of a fun house - hiding an entire ball pit ideal for keeping the kids busy for a few hours. The five-bed house in Lincolnshire - said to have once been the residence of the Mayor of Grimsby - was snapped up quickly after being put up for sale for £,.

Jungle fever  Ever struggled to keep a pesky houseplant alive  Well take a leaf out of the book of Nick Wilson, who brought an entire rain forest to le in his back yard. The software salesman spent  years and £, on this incredible project after being inspired by family holidays to Cornwall in the s.  The semi-detached home in Leeds is stuffed full of ferns, bamboos and big leaf plants, and has welcomed hundreds of visitors since opening to the public. I had no idea that I liked big, thick enormous plants so much, said Nick. It was just such a dference to soft, fluffy garden plants. Itaposs definitely a blokeaposs garden.  My inspiration came from family holidays to Cornwall in the s and suddenly my back garden was overflowing with massive plants. The father and grandfather of one has since raised thousands of pounds through viewings for charities including Marie Curie and McMillan. Best bar none  Ok, so this dreamy getaway in Adelaide, Australia, is far from an ordinary home anyway, with a massive pool to relax in during those scorching summers. Nonetheless, its best feature is hidden away behind an old bank vault door - a fully-stocked pub cellar complete with a vast booze menu on the walls.  The amazing bar comes with a truly massive wine rack, beers and spirits on tap, and a jukebox in the corner. Put up for sale at around £,, the ultra-modern house features three bedrooms and - crucially after an all-night bar session - four bathrooms.  Local estate agents Harcourts Sergeant said the owners installed the vault doors especially for the secret getaway.“The business that they own, they actually install bank vault doors,” they told Real Estate.Com.Au.“That’s why they put that door in there, just as something a little bit dferent.

The stunning property also has five bathrooms, a granny flat and an attached holiday cottage, accessible through a separate door.  A spokesman for Edinburgh-based agents McEwan Fraser Legal said: “The owner was keen for the slide to go in as they felt the house had lots of things in it for the adults and they wanted to have something special for kids. “Any child will love this unique feature and will never be late for a meal again.

On a grand table in the conservatory sits a giant peacock, while deer heads and birds fill every corner of the home. The interiors are a bold mish-mash of wooden ling, vintage clocks, and animal-print wallpaper, and even the ceilings of the bedrooms look like they were painted by Michelangelo.  Said to have been inspired by the interiors of Belvoir Castle in Leicestershire, the two-bed cottage was bought last year after going on sale for £,. An online description said the home had been fully renovated and uniquely styled, featuring hand-painted wall coverings, a custom-designed kitchen and bathroom suites, reclaimed oak flooring and French polished doors. It added: The layout offers a living room with large fireplace, kitchen dining room, conservatory, two double bedrooms and a bathroom.Externally, there is a gravelled driveway with electronic gates for access and a Mediterranean style, low maintenance garden.

One bride in particular spent more than a year planning her wedding, having opted for an intimate day made up of just  guests with no kids invited, to keep costs down, as you do. But, despite meticulously planning her day down to the last detail, a spanner was thrown in the works when her sisterapossbabysitter fell through, meaning there was no one to look after her sons, aged two and five.The bride reluctantly agreed to let her nephews come to the wedding, explaining on Redditaposs Am I The A**hole forum: I felt pressured, but she begged for them to come. I told her as long as they behaved and her husband kept an eye on them. Immediately, she was forced to regret her decision when her sister turned up late because the boys were fussing getting ready, meaning that she missed the majority of the getting ready photos. Then the ceremony itself happened, and my two-year-old nephew began to act up during the vows, she explained. My husband and I wrote our own, and about halfway through mine he begins to cry and fuss. My brother-in-law grabbed him and very awkwardly made his way out, with my older nephew behind telling his brother to shush. I had to restart my vows twice due to the disruption, and I was already so nervous. The venue was outdoor as well, so we could hear my nephew fussing for a while until my brother-in-law got them a good distance away. I didn’t see this at the time, but according to the best man my sister was dramatically shooing her husband out. However, things went from bad to worse when her sister completely disappeared following the ceremony, meaning the entire wedding party was completely held up from being able to get any photographs together as a group.  After the pictures, my sister didn’t even say anything, no apology, nada. After the first dances she finally came up and was like “haha sorry about [nephew], it was nap time! He’s settled now. It was such a non apology and I was so upset, the bride continued. I told her I didn’t like how dismissive she was of my wedding and how I broke my own rule to accommodate her family and she didn’t seem to care. She said she was sorry again but I was blowing things out of proportion, and how it wasn’t as big of a disruption as I was making it out to be. I was just boiling at this point and asked her to please go, I didn’t want her there anymore. The brideaposs mum and her sister were both upset by her decision and neither of them have spoken to her since the wedding, which happened a week ago, leaving her questioning whether she made the right decision. She is an a**hole for bringing them and making you feel pressured when you already set up boundaries and preferences for this situation exactly, one Redditor commented. She proceeds to give a pathetic attempt at an apology to save face but seems to be vaguely gaslighting you in the process, which is why I guess you ended up asking her to leave, because who does that on a day like that  At least fake through an apology and accept responsibility. This is why I opt for eloping haha. Canapost win for losing. Another added: You were unbelievably graceful in how you handled this situation. It seems that your sister was given every available tool to help you have a relaxed, quiet wedding and failed. It also reads in a way that she did a disservice to her children my making them attend an event that caused same level of stress. I do not want to make assumptions, but the mention of them being aposfussyapos in the getting ready and ceremony gives the impression that they did not want to be there.What do you think, did she do the right thing in kicking her sister out  Let us know in the comments...

Yazmina Jade Adler, from Australia, made headlines in  after claiming she relieved her severe period pain by rubbing menstrual blood on her face during a ritual meditation.Now, the Gold Coast business owner has attracted attention again after imposing a controversial policy banning coronavirus vaccine recipients from her Palm Beach salon.Immunology experts say it is scientically impossible for Covid- vaccines to cause illness in unjabbed people as they contain no live virus or any other infectious material that can pass from person to person.Ms Adler told News : It doesnapost really make sense, I guess a lot of people will question that, [but] it is like anything, like the disease or virus, it is spreading [jab particles] somehow and women are reporting side effects when they havenapost had the vaccine. She announced the new rule over Khemia HI vibe frequency salonaposs social media pages on Monday, stating: We are not your hairdresseryou have had the Covid vax.The unknown health effects of the mRNA vaccine are not covered by our public liability insurance, Ms Adler wrote on Facebook and Instagram. She apologised for any aposinconvenience to customers but said the safety of our staff and existing clients is our priority, adding the policy would be re-evaluated in  when clinical trials of the experimental injection are completed. But social media users hit back at her decision. One Facebook user said: I find your business decision ludicrous!! I’m a hairdresser andanything I’d rather my clients were vaccinated, but it’s a personal decision and I won’t discriminate! Another questioned: Itaposs curious to read that so many people who are so vehemently standing up for their right to privacy and standing against a vaccine passport are also asking people to disclose their vaccination history at a hair salon not run by medical experts  More challenged her decision: So just to confirm that the essential health workers, first responders and those working the frontline in health that have to get this vaccine are not welcome in your salon  The businessapos posts have since been flagged as missing context and defying scienceapos by independent fact checkers, the Australian Associated Press.  In a statement addressing the claims, AAP said a Facebook post circulating online claims that countless reports and anecdotes affirm people who are unvaccinated against Covid- are becoming ill just by being in the vicinity of those who have had the jab. The y post lists alleged examples of illnesses and injuries unvaccinated people have picked up from vaccinated people. These include irregular and heavy menstruation, bleeding while pregnant and miscarriages as well as supposed cases of pets dying when touched by someone who got the Covid jab. Associate professor Menno van Zelm from Monash Universityaposs Department of Immunology and Pathology agreed, saying that there are aposno credible reportsapos that vaccinated people can make other people ill. For one, Covid- vaccines do not contain the virus nor any other infectious agent that is contagious, Dr van Zelm said in an email. Yes, the vaccine activates the immune system and can make the recipient feel unwell for  hours, but this does not affect bystanders. Ms Adler, who also offers aposcrystal healingapos and aposfrequency technology and sound healing for your full mind body hair experienceapos in her salon, rose to fame two years ago after appearing on SBSaposs show Medicine or Myth. In front of a  of medical experts, she pulled out a jar of her menstrual blood - which she collects - and daubed it across her forehead, claiming it cures her period cramps.FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnGold CoastPalm BeachImmune systemCoronavirusCoronavirus vaccineAustralia"},{"url":null,"title":"huge snake 100 teeth found","story":"NewsHuge snake with  teeth found hiding in kitchen after homeowner hears strange noisesExpert Steve Brown used a hairdryer and a piece of plastic to catch the giant snake in Brisbane, Australia, which measured three-metres and weighed kgmirrorShareCommentsByJonathan ColesReporter:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY NewsSteve with the large python \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Fontaine and Marshall have been training and we’ve no new concerns from last Thursday. We’ve almost a full squad.“I was holding Fontaine back. Marsh, kind of, but it was more trying to control his workload more without risking him in a game.“We wanted to get the high speed running into him because that’s what his game is about.“That’s where his injuries usually come from, so we tried to do that in a controlled way.“We had a - cushion and were confident going into the game. We weren’t going to risk Fontaine because we knew we’d have him back for Thursday’s game.“It’s great to have a full squad to choose from. Jack Hamilton and Fin Robertson are the two senior ones who are missing at the minute but apart from that, everyone is healthy and can play and be on the pitch.”The Dark Blues head into the double-header in good heart after an impressive run of form saw them finish second on the final day of the Championship.Though defeat to Raith last time out ended their nine-match unbeaten streak, the confidence built up won’t be dulled.And McPake says the experience scattered throughout his squad will ensure that is the case.He added: “It’s a boost for our team any time they turn round and look at each other.“Paul McGowan scored a penalty in front of , people at Hampden, a full house, in a semi-final against Celtic.“Shaun Byrne’s won in the playoffs with Livingston. Jason Cummings and Liam Fontaine played in the cup final when Hibs hadn’t won the cup.“I’ve been at Hibs and I know how important that game was for them.“Charlie Adam is an exceptional talent and an exceptional player. He’s got real, real experience of high pressure games.“When you look about our squad, and you see the names of the players in there, then you’re glad they’re standing beside you.#Dundee wow fans with #Fabric of the City# new kit launch ahead of Kilmarnock promotion showdown\" title\"#Dundee wow fans with #Fabric of the City# new kit launch ahead of Kilmarnock promotion showdown# # The Courier\" src\"https:www.thecourier fp sport football dundee-fc  dundee-wow-fans-with-fabric-of-the-city-new-kit-launch-ahead-of-kilmarnock-promotion-showdown embed # secretmuWVH\" data-secret\"muWVH\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/syndicatenews/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/05/YMCA_Ys_Girls-558x372.jpg ","title":"ymca tayside looking for mentors for vulnerable young women","story":".dct-cta@-webkit-keyframes dctSpinnertransform:rotate%transform:rotate@keyframes dctSpinnertransform:rotate%transform:rotate.dct-cta__title.dct-cta__content p.dct-cta__content p:not.dct-cta__content p:last-child.dct-cta__label.dct-cta__input.dct-cta__input::-webkit-input-placeholder.dct-cta__input::-moz-placeholder.dct-cta__input:-ms-input-placeholder.dct-cta__input::placeholder.dct-cta__label:hover.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__label:focus.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__input:hover,.dct-cta__input:focus.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__btn .stransition:all cubic-bezier .s.dct-cta__btn.dct-cta__btn:disabled.dct-cta__btn:not.dct-cta__btn:not:hover.dct-cta__btn:not:hover,.dct-cta__btn:not:focus.dct-cta__btn-text.dct-cta__btn:before .stransition:all cubic-bezier .s.dct-cta__btn-loadingborder-top:px solid #fffborder-radius:%width:pxheight:pxbox-sizing:border-box-webkit-animation:dctSpinner .s linear infiniteanimation:dctSpinner .s linear infinite.dct-cta--signup.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__title.dct-cta--signup__dialogs.dct-cta--signup__dialog.dct-cta--signup__dialog--success.dct-cta--signup__dialog--error.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__grid.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--subscribe.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__title.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__content@media only screen and @media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap@media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap+.dct-cta__content@supports or.dct-cta__flex:after.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--signup__dialog.dct-cta--signup__dialog--js-active.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap,.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__content@media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe--contained .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe--contained .dct-cta__image-wrap@media only screen and @supports or.dct-cta__grid:after.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label,.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__gridgrid-template-columns:fr minmaxgrid-gap:.rem .remYMCA Tayside is looking for volunteers for a new mentoring programme to help vulnerable girls.The programme, Y#s Girls, will offer help and support to young women and girls at risk of developing mental health issues.They are calling on the community to get involved and provide positive role models.Working with social workers, schools and local police, Y’s Girls will connect vulnerable young women aged nine to , with mentors from a range of dferent backgrounds to offer support and positively influence their lives.Mentors will be trained by YMCA Tayside.

week or so, and now Moray is able to do so as well.#It has been a long time coming and I know many people will be looking forward to visiting their loved ones or family or friends, and it is also great news for the local economy.#I want to pay tribute to the people of Moray for taking advantage of the expanded testing regime we have locally, and also getting themselves vaccinated, so we can bring those case numbers down and allow us to move forward.#I have to continue to urge people to remain cautious, to get themselves tested regularly, make sure they do turn up for their vaccination appointments and stick to the advice so we can move forward.#This is a good day for Moray and good news for our local families, our communities and the local economy.#East Renfrewshire will remain at Level  for now, but will be kept under constant review.Levels in East Renfrewshire are higher than in Glasgow, but it is important to consider the size of the area.East Renfrewshire has  cases per , of population but is a signicantly smaller area than Glasgow.Ms Sturgeon said: #Yesterday there were actually just  new cases reported in East Renfrewshire, compared to  in Glasgow.#She added that when decisions are made, they need to look at what underlies the raw figures.The first minister has also confirmed that Glasgow City will #regrettably# remain under Level  restrictions.Ms Sturgeon said she was not yet confident that the virus has slowed enough for restrictions to be eased.The region was held back in Level  alongside Moray last Friday.Cases have continued to rise in Glasgow which is thought to be due to the April . iant. Testing, vaccination and contact tracing have been enhanced in the area.Ms Sturgeon said she was #confident# that measures put in place in Glasgow will help to bring the outbreak under control # but they will need #a bit longer to do that#.She continued: #Despite all the efforts that have been made in the past  days, cases are still rising in Glasgow.#Authorities are #fairly certain# that the increase has been driven by the April . iant.The number of cases per , population had gone from  last week, to  cases now. The percentage of tests coming back positive in Glasgow has also increased over the last week from .% to %.The first minister added: #We don#t think we have turned the corner in Glasgow yet.#The situation in Glasgow will be reviewed on a weekly basis so the area does not remain under restrictions for longer than necessary. It cannot be confirmed how long this will continue.Nicola Sturgeon also commented on how #unwelcome# remaining in Level  would be for businesses, including hospitality and retail. Reactions have shown the disappointment among these sectors.Liz Cameron OBE, chief executive of the Scottish Chambers of Commerce said: #The business community in Glasgow were handed a hammer blow last week and are deeply disappointed and disillusioned that more businesses could now reach crisis point as a result of these extended restrictions.#The absolute priority must be to focus on managing these local outbreaks quickly to enable Scotland’s most populated city to open up, in line with the rest of the country.“Businesses have invested heavily in COVID safe measures and equipment and want a fair opportunity to trade. They have created safe environments and need time to plan and rebuild confidence.#To support restart efforts, we urge the Scottish Government to accelerate and expand the vaccination programme to as many people as possible, particularly in hotspot areas.“The Scottish Government must ensure that adequate and targeted financial compensation is provided quickly.#We also urge the UK Government to accept these outbreaks as special cases and be flexible with furlough criteria for businesses who have recruited new staff or have brought back their employees, they should be able to use the furlough scheme to protect jobs.#Andrew McRae, policy chair from the Federation of Small Businesses# Scotland, said: #The situation in Glasgow is excruciating for the city’s hospitality and tourism industry.#From next week, Scotland’s largest city will be the only place in the UK where pubs and restaurants won’t be able to serve alcohol indoors. Understandably, business owners and their customers are intensely frustrated.#While we want to see new financial support for Glaswegian operators, especially those that took on new staff for re-opening, we must also see the Scottish Government investigate whether a new approach is required for the city.#If the virus has not been brought under control while Glasgow businesses have faced almost  months of restrictions, then surely the problem lies where.#Restrictions will not be law but it is advised to avoid travel to these areas.People are currently allowed to travel between Level  and  areas, but must avoid those in Levels  and .Due to high numbers of the April . iant in local authorities in England, the first minister announced that travel to Bedford, Bolton, Blackburn and Darwen is now restricted.In response to the travel restrictions announcement, Ms Cameron said: #We would continue to urge a -nations approach in containing outbreaks.If the evidence shows that restricting travel to local authority areas in the rest of the UK will suppress the virus spread, then we would expect to see restrictions removed as quickly as possible once the data allows.”For as

north-east have taken part in an interactive online programme promoting Stem education in schools.Pupils had the opportunity to explore science, technology, engineering and maths straight from their desks as part of TechFest#s Digital Early Years and Primary Schools programme.The virtual week-long event, which was supported by joint principal sponsors BP and Shell, took place from May -.It was the first time the popular festival was based exclusively online in its -year history due to the ongoing coronavirus restrictions.School pupils had the chance to watch a wide range of live and pre-recorded events # including presentations from Macduff Marine Aquarium, The Ark Open Farm, The Critter Keeper # as well as join Oceaneering and TechFest for an Audience with Astronauts.Striving to develop a programme to suit schools and teachers’ needs, the TechFest team created three categories of events # Live, Touring and On Demand # all of which were free to attend and download.With the Touring option, teachers were able to book a range of resources through TechFest and complete activities in their own time.In addition, the My Work of Work Live series by Skills Development Scotland offered pupils the opportunity to make their own game, experience what it’s like to be a forensic computer analyst and use coding to create artwork.The On Demandmeant schools could access TechFest’s catalogue of activities whenever it was convenient, including workshops from K’Next Generation, Dynamic Earth in Edinburgh and Glasgow Science Centre.Sarah Chew, managing director at TechFest, said: #I’m thrilled that our content has reached such a vast amount of pupils over such a large area.#We saw great success with our digital event adaptations last year, so instead of continuing to put the physical schools programme on hold, we made it virtual, continuing our mission to promote STEM to a wider audience.#This last year has been a great example of how we can adapt to changes in circumstances, and thanks to our sponsors, volunteers and presenters, events like this can be provided to help inspire and inform our future workforce, even when we can’t be physically together.#Recordings of the live events are available on TechFest#s YouTube channel.For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium

many people have received the vaccine in my area Which demographics have received the vaccine When will I receive my coronavirus vaccine The Covid vaccine tracker below shows an at-a-glance view of the current proportion of the Scottish population who have received the first and second dose of either the Oxford AstraZaneca or the Pfizer BioNTech vaccination so far.The table below is an at-a-glance view of the total figures by group.Data on the number of people vaccinated was initially provided in a weekly report from Public Health Scotland, however there was immense pressure to keep the public more regularly informed so on January  the statistics began to be provided each day.The chart below shows the daily numbers of first and second doses provided.The chart below shows the cumulative number of people who have received each dose since the vaccination programme began on December .It#s also helpful to look at this data as a proportion of the Scottish population so you can see how the percentage of people vaccinated grows over time.The chart below shows the progress for each UK country.On January , Public Health Scotland provided this data broken down by vaccine type which is shown in the chart below.The map below shows the available data on the regional rollout of the vaccination programme.January  saw the release of data by local authority area for the first time, which is shown in the map below.Regional data was originally available on a weekly basis but moved to a daily upload on February . The chart below contains data on the daily number of doses provided and the population covered. Use the drop down box to select your area and the buttons to move between daily vaccinations, cumulative vaccinations and the percentage of the population who have received first doses.Similarly to the regional data, data by demographics were originally provided in the weekly PHS report # however on February  they moved to a daily publication schedule.The chart below shows the daily number of people who have had first doses in each age range, as well as the percentage of that population, covered.Public Health Scotland began reporting daily statistics on vaccinations by JCVI categories in mid-March.

Retailers in Scotland have invested tens of millions of pounds on safety measures including plexiglass screens, queue management systems, social distancing signage and floor markings, better ventilation, cleaning and hygiene. Shop workers have ensured the nation was supplied and fed throughout the past  dficult months.The reopening of non-essential shops and ability of food-to-go retailers to resume welcoming customers in-store will mark a crucial milestone for Scottish retail and the wider supply chain. Retail is Scotland’s largest private sector employer. So-called non-essential stores have been compelled to close in Scotland for  consecutive days. The SRC and Usdaw encourage shoppers to:Across Scotland, thousands of shops which have been shuttered for four long months are looking forward to getting back to doing what they do best, serving their customers.Re-opening is good news for our economy, for jobs and for our local communities. It has never been more important to play our part in keeping our towns, cities and retail destinations vibrant.Every purchase from a shop helps to support jobs in local retail and throughout the supply chain.Retailers and their colleagues continue to work around the clock to maintain a safe shopping experience, so customers can have the confidence toto their favourite stores.If we all follow the necessary physical distancing and hygiene measures and show consideration to those around us, including shop staff who are doing a dficult job, then everyone will be better off.David Lonsdale, director of the Scottish Retail ConsortiumThe reopening of stores on Monday offers a leline for many retailers. That is good news in terms of helping to safeguard jobs, but the virus is still out there.We expect employers to conduct full risk assessments, follow the agreed guidance and ensure that customers are fully informed of the necessary safety measures.Shoppers need to play their part in helping to limit the spread of the virus and avoid further lockdowns by following the rules and respecting staff.Regrettably, throughout this appalling pandemic, incidents of abuse towards shop workers doubled and Covid safety measures have now become signicant flashpoints.Abuse should never be part of the job and shop workers – who played a vital role in getting food and medicine into our homes during the pandemic – deserve our thanks and respect.In January, the Scottish Parliament unanimously voted for a ground-breaking new law to protect shop workers.Usdaw campaigned for many years to secure these legal protections and we will continue to work hard to ensure that shop workers are protected and treated with the respect they deserve.Tracey Gilbert, Usdaw deputy isional officer for ScotlandSir,Oxfam’s shops in Argyll and Bute have an urgent need for volunteers to help deal with an anticipated deluge of donations as they prepare to re-open from Monday April .Sales from the first day of trading following the re-opening of its English and Welsh shops were up  per cent on  figures, with it being the most successful Monday ever sales-wise for the organisation outwith Christmas periods.Money raised by the dedicated staff and volunteers in Oxfam#s shops in Dunoon and Rothesay helps fight poverty and injustice around the world providing people with lesaving essentials like clean water and soap as well as the hope of a better future.We know from the last lockdown that people will have taken the chance to have a good declutter and we’re anticipating a deluge of generous donations.Volunteers are asked to give as little as a few hours a week of their time and can take up a range of vital roles, from serving customers to sorting donations and arranging window displays.Each shop typically relies on a team of  dedicated volunteers and one or two staff, with more than , volunteers required across the country.As well as volunteers, Oxfam stores are also appealing for good quality donations.Protecting staff, volunteers and customers from Covid- remains Oxfam’s priority, with shop teams continuing to implement strict protocol, including social distancing, readily available hand sanitiser, masks and gloves for staff, screens at tills, regular and frequent cleaning, closed changing rooms and encouraging contactless payment.In advance of shops re-opening, people are invited to register their interest online via www.oxfam.org.uk # just click on #get involved#.Tom Richardson, Oxfam interim head of retailSir,The demands placed on Scotland’s health service by the pandemic have intensied pleas for an increase in funding for Scottish NHS.NHS funding in Scotland comes from the block grant from Westminster. If huge sums of Scottish taxpayers’ money were not being used to pay Scotland’s share of renewing and maintaining Britain’s nuclear submarine fleet, there would be funds available to properly support the Scottish NHS. This will only be possible when Scotland is independent once more.Susan Swain, Dunbar"},{"url":null,"title":"the softer crofter a land of sustainability","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Our pretty Highlander girls have lost all interest in us now that the grass and rashes are a vivid, succulent green.

So, it’s an easier morning round for us crofters with only the daft pigs to feed, who long ago foraged every root, acorn and pine-cone from their sizeable woodland.Their little forest is perfectly, porcinely ploughed, but they must still be finding some nourishment there as they seem less frantic at feeding-time, pausing their grubbling and guzzling for the occasional scratch and cuddle.The let-up in winter feeding has allowed much-needed attention to be given to the now stuffed-full Polycrub where every speck of soil, every hanging beam has been usefully employed in the mission to feed the family entirely from its harvest.Raspberry canes, lemon, orange and cherry trees should keep rickets at bay, while the plethora of weird and wonderful ieties of carrots, potatoes, asparagus, and squashes will nourish us throughout the season and beyond.Our newbie attempts to live off the land mirror the much more experienced efforts of families throughout theand breadth of this peninsula and in the village beyond. Thanks to those techie neighbours who set up email networks and social media groups there is a fantastic bank of information and expertise shared locally.Whether you want to learn how to plant oak trees, acquire foraging skills or find out how to run your home on renewable energy, somebody local has been there, done it and is happy to point you in the right direction.Over the last few months this valuable mine of knowledge and enthusiasm for environmental projects has been formalised into the Tayvallich Sustainability Plan, a  for sharing information and taking action to create a more sustainable community.The plan has grown organically from a pilot scheme run through the winter months with Keep Scotland Beautul to a website, action plan and monthly activities.Open to everyone with an interest in achieving a healthy, sustainable future for the village and its surroundings, the plan will work on the whole gambit: from food growing to flood mitigation foraging to forestry and heat pumps to bike pumps # a new cycle repair work-stand has been installed outside the village shop.Joining the online meetings throughout the winter, I was amazed to see not just the number of locals involved, but also the extraordinary talents and interests they share.We only entrenched ourselves full time on this wild wee bit of Argyll a month or two before lockdown so we’re not well-kent faces and, likewise, the faces of many villagers I’ve only ever seen strangely pixellated thanks to my dodgy connection to the Zoom meetings.Hopefully the same is true for wi throughout the area and that my, now ubiquitous, Zoom-accompanying glass of wine has stayed safely out of shot."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column april 30 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Was it perhaps in an area where there were no wind farms in sight of  the local communities which were questioned but where they were still able to take advantage of any community benefit on offer If successful, the public petition recently submitted to the Scottish Parliament by campaign group Scotland Against Spin should help to clary exactly how much support there really is for further onshore wind development in Scotland.Aileen Jackson, Knockglass, UplawmoorSir,I have been contacted by a number of my justiably concerned constituents about the recent removal of a cattle grid on the Isle of Gigha from the road between the ferry jetty and the village.The space has been tarred over but I have been informed by residents that unfortunately the sub surface area was just grit and so the tar has subsided due to traffic including tractors and lorries. The dip now is actually worse than when the cattle grid was in place.To make matters worse, the damaged cattle grid which is now mangled metal has been left on the adjacent roadside verge.It is my strong belief thatcattle grids are damaged the roads department should replace them with new, fit-for-propose cattle grids, not get rid of them all together.Not only should road repairs be made to last, but at the very least the roads department should clean up after itself and remove old damaged materials # such as this # left behind. If a private company or an inidual member of the public left a large amount of scrap metal at the side of the road they would be in trouble.I have contacted our roads# management through member services and asked them to recty this matter as soon as possible.Councillor Alastair Redman, Kintyre and the Islands ward Sir,I am a GP in one of Argyll’s rural practices. Last week I was having a busy morning so was a little later than usual getting back to my car, which I had left charging at an electric charge point.That evening I was surprised to see that I’d been charged £ over and above the normal charging rate per KwH. I checked through the Argyll and Bute website and discovered that there is now an overstay charge – hence the surcharge.I had had an email back in April saying that Argyll and Bute Council would now be charging users at its charge points – the cost being p per KwH. Fair enough.However, there was no mention of a penalty for overstaying. Nor is there any notice at the charge points themselves, save a tiny notice stating #charges apply#.Those seeking to charge in Argyll and Bute are additionally confused by the lack of clarity over what type of charge point is being used: is it a  Kw, Kw or a  Kw. There is no notice on the chargers. This is important because the overstay timings y according to the dfering units.When I buy petrol at a filling station I clearly know what the charges are when I buy a ticket at a parking meter, I buy a ticket and know exactly how long I am able to park there.But it seems that for electric vehicles you have to search the internet to find out the rules – and in my village there is no local wi and  I cannot get G on my phone.Dr Carina Spink, MuasdaleSir,Cats Protection would like to advise cat owners to be aware of the risks posed to their cat by the sun.Pale-coloured cats, or those with unpigmented white noses or ears, are particularly at risk from the sun’s rays which can cause sunburn and skin cancer.Those affected can suffer long term damage including, in severe cases, having to have their ear tips removed to prevent the cancer from spreading.Following a few simple tips, owners can help to protect their cat from the harmful effects of the sun.These include keeping them indoors on sunny days between am and pm, asking your vet for advice about suitable sunscreen and ensuring you provide plenty of shade to enable your cat to shelter from the sun’s rays.Dr Sarah Elliott, Central Veterinary Officer, Cats Protection"},{"url":null,"title":"from cradle to grave","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

It involves GPs, nurses, an army of health professionals and lots of support staff. It is essentialwe are to achieve what the publicsay is a priority, enjoying a healthy le. As the founders of the NHS said: #From the cradle to the grave#.Hiding in plain sight in this report, in the small print, is this statement: #Politicians, health care professionals and the public must all be involvedour primary care system is to survive.# As Oprah Winfrey would put it, #WHAT # If this is what is at stake, why have we not heard more about it  Why was it enough to contact so few people among our erse population Why has health management locally cast our group out in the cold We are open to all and represent a wide cross section of community interests. And their latest distancing act is to #temporarily suspend# public representation on its Integration Joint Board.I am coming to believe that this critical situation has overtaken long-held belief systems that need to be challenged.In NHS values, the first statement is #working together for patients.#That is well out of date increasingly the patient has been a participator in their care, and the duty of obtaining consent means you can’t have treatment without co-operation.This report goes on to make clear that #collaboration# is a key requirement. That means we are an essential part of the system.It seems clear that we are going to have to fight to get past the unconscious assumptions of decision makers. It is literally a fight for the lives of ourselves and generations after us.We need all the support we can get."},{"url":null,"title":"inveraray castle set to reopen for 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

We once again highlighted our concerns over a lack of immediate action on the crisis at the Rest and be ThankfulDear Roy and Hugh,I am writing in response to an official Transport Scotland email to the Rest and be Thankful Campaign on the April , where you have sought to answer several questions posed by us at our meeting with your officials and in subsequent emails to you both. We are hugely disappointed by this response and its apparent contradictions.We asked for a permanent solution within the next three years. The email states #we are not waiting for anything and are pushing on with work at pace# yet your actions since the August landslide have only created delay.We believe creating  options for consultation in November  and five further options for consultation in March was a time-wasting exercise. We strongly believe there are only three real options, with studies on these completed in your  report.A geological survey, which will take  months to complete, could have started last August, assuming you had not conducted such surveys in .We have asked for temporary use of the forestry road, away from the threats posed by landsides.The email states: #We were clear without that information we are not certain the forestry track in its current form is safe for use#, yet we would argue you already have a Transerv report produced in  by Balfour Beatty and Mouchal Services Ltd for Transport Scotland which suggested the forestry road could be upgraded in - weeks. How did Transerv arrive at this conclusion without a study of the ground conditions being done in advance This situation should be considered a safety, economic and social emergency, cutting through the red tape of consultation and delay.It further declares that #we understand first-hand the delay that can be caused by procedural challenge…there needs to be a careful balancing of accelerating development and procedural risk in order to ensure that we do not end up in the courts#.While we understand the need for the right balance of speed and consultation, we think the safety risks, costs incurred by business and damage to the economy of Argyll should create the conditions for emergency action, delivering what should be a simple road realignment.This is not HS, we are not asking to blight the countryside or people#s homes you do not have whole communities ready to challenge fixing the crisis at the Rest and be Thankful. What we want cannot be worse than the damage already inflicted on the hillside without consultation. If you fixed the rest, we will all be thankful.The following questions still have not been answered in Transport Scotland#s official reply or in recent press statements:If the next landslide, or subsequent ersion along the equally inadequate A, results in a fatality who will be held accountable Who is responsible for the social and economic impact on the people and businesses of Argyll while we wait another  years for something permanent to be done We are business people and understand the need for safe environments, effective procedures, timely management and cost control, but what we have experienced over the past year does not give us confidence you will address the concerns we have.We are not looking for you to defend your approach, what matters to us is the action taken to bring timescales down and resolve the problem within the next parliament.We are simply asking you to rethink your approach, look at how your team can cut through this #business as usual# process and appoint someone who can find a way to realign two km of the A safely within the next three years.By challenging your approach, we are hoping to see that after nearly a year of delay and ersion, there is a recognition of the cost impact to business, the signicant safety concerns, and that this will continue to blight Argyll as a place to live, work, and invest in until a permanent solution is delivered.We will be working with the relevant politicians post elections and will continue to campaign for a change in approach.We would be happy to discuss what can be done to overcome any constraints you have to deliver a solution quickly and resolve the crisis at the Rest and be Thankful.John Gurr, chairman, The Rest and be Thankful CampaignSir,Mental Health Awareness Week opened on Monday May  and we are inviting everyone to #ConnectWithNature to support their mental health.Spending quality time in and around nature can help to reduce stress and increase feelings of positivity, and you don’t have to be surrounded by fields or have to take a walk in the wilderness to feel the benefits.The Mental Health Foundation, which works to prevent mental health problems and has organised this awareness week for the past  years, encourages you to recognise and grow your connection with nature by sharing a photo, video or sound recording with your family and friends, and on your social media.Connecting with nature can really make a dference to your mental health, and now more than ever, it is time to look after yours.Julie Walters, actorSir,Alan Reid, Dunoon"},{"url":null,"title":"riverside kids vote for nature","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

I was really pleased to find a company that does dehydrated vegan food in compostable bags, so I bought  meals and have mailed them in batches to post offices around the country so I can collect them as I travel.#As far as training for such an extraordinary expedition is concerned, Ben explained that he has participated in several endurance events, including multi-day running, in the past, but, now three weeks since he left his starting point of Glasgow he is enjoying this trip more than these previous competitions.#I’m loving this as it’s not all ‘Go, Go , Go’. I want to be able to sit back and take time and explore all the dferent parts of the coast. This trip has given me time to write, which is something I’ve wanted to do for a while.#Ben’s blog can be read on his website where he has also written in detail about the threat plastic litter poses to marine le and the environment in general.#I wasn’t brought up by the sea I’m from Manchester,# Ben adds. #I worked at a youth hostel in Ullapool for a couple of years and felt a connection there.#When I’m picking up rubbish on beaches I feel really up and down about it all.#I feel so sad about what I find, and also about the amount that’s below the ocean’s surface. But then I realise I need to do what I can.#On that note, Ben is keen to work together with locals who want to make a dference.He is helping out at a beach clean in Oban this Friday, May . Information on this and how to donate to the John Muir Trust or the Marine Conservation Society can be found on Ben’s www.ukcoastjourney website."},{"url":null,"title":"lots to do for new argyll and bute msp","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

So, throw open your windows, stock up on blossom-scented cleaning supplies and follow my steps for freshening up your home for spring hellipDeep clean and declutter:Spring is the perfect time to assess your home and see what you can donate or throw out. Irsquove made multiple trips to the recycling centre lately and it really has made a dference to my home ndash I know Irsquoll never be a minimalist, but it feels calming to have a little less clutter at least.Set aside an hour or so once a week to clear out your wardrobe, kitchencabinets and hallway cupboards.Reorganise sideboards and shelves, and get rid of anything you havenrsquot used or worn in a while ndash be ruthless! Then give everything a once-over as you go ndash spring cleaning is good for the soul.Have a room refresh:Changing the layout of a room and giving your home a bit of a rejig does wonders for making the space feel like new. Once or twice a year Irsquoll consider how I can switch up my spaces. Irsquoll move furniture, swap out soft furnishings, relocate the sofa to another position or change our spare room completely. Irsquoll even rework the gallery walls and artwork around my home. Itrsquos like redecorating but without spending a penny.Bring the outdoors:in Stock up on tulips, daffodils and peonies, and place bouquets around your home ndash on mantelpieces, sideboards, kitchen worktops and coffee tables. Irsquom a big fan ofgreenery in the home too ndash plants like Pothos, Monstera deliciosa and ZZ plants are so easy to take care of and really breathe a bit of le into a room. Irsquom all about the indoor jungle, so go wild with blooms and plants and your home will feel bright and breezy in no time.Consider a lick of paint:With so many fun paint brands launching lately , itrsquos easier than ever to add colour to your le. Opt for a fresh eucalyptus green to revive a bathroom, or pick a played-down pink for warmth. Go wild with it ndash paint a feature wall in your living room or section off a room with a dado rail and paint the lower section a bright shade.

It will help protect the people around you, and help us avoid anotherto lockdown.\"It may be tempting to think as vaccinations increase and cases drop, that testing will become less important.\"In fact, this will only make it more important to spot and prevent new outbreaks as cases emerge.\"We know from our experience of last summer just how quickly one outbreak can lead to another.\"This also applies regardless of whether you have been vaccinated or not.\"While the latest evidence suggests vaccines provide a high level of protection against the effects of Covid-, they dont yet provide a guarantee that you cant still get the virus or pass it on to others.\"How do I take a test Follow these stepsyoursquore doing a rapid LFD test at home.Read the instructions that come with your test kit.Clean and dry a flat surface and wash or sanitise your hands before you start.Once you have removed the test strip from its packet, start the test within  minutes.Carefully open the extraction buffer sachet tube.Open the extraction tube and pour in all the liquid.Close the cap and put the extraction tube in the holderBlow your nose.Clean your hands again.Remove the swab from the packet. Do not touch the fabric tipof the swab.Open your mouth wide and rub the fabric tip over both tonsils . Do this  times on each side. Itrsquos normal to find this a bit uncomfortable.Using the same swab, insert it up your nostril until you feel resistance.Rotate the swab in your nostril  times.Pick up the extraction tube, open the lid and place the fabric tip of the swab in the fluid in the tube.Firmly press the swab against the bottom-inside of the tube and rotate it around for  seconds. Itrsquos important to mix thoroughly.Pinch the tube as you remove the swab and put the nozzle cap on.Squeeze the extraction tube to place two drops of fluid on the test strip. Watch out for any air bubbles.Set a timer for  minutes and leave the test strip on a clean, flat surface.Once your test is complete, place all used test kit contents in the waste bag provided and put this in your bin.Where testing takes place - community testing sitesIfyou do not have coronavirus symptoms but live in a community that has been targeted for testing, you can access a test at a rapid test site.These are only available in some parts of Scotland.You can usually just turn up and do not need to book in advance ndash but you should check the arrangements at your local site first.You will be tested using a lateral flow devicewhich involves taking a swab or saliva sample.You should usually get your result within an hour.Island testingThe First Minister also added that people visiting the islands should take two lateral flow tests before travelling.Nicola Sturgeon said: \"We are keeping island communities at the same level as the rest of the country at the moment, so that we can allow travel between island communities and the rest of Scotland.\"But we know this does create a risk for our island communities.\"Many of them currently have very, very low rates of Covid.\"And they will be welcoming visitors from parts of Scotland which I know many of them are looking forward to where Covid will still be circulating at a higher level and more widely.\"So If you are planning to travel to an island we do encourage you to take two lateral flow tests before you depart.\"The second test should be on the day that you are planning to travel, and the first should be three days before you travel.\"That means thatyou test positive, you have a chance to take a PCR test - which is more sensitive - to confirm the result before making a final decision on cancelling your visit.\"This is potentially an important way in which we can minimise the risk, of bringing Covid into island communities while nevertheless allowing our island communities the benefit of opening up again to visitors.\"Soyou are planning on travelling to an island over the course of next week, it is possible to get tests from today, and I would encourage you to do that.\""},{"url":null,"title":"times-league-table-borders-high-schools-appear-top-50","story":"A LEAGUE table of Scottish secondary schools has been published by The Timesndash and the Borders has two in the top .The newspaper creates rankings every year based on the proportion of pupils achieving five or more Highers.This years editionwas published in print on Wednesday, May , showing a total of  schools in the country.GalashielsAcademy has risen by more than  places compared with last years chart.The Elm Row school is now in th place ndash up from last yearrsquos finish of th, as reported in the print edition of The Times.: Talented executive director is leaving Scottish Borders Council for new jobAccording to the latest statistics,  per cent of Gala Academy pupils achieved five or more Highers in .That is up on , which saw  per cent of Gala pupils complete the feat.In this yearrsquos table, only Earlston High Schooland Peebles High Schoolfinished above Gala Academy among the high schools in the Borders.Sixty-seven per cent of pupils at Earlston managed five or more Highers in , an increase of  per cent on rsquos figure .Meanwhile,  per cent of Peebles High pupils achieved five or more Highers last year, up from  per cent in .: Historic mansion near Borders saved from demolition following outcry over plansThe other Borders schools named in the rankings were Jedburgh Grammar School , Selkirk High School , Berwickshire High School , Kelso High School , Eyemouth High Schooland Hawick High School .As a region, the Borders council area was th in a league table of Scottish councils after . per cent of pupils graduated with five or more Highers.That is a . per cent increase on rsquos figure .A Scottish Borders Council spokesperson said: \"There is a lot of good work going on right across the nine high schools in the Borders and it should be noted that there are a number of dferent ways of measuring the health and success of a school.\"The top performing school in the latest table based on this metric was Jordanhill School, Glasgow, which recorded an  per cent success rate of pupils recording five or more Highers.The lowest performing school was Craigroyston Community High School, Edinburgh, which recorded nine per cent of pupils achieving the feat."},{"url":null,"title":"covid-vaccine-passport-scheme-announced-scotland","story":"A new scheme that will allow Scots to prove they have been vaccinated against coronavirus before travelling abroad has been launched by the Scottish Government.Those who have been vaccinated can download a letter from the NHS Inform patient website, or request a letter from the Covid Status Helplinethey are not online.But as details of the vaccination status scheme were announced, Scotlandrsquos Chief Medical Officer Dr Gregor Smith urged people to be \"highly cautious about international travel\"and ldquocontinue to limit their travel abroad.Only those travelling to a country where proof of vaccination is needed as an entry requirement should request a letter.There are currently no countries that require travellers to show their vaccination status, but the letter scheme is being introduced because international travel requirements can change quickly during the pandemic.What to do before going abroad:If yoursquore planning to travel abroad, you must:check whether a country yoursquore travelling to is on the red, amber or green listconfirm what you need to do when you arrive back in ScotlandCountries may move between the green, amber and red lists at short notice.You should not assume that a country on the green, amber or red list now will remain on the same list over the weeks and months ahead.Before you travelYoull also need to:have taken a coronavirus testin the threedays before you begin your journey to Scotland -

Eight designs will be chosen to become stamps which will be on sale across the UK.Children may choose to illustrate frontline workers in health or social care.They may want to celebrate other key workers who have kept the country going, such as refuse collectors, cleaners, teachers, supermarket workers, public transport staff, delivery drivers or, indeed, postmen and postwomen.Or they might highlight the volunteers who have helped in their local communities or raised money for charity, such as the late Captain Sir Tom Moore.The competition is open until Friday May . A special  of judges will select the winners. As with all special stamps, the final eight designs will be sent to HM The Queen before they can be printed and issued as stamps. The winners will be announced in the autumn.We cannot wait to see who children choose to honour on their stamp.

The dip now is actually worse than when the cattle grid was in place.To make matters worse, the damaged cattle grid, which is now mangled metal, has been left on the adjacent roadside verge.It is my strong belief thatcattle grids are damaged, the roads department should replace them with new fit-for-propose cattle grids, not get rid of them all together.Not only should road repairs be made to last but at the very least the roads department should clean up after itself and remove old damaged materials such as this left behind.If a private company or an inidual member of the public left a large amount of scrap metal at the side of the road they would be in trouble.I have contacted our roads management through member services and asked them to recty this matter as soon as possible.I am a GP in one of Argyll#s rural practices. Last week I was having a busy morning so was a little later than usual getting back to my car, which I had left charging at an electric charge point.That evening I was surprised to see that I#d been charged £ over and above the normal charging rate per KwH.I checked through the Argyll and Bute website and discovered that there is now an overstay charge – hence the surcharge.I had received an email back in April saying that Argyll and Bute Council would now be charging users at its charge points – the cost being p per KwH. Fair enough.However, there was no mention of a penalty for overstaying. Nor is there any notice at the charge points themselves, save a tiny notice stating #charges apply#.Those seeking to charge in Argyll and Bute are additionally confused by the lack of clarity over what type of charge point is being used: is it a  Kw, Kw or a  Kw. There is no notice on the chargers. This is important because the overstay timings y according to the dfering units.When I buy petrol at a filling station, I clearly know what the charges are when I buy a ticket at a parking meter, I buy a ticket and know exactly how long I am able to park there.But it seems that for electric vehicles you have to search the internet to find out the rules – and in my village there is no local WiFi and I cannot get G on my phone.As a responsible democrat I thought, when this election was called, that I would write to the candidates to ask them a few questions before deciding how to vote.We had no hustings this time, even in Campbeltown, and our MSP has not visited the town for ages. So election time seems to be the only opportunity to enter into dialogue with those who want to represent us.Last year I published a book about the uncertain future for the rule of law in Scotland. The irreducible basis of a rule-of-law society is reciprocity between those who make the laws and those who have to obey them. Without dialogue, that is impossible.Only two parties sent me a leaflet with enough time to allow an exchange of emails: first the SNP and then the LibDems.I started by asking the SNP candidate, Jenni Minto, for a CV. That was initially refused, then a redacted one sent. Next, I asked about the Hate Crime Act. I got a long answer ending with a quotation from the English philosopher, Karl Popper: #In order to maintain a tolerant society, the society must be intolerant to intolerance.#I wrote back quoting Bertrand Russell, who said that enforced morality is not morality at all it is pure obedience. Likewise, enforced tolerance is not tolerance, just obedience. I asked what she thought of the criminalisation of dinner-time conversations and other aspects of the Act. It was at that point that the dialogue broke down.I changed the subject to independence. This time I did get a reply, but it was evasive.For example, I had asked what the most important features of the UK were that made her want Scotland to leave it. Ms Minto replied that an independent country would get the government it votes for. That implied thatScotland and England voted for the same party, there would be no need for independence. So, by extension, whatArgyll wanted a dferent government from that in Holyrood  Should it declare independence from Scotland, as Orkney and Shetland have said they willthe UK breaks up  I wrote for clarication, but Ms Minto did not reply.I also wrote to Alan Reid of the LibDems. He sent a CV, but when I replied to that with questions about LibDem policy, I heard nothing more.That, in Scotland, appears to be the limit of dialogue between the rulers and the ruled. Perhaps that explains something about the parliament itself.With Sun Awareness Week taking place this week, Cats Protection would like to advise cat owners to be aware of the risks posed to their cat by the sun.Pale-coloured cats, or those with unpigmented white noses or ears, are particularly at risk from the sun#s rays which can cause sunburn and skin cancer.Those affected can suffer long-term damage including, in severe cases, having to have their ear tips removed to prevent the cancer from spreading.Following a few simple tips owners can help protect their cat from the harmful effects of the sun.These include keeping them indoors on sunny days between am and pm, asking your vet for advice about suitable sunscreen and ensuring you provide plenty of shade to enable your cat to shelter from the sun#s rays."},{"url":null,"title":"thought for the week may 7 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Yet, at the same time, we are becoming increasingly suspicious that the label on freedom has been switched.For some people appear to be devaluing freedom. They seem to think it means no constraints on their behaviour. They have the right to do whatever they want, evenit causes damage to themselves, to others and to the environment.Jesus makes it clear that freedom is something quite dferent. It is being set free from the tyrannical oppression of our own self-centredness – what the Bible calls sin – empowering us to be free to love God by willingly obeying his Word and to love others by humbly looking out for their best interests.Not only did Jesus tell us in his teaching and show us by his example what label freedom should have, but by his real death on the cross, his physical and historical resurrection and the gt of his Spirit, he made it possible for us to experience it.We must not be conned by the switch that has been made to freedom#s label.Instead, let us restore its label back to its correct, Jesus-defined and le-changing setting, and through faith in Jesus alone, value and enjoy the freedom he secured by his death."},{"url":null,"title":"happy lockdown birthday joanne","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

We decided this is something we can do safely, while also making the community smile, just like the previous flock did, eight whole years ago.#Please get in touchyou would like further details.#To find out how to get involved with the latest #flamingo flocking# campaign, email Agnes Stewart on Ags@yahoo, telephone   or contact the @CGSGambia Facebook page."},{"url":null,"title":"down memory lane may 14 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

The shutdown means the loss of nine jobs at the plant, but local farmers believe the knock-on effect on employment will be even worse.Farmer and shareholder in the company Tony Archibald said: #It could mean the loss of another job on every dairy farm, not to mention the milk tanker driver.#The farmers are looking at ways of opening the creamery. It is very important because it is the one thing we have as a raw material for over here.#The farmers were due to meet as the Courier went to press to discuss ways of re-opening the creamery and they also plan to meet representatives of Scottish Milk.Mr Coffield described the closure as #devastating#. He said: #There#s not a lot of work round here. The main feeling about the place is disbelief.#The creamery produced about  tonnes of cheese a year.FIFTY YEARS AGOColour TV comes to CampbeltownColour television is to be launched in Campbeltown next Tuesday by Redfusion.And to mark the occasion, Redfusion is staging a demonstration exhibition in the town#s White Hart Hotel, where about six sets will be on view.The exhibition will be open to the public for three days.

I am grateful to the Courier reviewer and to the other reviewers in the BBC, ITV and papers from Stornoway to London for giving it such a good start.#My advice to young authors  Stick at it. The first  books are the worst!#His latest book for children, Super Nova and the Frozen Man, is also doing well in hard cover and paperback. Most of Angus#s books are published in European countries, and some in America, but only the other day he heard this one is being published in Japan.#I#d rather have heard that my golf handicap is coming down, but that would be even more of a miracle.#ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOPlease noteThe change in the publishing day of the Courier to Thursday of each week instead of Friday has proved so acceptable to readers, particularly to the large number resident outside the district, that we have resolved to make the arrangement a permanent one.Sparks and flashesA meeting will be held in the Town Hall on Friday evening with the object of forming a branch of An Comunn Gàidhealach in Campbeltown.Neil M#Bain is among the latest of the Ayr United Football Club players to fix up for another season.

We are hugely disappointed by this response and its apparent contradictions.We asked for a permanent solution within the next three years. The email states: #We are not waiting for anything and are pushing on with work at pace#, yet your actions since the August landslide have only created delay.Creating  options for consultation in November , this, we believe, is a time-wasting exercise. Five further options for consultation in March. We strongly believe there are only three real options, with studies on these completed in your  report. Conducting a geological survey which will take eighteen months to complete, a process that could have started last August, assuming you had not conducted such surveys in .We have asked for temporary use of the forestry road, away from the threats posed by landsides. It also states: #We were clear without that information we are not certain the forestry track in its current form is safe for use.# Yet we would argue you already have a Transerv report produced in  by Balfour Beatty and Mouchal Services Ltd for TS which suggested the forestry road could be upgraded in  to  weeks. How did Transerv arrive at this conclusion without a study of the ground conditions being done in advance This situation should be considered a safety, economic and social emergency, cutting through the red tape of consultation and delay. It further declares: #We understand first-hand the delay that can be caused by procedural challenge…there needs to be a careful balancing of accelerating development and procedural risk in order to ensure that we do not end up in the courts.#While we understand the need for the right balance of speed and consultation, we think the safety risks, costs incurred by business and damage to the economy of Argyll, should create the conditions for emergency action, delivering what should be a simple road realignment. This is not HS, we are not asking to blight the countryside, or people#s homes, you do not have whole communities ready to challenge fixing the crisis at RABT.What we want cannot be worse than the damage already inflicted on the hillside without consultation. If you fixed the Rest, we will all be thankful.The following questions still have not been answered in TS#s official reply or in recent press statements:We are business people and understand the need for safe environments, effective procedures, timely management, and cost control, but what we have experienced over the past year does not give us confidence you will address the concerns we have.We are not looking for you to defend your approach, what matters to us is the action taken to bring timescales down and resolve the problem within the next parliament. We are simply asking you to rethink your approach, look at how your team can cut through this #business as usual# process and appoint someone who can find a way to realign two kilometres of the A safely within the next three years.By challenging your approach, we are hoping to see that after nearly a year of delay and ersion, there is a recognition of the cost impact to business, the signicant safety concerns, and that this will continue to blight Argyll as a place to live, work, and invest in until a permanent solution is delivered.We will be working with the relevant politicians post elections and will continue to campaign for a change in approach. We would be happy to discuss what can be done to overcome any constraints you have to deliver a solution quickly and resolve the crisis at the RABT.We stand at a once-in-a-generation crossroads.Earlier this week, a thought-provoking poem, ACCEPTABLE  by the Anonymous Mother # judged for needing a food bank to feed her child # started a nationwide debate about whether the world#s fth richest country should need food banks to feed children.This conversation needed to happen as our food bank crisis has become critical.Last year food banks in the Trussell Trust#s network handed out , emergency food parcels for children in the UK. This surely cannot be acceptable.However, fate has given us a rare opportunity, as history shows us that the best time to create a brighter future is after times of great darkness.The pandemic has been the most devastating event to hit our country since the Second World War, but it also brought out the very best of our nation.We recognised our real community heroes, we protected the vulnerable, we didn#t stand by when kids went hungry.But now, as we prepare to wake up from the pandemic nightmare, millions of British families still cannot afford food on their table.As the Anonymous Mother poetically says # it doesn#t need to be this way.In , Britain woke up to its new dawn at a similar crossroads # go back to the old broken way, or use this golden opportunity to make things better.That great generation chose hope, and created a better, fairer society for all # including founding the NHS.This pandemic has been our generation#s darkest hour. This is now our new dawn, our choice. Will we choose the old broken way, or use this golden opportunity to eradicate hunger in the UK I urge you to do just one thing today, and that is to seek out the poem that started all of this, and reflect.If, afterwards, you agree with me and the hundreds of thousands of other supporters of the Trussell Trust, that we can do better, join us as we collectively create a #hunger free future#."},{"url":null,"title":"photograph of the week may 14 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

I was really pleased to find a company that does dehydrated vegan food in compostable bags, so I bought  meals and have mailed them in batches to post offices around the country so I can collect them as I travel.#As far as training for such an extraordinary expedition is concerned, Ben explained that he has participated in several endurance events, including multi-day running, in the past, but, now three weeks since he left his starting point of Glasgow he is enjoying this trip more than these previous competitions.#I’m loving this as it’s not all ‘Go, Go , Go’. I want to be able to sit back and take time and explore all the dferent parts of the coast. This trip has given me time to write, which is something I’ve wanted to do for a while.#Ben’s blog can be read on his website where he has also written in detail about the threat plastic litter poses to marine le and the environment in general.#I wasn’t brought up by the sea I’m from Manchester,# Ben adds. #I worked at a youth hostel in Ullapool for a couple of years and felt a connection there.#When I’m picking up rubbish on beaches I feel really up and down about it all.#I feel so sad about what I find, and also about the amount that’s below the ocean’s surface. But then I realise I need to do what I can.#On that note, Ben is keen to work together with locals who want to make a dference.He is helping out at a beach clean in Oban this Friday, May . Information on this and how to donate to the John Muir Trust or the Marine Conservation Society can be found on Ben’s www.ukcoastjourney website."},{"url":null,"title":"new member makes his mark at dunaverty","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

It#s a really exciting move as it offers the potential to climb the Scottish football pyramid.#From the club#s point of view, we want to find our standard amongst the new teams joining the set up.#We want to be the best we can be as the senior team of the Campbeltown and District Community Football Club.#With our acceptance into the WoSFL, we can offer a pathway for the youngest age groups right through to the under- side, being trained by Stuart Crossan, into our first team, representing Campbeltown in non-league football.#With that, it#s important to acknowledge the huge amount of hard work that has gone into making Campbeltown#s community club a Gold Merit Award holder, one of only seven clubs in the Scottish Football AssociationWest region, encompassing all of Glasgow and the west. This accolade was a major factor in our acceptance into the WoSFL.#Other factors in the Pupils# favour before WoSFL committee scrutiny included having changing facilities for two teams of up to  players each, a separate referee#s room, and an enclosed ground with spectator barriers.Campbell said of the club#s Kintyre Park home: #The renovation of the pavilion is nearing completion, through a fundraising campaign led by club chairman Alex McKinven.#Campbell added: #The SAFL was a great  for us to play competitive amateur football for  years. In periods, we went through some wilderness years but we have happy memories of successful title-winning seasons, too.#In recent seasons, however, the club became disillusioned with how the league was going, with dficulty getting referees and sometimes teams to travel to Kintyre at a week#s notice – this was not a feature against even rival teams in years gone by.#In the WosFL, our geography could not be a determining factor in league entry as we are SFA West region members, which meant that the criteria we could meet on a match day, and the quality of our community club pathway, mattered most.#Meanwhile, the Pupils are gearing up for le in the WoSFL with contact training resuming on Tuesday evening.The team have been training twice weekly in a non-contact setting to build up their base fitness since March.Campbell added: #Training has been well attended, led by coaches Norman Thomson and Lewis Mackay, and although it has been hard to get the players together with ongoing restrictions, the squad are right behind the move and excited about the challenge ahead.#Campbeltown Pupils are keen to hear from anyone who would be able to help with ground and park maintenance. Anyone who feels they are able to help can contact Campbell Robertson, club secretary.For more club updates, follow @PupilsAFC on Twitter or Campbeltown Football on Facebook."},{"url":null,"title":"budding young photographers make their mark","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Known only to the world mysteriously as #Pat#, he decided to part with his , bottle library last year, through a series of auctions, with a mission to share his passion for whisky with the world by passing his bottles on to new owners.Joe Wilson, head of auction content at Whisky Auctioneer, said: #Fèis Ìle is an iconic celebration of whisky and Islay culture that draws people back to the island year after year.#From Port Ellen to Bowmore and Bruichladdich to Ardbeg, this collection of Fèis Ìle bottlings is without a doubt the largest and most complete we have ever encountered.#The auction presents the rare opportunity for collectors and whisky drinkers to acquire some incredibly scarce malts that have been produced to celebrate the history of this iconic whisky region.#Examples from each of Islay#s eight single-malt producing distilleries feature in the sale, including complete collections of every single limited edition festival bottling from distilleries including Bowmore, Laphroaig and Lagavulin.The sale also features bottles that have been donated to the Fèis Ìle committee by distilleries to raise charitable funds for the island through their Islay Wave Project, which will focus on ways to support culture, artists and youth.Included in the charity lots is the oldest and rarest release directly from the iconic Islay distillery, Port Ellen. The Port Ellen -year-old # Rogue Casks# is the second release in the #Untold Stories# series, which explores the intriguing history of the Islay distillery ahead of its re-opening after closure almost three decades ago.Florence Grey, chairperson of the Fèis Ìle committee, said: #Fèis Ìle was delighted to be given the bottles in this charity auction from Diageo, plus a signed bottle from the legendary Islay whisky maker Jim McEwan.#All the proceeds raised from these bottles will benefit our island community as the funds will kickstart our Islay Wave Project # an ongoing project that will begin after this year#s virtual festival.#Focusing on ways to support our island#s culture, artists and youth, The Islay Wave Project concentrates on everything we celebrate throughout Fèis Ìle.

As German troops advanced through Normandy, the st fought valiantly, protecting French citizens, hoping evacuation by sea would be forthcoming.On June  , German tanks surrounded the ision at the French fishing port of St Valéry. This, alongside a curtain of heavy fog, made the long-awaited flotilla rescue unviable and they were forced to surrender. Those who were not killed in the fighting were captured as prisoners of war and marched to camps in Eastern Europe, where they remained for five gruelling years.Following the commemorations to mark the th anniversary of the battle last June, a remarkable story has emerged. One brave soldier miraculously evaded capture and was taken in by a French family who hid him from the occupying German forces.#We were contacted by Monsieur Patrick Prieur, a -year-old St Valéry resident whose grandparents and father remained in the town during the entirety of the war. He told us the story of the escapee and the tragedy that befell him,# said Dr Claire Armstrong, chief executive of Legion Scotland.#As we approach the st anniversary of the battle, we hope to identy this Scottish hero, give him the recognition he deserves and bring peace to his family.#Patrick Prieur recalled the tale his late father told him: #A soldier from the st Highland Division was hidden by a family in the village. They bonded and the family learned he was a married man with a we and two daughters waiting for him tohome.#For several weeks, the soldier remained hidden but, regretfully, he was eventually discovered by German troops and marched through the town to the municipal cemetery.#After being forced to dig his own grave, he was positioned against the cemetery wall and shot. His death deeply upset the townspeople, who had been aware of his hiding, and especially my father, who was only  at the time.#In later years, the Franco-British military cemetery was built and his body was moved there. His grave is marked as #Known unto God# and my father and other villagers tended to it for decades after the war ended.#Monsieur Prieur added: #My father had been gted a piece of paper on which the soldier#s name was written, #Keller Len Scott#, and this became his prized possession. He desperately wanted to find the soldier#s family to tell them what had happened to their beloved and where he was laid to rest, but having very little information, he struggled.#In  my father passed away and, being eager to finish what he started, I recently contacted Poppyscotland and the Highland Reserve Forces# and Cadets# Association to ask for help.#Michelle McKearnon, head of engagement at the Highland Reserve Forces# and Cadets# Association, said: #We started to do our own research to unearth the fallen soldier#s identity but only got so far. We believe the name order on the piece of paper may have been written in military fashion, with the surname preceding any given names, so the family name might be Keller.#We#re now at an impasse, struggling to find additional information through our own resources, so we need the knowledge of the wider community to continue our efforts.#Dr Armstrong added: #We are urging anyone who believes they know of or has any information about our #Unknown Soldier#, no matter how small, to get in touch.#This brave man fought valiantly for his country and to repay our debt to him for his service would be an honour, not only for Legion Scotland as custodians of remembrance, but for his family, Monsieur Prieur#s father, the people of St Valéry and, ultimately, for all the #unknown soldiers# who sacriced their lives for us.#Anyone with information that could help identy the soldier should visit poppyscotland.org.uk stvalery"},{"url":null,"title":"engines at the ready mach 1 stages rally gets go ahead","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

They did notto the harbour until after pm with the casualty in tow.The following day, Sceptre skipper Tom Smith praised the hard work and efficiency of the Campbeltown leboat crews.Diver Robert Lamont, a member of the leboat crew the night before, went in and removed the damaged rudder ready for Sceptre to be towed by tug to Troon, the finish of the race.The race sails from Oban to Mull, Jura and Arran then Troon, stopping at each island for a team of runners to complete a hill race.Sceptre, with a crew of four, was carrying the boys# team from Glenalmond School, Perth.She had run aground the night before entering Craighouse, Jura. Everything looked fine on the yacht, which was built in Argyll at Alexander Robertson#s Holy Loch yard to compete in the America#s Cup of .#As a precaution, we did not have the boys on board for the tough leg round the Mull of Kintyre to Arran,# said crew member Roger Finbow.#They haven#t missed the race they were on board Blue Damsel, carrying the girls# team.#The decision proved a wise move as not only did the rudder come loose leaving the yacht with no steering, it was flapping wildly and in danger of damaging the hull.As a precaution, the leboat crew put a heavy-duty pump on board but this was not needed.HMS Dragon broke off her sea trials to come to the aid of Sceptre. The Type  Clyde-built destroyer stood by until the leboat arrived.TWENTY-FIVE YEARS AGOCalls were mounting earlier this week for a Scottish Office decision on the proposed ferry link between Campbeltown and Northern Ireland.The Scottish Office has been considering a business plan for state-owned Caledonian MacBrayne to operate the link with Ballycastle in Northern Ireland since the beginning of February.The company needs Scottish Office permission to become involved in the project.But concern is growing that unless a decision is made soon the necessary harbour work at Campbeltown will not start until it is too late for the service to begin next year.Two Campbeltown ambulance men were among six from Argyll recently presented with long service and good conduct medals by the Duke of Argyll.Ronnie Hamilton and Malcolm Black travelled to Oban for the presentation, carried out by the Duke on behalf of HM Queen.The medals are not awarded automatically but are made on the recommendation of a special .The Duke told the ambulance men: #What you do is not a profession, it is a vocation.#He also paid tribute to their families, pointing out the ambulance men worked anti-social hours for long periods at a time.FIFTY YEARS AGOCampbeltown was #switched on# to colour television on Tuesday by the town#s new Provost, William Craig, in his first official engagement.The service has been brought to Campbeltown by Redfusion, the firm which pipes television to several thousand subscribers from its mast at Crosshill Farm.The firm#s Scottish general manager Mr Colin Payne said that Redfusion offers a public service of which they were proud.#We looked at the television problems here. There were just BBC and STV and occasionally Ulster in the town.#We said can we bring to Campbeltown the full range of colour programmes which are available where and the answer to that was #yes#.#There are now six programmes on the system. There aren#t many places in the country which can receive this.#ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOAn English steam liner which called in here for bait one day last week had full bunkers and a plentul reserve of coal in ious corners. She had gone to Ostende for the fuel.A further restriction of the gas supply in the burgh comes into force on Saturday night. The hours during which there will be reduced and normal pressure respectively are given in advertisement.The local branch of the Miners# Union opened a subscription list this week for the purpose of starting a communal soup kitchen. It is not intended, of course, to confine the benefits of the scheme to miners or their dependents. Over £ has already been raised and the committee intend to publish the list of subscriptions next week.A welcome break in our comparative isolation from the mainland was made at the beginning of the week when the steamer Kinloch made a special run to the upper reaches, with mail, passengers and cargo.Many merchants, not only in Campbeltown but at Carradale and the west of Arran ports, were carrying very low stocks and this run was not made a day too soon to prevent absolute scarcity of not a few necessities.Flour, for one thing, was running very short, and the new supplies got by bakers were very much-needed.Alcohol is again tipped as a likely rival to petrol. The new motor fuel is being produced by the Distillers Company Ltd and consists of a mixture of  per cent of alcohol,  per cent of benzole and  per cent of paraffin. The idea of using alcohol is not new, but a fatal obstacle has been the unwillingness of the government to release its hold upon alcohol and permit it to be used for commercial purposes."},{"url":null,"title":"leader may 21 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

These civil engineering schemes demonstrate what can be achieved when there is real political will and commitment to prioritise projects.I realise Transport Scotland has its own procedures for appointing consultants for the design processes and there are detailed environmental impact assessments to be done. It does, however, seem to me that its programming of the Rest and Be Thankful improvement is completely lacking in ambition.As a former director of roads and transport in Highland, perhaps I may be permitted to comment on the long-term solution.I would saythere are no geological features found on the other side of the glen which will cause a repeat of current problems, then the construction of a new road in ersion would cause less disruption to traffic than trying to form landslip shelters or tunnels adjacent to the existing carriageway.The main thing though is for Transport Scotland and their political masters to just get on with it.This week, Scotland#s Charity Air Ambulancemarks its eighth anniversary – after a year like no other.Throughout the coronavirus pandemic, our Helimed crews have never missed a beat maintaining our emergency helicopter air ambulance service across Scotland#s mainland and island communities. In fact we#ve enhanced our service with the launch of a new aircraft – Helimed  in Aberdeen last year – which has already had a huge impact on pre-hospital care in the Grampian, Highland and island regions.In our busiest year ever, our aircrew have endured challenging working conditions, with additional procedures and cumbersome protective and safety equipment as they go about an already dficult and stressful job.But they#re not complaining – this is what the Scottish public ask of them, to save and improve lives, wherever the need arises, and they fulfil their role with courage and pride.Our exemplary performance during this national crisis has been a tribute to how far SCAA has come in just eight years and I, for one, am immensely proud of what the SCAA team has achieved.But our operational teams are acutely aware that we are only able to provide this critical service, thanks to the continued public donations which you have maintained throughout these dficult times. So you are the real heroes in our charity.SCAA is the people#s helicopter – funded by the people of Scotland, for the people of Scotland – and our two frontline aircraft are stood by ready to help you, your family, your friends, colleagues, neighbours or anyone in your community when you most need us.As we mark our eighth birthday on May , we are asking the people of Scotland,they can, to support us into the future. Any donation, however small, to celebrate our anniversary will help to save a le – just like the numerous lives we have already saved over almost , missions.SCAA vows to continue to transform emergency care in Scotland, particularly to our rural and island communities, with your support. Thank you.As a coalition of leading providers of care and support to vulnerable children and young people, we congratulate all MSPs on their election and welcome the consensus there is between the major political parties to tackle the growing mental health crisis in our young people.We have for some time raised concerns over a potential lost generation of vulnerable children and young people, whose mental health is being impacted even further by the Covid- pandemic.There have been dramatically increased waiting times for mental health treatment during lockdown.In December , for example,  per cent of children and young people had been waiting more than a year for specialist treatment, compared with . per cent in , a truly frightening statistic.A commitment by MSPs to focus on mental health, increasing investment in support services and intervention strategies, must be a priority for this parliament, giving our young people the care and support they need, when they need it.The frightening statistics on the deteriorating mental health of many young people presents a compelling case for a radical new plan for our struggling mental health services and for a national crusade to address what is a mental health pandemic, underpinned by considerably greater resourcing.This is a crisis we can overcome, but it will require a similar energy and commitment to that demonstrated for Covid-we are to achieve this and prevent many young people giving up on their futures.At sight loss charity RNIB Scotland, we are concerned the Covid- crisis might have impacted on people who are blind and partially sighted, many of whom are older.We would like to highlight the emotional reassurance and practical help we offer during the coronavirus lockdown and its aftermath.Covid has eclipsed all other health news in the past year but  people still start to lose their sight in Scotland every week. Add to that stress over Covid and the lockdowns and there could be more people needing support and reassurance.Our Need to Talk telephone counselling service remains available in Argyll and Bute and the Western Highlands for anyone diagnosed with sight loss, as well as families, friends and carers.Losing your sight can be devastating news to take in. But our trained helpers can support you in coming to terms with your condition and finding the way forward.The uncertainty during the Covid lockdown over access to basic shopping and medication, a lack of information in accessible formats, the social isolation, the barriers to being guided because of social distancing # these have all added to and compounded the mental and emotional stress people are experiencing.But we want people with sight loss to know they are not alone and that help is available.To contact the Need to Talk service, phone the RNIB Helpline on    or email needtotalk@rnib.org.uk"},{"url":null,"title":"photograph of the week may 21 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

will remain in Level  for at least a further week and East Renfrewshire will stay in Level  - despite high cases in the area.Travel restrictions have also been brought in for some parts of England.Heres what you need to know:The First Minister confirmed that Glasgow will stay in Level  lockdown.Ms Sturgeon said: \"Over the past  days, there have been extensive public health measures deployed across the city - including enhanced testing and vaccination in the areas with the highest rates of Covid, especially in G and G.She added: \"Last week, we were seeing  cases for every , of the population - thats now risen to .\"That increase will partly be due to the fact theres more testing being done, but the percentage of positive tests has also increased from .% to %.\"In summary, we dont think that we have turned the corner in Glasgow yet.\"Let me stress that were confident the major public health interventions underway will be effective, and they will bring the virus rates back under control - but they need a bit longer to do that.\"We also need a bit more time to be confident than we are now that vaccination will stop the rising case numbers today becoming severe illness and sharply rising hospital numbers a couple of weeks from now.\"So for all these reasons, I can confirm today that regrettably, Glasgow will remain in Level  for another week at this stage.\"I know, not least because I live in Glasgow myself, how unwelcome this is for iniduals and businesses - but I hope it wont be for much longer.\"Nicola Sturgeon announced that East Renfrewshire will stay in Level  despite high case numbers.The First Minister said: \"On the face of it, levels in East Renfrewshire - as a proportion of the population - are actually slightly higher than in Glasgow.\"Im acutely aware that people might therefore look at the raw data and sayGlasgow is in Level , East Renfrewshire should be there too.\"But as youve heard me say many times before, and I know this is really dficult, the situation underneath the raw data is often more complex and its the detailed analysis that we must try to base our decisions on.\"For example, while the cases per , in Glasgow and East Renfrewshire are similar, the total number of cases in East Renfrewshire - because its a smaller area, obviously - is signicantly smaller than in Glasgow.\"To illustrate that, yesterday there were actually just  new cases reported in East Renfrewshire - compared to  in Glasgow. More importantly, many more of the cases in East Renfrewshire can be traced to specic household clusters, unlike in Glasgow.\"That means that we think strong and targeted public health measures have more of a chance of stemming the rise in East Renfrewshire, without the need to use wider restrictions.\"Taking all of that into account, our judgement - and these decisions are often finely balanced - is that East Renfrewshire should stay at Level  for now, although this will be kept under close review and well continue to use enhanced public health measures.\"Nicola Sturgeon confirmed that Moray will move to Level  from midnight tonight.Ms Sturgeon said: \"Im very pleased to say that the situation has actually improved very signicantly.\"Last week, the area was reporting  new cases a week per , - thats now fallen to .\"Positivity rate in Moray has also fallen quite markedly, from .% a week ago to .% now.\"In addition, the April- iant does not seem to be as commonly present in Moray as it is in Glasgow and indeed other parts of the country.\"Im able to confirm today that Moray will now move down from Level  to Level , taking effect on midnight tonight.\"This, I know, will be welcome news for people and businesses in Moray - and its been made possible by efforts of local public health teams and the public.\"I would say though that its important to remain careful.\"Being in Level  still comes with necessary restrictions, so please stick to those and do everything you can to help Moray to enjoy more freedoms and more easing of restrictions later this summer.\"The First Minister announced travel restrictions between Scotland and three areas in England.NS: \"However, there are particularly serious outbreaks of the April- iant in three specic areas of England: Bedford, Bolton and Blackburn  Darwen.\"For that reason, from Monday, we are imposing temporary travel restrictions on travel between Scotland and those  areas.\"Soyou were planning to visit friends or relatives, or to say in those areas - Bedford, Bolton or Blackburn  Darwen - you must delay your visit.\"The First Minister said that the iant may be more transmissible than the Kent iant.Ms Sturgeon said: \"In recent weeks, this iant has become quite established in many parts of the UK, including in Scotland, and we have reason to believe it might be even more transmissible than the Kent iant.\"The First Minister said that the latest estimate we have of the R suggests it might be slightly above oneagain.This means that the virus numbers are still growing across Scotland.There have been  new cases of Covid- reported inScotland in the past  hours -.%of tests.According to Scottish Government statistics, there havebeen nonewdeaths in the same period.Fourpeople are in intensive care, with  in hospital with recently confirmed Covid-.A total of , people have tested positive for the virus.The total number of positive cases reported yesterday was .  of these were in Greater Glasgow  Clyde,  in Lanarkshire and  in Lothian.,,people have received the first dose of the Covid vaccination and,,have received their second dose."},{"url":null,"title":"east-links-family-park-welcomes-adorable-baby-llama-dunbar","story":"The Dunbar tourist attraction recently welcomed an array of new arrivals including a baby llama and baby foal.The male llama, who has not been named yet, was born on Monday and is the fourth llama at the petting zoo.A baby foal named Chase was born on May .READ NOW:North Berwick named most tranquil place in UKEast Links Family Park re-opened in March following the third national lockdown.Cameron Bell, park manager, said: ldquoWe have been lucky in the respects that we are an outdoor site, and the weather over Easter time helped a lot, so it has been good to re-open again to the community.ldquoThe first lockdown last year was terrible because we missed a lot of key dates in the Easter and summer holidays.ldquoIt was dficult being closed when you think as an outdoor attraction you could be open, but we are just happy to get going again.East Links Family Park is open to the public but sections of their indoor facilities will remain closed until Covid- restrictions further ease."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.comource srcset=/resources/images/9909925.jpg?htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"list-glasgow-shops-administration-lockdown","story":"Here we look at some of the businesses who will no longer be operating in the city and the ones under threat.Remnant KingsCity location: Howard StreetA total of  stafflost their jobs from the firmrsquos bases in Glasgow, Hamilton, and Edinburgh after the administrators were called in.The firm, which started in Glasgow in , said that although they were historically profitable, they have since suffered from declining turnover and trading dficulties in recent years caused by changing consumer habits.:Glasgow firm Remnant Kings goes into admistration resulting in job lossesOasis and Warehouse GroupCity locations past and present: Buchanan Galleries, Silverburn, Princes Square, and Glasgow Fort.The company behind Oasis and Warehouse went into administration in April when Deloitte was appointed as administrator.All stores haveclosed indefinitely whileonline sales have stopped.Reports say the fashion brands have been sold to restructuring business Hilco in a deal which includes stock but not the  stores or  concessions.Hash Ladha, chief executive of Oasis Warehouse, previouslysaid: ldquoThis is a situation that none of us could have predicted a month ago, and comes as shocking and dficult news for all of us.ldquoWe as a management team have done everything we can to try and save the iconic brands that we love.:Oasis and Warehouse who have shops in Glasgow fall into administrationCath KidstonCity location: Gordon StreetCath Kidston said they will not reopen their shops when lockdown ends.They called in the administrators in April with the closure of shops costing around  jobs.It is understood that the owner of the retro fashion brand has secured a deal to buy back the brand and its online operation.

But there doesnrsquot appear to have been any rebuke for the drugs deaths crisis, their failed education record, missed hospital waiting time targets, rising child poverty rates, the exam results scandal, or failures in local policing.The next Scottish Government has an opportunity over the next five years to make amends for past failures and getting caught up in an independence campaign will only take the SNPrsquos eye off the ball once again.However, the SNP did not win a majority in the election and as a minority government will require support from other parties to pass budgets and any major reforms.The Scottish Greens will likely prop up the SNP in future policy discussions, but this will requirepolicy trade-offs infor budget support.With COP firmly in the sights of both parties as an opportunity to showcase Scotland as a leader in tackling climate change on the global stage, will the Scottish Greens be willing to lend support to independence which could risk the SNP taking its focus off meeting its emissions reduction targets of % by  ndash which it has done for the past two years in a row.They have already said they want bold action from the Scottish Government and now they are in a position to bargain for this.Read more:Indyref and a blinkered green agenda could harm Scottish farmings futureDuring Sundayrsquos Andrew Marr programme, a suggestion of next spring to hold another referendum was put to the First Minister, to which, of course, she said she was contemplating. Nicola Sturgeon hasnrsquot officially committed to a timescale, other than the first half of the next parliamentary term, but it would appear that the media is setting the ball rolling by proposing such a timeline. As much as I have criticised the SNP for pedalling talks of Indyref during a pandemic, journalists are also guilty of fuelling the debate and diminishing print space or airtime for more immediate and pressing issues.Over the past week I have been moving into my new house, which has involved many hours of deep cleaning whilst tuned in to my radio and coverage of the election.Hats off to BBC Radio Scotland team for managing to fill three daysrsquo worth of election coverage with very little to report on other than the one major news story: would the SNP gain a majority Although they covered results and reaction across the entire country, the main topic on every reportersrsquo lips was whether the SNP would have a mandate to hold another referendum. So, for every listener tuned in, we are being told that this is the discussion we need to be having, this is the headline we should all be taking away.In between googling tutorials on how to sand kitchen worktops, I checked in to the community Facebook page for my local village and was struck by the fact that none of the members were remotely engaged in discussions over the election, let alone independence. Like many other communities across the country, this village is still in the grips of a pandemic, so quite understandably, most posts and discussions revolved around Covid advice and best practice, information about the local youth club reopening, as well as a series of church services.Read more:Scottish election: Indyref cant continue to dominate the next five years mdash there are bigger issuesMembers were posting aboutfitness camps and slots which had come available for hairdressers and beauty salons.

It could be your living room or home office, or simply a bright corner of your kitchen or a balconyyou live in a flat. Just wherever you feel good and where you can relax like you would on holiday, surrounded by plants.Are there rules for where you place your plants Plants love light and require it for photosynthesis. However, the amount of light they need to thrive is particular to each plant. For example, cacti and succulents generally love the bright sun on the windowsill.Which plants are likely to give you least trouble Calathea zebrina, aloe, sansevieria, spider plants, pothos and peace lily.How do you match your plants to your decor Find your plants some beautul pots and baskets. Perhaps you could go for a handwoven basket that matches the colour palette and style of your interior. This may be custom-designed, a classic terracotta pot, a vintage planter, or you can even make your own ceramic pots at a workshop.Which houseplants are trickier to grow Usually, plants that grow in very dferent native conditions such as high humidity can pose some challenges when growing them indoors. This includes alocasia, the banana palm and some philodendrons. Others such as the date palm require specic temperatures and lots of space to grow, which can also present challenges indoors.Which houseplants prefer shadier conditions For shadier conditions we recommend the ZZ plant , epipremnum, the Philodendron Brasil, as well as colocasia and azalea.Which houseplants can be moved to a sunny patio or balcony and can be left out in summer As long as temperatures dont drop too muchduring the warmer months, plants like the banana palm, kentia palm, agaves, opuntia, kalanchoe, crassula, haworthia and chamaerops palm can be kept outside at night.Some, like the palms and certain succulents, can even be kept outdoors all year long, but need to be protected from frost. Also ensure the soil and pot are well drained to prevent root rot due to heavy rainfall.How can the plants be cared for when the weather cools Before bringing your plants inside, check them for pests that they picked up outside. Make sure you find them a spot in your home where they get a similar amount of daylight as on your balcony or patio.Expect some leaf drop from the adjustment to new light conditions, which is normal, and help your plant by removing the dead leaves.Avoid any extreme changes in temperature and dont put your plants near or on top of the radiator, or next to a front door that opens frequently, as sudden hot and cold draughts can cause the plants stress.When you bring your plants inside, or when you start heating your home again during the colder months, adjust your watering schedule. Most plants require less water during hibernation, butyour apartment is very dry, use a humidier to keep your plants happy.Also, foliage growth slows down considerably during autumn and winter so you can stop fertilising until spring.Which houseplants will match your chosen destination Moroccan riad: Banana palm, papyrus plant, colocasia, Phoenix canariensis , bougainvillea, oleander, agave.Mediterranean haven: Lavender, Opuntia cacti, eucalyptus, olive tree, any kind of citrus tree, Chamaerops palm.Australian rainforest: Kentia palm, Schefflera actinophyla, umbrella tree, Epipremnum pinnatum, Alocasia brisbanensis, Hoya australis, Staghorn fern.South African safari: Strelitzia nicolai, kalanchoe, Zamioculcas zamiolia, string of pearls, crassula, Euphorbia ingens, haworthia, protea.Japanese garden: Azalea, Japanese spindle, moss balls , bonsai trees, a mini zen garden, Japanese painted fern.Amazonian jungle: Philodendrons of all sorts including monsteras, Thaumatophyllum xanadu, Calathea Burle Marxii, Calathea ornata, Begonia maculata, orchids, airplants, heliconia, dieffenbachia."},{"url":null,"title":"agenda-impact-covid-19-innovation","story":"WORKING from home or living at work  For the  million-plus people around the UK who have done just that over the last  months, itrsquos a conundrum that many have experienced. While research has shown that productivity from remote working has either remained steady or increased under the pandemicrsquos shadow, there is no doubt in my mind that innovation has been negatively impacted.Sure ndash businesses around the world have been innovative in adapting to new ways or working, but the true innovation that keeps the heart of the company evolving and growing has dwindled.Why  The collaborative nature that an office environment provides as teams work alongside one another, or as they head to the kitchen for a coffee, creates an environment which inspires discussion and sparks of creativity or new ideas. However, the virtual boundaries we have been forced to work within have held many businesses back from reaching their potential. Management consultants McKinsey and Company have even stressed that ldquoprioritising innovation today is the key to unlocking post-crisis growth.While technology has enabled us all to keep in touch and connected to colleagues, it has proven tiresome as diaries become overloaded with calls and meetings. It has become easier for people to ldquohide on video calls and contribute little, meaning welose out on the rich ideas they hold. Apprentices have also missed out as remote working means they donrsquot get to see the innovation happening around them. Thankfully, we have also seen that even the leaders of video conferencing companies are beginning to suffer from technology fatigue too. Ultimately, businesses need people and ideas to thrive. If thatrsquos not a driver to bring our teams back together in a physical setting, then I am not sure what is.Given the economic impact that the pandemic has had on businesses, and with Scotland slowly beginning to reopen again ndash quite rightly prioritising the hospitality and retail sectors which were so badly impacted ndash now is the time for the Government to do the same for office-based sectors. We need to be allowed toto the office in some way, shape or form to be able to operate collectively to restore collaboration which will result in innovation. Yes, that may end up being through a hybrid model, but being afforded the opportunity toto the office will help to lessen the impact the pandemic has had on all of us.While the business world has followed the stringent rules that Government has rightly set out to protect the nation, now that we are relaxing these somewhat, autonomy must be afforded to business leaders to make responsible decisions to shape the future of their businesses. This, alongside the rumblings moving through the market that the true impact of Brexit is yet to be felt, means we canrsquot afford to let businesses suffer from a lack of innovation any longer ndash we need to be allowed to correct our own paths. To do otherwise doesnrsquot bear thinking about.Peter Proud is CEO, Forrit"},{"url":null,"title":"letters-government-allowed-human-nature-let-fans-ibrox","story":"In the circumstances it is not surprising that their dedicated fans wanted to celebrate boisterously.However, like many, I was totally appalled at the scenes of Rangers fans all crowding together and behaving so badly. Well, I was appalled until I read that Rangers FC, understanding their fans very well, had tried to pre-empt trouble and ensure a celebration that would be both safe and satisfy their fans enthusiasm.They knew that it would not be possible to stop fans from inidually and separately deciding to go to Ibrox to celebrate this remarkable victory, so how much better to manage the process.In April, the chairman of the club wrote to the Scottish Government suggesting that, on four successive nights, , season ticket holders could be invited to Ibrox to join an in-stadium celebration.The request was turned down on the grounds that it did not comply with Covid rules. In my book this makes the Scottish Government culpable for the scenes in Glasgow, yet I see that the same Scottish Government is now heaping all the blame on to the football club and trying to work out how to punish it.Itrsquos no good Nicola Sturgeon emoting about how she feels our painshe does not understand human nature. The Rangers fans were always going to gather to celebrate in the same way that those grieving over Sarah Everadersquos disappearance were always going to gather in a vigil. How much better in both instancethe governments concerned had recognised the force of human emotion and allowed both events to take place safely, as proposed. Therersquos no virtue in being all bossy and sticking to the rulesit leads to a situation that canrsquot then be controlled. In any case, the Covid rules are not absolutes ndash they y too much between the four nations for that to be true.Judith Gillespie, Edinburgh.DONT BLAME SNP FOR VIOLENCESURELY only someone as blinkered as Brian Wilsonwould attempt to blame the SNP for the violent attacks on the police by unionist mobs in George Square. It is noticeable that the carnage has not been condemned by Tory politicians or by Scotland in Union officials.Mr Wilson also ignores the clear scientic advice that shows poor ventilation in crowded indoor situations combined with the effects of alcohol makes the spreading of Covid much more likely.There is no reason for Scotland to follow Boris Johnsonrsquos disastrous handling of Covid as illustrated by his failure to put India on the red list which allowed thousands to travel to the UK and bring the more virulent Indian iant to Glasgow, thus making it much more dficult to reopen hospitality venues and football stadiums.If Glasgow has to suffer further or extended restrictions thanks to the selfish actions of those Rangers supporters in George Square, then itrsquos guaranteed Mr Wilson will blame the SNP.Mary Thomas, Edinburgh.CELEBRATIONS WITHOUT THE BILETHE headline over Brian Wilsons article states that the \"SNP ... guaranteed George Square chaos\". Younger readers may not be aware of Mr Wilsons long history of visceral opposition to Scottish independence. Does he believe that the poisonous tribalism which afflicts our society in the West of Scotland and beyond and which sustains the dominance of the \"Old Firm\" over Scottish football is attributable in whole or in part to the SNP It may have escaped the notice of Mr Wilson and many others that the championships of SPFL League  and League  in  were also won by Glasgow teams. The smaller and more local tribes which support Partick Thistle and Queens Park were equally joyful and held celebrations which attracted little or no media attention.Willie Maclean, Milngavie.WAS THERE UNITY IN A COMMON CAUSE NEIL Mackay claims that \"sectarianism shows a Scottish face to the world\" .As is understood, the tribal Rangers Celtic Protestant Catholic ide arose from immigration in previous centuries.It is to be hoped that sectarianism in the west of Scotland gathers less publicity when the world looks at Pollokshields and the strong public intervention to stop brutal dawn raids on two immigrants who were from a country far away.It would be interesting to knowthat gathering included many Rangers and Celtic supporters united in that effort to prevent the immigrantsrsquo deportation. Or in the same George Square on Sunday after the Rangers mayhem in the previous hours, who knowsthose united at the peaceful rally for Palestinians from another country far away from Scotland included Rangers and Celtic supporters protesting in that common cause Maybe any future humanitarian-type protestations could show a representation of peaceful Rangers and Celtic supporters in their colours to show the world that the destructive face of sectarianism is promoted only by a flawed section of small-minded people who are outnumbered by the big-hearted people of Scotland. This may help discard bigotry and prejudice as all come together to promote a better face to the world of concern and kindness to the desperate and the downtrodden.Irene Munro, Conon Bridge.CAUSE FOR DISMAY AND CONCERNWE would need to have a heart of stone not to have been moved by the words of Canon Matt McManus . Here we have a man who has clearly spent his le in works for the public good feeling that he has to write such words in disbelief, bewilderment and, perhaps, even despair at the hatred generated toward him in certain quarters.While his sense of dismay will have moved our hearts, it should also be recording concern in our minds. Yes, concern in our minds because we live in a country where such awful behaviour can still arise. No doubt the many true friends of Canon McManus, to whom he refers, will be confirming to him that his many years of work and service are truly valued and appreciated.Ian W Thomson, Lenzie.CHALLENGE UNJUST LAWS IN COURTIF \"the law of the land should not be sovereign over the will of the people\" as suggested by David Gray , then who rules  The answer is simply anarchy.If any law is perceived to be so onerous or unjust the answer is clear: it can be challenged in court and changed by Parliament.This Mr Gray acknowledges in the case of suffragettes .There were many residents in Pollokshields who were not best pleased by the antics of those who chanted and shouted their opposition to the legal removal of two illegal immigrants, especially on the grounds that the timings were religiously inauspicious, that is, the end of Ramadan and the beginning of the Festival of Eid. It transpired that they were not of the Islamic faith, rather Sikhism. Im not convinced that the deeds of the Pollokshields protestors could be labelled \"kindly motivated actions\" by lying under a vehicle and blocking the police.Robin Johnston, Newton Mearns.SWINNEY OFF TO A BAD STARTAS always the news on your front page this morning makes interesting reading.

There are politicians who talk about our country as a one-party state.Thatrsquos Scotland, which isnrsquot even a state and which has a multi-party legislature, elected under a proportionate representation system literally designed to prevent unfair parliamentary majorities.There are also online activists who equate our free press and our public broadcasting to what is seen in places like Turkmenistan.These people: they are shallow they are trite and they are wrong, sickeningly so.There is an irony about the jokes about Berdi and the hyperbolic Twitter-grade rhetoric about one-party-state Scotland. It is that Mr Berdimuhamedovsrsquos corrupt autocracy is being enabled right here in the UK.Last week, the Sarajevo-based Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project or OCCRP ndash an international investigative journalism project ndash revealed some of the wealth of members of Mr Berdimuhamedovrsquos family and where it came from. The Scottish topline: our cottage industry providing shell firms was a big part of the story.Itrsquos a complicated tale, so please bear with me.People in Turkmenistan are hungry. The Central Asian state after the collapse of the Soviet Union depended on Russia buying its gas. In , Russia stopped doing so. The result  Hyperinflation that made food unaffordable.: Secret sanction-busting base - from a Scots council houseMr Berdimuhamedov in  signed a decree giving contracts to seven ldquoforeign companies to import staples like sugar, chicken and sunflower oil to be distributed to the public. The OCCRP this week revealed that two of these importers were Scottish limited partnerships or SLPs ndash a now notorious form of shell firm long exposed in this newspaper ndash and another was a English limited liability partnership.The shell firms, we can discover thanks to new UK transparency rules introduced after a campaign by The Herald, were controlled by Mr Berdimukamedovrsquos nephew, Hajymyrat Rejepov, or his associates.Mr Rejepov ndash who recently used Russian social media site Vkontakte to show off a seven-figure collection of luxury watches ndash did not comment when approached by OCCRP.One of the SLPs named was Staunchest Holdings, registered at a Mailboxes Etc in Church Street, Inverness. It had a monopoly on the import of frozen buffalo meat in to Turkmenistan and had a multi-million-pound state procurement contract under Mr Berdimukamedovrsquos food decree. The business, which was dissolved two months ago, officially listed a friend of Mr Rejepov as its person of signicant control or beneficial owner.: Scotlands a centre of launderingThere are virtual offices or PO Box addresses all over Scotland where hundreds of often opaquely owned shell companies are registered. Over the years The Herald has named many of them. Often the owners of the addresses have no idea who really controls the entities which they host. This business, like the related business of creating shell firms is entirely legal, but barely regulated.Autocrats and kleptocrats need such facilities to survive. A concerted effort in the UK and some other jurisdictions ndash often UK overseas territories ndash would make le very hard for Mr Berdimuhamedov and his ilk. Tens of billions have been flushed out of the former Soviet Union alone in the last three decades via British shell firms, especially Scottish ones. Despots and oligarchs also use British PR firms and British lawyers to make them look good. It is not just their money they are laundering, but their reputations too.This is usually considered a British Government problem. The Conservatives at Westminster have introduced some cautiously welcomed reforms and promise more. Critics accuse them of being half-hearted.But surely it is an ethical issue, not just a political one  Nobody is forcing Scottish people to create and host dodgy firms. Nobody is forcing Scottish lawyers or company formation agents to enable global criminality and oppression. But that is what they are doing, eventhey donrsquot know it.Politicians and the lobbies for white collar professions cannot pretend they do not know this. Because this enabling of corruption and crime is happening right on our high streets. The stink is right under our noses ndash evenwe do not smell it.There have never been free and fair elections in Turkmenistan. The country ranks close to the bottom of most league tables for democracy, transparency or press freedom.We had democratic elections last month. It was an opportunity for a whole range of small parties or independent candidates, some eccentric, some on one fringe or another, to try and have their say.These small outfits tend not have permanent HQs. So they use mail boxes. Often the very same ones as the suppliers of shell firms.Alex Salmondrsquos Alba party shares its virtual office HQ, in Edinburgh, with SLPs. So does George Gallowayrsquos AllUnity, whose official base opposite Ayr bus station is familiar to anyone who keeps up with opaque corporate strictures north of the border. The once proud now tiny Social Democratic Party is based at a mailbox in central Glasgow which entirely legally hosts SLPs linked to endless scandals.This is a meaningless coincidence, of course. These parties have no links to the shell companies. But it made me laugh even more than one of those classic Berdi propaganda videos.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

This does, however, raise another question.The only Cabinet member from the  intake is Angus Robertson, and he is scarcely a new face, having been an SNP Westminster MP for  years.

She has failed to do this and we can now look forward to the continuing costly incompetence which has dogged our public services. Much of the media has likened the reshuffle to a game of musical chairs, and I hope for Scotlands sake that it will turn out to be just that and not something akin to filling the deckchairs on the Titanic.Bob MacDougall, Kippen.* IF John Swinney is as successful as he was as Education Secretary in his new role as Covid Recovery Secretary then we are in for a very long haul indeed. For sure this is a master stroke by Nicola Sturgeon, who has promised not to engage in any discussion of a second referendum until recovery from the pandemic is accomplished.Michael B H Ashmore, Gatehouse of Fleet.* THERE is the story of a tenor who performed at La Scala, Milan and was called back for encore after encore.

But not very successfully, given the result of the Scottish Parliament election.Mr Gordon tells us that since the election there has been a marked surge in activity from these organisations, but as they had long known the date of the election, surely it would have been more to the pointtheyd thrown everything at it in the run-up to polling day perhaps the truth of the matter is that they did throw everything at it, and it just didnt work. The SNP won its highest-ever share of the Holyrood vote, lost not a single seat and made gains, as did the pro-independence Greens.Although saturated with unionist leaflets arriving through their letter boxes, Scottish voters rejected Project Fear, and no matter how the pro-Union cabal tries to dress up the Union, and keep the toxic Tory Prime Minister away from Scotland, the inference will always be that Scots are better off leaving their future in the hands of governments and policies theyve repeatedly rejected. As Mr Gordon admits, \"the idea that the people who live and work in a nation should decide and supply its system of government is straightforward and appealing\" it is also normal, andit can work for every other country in Europe, it will work for Scotland too.Ruth Marr, Stirling.THE MADNESS OF BREXITTHE Brexit fiasco just keeps on giving. Not content with having sold the Scottish fishing industry down the river, the latest Tory betrayal in this post-Brexit brave new world is of Scottish farmers . After flouncing out of the worldrsquos largest free-trading bloc on our doorstep, the Tories are feverishly scouring the Australian Outback for any scraps to replace the monumental loss in tarf-free trade.However, the Australian and New Zealand trade negotiators know how desperately Boris Johnson needs any deal and are not backing down from demanding tarf-free access to UK markets for Australian lamb and beef, undercutting Scottish farmers. Mr Johnson has confirmed hersquoll sacrice our farmers for another drop-in-the-bucket trade deal. This is the madness of Brexit ndash stfing Scottish producers in exchange for transporting inferior hormone-injected Aussie beef and lamb halfway around the world. So much for climate awareness.Thatrsquos how this precious Union really works. The UK, aka the British ruling class, doesnrsquot care about Scotland because it doesnrsquot do equal partnership.

Perhaps Ms Gillespie has her priorities somewhat askew It might always have been easy to forecast that a certain section of the Rangers following ndash for it is wrong to besmirch all, or even most of them ndash were always likely to behave as they did last weekend, but this says more about them than anything . The question is what do about it. To offer a group carte blanche, because they cannot easily be controlled, is going to be perceived ndash correctly ndash by the rest of us as monstrously unfair and would only encourage others to act as they see fit.Moreover, Ms Gillespies comparison of last weekendrsquos \"events\" with the vigil for Sarah Everard is beyond calumny. The latter, albeit against Covid restrictions, would have been a quiet and respectful gathering of iniduals to express their concern about the murder of a young woman, were it not for the heavy-handed approach of the politan Police. The gathering of Rangers fans was, likewise, against Covid restrictions, but do the words ldquoquiet or ldquorespectful come to mind when looking at film footage of these events There are two facts in this sorry embarrassment to our country. First, that the Rangers fans involved last weekend were given no licence to behave as they did. What they did was wrong, and should be condemned without reservation. Secondly that in the circumstances, the police response of containment was about as much as could be done, other than mass arrests, in circumstances which arose only because of the warped perception of certain iniduals of their own rights, and total disregard for anyone .Alasdair Galloway, Dumbarton.POLICE WERE NOT BLOCKEDROBIN Johnstonclearly does not know much about law.

The operation was the arrest of two alleged traffickers, accused of conspiring to facilitate illegal immigration.People smugglers are ldquoTreating innocent lives as a commodity and lining their pockets while people are dying, Ms Patel is quoted as saying without any apparent sense of irony.Plenty of those who had been outraged did a quick volte face and expressed relief that the politician was on the side of right. Dont be so sure: successive governments hostile to immigration have helped create a thriving market for those looking to exploit people desperate to reach the UK.No mention was made of the victims of this type of situation either. No wonder. In January this year Home Office minister Victoria Atkins, the minister for safeguarding, rejected proposals in a parliamentary bill that were designed to provide additional supports for victims of trafficking. The bill, tabled by Tory le peer Ian McColl and co-sponsored by Iain Duncan Smith, asked for trafficking survivors to receive at least  months access to safe housing, support and protection from immigration detention.In response, Ms Atkins said, \"The government does not agree that victims should automatically be granted leave to remain for  months.\"Evenyou struggle to find empathy for victims and prefer a tough-on-crime approach, poorly supporting vulnerable people and then deporting them is a boon to criminals - youre packing off those who can testy to their crimes.Butwere looking for a coherent, humane strategy from Boris Johnsons government then well be staring at an endless blank horizon.\"Take back control of our borders\" was one of the most potent slogans of the pro-Brexit campaign. And yet, when it became vital to do just that, the Tories have spectacularly screwed it.Last year Ms Patel was having fun deploying RAF jets over the English Channel in response to refugees in rubber dinghies while also flying in fruit pickers from Eastern Europe to Pick For Britain because wed run out of migrants.There were reports this week of EU citizens being detained at UK airports and held in detention centres for as long as seven days. They claimed to have been denied medicines, such as blood pressure tablets and contraceptive pills needed to control polycystic oy syndrome.Today, a report from the Independent Monitoring Board details \"inhumane treatment\" of detainees held in Brook House, near Gatwick Airport. Volunteers engaged to scrutinise conditions in custody, found high levels of self-harm, suicidal ideation and serious delays in assessing torture claims.These stories are relentless. Every week, fresh outrage at the UKs inhumane immigration system. It feels never ending.While the Home Office displays relentless confused cruelty, when presented with a genuine, vital need to control the borders, the government failed to do so. Quarantine regulations were eye-poppingly lax. There was a failure to check that people were self-isolating - for the required time, or even at all. The information on how to quarantine was muddled and open to interpretation.And when overseas holidays were allowed, there was a push for people to travel without any real clarity on safety or caution.Now we have a travel traffic light system already being hammered by scientists as incomprehensible and picked apart by the opposition as unworkable. Is an airline consortium in about Boris Johnsons personal texts Last week hundreds gathered in Glasgow to help block the detention of foreign nationals. My colleague Kirsteen Paterson at The National had a vital follow up story about a second immigration raid on the same morning in the city at the same time local residents in Pollokshields stopped the removal of two of their Indian neighbours, mechanic Lakhvir Singh and chef Sumit Sehdev.This other raid went under the radar. While the demonstration on Kenmure Street made international headlines, no one saw the van that came for this other man at the emergency accommodation centre he had been placed in. No crowds gathered, no one lay holding the chassis underneath his van because this removal was unseen - as with others that have occurred this year and that will continue to occur.As Kirsteen Paterson highlights, on May  the UK signed a new deal with India, agreeing to accept  Indian students aged  to  to live and work in the UK for up to two years, the process of ing visa overstayers will be \"swter and more efficient\". The Home Office would not be drawn on whether the two dawn raids against three Indian men in Glasgow were carried out on the same day due to an intention to target Indian nationals as part of this deal.In the push to publicise friendly ties to India, Boris Johnson waited until the eleventh hour to cancel his scheduled trip to the country. Despite the concerns over the Indian iant, flights from Pakistan and Bangladesh were stopped yet in the three weeks following, , travellers from India were allowed to arrive in the UK.Was this lax approach influenced by the immigration deal with India  Was it influenced by a potential trade deal Were at another crucial point in lockdown easing. We were here last summer - cinemas opened, the government paid people to eat indoors, foreign travel restarted and folk shot off to sunny climes with a sigh of relief.Both governments urge personal responsibility, asking for caution in enjoying new found freedoms butrestrictions are eased, however, people will make the most of them - including overseas travel.It is folly to put any faith in the government to safely manage the borders for holidaymakers and travellers with regards coronavirus. It is glaringly apparent that the notion of taking back control of immigration means unfettered cruelty.For a government dead set against free movement, the virus has been allowed to wander untrammelled.

Therersquos no sleight of hand here, itrsquos simply the effect of not havingto pay the full cost of the car from the startinsteadyou only pay for the period from new until the end of your lease agreement. The remainder of the value is thenrealisedby the funder when they sell it into the used car marketplace.The result is that luxury cars are more affordable than you might believe. For example,the BMW  Series Saloon costs as little as pound a month to lease, which includes VAT, road tax and delivery.

We seek assurances, therefore, that  steps will be taken to ensure that this happens. Close collaboration with locally elected representatives, including the island authorities, will be important but we would encourage you and your officials to look at other ways of making sure this happens from the outset.“Needless to say, we would be happy to meet with you to discuss this matter in more detail.  Meantime, we wish you well in the substantial task that lies ahead and stand ready to assist, particularly in ensuring the needs of our islands are front and centre of government thinking.“We look forward to hearing from you in due course.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Subsequent site investigation works were undertaken, and confirmed the presence of oil contamination below part of the area, which falls within the council’s ownership.However, after writing to the MoD, it was in November  that confirmation came that OIC was unsuccessful in its request that the MoD foots the bill for the clean-up operation.According to the MoD, the evidence did not support them assuming liability for the contamination.The ambition to attract new businesses and industries to Lyness, transforming and breathing new le into the area with signicant new job creation, has been held by OIC for years.Its potential and the characteristics the area boasts have been lauded by the authority for some time, but aside from interested glances and preliminary works carried out by companies, nothing has come to fruition.The last of these was in , when plans to revitalise the area into a decommissioning base to serve the oil and gas industry failed to materialise.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

It acknowledges the anxiety that some travellers may have.Loganair chief commercial officer Kay Ryan said: ldquoWe are delighted to play a part in helping showcase Shetlandrsquos stunning scenery and all the great reasons to visit this beautul part of the United Kingdom.ldquoWe are also extremely mindful of our passengersrsquo well-being, and full details of our lsquoFlysafersquo healthy flying protocols are available on our website, along with our lsquoFlexprotectrsquo programme which outlines our flexible bookings conditions as we continue to transition out of travel restrictions.Shetlanders Neil and Natasha Clubb took part in the filming ndash spending the day as ldquotourists enjoying the scenery and famed islesrsquo hospitality.Mr Clubb said being involved was great fun.ldquoWersquove not told many people about it so I canrsquot wait until my friends in Glasgow see it on the TV and realise that itrsquos us,# he said.ldquoThe filming experience was really good fun.

There was a huge amount of rope and all sorts of litter.“Beyond that there was general litter such as Coke bottles, beer cans, and a few face masks. The only odd thing we found was a massive oxygen tank.”Highlighting the volume of rubbish encountered during the clean, he added: “Nearly everyone who came along was from the community and they had seen this litter building up over the last two years.“The beach clean is an annual event we tend to do in April but we had to cancel last year’s so this year is basically two years’ worth including two winter storms’ worth.”When asked how much of the responsibility for the mess he believed lay with local people, he went on to say: “Some of the litter will certainly be from local industry but so much of it will be dropped from people on the island – whether locally or swept in.“The problem is not just local to here, it’s a UK-wide issue.”Addressing the challenges facing the village more broadly, Mr Watson said: “On Friday one of our contractors pulled up two trailers of fly-tipped metal down the side of one of the bridges away from the beach.“That has been years’ worth of local people dumping bikes, climbing frames and all sorts of bits and pieces. Both the Woodland Trust and the Uig Community Trust were speaking today about how we can make a bigger impact through this event, and how we can cover the whole of the community.“There is real potential for the event to be an Uig clean as a whole and not just a beach clean.“A lot of people were saying that it was the first event that they had been to in well over a year, while some of the older people hadn’t seen anyone for months.“It was a real feel-good event from that side of things.“There was a mixture of working-age parents through to retired folks.“It was great to see the kids there and have a chat with their parents. The children were appalled at the amount of litter on the beach, and we were talking about what they can do to help. Getting the message across to them about these matters at an early stage is ideal.”"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Portree-View-scaled.jpg","title":"new skye homes to be sold at a fixed","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine revealed proposals by London-based developer Charlie Garton Jones to build  family homes in Portree on the site of the old golf course off the Struan Road.The plans,approved, will comprise  three-bedroom houses, and five four-bedroom houses, each with a garden and drive, situated on a site of around five acres in total.Mr Garton Jones lodged a planning application with Highland Council in late April this year, and hopes to provide homeowners with an ultrafast one gigabyte broadband connection free of charge for the first five years via the excess capacity the Bracken Hide Hotel will have from the nearby BT exchange.If given the green light, the scheme will be built on land next to where the developer is constructing his -cabin hotel, which is scheduled to open in April .Mr Garton Jones runs an independent estate agency specialising in the sale and rental of residential property in London, which has offices in Westminster, Nine Elms, Cha and Battersea.He also owns the Cow Shed boutique bunkhouse in Uig. report on Mr Garton Jones’ proposals has sparked a heated debate via the paper’s Facebook page over the last few days, attracting more than  comments.Although opinions dfered on the appearance of the houses, the main point of contention centred on whether the homes would be affordable and accessible to local people.Peter Brown commented: “The local community should have the final say. Personally I would think social housing should be a priority.”While Helen Grianan said: “Will these houses be £, or under  If not, they are not affordable housing for locals or key workers.”Calum J Morrison from North Uist was in favour of the scheme saying: “Sounds like a good type of thing in my opinion, the dude seems to know what he’s doing, good luck to him I say!”Annie B Campbell, meanwhile, highlighted broader issues with housing on the island, stating: “Key workers, like some NHS and teachers, are being outbid for most of the houses that come on the market in Skye.“They are not ‘officially’ homeless so do not have enough points to qualy for council housing.“Some are forced to skip between illegal short term lets. This is not simply a locals versus incomers issue.“Key workers coming to fill essential jobs on the island and local families need somewhere to live. There is a very real housing crisis.”Mr Garton Jones said the price of the houses could not be confirmed until planning permission was obtained.However, in the last few days, he took to social media to try to address worries that people on the island will be priced-out of buying the properties.“There has been a lot of focus on the larger family house we are hoping to build but  of the  houses we are building are smaller, three bedroom, houses,” he commented.Kevin McMahon simply asked: “Will there be a first refusal for locals and the children of local families ”In response, Mr Garton Jones said: “I am happy to confirm that the properties will not be sold via the Scottish ‘sealed bids offers over’ system but will be sold at a fixed price on a first-come, first-served basis.“Obviously until we have planning, we cannot sell the houses, but we have opened up a ‘waiting list’., which is the only place the houses have so far been mentioned or advertised – have emailed me to express their interest in the houses.“Many of them do, indeed, appear to be locals, although we will not be checking birth certicates as part of the sales process.”He added: “There are  houses in total, soyou would like your name added to the list, please email me via charlie@gartonjonesChisolm talked about his own chances of finding a home, questioned the effectiveness of the Highland Council in its current form, and underlined the importance of investing in smaller communities on the island.“I am living with my parents, and with my work I am fortunate to still live on Skye,” he said.“Saying that, I haven’t taken any steps to purchase a home as the prices do not justy the property, or are just too expensive.“I know people who have taken steps to purchase but were outbid either at the start or last minute.”Chisolm has worked for CalMac since  and says he has thought about moving to the Western Isles due to his poor prospects of finding a home on Skye.He said: “I have strong family connections to Lewis and Harris, and I might have the possibility of moving across as house prices haven’t been affected as much as on Skye in terms of second homes and holiday homes. However, it is now on the rise as on other neighbouring islands.”Chisolm believes a revamp of the local authority is needed to force meaningful change.“Skye is facing issues linked to the lack of investment and communications. That makes me question why are we governed by people in Inverness and not the people of Skye and the surrounding islands.“I look at the Western Isles, and I’m seeing housing developments across the islands in dferent areas with the goal of helping local people stay where they are from, sustaining school numbers — including Gaelic communities — and helping small areas grow.“That should be critical here and not just developing in Portree. Roads, housing, harbour investments are just a few aspects that link together and time is critical.”He added: “It’s very important for young people and young families to stay on the island with the support of affordable housing, whether that’s purchasing or renting.”Chisolm said he had been encouraged by responses to Iomairt an Eilein’s call to action.“Political responses ahead of the election have been very welcoming and we are grateful for the support,” he added. reported on plans to build a new -home private scheme on the outskirts of Portree.Commenting on the merits of the proposal, Chisolm said: “I welcome the new development in Portree, I’m sure many young people and families from Skye will benefit from thesethey are available at an affordable price.“That being said, I do question why we’re only developing in Portree. I can name many schools in surrounding communities that would benefit from even a half of a development like this.”Painting a stark picture of the dficulties facing townships such as Staffin, he said: “Smaller communities are missing out and our school numbers and Gaelic communities are suffering. This should be a wake-up call to our government and ‘our’ council that more housing investments in rural areas will have more of an impact and better outcomes.“We all have a right to articulate our viewpoints and opinions. Not everyone will agree but that’s what makes a community – having dferent voices for the benefit of our island.”"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_3812694.jpg--.jpg?1621502297000\n","title":"church launches new youth app","story":" THE Presbyterian Church in Irelandhas sought to respond to the impact of the pandemic by supporting and developing congregational le across PCI’s -plus churches with a range of resources. The latest initiative is the brand new PCI Youth App.Rev David Thompson, Secretary to the Council for Congregational Le and Witness, explained that one of key elements of fruitful youth ministry is effective communication, which was challenging before Covid-, but has become even more so in present circumstances. The new app will allow congregations to safely and effectively keep in touch with young people, leaders and parents.”With a number of default ‘pages’, which can then be customised by congregations as their own ‘affiliate’ app, it brings everything together in one place, that is easily accessible to everyone involved in a church’s youth ministry. Congregations with less time and resources can start off with a basic template and build as their needs change, but others may want to be a little more adventurous, which makes it not just a useful tool for these times of additional challenge, but one that will continue to be useful long into the future.David Thompson explained that this makes the App very flexible, “As a Council, we were delighted to receive funding from Northern Ireland’s Education Authority to make the App freely available to  congregations and we have really been encouraged by its steady uptake by congregations. We hope that it will prove invaluable in effectively communicating not only what is happening, when and where, especially when our youth groups can’t meet in person.” "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_3813137.jpg--.jpg?1621509111000\n","title":"moy park offer jab at work to employees","story":"Moy Park is facilitating its Northern Ireland workforce with the opportunity to receive the COVID- vaccination at work.

The trio were cared for at the centre after a number of litters were seized at the port, with puppies being taken into the care of local dog rescues across Mid-Antrim.Originally four puppies were brought to the Ballymena Rehoming Centre by authorities, and were named Neo, Asher, April and Daffy by staff there. However, after receiving an initial vet check-up, they were found to have contracted parvovirus and despite best efforts by the team to help her, April sadly passed away. Conor O’Kane, Rehoming Centre Manager at Dogs Trust Ballymena said: “When they arrived, we could tell they had been through a traumatic experience and that something was wrong. We had them immediately checked over by a vet and after it was confirmed they had parvovirus they began treatment but unfortunately nothing could be done for April. “We believe they were under the age of eight weeks which is too young to be taken away from their mum or to undertake such signicant travel. After around four weeks of treatment, Asher, Daffy and Neo received a clean bill of health during that time, they had relaxed more and really started to come out of their shells. “It wasn’t long before we were able to find them new owners prepared to give them all the love and care they need to live happy lives, despite their dficult start in le.” Paula Boyden, Veterinary Director at Dogs Trust,said: “An ongoing and very serious issue that faces dogs and potential owners is the illegal trade of puppies. Alongside other animal welfare organisations in Northern Ireland, we have been campaigning for stronger and better enforcement of dog breeding regulations. “It is important that an improved, robust licensing system is developed in Northern Ireland in order to tackle unscrupulous breeders and sellers, alongside effective inspection of licenced breeders to ensure the welfare of dogs. As well as requiring every dog breeder to be registered or licensed, these credentials should be a legal requirement on any advertising that promotes the sale of dogs.” Every year puppies are illegally imported into Great Britain and mis-sold via online ads to unsuspecting dog lovers who think they are getting a healthy, happy home-bred puppy. Dogs Trust is urging potential dog owners to follow the charity’s responsible purchasing advice when getting a puppy:  Potential owners should always call the puppy seller beforehand and should never make any payment in advance of seeing or meeting their new pet  Pitfalls can be avoiding by not rushing into purchasing a puppy and following our buyer advice so potential dog owners aren’t ‘dogfished’. Always ask to see puppy and mum together at their home, evenits via video call to comply with coronavirus restrictions. Ask lots of questions and expect to be asked lots of questions as a good breeder will want to know where the puppy is going  All puppies should be microchipped at eight weeks old and registered to the breeder as the first keeper. Potential owners should be able to check whether paperwork such as pedigree papers, microchipping, proof of vet checks and vaccinations, all match  If, for whatever reason, something doesn’t feel right or you feel pressured into buying when you see or visit them, do not proceed and report to Trading Standards  We would recommend potential owners consider adopting a rescue dog before purchasing a puppy, howeveryou are planning on purchasing a puppy, then make sure you do your homework.

And for the first time since the turn of the year, some lucky fans will be there to see it. One thousand supporters of Larne and Linfield will be welcomed back for the Irish Cup final at Mourneview Park in Lurgan tonight. It has been a dramatic journey for the Larne fans, after a controversial semi-final win over Crusaders that saw Crues goalkeeper Jonny Tuffey red-carded in the penalty shoot out. The final will serve as a test event, with fans required to take Covid tests before and after the match while adhering to social distancing while watching the game. Some of the lucky ticket-holders told the Belfastof their excitement for the chance to watch a game — and see this season’s cup winners crowned — after months locked out of stadiums. On the Linfield side, Alex Harshawfrom Moira said he was overjoyed to watch a match in person. “I can’t wait to be honest, I’ve been watching all the matches on TV but it’s just not the same as being there,” he said. “It still won’t be the same as being at a final with , people, but any chance to be there I’ll take it. “I was going to go with my dad but he has health problems so wasn’t able to get to this one.” Fellow Linfield supporter Mark McGuigganfrom Lisburn said he would have preferred to face Crusaders in the final, but was relieved to have secured his ticket. “It’s a long time coming, it’s a long time since and there’s been a couple of embarrassments along the way,” he said. “But I’m glad I’ll be there and was lucky enough to get a ticket. It’s a strange thing to get a Covid test just to go to a football match but it’s all for a good enough cause at the moment.” Stuart Warrenfrom Antrim has his fingers crossed for another Linfield win. “It’s something you look forward to. I think the three Covid tests is a wee bit over the top, but as long as I get to see the match I’ll be happy enough,” he said. With bragging rights on the line, he added: “I could head down with a Larne fan that I work with but I just thought that wouldn’t be a good idea for the drive home.” Linfield fan David Hanthornefrom Coleraine has had both his vaccines and said he felt more than ready to get back to matches. “It’s brilliant being back at any event at all, just being able to get out and do something. Over the past year you’ve really not had anything to look forward to,” he said. “If both teams turn up like they can it’s going to be close. I’m obviously biased but I think - Linfield.” Cheering from the other end of Mourneview Park will be Margaret Fergusonfrom Larne, who will be making it a family affair by taking her two youngest sons Lucasand Caleb , who both serve as ballboys for Larne’s home games. “We’re extremely excited,” she said. “I’ve missed watching football so much … it’s something to lt everybody. We’re hoping to wave the first team off just after pm, then we’ll drive down. “It’s such a great thing for a mum with boys.” Josh Neillfrom Larne said it was “amazing” to be back cheering his team, evenhe has take multiple Covid tests. “If it helps get fans back in then it sounds good to me,” he said. “I’m happy enough to be in a crowd again. I’ve been at games before and it’s really spaced out and there’s no nonsense with the regulations.” Reliving the dramatic semi-final, he said: “I’ve been absolutely all over the place since. I’ve barely slept, it’s been an absolute blur. “I thinkI was on the Crusaders side of things I would be gutted, but obviously I’m delighted. “I’ve been watching Larne get beaten for too long so I’ll take what I can get.” Starved of watching matches for too long, Davy Wilson from Larnehas resorted to desperate measures in recent months. “A few of us have been going along with our ladders to games and we just find an appropriate spot to watch from behind the goal. “For our first away match we went into someone’s back garden and were able to see the pitch.” For someone so dedicated, taking a few Covid tests is a small price to pay. “I’m just happy that the doors are starting to open again,” Davy said. “It might put some people off but not me. I’ve had my first vaccine and I’m getting my second next week.”.app-box.app-box h.app-box a.app-box img Download the BelfastAppGet quick and easy access to the latest Northern Ireland news, sport, business and opinion with the BelfastApp.Belfast Most ReadCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Indoor hospitality and foreign travel to resume as Executive agrees to lt restrictions ‘I lost everybody that day, even though Dee is still alive’ – Andrew McGinley on the day Deirdre Morley killed his three childrenAlex KaneOpinionNot yet born when Good Friday deal was signed, but Joel Keys young voice of loyalism sounds depressingly oldSinn Fein’s Martina Anderson and Karen Mullen reject ‘scurrilous allegations’ of illegality in Derry Jury finds Deirdre Morley not guilty of murdering her children by reason of insanityTop VideosPlay#I wouldn#t rule violence off the table# LCC member tells NI Affairs CommitteePlayArlene Foster: Now is the time for action on NI protocolPlayPolice operation on Rossnareen Avenue in west BelfastLatest Northern IrelandNI philanthropist Martin Naughton no longer a billionaire… but still has £m stashed away for a rainy day Crusaders Irish Cup protest dismissed by authorities as final set to go aheadCoronavirus Northern Ireland: No further deaths and  cases reportedMapping coronavirus in Northern Ireland: Confirmed Covid cases in your area and seven day rolling averageTV’s Dr Christian Jessen ‘constructed reality which did not exist’, court toldLatestNI philanthropist Martin Naughton no longer a billionaire… but still has £m stashed away for a rainy day David Moyes hopes West Ham reward fans with Europa League qualicationCrusaders Irish Cup protest dismissed by authorities as final set to go aheadHarry reveals he turned to drink and drugs in the years after Diana’s deathRoy Hodgson backs Eberechi Eze to recover from injury and have ‘bright future’,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Mid and East Antrim has the lowest annual figure at , tonnes.These areas shipped .% and % of their waste outside Northern Ireland respectively.SDLP MLA Sinead McLaughlin said: The SDLP is strongly committed to the circular economy: treating our waste as much as possible as a resource for further reuse, rather than as material to be dumped or burnt.It is particularly worrying that so much of Northern Ireland#s waste is being sent to other places for disposal.Councils have to up their game, processing wastes in ways that maximise their reuse.We must all accept our responsibility in reducing, reusing and recycling. These statistics are not just embarrassing, they are disgraceful.My local council, Derry City and Strabane, has shown what can be done with its #New  You# service.This takes old items such as furniture and redundant computers, restoring them for new use.Much more could be done along these same lines and I urge consumers to think before they dump.Alliance’s John Blair, a member of Stormont#s DAERA committee, added: Whilst there is evidence we have achieved recycling targets, we are not maximising recycling and circular economy opportunities.He said his party#s Green New Deal plan highlights the urgent need for a review of the current waste management structures in Northern Ireland, including an audit of existing residual waste capacity for landfill and incineration.Exportation of waste is not without risks or controversy.Last December several tonnes of household waste from here ended up in the sea off the east coast of the US while on its way to an incinerator in Orrington, Maine.It had been part of a larger shipment sent by Co Down-based company Re-Gen, which has contracts with councils to collect and dispose of black bin waste.Two cubes of shredded waste fell off a ship when they were being unloaded at docks during a storm, one of which could not be recovered.A clean-up operation ensued for what was deemed a one-off, extremely unfortunate occurrence.Last month the Belfastrevealed tonnes of material left out by people for recycling is instead incinerated each year.In the year to March , % of all local household waste was burned.Of the , tonnes of recycling collected by the roadside, around % was rejected and sent for energy recovery, ie incineration.The news emerged following a Channel  Dispatches programme that revealed some councils in the UK recycle less than % of the waste householders put out in bins.Defending the % figure, Environment Minister Edwin Poots said it is signicantly lower than other parts of the UK, and my department is working closely with councils and delivery partners to improve this fu rther..app-box.app-box h.app-box a.app-box img Download the BelfastAppGet quick and easy access to the latest Northern Ireland news, sport, business and opinion with the BelfastApp.Belfast Most ReadCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Indoor hospitality and foreign travel to resume as Executive agrees to lt restrictions ‘I lost everybody that day, even though Dee is still alive’ – Andrew McGinley on the day Deirdre Morley killed his three childrenAlex KaneOpinionNot yet born when Good Friday deal was signed, but Joel Keys young voice of loyalism sounds depressingly oldSinn Fein’s Martina Anderson and Karen Mullen reject ‘scurrilous allegations’ of illegality in Derry Jury finds Deirdre Morley not guilty of murdering her children by reason of insanityTop VideosPlay#I wouldn#t rule violence off the table# LCC member tells NI Affairs CommitteePlayArlene Foster: Now is the time for action on NI protocolPlayPolice operation on Rossnareen Avenue in west BelfastLatest Northern Ireland‘He’s a snake and a shark’: How Alex Best turned against Martin Bashir over ‘manipulative’ interviewsNI philanthropist Martin Naughton no longer a billionaire… but still has £m stashed away for a rainy day Powersharing could collapseStorey funeral row is not addressed, says BeattieEleven ‘ready to use’ firearms recovered in Co DownCrusaders Irish Cup protest dismissed by authorities as final set to go aheadLatest‘He’s a snake and a shark’: How Alex Best turned against Martin Bashir over ‘manipulative’ interviewsNI philanthropist Martin Naughton no longer a billionaire… but still has £m stashed away for a rainy day Former BBC news boss sidesteps questions on Lord Hall’s role in Bashir rehiringPM tours HMS Queen Elizabeth but denies Far East deployment is ‘confrontational’Road map forof international travel due from Government next week,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

If you have bought there in the last few years, then you should be quids in as values have taken a huge leap in the past  months. It#s so popular that supply isn#t meeting demand, as people moving in are there to stay, meaning fewer properties coming onto the market. The few that have recently become available are so sought-after that they have prompted bidding wars. Average property values here rose by £, in the past year to £,, but local agent Neil Templeton reckons that#s a conservative figure. A director of Templeton Robinson Estate Agents, he says: It#s been a good market since we came out of the first lockdown in June of last year but it has been particularly busy since Easter. I think that#s because people are seeing light at the end of the tunnel now, with the number of Covid cases down and vaccines being rolled out. While some people will have a tough time ahead because of employment, others have been told their jobs are safe. The dynamic of what people are looking for has changed and generally people want more space internally and externally. Also a lot of people have been told by their bosses that they will continue to work from home for the foreseeable future. Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseBelmont FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueBelmontPeople are attracted to this area by the great schools and many restaurants and shops and the close proximity of the City Airport. We also have something for everyone in terms of price brackets as there are houses from £, to £m.There are also people moving back home from England because they have the option of remote working. Neil says: They are looking for a better lestyle, a better education for their children, savings on school fees as well as a lower cost of living. These are people who maybe worked in London but have now been told they can work from home. We recently put a four-bedroom semi on the market at £, and had four bidders, three of them from England. The house sold for £,. The biggest increase has been in terraced properties, up by almost £, from £, to £,. He says better mortgage products - some at % LTV - have fuelled growth, especially for first-time buyers. If you can get your hands on a -% deposit then you can buy a terrace house in east Belfast and have mortgage payments which are lower than rent. People have been able to save money during the pandemic and a lot of first-time buyers are being assisted by their parents to get on the housing ladder. Semi-detached houses are at a premium, rising in price over the past year from £, to £,. Agents are now facing a shortage of houses and unabated demand. Neil says: There is very little land left to develop in east Belfast and generally people moving into the area are moving in to stay. Those already here don#t want to move so there aren#t enough properties for sale to meet demand. .app-box.app-box h.app-box a.app-box img Download the BelfastAppGet quick and easy access to the latest Northern Ireland news, sport, business and opinion with the BelfastApp.Belfast Most ReadCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Indoor hospitality and foreign travel to resume as Executive agrees to lt restrictions ‘I lost everybody that day, even though Dee is still alive’ – Andrew McGinley on the day Deirdre Morley killed his three childrenAlex KaneOpinionNot yet born when Good Friday deal was signed, but Joel Keys young voice of loyalism sounds depressingly oldSinn Fein’s Martina Anderson and Karen Mullen reject ‘scurrilous allegations’ of illegality in Derry Jury finds Deirdre Morley not guilty of murdering her children by reason of insanityTop VideosPlay#I wouldn#t rule violence off the table# LCC member tells NI Affairs CommitteePlayArlene Foster: Now is the time for action on NI protocolPlayPolice operation on Rossnareen Avenue in west BelfastLatest News‘He’s a snake and a shark’: How Alex Best turned against Martin Bashir over ‘manipulative’ interviewsNI philanthropist Martin Naughton no longer a billionaire… but still has £m stashed away for a rainy day Former BBC news boss sidesteps questions on Lord Hall’s role in Bashir rehiringPM tours HMS Queen Elizabeth but denies Far East deployment is ‘confrontational’Road map forof international travel due from Government next weekLatest‘He’s a snake and a shark’: How Alex Best turned against Martin Bashir over ‘manipulative’ interviewsNI philanthropist Martin Naughton no longer a billionaire… but still has £m stashed away for a rainy day Former BBC news boss sidesteps questions on Lord Hall’s role in Bashir rehiringPM tours HMS Queen Elizabeth but denies Far East deployment is ‘confrontational’Road map forof international travel due from Government next week,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

A young girl and two women were injured.“I try not to show any worry or stress, because that would make the nurses and mothers worry as well.“I try to explain what they will experience — but most of these children don’t have sirens and bomb shelters at home.”She added: “Our staff works hard to make sure everybody is okay. It’s dficult for them. The mothers from Gaza are naturally concerned about their families there.”In the early nights of the conflict everyone involved with Sach slept in the building’s air raid shelter as Holon, south of Tel Aviv, was in the line of fire.Laura volunteered for Sach, which is a non-profit organisation funded by Israel, after her own son was old enough to attend nursery school.She works at the Edith Wolfson Medical Centre — the Sach headquarters — which, apart from administrative offices, is also a temporary home for  children, mothers, nurses and medical professionals.“At the moment, the patients from Gaza can’t go home,” said Laura, who has been the humanitarian charity’s ‘house mother’ since .“It’s an extremely dficult and sad situation. Let’s hope it comes to an end soon and everyone is able to go about their normal daily lives once again.”Sach, which offers free treatment primarily to children from developing countries who suffer from heart disease and cannot get adequate medical care at home, was founded in .It doesn’t treat Israeli children, who benefit from health insurance and receive excellent medical care in other hospitals.Of the Gazan children currently being looked after, one is an infant, another  months old and a third six years old.Two are accompanied by their mothers and another by a grandmother.Other Muslim patients include a -year-old from Kosovo and a one-year-old and six-year-old from Zanzibar.The staff helped the Muslim youngsters celebrate Ramadan, the month of Islamic fasting, which ended on May .Laura said there were three important words that the children — who are never segregated — understand.‘Kula’ and ‘kulala’ mean ‘eat’ and ‘rest’ respectively in Swahili, while ‘balagan’ is Hebrew for ‘chaos’ or ‘mess’.“The job got so much easier after we moved into a purpose-built centre  years ago,” said Laura, who’s multi-lingual.“We normally have up to  children at one time here in the house.”.app-box.app-box h.app-box a.app-box img Download the BelfastAppGet quick and easy access to the latest Northern Ireland news, sport, business and opinion with the BelfastApp.Belfast Most ReadCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Indoor hospitality and foreign travel to resume as Executive agrees to lt restrictions ‘I lost everybody that day, even though Dee is still alive’ – Andrew McGinley on the day Deirdre Morley killed his three childrenAlex KaneOpinionNot yet born when Good Friday deal was signed, but Joel Keys young voice of loyalism sounds depressingly oldSinn Fein’s Martina Anderson and Karen Mullen reject ‘scurrilous allegations’ of illegality in Derry Fury as loyalists warn of ato violenceTop VideosPlay#I wouldn#t rule violence off the table# LCC member tells NI Affairs CommitteePlayArlene Foster: Now is the time for action on NI protocolPlayPolice operation on Rossnareen Avenue in west BelfastLatest WorldDoctors optimistic about health of Malian woman’s nine babiesOlympics will go ahead evenTokyo is in state of emergency, IOC chief saysNato will continue to train Afghan soldiers after exiting country, says chiefIslamist political party leader killed in Pakistan bomb blastSpain s , migrants to MoroccoLatestNI philanthropist Martin Naughton no longer a billionaire… but still has £m stashed away for a rainy day Eleven ‘ready to use’ firearms recovered in Co DownDavid Moyes hopes West Ham reward fans with Europa League qualicationCrusaders Irish Cup protest dismissed by authorities as final set to go aheadHarry reveals he turned to drink and drugs in the years after Diana’s death,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

She didn’t know how to live without alcohol. It was used as a coping mechanism to suppress underlying trauma. But, she says, after reaching out to addiction support group Heal the Hurt , her recovery has been ‘astounding’. “Heal the Hurt has helped me to realise that childhood trauma was not my fault, to face my past and see it as the past, not my today. googletag.cmd.push “With the help of group therapy in a safe environment of discussion and no judgements I slowly started believing in myself again with the help and power of the  steps to recovery.” She adds: “I now have a new thinking process, I had to relearn a lot of things that I thought were true about me and I see now that I was sick and trying to get better.” The woman, who wished to remain anonymous to avoid destabilising her recovery, says she had to confront her own ‘selfishness’ the ‘hurt and trauma’ that was being passed on to the next generation. googletag.cmd.push Breaking the cycle of alcohol abuse was key, she says, to ensure that her children and grandchildren never know that pain. She is proud to have climbed that mountain: “Those were my wildest dreams that I thought I would never achieve and now I am with the help of Heal the Hurt. “It’s amazing for everyone, especially my children. They got their mammy back and I got to be their true, amazing mammy again and their world. “I do my best not to judge or be judged, it’s all part of my recovery.” At group sessions she now leads by example by helping others to ‘see the beauty of not being a slave to addiction - to see the beauty in the world, not the darkness.’     DEVASTATED FAMILIES HTH founder, Liam Stewart, himself a recovering addict, says the addiction charity has gone from ‘strength to strength’ despite dficulties posed by the pandemic. Numbers attending have almost doubled. Last year the NI health service recorded over . million anti-depressant prescription items at a cost of over poundm. Mr Stewart points to the amount spent on anti-depressants in Northern Ireland as evidence of the need to address a mounting mental health crisis. While anti-depressants aren’t specically categorised as addictive, abuse of other types of prescription medication locally is of great concern to the Derry man. He says: “People were forced to stay at home over the past year where they drank more than usual to cope with the stress. “Their medication seemed to increase and it’s understandable that a lot of people crossed the line and are now in addiction.” Alcohol misuse alone costs Northern Ireland as much as pound million a year, with up to pound million of this falling on an already stretched Health and Social Care sector. Despite these signicant costs, the Department of Health allocates a relatively small budget to tackling the problem - pound million for implementation of its Drugs and Alcohol strategy, and a further pound million for statutory addiction services from the mental health budget. That represents around five per cent of the budget, according to the Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency . Derry and Belfast have the highest mortality rates related to alcohol mis-use in the North. Speaking candidly, Mr Stewart explains: “The depths of addiction in our very own group has claimed the lives of  people, the youngest being only  – families that are devastated forever. “Our referrals have doubled since July last year with the impact of Covid. “I believe Heal the Hurt has been a leline to many people, where there’s no appointment needed and people are made very welcome. Our service is also free of charge.” SMILES Underlining that point, another member of Heal the Hurt shared their experience with the Derry News. As a parent to three boys, he had attended with his GP and other health professionals but felt that ‘no-one understood’. He fell deeper into a hole of alcohol and drug abuse before finding the motivation to attend Heal the Hurt on the recommendation of a friend. While anxious at first, he grew more comfortable as other people recounted experiences similar to his own. “I decided to give the programme a go, today I am in recovery. “I never thought I could imagine a le without drink and drugs, yet here I am today, focussing on what’s really important, understanding it’s all about giving back, it’s about my boys and family.” He concludes: “My actions today are having an impact on my three boys and family. I used to bring only tears to my family, now today, I bring smiles. “Is it hard  Of course it is, it’s tough, but looking at my children and family smiling now is what’s important. “This makes me hungry for more of this programme and more of Heal the Hurt.” Meetings are currently held in a small room at the back of Northside Shopping Centre in Galliagh. Since it was established, Heal the Hurt’s path has not been straightforward, it has faced the threat of closure on more than one occasion. However, Mr Stewart expressed his gratitude to the local community for their ‘generous donations’ which have allowed the doors to remain open.  Group member, Brandon McManus , is the latest to kindly donate pound. “These people are saving lives and reuniting families. That’s priceless,” Mr Stewart says. Special mention was given to the Friars of Renewal for their input over the past five years, particularly Brother Patrick, who Mr Stewart described as one of his best friends. Brother Patrick is now living in New York where he is continuing to help people with addiction.

Mourners at the service in Our Lady of Mercy Church in Lavey heard how Catherine showered the children she taught with love and was devoted to her family. Officiating at the funeral, parish priest Fr Eamon Graham said she was a beautul person. “If I was to mention this morning all the people who Catherine loved and who she in turn was loved by, we would be here all day,” he told the congregation. “The past few days I was trying to think how I would sum up Catherine she was beautul inside and outside, in every aspect of le. googletag.cmd.push “She loved all the good things in le. She always had her hair done and presented herself better than any of the rest of us. “Behind that, it wasnt a facade. It was a reflection of the goodness within her. She lived her le in a wonderful way.” Fr Graham told those gathered in the church how Catherine had doted over her many nieces and nephews, and encouraged them to keep her memory alive by following her example. Her love of both those in her family and the children she taught was central to her le, a le in which her faith was strong. googletag.cmd.push “You know every child she ever taught, because she brought all the childrens bothers and woes home. She loved the children she taught, particularly in Creggan,” he said. “She had a special love of her godchildren because her faith was important. She loved God deeply and many people are closer to God today because they encountered Catherine.” A proud Lavey woman, she was deeply involved in the local community. She attended the local primary school and was steeped in the areas GAA tradition. “In our own parish, Catherine was so involved in the GAA, the camogie. She was a pupil at our school and the teachers remembered her as a pupil and a student teacher,” said Fr Graham.     “When she was dealing with student teachers, she always went the extra mile. Teaching wasnt just a job for her, it was a vocation. “She was a perfectionist in every way possible, but she missed her mummy. It is our hope, prayer and belief that she is with her mother and with God.” Erins Own GAC led their own tribute to Catherine online. “Lavey GAC is greatly shocked and saddened to learn of the untimely death of our former senior camogie player, Catherine McCann,” they said. “Today and forever well remember Catherine McCann. Every team with Catherine on it was a better team.” Catherine taught for  years in Creggan Primary School, near Randalstown, County Antrim, and the school paid tribute to her kindness. “Miss Mc Cann taught in our school for  years. She was a model teacher in every way, always putting her pupils first,” they said. “An amazing friend to all the staff and parents and her displays of kindness to everyone she met came so naturally. “She always arrived to school dressed in the latest fashion and then quickly pulled the trainers on her to deliver sports lessons in her lovely pink trainers. “We cannot even begin to realise the void that is left in Creggan Primary School.” Concluding the homily at her funeral mass, Fr Graham said she had touched the le of every person she encountered. “I cant sum up Catherine – I wouldnt even try to – but the thought thats in my head is that she wove a thread of gold through le,” he said. “It touched every person she encountered and it was made out of love. Its up to the rest of us to take up that thread and bring it through le. “Thats the greatest tribute everybody can give.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The seven-acre site at Bay Road faces onto the River Foyle. The site has long been used as a fuel depot. However, last year a large number of people put their name to a petition objecting to a bid for a coal screening operation on the site. The site has now been placed on the market. Although zoned as ‘white land’ the fuel yard could have development potential, particularly with the progress on the nearby Fort George site. The Department for Communities decision to sell part of the site to the Western Trust in March marked the latest step in the ambitious project. googletag.cmd.push The land on the river front of the Bay Road coal yard was also recently acquired for the new cross border cycle network, which will include a new pedestrian and cycle bridge across the Pennyburn Inlet. The sale of the Bay Road site is being managed by TDK Commerical Property Consultants. In the sales brochure, it states: “The site measures approx. . acresand was previously used as a coal storage and distribution yard. The site benefits from  large warehouses, office building and a large covered storage area. “It has roughly  m of frontage on-to the River Foyle and this could be extended up the Pennyburn Inlet by around m.” googletag.cmd.push  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The Derry News has learned that Home Bargains is keen on opening a new outlet on the large Waterside site. The Lisnagelvin Leisure Centre site was put up for sale last year by its owners Derry City and Strabane District Council with an asking price of pound,. It is understood that there was strong interest in the site from potential buyers. However, the council has confirmed that a preferred bidder has been approved by the councils Business and Culture Committee. That decision will now need to be ratied at the councils full monthly meeting later this month before the final details of the sale can be processed. googletag.cmd.push While all those involved in the sale of the key Waterside site are remaining tight-lipped, the Derry News understands that the preferred bidder would see Home Bargains opening a new store on the site. This would involve the demolition of the former leisure centre building and the construction of the new store. The Derry News contacted Home Bargains, who already have a store at Strand Road in Derry, about their plans for further expansion in the city. However, a spokesperson for the company said they were not able to comment at this time. A spokesperson for the local council said a report was brought before the Business and Culture Committee last week in confidential business seeking members approval for the appointment of the preferred bidder for the purchase and development of the Lisnagelvin site. googletag.cmd.push “This decision will come before Full Council for full ratication at the end of the month,” the spokesperson said. “Once ratied Councils legal services team will engage with the successful bidder to commence legal formalities for the disposal and development of the site in accordance with the Conditions of Sale set out in the tender documents.” ​Lisnagelvin Leisure Centre closed several years ago. The leisure centre was hugely popular with generations of young people in the city, especially because of its swimming pool and its famous wave machine. Since being closed, the building has been empty and there has been much debate about the future use of the large site.      --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Sandra was first and foremost a devoted family woman and she will be sorely missed by them all. Sandra believed thatyou want something then you work for it and Sandra worked all of her adult le. She loved her many holidays whether it was heading to the sun or a weekend in Donegal. googletag.cmd.push Without doubt, her most cherished holiday was the one to Gracelands in Memphis to the love of her le Elvis. He was the only rival Jim had, but dont tell Jim, she would say. Sandra worked for  years in Foyle College kitchen, a job she loved. She often said, Jim took the children to school and she fed them. Jim is a driver with Ulsterbus. At Foyle, Sandra made many lelong friends and enjoyed many nights out with them. The sad news of her passing totally devastated them and they gave her a beautul guard of honour at her funeral. googletag.cmd.push Music and dancing were always a very important of Sandras le. She was a s and s child and loved the music from that era. Sandra took part in the Strictly Come Dancing shows with Jim to help raise money for the Foyle Hospice. This became a great source of pride for Sandra. The Ulsterbus dinner dance was another important date on her calendar. She hit two birds with one stone with this one weekend away and some great dancing. Sandra, of course, was a legend to her children, there was nothing she wouldnt got through for them. Sandra held birthday parties for them every year even though they were ,  and .     Sandra first got cancer in  and beat it. She had a year and a half free of it before it came back in October . This time it was in her breast and lungs. Sandra was a fighter and never gave in. She so wanted to beat it again but unfortunately it became too aggressive with infections and the load was too much to beat. It was only right that Sandra passed away quietly and peacefully surrounded by her loving family. The only way we can describe Sandra is by saying she was as beautul on the inside as she was on the outside. The world is a sadder place for Sandra not being in it. God rest you Sandra.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Kick off :pm. Ruaidhri Higgins has had to plan without both players with both serving a one-game suspension with striker Parkhouse receiving his fth yellow card at Shamrock Rovers last week, while Lafferty was sent off at Tallaght. City’s away form has improved considerably in the short time with Higgins in charge, with City picking up seven points from Sligo Rovers, Bohemians and Rovers. They now face a Waterford side who have been badly affected by Covid- in recent weeks, playing a reserve side in a - drubbing against Drogheda United, before being unable to field against Sligo Rovers. Waterford are currently bottom of the Premier Division, but Higgins is expecting a stern challenge. googletag.cmd.push “They have had a good period of not playing any games so they will be well rested and they have had a lot of time to prepare for this game,” he said. “They’ll be nice and fresh for this game and they will have had a lot of time to analyse us and analyse our strengths and weaknesses. There is a new manager coming in as well so you would expect a reaction from the players.” City though are confident after holding the champions to a - draw last week, a game they could well have won but for a very controversial equaliser to stand. googletag.cmd.push “Our away form has been very, very good against three of the top teams in the country we’ve taken seven points so it just shows that there are strong characters in this group and good players as well,” Higgins said. “We’ve set a standard on Saturday and we have to maintain that. We have to follow up on the performance against Shamrock Rovers and back it up with another good performance. Disappointed Meanwhile, Derry City fans hoping to attend this Monday’s game against St. Patrick’s Athletic have been left disappointed. The club released a statement yesterday explaining that despite recent changes by the Northern Ireland Executive, it was still too soon to allow supporters back into the Brandywell.     “Based on the current high rates of covid- transmission in the city, the Medical Director at the PHA has recommended that supporters should not be permitted to attend at this time,” it read. “In the interest of the health and safety of supporters, players and staff it has been agreed therefore that Monday nights match should remain behind closed doors. “We will continue to discuss a way forward with the relevant public authorities and will keep supporters informed of progress.” The club have also confirmed that Manchester City youngster Joe Hodge will not be ing to the club following an injury.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

That was the last we heard from him.ldquoI was listening to the news all afternoon to hearthere was anything happening. It wasnrsquot until pm that night when I was listening to the RTE news that I heard a priest had been shot in Ballymurphy.Mr Mullan knew in his gut that it was his brother, but could not bring himself to tell his parents, John and Mary.ldquoAll that was said that he was shot, it didnrsquot say he was dead. He was actually dead within  minutes of being shot, he continued.ldquoWe were phoned around am and I found out he was dead. I called the doctor just in case my mother would get badly upset and she was badly upset after the doctor told her. I couldnrsquot bring myself to tell her.ldquoMy father was up the stairs and couldnrsquot come down the stairs but he knew it was bad news.Mr Mullan said it took the Ballymurphy families a few years to organise in order to campaign for truth and justice as a  inquest recorded an open verdict in all the deaths.He has been involved with the campaign for a new inquest for over  years, travelling to Dublin and Brussels and beyond on order to plead the familiesrsquo case.Mr Mullan, his niece Geraldine McGrattan and son Hugh had been regular attenders over the  days the inquest was held.The family, including Mr Mullanrsquos late sister Teresa, lived for a time on the Strand, beside the Portaferry Hotel.While Mr Mulllan took after his father and spent his working le fishing, Fr Mullan spent a year in the Merchant Navy before opting to go to Queenrsquos University and then Maynooth College to train to be a priest.He served for a time at St Josephrsquos Church in Killough before moving to Dunloy for nine years. While his funeral was held in Belfast, he was buried in St Patrickrsquos graveyard in Portaferry.ldquoHugh baptised all my family, he married me and my we Mary, so he was very close to us all, said Mr Mullan.He recalled how his brother loved to sail in Strangford Lough and entertain his family or parishioners by singing along to his guitar.But most of all, Mr Mullan mourns what his brother could have done for others.ldquoHugh was the type of priest who needed to be among people all the time, helping people, he said.ldquoHe was someone who would have given anyone anything he had, even his last penny. He particularly liked to help young people and loved working and encouraging them.ldquoIf he had have got a chance in Ballymurphy, he would have helped the people no end to help themselves. Thatrsquos what he aimed to do with people and was always thinking of dferent things that he could start.Mr Mullan thanked everybody who had called him or send cards over the week and in particular, local priest, Fr Feargal McGrady, for his help and support over the years.Mr Mullanrsquos granddaughter, Mairead OrsquoHare, added: ldquoThese families have fought so tirelessly over the years to get justice for their loved ones, it has been both inspiring and heartbreaking to watch.ldquoI never met my great-uncle, but the stories my Granda tells regularly make his presence known and you can easily tell that the love my Granda has for his brother has never ceased.ldquoHe has known for the last  years that his brother was innocent, he didnrsquot need a coronerrsquos ruling to know that, but having Fr Mullan declared innocent to the entire world has brought much needed comfort and peace..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/19May2021-World.jpg","title":"‘World knows Hugh was innocent’  ","story":"THE family of Ballymurphy Massacre victim Fr Hugh Mullan have welcomed a coronerrsquos ruling that he was an innocent ldquopeacemaker.The Portaferry priest was shot dead by soldiers as he tended to a wounded man on waste ground in west Belfast on August  .Fr Mullan and nine others shot dead were all exonerated in an inquest ruling by a coroner last week.At the time the Army reported that the nine men and one woman who died were Republican gunmen killed in crossfire.The first to die over the three days of shooting, Fr Mullan had only served a a church for seven months.Mrs Justice Keegan said in her findings that he was ldquounarmed, not acting in any way as a threat, attending to a wounded man in the field and waving a white object as a sign of his peaceful intentions.ldquoHe died as a result of gunshot wounds to the chest and abdomen. The shooting of the deceased has not been justied by the State. The use of force by the Army that resulted in his death was disproportionate.Fr Mullanrsquos youngest brother, Patsy, said that he and the rest of his family always knew the  year-old priest was innocent.Now , he said the first learnt something was wrong when he heard that a priest had been shot in Ballymurphy that day on the RTE late news.ldquoI knew right away it would be him, he was the type of person and would be out to help anyone in trouble or who was injured. That was just his nature. Unfortunately it was his downfall, said Mr Mullan, who still lives in Portaferry.ldquoHugh was the type of priest who would have been among people all the time, helping people.ldquoHe was someone who would have given anyone anything he had, even his last penny.Mr Mullan was left unimpressed with an apology that Prime Minister Boris Johnston made in a call to former First Minister Arlene Foster.ldquoI wouldnrsquot have wanted an apology from him actually. I donrsquot have much time for him at the best of times because I donrsquot think hersquos the best person for that job.Mr Mullan, his niece Geraldine McGrattan, his son Hugh and other family members attended nearly all  days the inquest since it started in November .Mrs McGrattan said that hearing the judgersquos findings ldquolted a weight of me.ldquoIrsquove known for the past  years that Hugh was innocent but now the world knows, she said.ldquoTo hear him call him a peacemaker was very touching. It was as though that I had been coiled up in a tight spring and suddenly just released. It was a great day..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/19May2021-Ardglass.jpg","title":"Ardglass fishermen sign up to marine litter project  ","story":"A NEW initiative has been launched which aims to reduce the amount of litter in the sea.Spearheaded by the Northern Ireland Fishery Harbour Authority, a number of trawler owners based in Ardglass have signed up for the new lsquoFishing for Litterrsquo scheme designed to help protect marine le.The village hosted a launch of the new scheme with trawler skippers and Fishery Harbour Authority officials last Friday and were joined by representatives from the Northern Ireland Fish Producersrsquo Association.The lsquofishing for litterrsquo scheme is designed to reduce the amount of marine litter by physically removing it, with the new initiative also highlighting the importance of good waste management amongst the fleet.Participating vessels are given hardwearing bags to collect marine litter that is caught in their nets during their normal fishing activities, with the waste subsequently deposited at participating harbours on the quayside where they are moved to a dedicated skip for recycling or disposal which has a positive impact on the environment.The scheme is being launched at the three Co Down ports of Ardglass, Portavogie and Kilkeel with fishermen highlighting their frustration about marine litter which can be found in rivers, lakes and seas across the globe.A walk along any coastline will reveal a rainbow of colour where there should just be sand and stones with plastic the real reason that marine litter is such a big issue.Jenny Lau mdash the Fishery Harbour Authorityrsquos environment officer who was in Ardglass last Friday mdash explained that a plastic bottle is typically used for less than  minutes before being discarded, after which it takes  years to break down.ldquoEven then, it will break down into smaller and smaller pieces known as micro plastics which are still harmful. This means that plastic litter in the sea is just adding up and, globally, we are adding a truck load full every minute, she continued.ldquoThat is a lot of plastic and, on top of looking bad, it is harmful to sea plants and animals. Every year, plastic kills , sea animals and over a million sea birds. It is a big problem.During last weekrsquos launch event in Ardglass, a number of fishermen told Jenny how sad they were to see how much litter is in the sea and that they have noticed an increase in the amount of it in during their letimes.ldquoIt also takes their valuable time at sea to clear from their nets and can potentially contaminate their catch, so the new scheme is a win-win for them to do their part in getting rid of it.Describing the new project as ldquoinnovative, Jenny said it has already been successful where with fishermen bringing marine litter caught in their nets back to shore.She said the Harbour Authority provides durable bags for the litter to be collected in and that once landed onshore, it is sent off to be recycled or otherwise disposed of.ldquoThis is how our fishermen in Northern Ireland are reducing the marine plastic problem at sea, Jenny explained. ldquoThe thing that makes this project so unique is that fishermen are almost the only people who have access to litter that is out in the open water or at the seabed.ldquoStopping waste entering the sea is imperative, but taking litter out of the sea is too, even though it is more challenging. That is exactly what lsquofishing for litterrsquo fishermen do.Jenny praised the fishermen in Ardglass who have signed up to the scheme as did local councillor, Dermot Curran.ldquoThis is a great scheme and anything which can help reduce the amount of marine litter being washed ashore is to be welcomed, he said.ldquoTen Ardglass skippers have already signed up for the scheme and I hope that there will be more.

It was a four-lap course which started at Greenisland Golf Club and carried on via Monkstown Wood, Shore Road and then a bit of a challenge with a hill to contend with on Station Road.The weather was grey with a little drizzle but nothing to cause major problems and in fact Declan felt that there was a slight wind assistance on the climb which was welcome.The overall winner Chris Denton, was the only runner to break three hours and he took top spot on the podium with a time of two hours and  minutes.Declan was more than happy with his own time of . and the fact that he placed seventh overall.

There will also be increased emphasis on ensuring that public toilets meet the needs of those with autism, dementia and other health conditions.The new toilet strategy mdash which includes a review of how council-owned toilets are managed, cleaned and maintained mdash is expected to be formally signed off at tonightrsquos meeting of the local authorityrsquos Neighbourhood Services Committee.Across the district, the local authority is responsible for  public conveniences, many of which have been in place for over  years and are showing signs of corrosion and internal wear and tear. A number have also been vandalised.Councillors will be told tonight that a decision is required to repair, replace or remove these particular units and they will be provided with a detailed breakdown of the work that is required.Toilets at Castlewellanrsquos Upper Square need to be replaced while the outer shell of the building would remain in place, while the existing facility at Market Street in Downpatrick would be entirely replaced.The new strategy suggests that the current public toilets at The Rocks in Ballyhornan would be replaced as would existing toilets at the local authority-owned car park at the Newcastle Road outside Dundrum.Plans have also been drawn up to replace toilets at Crossgarrsquos Lislea Drive and at Ardglass harbour, while public toilets at the New Line in Saintfield mdash which have been repeatedly targeted by vandals mdash would replaced, alongside those at the Quoile Road in Downpatrick.Public toilets the Lough Inch cemetery in Ballynahinch and Struell Cemetery in Downpatrick are also in line for refurbishment under the new council strategy, alongside conveniences at Windmill Street in Ballynahinch.It will also be confirmed at tonightrsquos council meeting that almost  people responded to a -week consultation on the new strategy with over  percent of those who responded agreeing with the suggestion to pay to spend a penny. Concern was also expressed about the cleanliness of some public toilets and their layout.And while council toilets in Newcastle, Dundrum, Castlewellan, Downpatrick, Ballyhornan and Ardglass have reopened after being closed due to coronavirus, those in Saintfield, Ballynahinch, Crossgar and Killyleagh remain closed. They are due to reopen shortly.Cllr Billy Walker has welcomed the decision to reopen council toilets across the Rowallane area and said the fact that these particular public conveniences have been closed or over a year was ldquounacceptable.He said steps should have been taken earlier to ensure that staff were available to open and maintain the ious facilities.Cllr Walker was particularly critical of the decision to keep toilets in Killyleagh closed given the number of people who visited the town over recent months as Covid restrictions eased.ldquoPublic toilets across the Rowallane area were closed too long for my liking and I am aware that there was concern that conveniences at the townrsquos Market House and nearby community centre were also closed, he continued.ldquoI have been informed that all public toilets across the district will be reopened by June and that is welcome news.

It is celebrated on Sunday, May .In their joint message, the bishops opened by quoting a verse from the book of Acts in the Bible: \"All of them were filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in other languages, as the Spirit gave them ability - Acts :.\"They continued: \"One of the great marks of the first Pentecost was the ability the Holy Spirit gave the apostles to speak across barriers of language of the works of God.ldquoThe Spirit today gives the people of God the same ability to speak as one across all kinds of barriers and boundaries.ldquoWe rejoice today that we can speak together to both our church communities and beyond with a common message of hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ.\"Stating their disappointment that for a second year they are unable to mark this \"great feast\" by coming together for their Ecumenical Service of Prayer, as they have done for almost  years, the bishops added: \"This service allows us to give thanks and praise together to God the Father, Son and Holy Spirit. Please God, next year this might again be possible.\"They continued their message by noting how speaking together about \"the goodness of God\" across barriers is an \"important expression of the language of hope\".They said: \"This is so important as we begin the journey of recovery from the impact of coronavirus. There has been much suffering the loss of loved ones, illness, financial challenge and isolation.ldquoWe all need to hear the healing and strengthening words of Christ, lsquoCome unto me all who are weary and heavy-laden, and I will give you restrsquo.\"Outlining how during the pandemic people quickly realised how important communication is when denied simple non-verbal qualities of close contact and touch, the bishops said: \"We discovered how much we need the warmth of the love of our family and friends.ldquoThe telephone and internet became our key means of keeping in touch and we thank God for these technological aids that kept us connected.ldquoCrucially, we learned how much we are indebted to medical staff, nurses, key workers and volunteers who have communicated dedication, care and love to the community through their skill and acts of kindness.\"We must continue to communicate the language of love and hope across all barriers and boundaries.ldquoIt would be so easy after this long period of restrictions to move to despair and lose hope. Yet we believe there are signs of new le all around us in the vaccination programme and the good response to public health guidance.ldquoLet us encourage one another to communicate the hope that by Godrsquos help, our common le will slowly , and together seek his grace to renew our lives.\"In closing, the bishops said: \"We pray that the Holy Spirit of Pentecost may inspire us so that we communicate in our words and deeds the hope we have in God.ldquoMay we as Christian people speak of our belief in the transforming power of God, and by his Spirit to work together for the rebuilding and re-energising of our churches and society.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

That which was a major cause of the Troubles is also problematic in Israel. After all,the majority takes its own decisions by majority vote, then just as a half of a half is a quarter, so too, a majority of a majority is probably a minority: the DUP in Belfast, the Boris Johnson wing of the Tories, and so on. True majority rule can only exist with consensus. In practice,no party gets a majority of seats in Parliament, the biggest can ‘jump into bed’ with another and, as long as the two thus add up to at least % + , that pair can then rule.    \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

While it is welcome that he is now calling on Brussels to compromise, having previously, like Leo Varadkar, talked asIreland is the EU’s most rigorous enforcer of the single market, this new flexibility is also misleading.It means modications to the protocol or extensions of grace periods or easing of checks. Prominent unionist critics of the Irish Sea border are often seeming to accept that such modications are acceptable. But it would mean, in essence, that the UK’s repeal of Article  of the Act of Union, which relates to unfettered internal trade within the Union, will continue. But that repeal just won’t be so visible or obvious.That is unacceptable because it will still mean major constitutional change. It is an outcome with which Irish republicans will be delighted: Article  will have been repealed, but the fundamental nature of the change will not be so apparent.Nationalist Ireland fiercely rejected the reverse. Eventhe new trade ergence began at the existing land frontier between the two jurisdictions, as it should, and eventhe UK vowed to have no checks, Dublin simply would not accept it.Why  Because nationalism rejected the premise.Checks were not the issue. Modications or grace periods would have been insufficient to placate Ireland in such circumstances. As you would expect them to be to unionists now such a scenario is panning out in the Irish Sea.——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

During my  years as a community campaigner I have passionately campaigned for education, creating more opportunities for young people, tackling the housing crisis and the climate crisis. I was the regeneration officer for the Loudoun Square and Trowbridge redevelopment, and was selected as the Wales delegate for the International Association for Community Development and Commonwealth Games in Glasgow . Over the last  years Irsquove supported young people in Cardf South and Penarth to develop their skills in the arts and creative industries and to participate in a wide range of opportunities. I successfully gained the London  Olympic Cultural Inspire Mark for Butetown Community. I entered politics because of the increasing injustice around me - increasing food banks, homelessness, education, climate crisis, lack of opportunity for our youth, lack of affordable housing I was sick and tired of our communities being treated like second class citizens by the London elite. I want a fair deal for our communities for Cardf South and Penarth and for Wales.Alan Golding - Freedom Alliance. No Lockdown. No CurfewsRaised in Tonyrefail, Rhondda Cynon Taff, I have since lived in Brighton and Glasgow, moving to Cardf in . Since my early twenties Irsquove been interested in the workings of society and how we treat each other, animals and our planethellip and in the process Irsquove come to completely mistrust virtually all career politicians. I believe a new way of doing politics is needed in Wales with a new set of values across the whole system. I donrsquot believe the current political structure and its controllers have the interest of the people at its heart with regard to their mental and physical health, their quality of le and spiritual and economic well-being.     Paul Campbell - UKIPHello Im Paul Campbell and Im standing in the Cardf South and South Wales Central area for UKIP in the Senedd elections on MAY TH.Being. Born in Cardf and lived most of my le there I appreciate the Greatv Potential the pride and the Welsh Identity in Cardf and the Valleys towns. and I have seen how things have changed over the years with parts of the area unrecognizable from the place I remember.Areas of Cardf have become run down and standards have fallen with a loss of community spirit The surrounding Towns have been neglected with. A lack of investment and job creation initiatives.Mass immigration in the UK has put tremendous strains on cities like Cardf Newport and Swansea with wage depression and overstretched public services.. The Conservatives claim to be in control of immigration but they will only ever talk about it and under there watch in the in the last  years  million more people have come to our shires thats  cities the sthe size of Cardf . Increasingly they are choosing to come to Wales as Labour has encouraged them by a making Wales a Nation Of sanctuary.Helen Westhead - Green PartyOur current administration has ignored the climate emergency and has left so many people vulnerable and excluded. As we recover from the pandemic we have unique opportunity to create better ways of working - the influence of an elected Green in the room will be transformative.We see from across the UK, Europe, and beyond the incredible dference Greens make, holding government to account, speaking out against inequality, and representing real people and their communities, not political or corporate interest. Wales is long overdue that representation in the Senedd.We know that the way we recover from this pandemic and build back stronger is through investing in communities and public services, ensuring everyone has access to local facilities, and supporting small business. If elected, one of my main priorities would be better walking and cycling routes, connected to affordable public transport and green outdoor spaces that communities can enjoy. Advocating for a Universal Basic Income would ensure no one is left behind in our bold plan to transform Wales.With the more proportional voting system on the regional ballot in Wales, Labour cannot win regional seats. A Green vote on your second ballot is the only progressive option.Matt Friend - PropelPropel has led the campaigns on two of the most important issues affecting Barry, Penarth and Cardf.Wersquore the only party that has committed not to allow any nuclear mud to be dumped in our waters, including the mud dredged from outside Hinkley nuclear reactor in Somerset.And wersquore the only party that even mentions the scandal of dangerous fire risk cladding on so many of our flats and buildings. Through our Contract with Wales we have committed not to issue new building contracts to any housing developer involved in the scandal, until they have paid to fix the problem they created.Wersquoll also end the way leaseholders are getting rinsed by introducing a service charge cap, linked to the Retail Price Index. That will stop the double digit increases in service charges that leaseholders have had to put up with.Most importantly, wersquoll introduce a Coronavirus Recovery Act to end Welsh lockdowns, save lives and restore freedoms. We canrsquot just hope wersquoll get our freedoms back, we have to vote for them.The ten laws in our Contract with Wales will transform our nation. Wales needs champions. Vote Propel.Alex Wilson, Liberal DemocratsI live with my family in Penarth and I became involved in politics because of the widening isions that seemed to occurring our community. I feel that with the Liberal Democrat core values of tolerance and understanding we can bring people back together. We can cut through the shouting of partisan politics and once again listen to what people want in their community.The next five years is going to be critical and I feel the Senedd must put recovery first. That means recovering from the Covid pandemic, the recovery of our economy, better healthcare services and a happier community which can be achieved by better transport links, saving our environment and ato community values.Irsquove been around long enough to know a political status-quo without a strong opposition can breed complacency. Wersquove seen this in national and local government. If I am elected I will ensure that the voice of the people is heard. If yoursquove ever wondered how we almost lost the Kymin or how they plan to build over  homes on contaminated land at Cosmeston Farm in Sully, well itrsquos because our current political leaders often lack empathy with local communities.Other candidates standing are:Vaughan Gething - LabourAngus Hawkins - Gwlad The Welsh Independence PartyLisa Peregrine ndash Abolish the Welsh Assembly Party Alan Pick ndash Reform UKDavid Rolfe ndash IndependentLeighton Rowlands ndash Conservative article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Otherwise a coalition must be attempted.:Who can vote Anyone over the age of  can vote in the Senedd election provided they are:- registered to do so- living in Wales- not legally excluded from votingThis is the first time  and -year-olds have been eligible to vote. What impact that has on the result remains to be seen.How do I vote There are three ways - in person, by post and by proxy - however, the deadlines for latter two options have already passed.Voting at the polling booth with take place until pm today.Polling stations will be kitted out with hand sanitiser and distancing markers to help voters remain safe from coronavirus.Most crucially, voters are being asked to bring their own pen or pencil.Face coverings must also be worn, unless exempt.How does the voting system work Each voter will have two votes - one constituency vote and one regional vote.Youll be represented in the Senedd by five Members. One for your constituency and four for the region of Wales where you live.Constituency vote - this is for the person you want to represent you and your local area. Wales has  constituencies, with each being represented by one MS in the Senedd. Constituency votes are counted in a first past the post system - so the candidate with the most votes is elected.     Regional vote - This is for who you want to represent your region of Wales - South Wales East, South Wales Central, South Wales West Mid and West Wales and North Wales. There are  regional Senedd Members, elected by the additional member system.When will results be announced As with a lot of things this past year, the election has been hit by Covid restrictions.While voting will happen today, counting will not take place the same night as is usually the case on election night.Instead, the votes will be taken to the counting locations and kept secure until morning.They will then be veried - spoiled ballots removed - and counted.Due to Covid restrictions, this will likely take longer than in normal counts, but results are expected within two days of polls closing.Keep an eye on the Argus website for the latest, and results. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityIt was girl power when ten female walkers joined Joy and sheepdog Bracken from Penarth and District Ramblers at Penarth clftop for an . mile walk, with no stiles only gates and which would see them experiencing the weather of all four seasons in one day. They set off on a socially distanced walk in lovely spring sunshine across the old pitch and putt course before joining part of the old railway line, now a walk and cycle way, and heading through a built up area Lavernock Road led them into Cosmeston Country Park.Past the eastern lake with its floating jetty where canoes can be safely launched and making their way through the eastern paddock with its carpet of pretty cowslips, open meadows led them towards Old Cogan Hall Farm, where they deviated into the churchyard of St Peterrsquos for morning break in glorious warm sunshine reminiscent of summer. Admiring the herring bone masonry which dates to Celtic and Saxon times and the ancient yew trees that could even pre-date this lovely old church, which allegedly is the oldest building in Penarth and hearing some of its long and interesting history, it fell into disrepair in the th century. By the th century the ruinous building was a cattle shelter until the latter part of the rsquos when the rd Marquis of Bute was persuaded to pay for its renovation.Mile Road built by the Bute family led them to the western paddock and through the sun-dappled Cogan Wood to re-enter fields where a footbridge led them across the Sully Brook for the short climb up to Home Farm, with its glorious views towards the eastern end of Barry and the surrounding farmland. Exiting through a gate, some road walking in a southerly direction brought them into Sully village and pounding pavements to reach the Jubilee Hall and the cricket field, the full beauty of Sully Bay with its views across the Bristol Channel towards the Somerset coastline and Hayes Point to the west confronted them.     With the wind beginning to pick up they tramped by track and field to the public slipway at Sully beach and stopped for lunch utilising rocks for seating whilst gazing eastwards towards Sully Island and Flat and Steep Holm beyond, as clouds thickened overhead and the temperature dropped making it feel more like autumn.Time to move on along part of the long distance Wales Coast Path, through the playing fields to exit onto Beach Road, following it to the car park of the Captainrsquos We where there were only a few people sitting at outdoor tables for food and drink, not really enjoyable in the cool breeze.The fairly quiet St Maryrsquos Well Bay Road brought them up past The Bay Caravan Park and into fields with growing crops where, without any warning a sudden short sharp shower of rain engulfed the group forcing coats to be swtly donned.Crossing a wooden footbridge into the delightful Lavernock Nature Reserve the grassy path led them into the remains of the WW gun emplacements. Initially in the late rsquos the original Lavernock Gun Battery was built to protect the Bristol and Cardf shipyards and the Bristol Channel, but unfortunately most of the original buildings now lie underneath the caravan park.Being bombarded by a short hail storm whilst moving on through the nature reserve, lovingly cared for by volunteers and passing the man-made pond with its surrounding carpet of bluish violet bugle, a plant which attracts moths, butterflies and bees, before exiting onto Fort Road their route led them past the Marconi Holiday Village and the Church of St Lawrence before heading along the clftop. With thick black clouds heading up the English side of the Bristol Channel, the race was on to get back before the rain hit. As the weather turned wintry and the wind increased, a huge shower of hailstones and heavy rain struck them on the open Penarth clftop soaking them as they made their way back to their start point.You can follow the grouprsquos exploits before, during and after lockdown on Facebook. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Unfortunately, both Sean and his father were thrown from the kayak into the freezing cold water.Sean’s father was washed ashore and despite frantic efforts he was unable to reach his son who was stuck in the water against a wall at the opposite bank. Thankfully a local father and son - Mike Greerand his -year-old son Zachery - were able to pull Sean safely out of the water and alert the emergency services. ]]Due to the severity of the incident, the Helicopter Emergency Medical Service , flown by Air Ambulance Northern Ireland were tasked to the scene along with a number of emergency first response teams.Fortunately Sean has recovered well and as a result of his experience he wanted to do something positive that would potentially help another person who might need the air ambulance in future.Sean’s mum Elaine said, “We wanted to do something that would give back. Air Ambulance NI is a wonderful service that we cannot take for granted. “The service has been tasked to our council area  times in  and it can only help people with donations to support its sustainability. We are so thankful that Sean wanted to do something and that’s him, he has so much grit and determination and we are so proud of him.”Just two months after Sean’s ordeal in the water, both he and his father took on the mighty challenge of summitting Northern Ireland’s highest peak, Slieve Donard to raise funds for the lesaving service. The seven-year-old initially set himself the goal of raising £ but was overwhelmed when his final total came in at £,! His mum said, “Sean is so grateful to every single person who donated to his Just Giving page and helped him smash his target. If the money pays half the fuel or pays towards saving somebody ’s le, it will have been worth it. “Every step Sean took on that mountain really was to help ensure someone  got pre-hospital critical carethey needed it - every penny donated will help that cause.”At the beginning of May, Sean and his family were delighted to be one of the first patient families to visit the air ambulance base with the easing of lockdown restrictions. Sean was delighted to get a tour of the airbase and hear all about how his donation will help others who are potentially in le threatening situations. Mum Elaine commented, “Sean has not stopped talking about his visit to see the air ambulance. He also signed up as a Junior Club member with the charity and so was delighted to wear his branded lanyard and bring along his teddy to get his photo by the helicopter. “He was given a tour, had lots of questions answered and was delighted to hear more about the pilot’s role within the team, as this is something he’s really interested in. “He was also given a copy of the charity newsletter and hasn’t put it down - that’s really helping him with his reading too! We are just so delighted that something that could have turned out to be a devastating situation has had such a positive outcome and we are extremely proud of our young boy who is a big air ambulance fan!”The charity Air Ambulance Northern Ireland, in partnership with the Northern Ireland Ambulance Service, provides the HEMS for Northern Ireland. The service brings urgent medical assistance to anywhere in the province, operating seven days a week for  hours per day. It can get to anywhere in Northern Ireland in approximately twenty-five minutes.How we reported Sean’s rescue in February - read hereEditor’s message:Thank you for reading this article.
