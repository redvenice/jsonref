But the mentor reaches far back to classical times, and is a narrative device most commonly deployed during a time of dilemma. Mentors are the flint-spark at the heart of a story.The genesis of my novel The Offing lies in the repeated assertion by female actors of more mature years that there are very few roles for them, coupled with an awareness that the combination of older womanyounger man is a literary pairing rarely read. Yet the tedious mature-man-has-affair-with-ingenue plot still endures. Only the brilliantly morbid 1971 film Harold and Maude subverted the notion that sex must be the defining factor in an unlikely age-gap friendship.So I decided to created my own bold female lead, an older women who is a bohemian with impressive social connections and knowledge to share. I named her Dulcie, and her role is that of mentor to a young lad from a County Durham mining backwater. Dulcie’s gentle schooling of Robert in all manner of subjects – from food, poetry and swearing to the importance of always rebelling against the “chinless middle managers who run England” – takes place over a bucolic summer following the second world war. As mentor she is the key to unlock his imagination.Here is a selection of other literary mentors, some of very different persuasions.1. MentorAthena in Homer’s OdysseyMentor first appeared in the Odyssey when, late in life, he was placed in charge of Odysseus’s son Telemachus when the legendary king of Ithaca left to fight in the Trojan war. Yet it was only when Athena, the goddess of warfare, disguised herself as Mentor to encourage Telemachus to seek out his father that the role become defined as “one who imparts wisdom and practical advice to someone of lesser experience”. The concept was later popularised in the 1699 French novel, The Adventures of Telemachus by François Fénelon.2. Lord Henry Wotten in A Picture of Dorian Gray by Oscar WildeOpinionated and hedonistic Lord Wotten becomes mentor to the young Dorian, whom he encourages to pursue beauty and sensuality above all else. Eighteen years of subsequent vice and debauchery leave a trail of destruction, including the murder of artist Basil Hallward, painter of the infamous portrait that continues to age while Dorian stays forever young. An aristocratic libertine, Wotten has an almost psychopathic indifference to the consequences of his guidance. 3. The Schlegels and the Wilcoxes in Howards End by EM ForsterFew writers examined hypocrisy and social codes among the upper middle classes quite as adroitly as Forster, and class mentorship defines his most masterful novel. The Anglo-Germanic Schlegel siblings – intellectual members of the Bloomsbury-esque bourgeoisie – become mentors to humble clerk Leonard Bast and wife Jacky, “a fallen woman”. However, their careerfinancial advice backfires. Meanwhile Ruth Wilcox, matriarch of a wealthy capitalist family, mentors Margaret Schlegel, bequeathing to her the idyllic country house after which this multilayered novel of matrons, patrons and redemption is named.4. M in the James Bond series by Ian FlemingDescribed variously as brutal, cold, curt and gruff, and the starting point for the younger spy’s adventures, M schools Bond in the ways of espionage, martinis and maintaining a detached sense of Englishness at all times. Only in his 13th novel, The Man With The Golden Gun, is he named as Sir Miles Messervy, while later post-Fleming novels (and screen adaptations) have depicted M as a female mentor.5. Miss Jean Brodie in The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie by Muriel SparkSuch is the influence of junior school teacher Jean Brodie over her pupils at an Edinburgh school in the 1930s that six of them – an elite group known as ‘the Brodie set’ – become enmeshed in her complicated life long after they have moved on to secondary school. Brodie is a commanding and subversive figure, who promotes love, art, travel, sex and fascism, and considers herself as transcending morality. A mentor who encourages her girls to defy convention, though not necessarily to positive effect.6. Ratso Rizzo in Midnight Cowboy by James Leo HerlihyNo one said mentors have to be entirely magnanimous. Ailing conman Rico “Ratso” Rizzo is a New York street hustler who initially sees in Joe Buck – fresh off the Greyhound bus from Texas – an opportunity. A symbiotic friendship soon forms, with Rizzo teaching the handsome cowboy how to survive in a cynical city while earning them money as a male prostitute. Ultimately the mentor is repaid in kindness as Buck assumes the role of protector in the heartbreaking conclusion to this wonderfully flea-bitten and unflinching novel. (Sidenote: Herlihy was himself mentored in his writing career by Tennessee Williams.)7. Earl Copen in The Animal Factory by Edward BunkerThe mentor is a recurring figure in crime and prison fiction, though few are as archetypal as that created by Bunker, himself once San Quentin’s youngest ever inmate. Copen is what every young inmate might hope for: an elder there to protect and guide them through a hellscape of predators, racial tension and prison etiquette. 8. Sando in Breath by Tim WintonTwo semi-feral adolescents in small town Australia, Pikelet and Loonie bond over a shared intoxication with the sea after witnessing the “huge, bearded, coiled-up presence” of veteran surfer Sando in action. Mentor and guru, he first inspires and then exploits their infatuation with both him and the sea, instilling a heady combination of fear and not-quite-freedom. Reviewing the novel in the , Patrick Ness remarked upon one of the downsides of such mentorship: “Pikelet is forever condemned to be Salieri to Sando’s Mozart: just talented enough to know how much more talented the real geniuses are.”9. Cardinal Wolsey in Wolf Hall by Hilary MantelSharing weighty intellect and lowborn status that mark them out in the court of Henry VIII, Wolsey and Thomas Cromwell make for a classic mentorprotege coupling. Long after the cardinal’s death, Cromwell still defers to his advice. In time, he too adopts the role of mentor by nurturing all manner of disadvantaged orphans and urchins in whom he sees potential.10. Teddy Prince in Daisy Jones and The Six by Taylor Jenkins ReidAn inventive subversion of the music biography-as-oral-history, the Fleetwood Mac-like band’s story here covers all the rock pitfalls during their rise and fall in heady 1970s LA – complete with a mentor figure in Teddy Price. In fact, the oversized British CEO of Runner Records may be a Svengali figure – the more insidious sibling of the mentor – but as the line between the two is so often blurred he warrants inclusion, if only as a reminder that behind every successful performer, whether real or imagined, there is usually a mentor some entirely altruistic, others less so.• The Offing by Benjamin Myers is published by Bloomsbury on 5 March.

Its wonderful seawater lido has been refurbished. Maintenance and repair for the sleeper trains to Paddington have been relocated due to work on HS2, creating 70 well-paid jobs. There are ambitious plans to revamp the main shopping street, which curves elegantly from the railway station to the statue of the town’s favourite son, Humphry Davy, at the top of the hill.But progress is slow. Penzance is the first and last town in Cornwall, a county that has the wage levels normally found in the most challenged parts of the north with the sort of house prices – inflated by the large number of holiday and retirement homes – associated with the plusher parts of the south-east. It was one of the first towns to suffer the hollowing out of retailing and it is not uncommon for residents to have five or six low-paid jobs in the peak summer season.Economic hardship is not immediately obvious. As James Green, director of the Newlyn art gallery, puts it: “Poverty looks different in Cornwall than it does in an urban situation. People who come here eat in the nice restaurants, they rent the pretty cottages, they walk on the beautiful beaches and they misunderstand the challenges Cornwall faces.”Tourism is thriving, according to Paul Ainsworth, chef patron of two restaurants in upmarket Padstow. “The biggest change I have seen since arriving here in 2005 is the staycation, people coming down here out of season. In the last year there’s been a huge surge in the number of people coming down here on an English holiday. In part that’s due to the pound’s weakness, but a lot of people are nervous, worried about terrorism and concerned about climate change.”Yet for all the cream teas and the golden beaches beloved by the visitors, Cornwall has much in common with old industrial Britain: the loss of jobs in staple industries the growth of low-paid precarious employment relatively high levels of disguised joblessness caused by people leaving the workforce altogether a struggle to prevent the young and the talented from leaving.It takes four and a quarter hours to get from Truro to London. It is quicker to get from London to Glasgow. I am more than 100 miles from the nearest motorway.The Conservatives won all six Cornish seats in the 2019 general election and the government has pledged to make its new shared prosperity fund as generous as the EU money it is replacing. Yet the council is worried that the investment will be skewed towards the former Labour seats in the Midlands and the north of England that gave Boris Johnson his 80-seat majority.Julian German, the independent councillor who leads Cornwall’s unitary authority, said: “We don’t want to be forgotten about. We face some of the systemic challenges the north faces and in terms of connectivity more so.”The council senses there may be an inherent bias against Cornwall, because it has no big city but rather a collection of similar-sized towns strung out along the railway line that runs down the county’s spine.Redruth is one stop of the line and on the northern edge of the town sits Krowji – Cornwall’s largest creative hub. The idea is to marry the county’s high-speed broadband – one area where it is well connected – with the students coming off the campuses at nearby Falmouth to kickstart the local economy. A new building is under construction to meet demand for space.Glenn Caplin, chief executive of Cornwall and Isles of Scilly local enterprise partnership, says that one of the failures of the past 20 years is that there are still really challenged areas reflecting structural industrial decline: in fishing in Penzance in hard rock mining around Camborne and Redruth, and in china clay mining in St Austell.He wants Cornwall’s economic future to be based on high-value sectors: digital, space, geo-resources, renewable energy, agri-technology and green tourism.This would be some transformation and for it to happen will require patience as well as cash. Penzance wants to use the money it receives from the government to create a year-round town, develop a creative sector, and encourage independent retailers back to take the place of the chains that have upped and left.The new Premier Inn and the revamped promenade along the seafront to Newlyn are signs that change can happen. The proliferation of charity shops and a median income of £14,000 a year are signs that there is still much to do. That squares with the council leader’s thinking. “The key word in regeneration is generation,” says German. “It takes time.”* Annual survey of hours and earnings, ONS"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/46bb6c1ac40b812236c5939096d2f7811369426e/15_99_3485_2090/master/3485.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4815bcaf19321316e00f5f88140d654a","title":"struggling shopping centre owner intu abandons 1bn cash call","story":"Group says there is risk it could breach certain bank covenants when they are tested in JulyIntu Properties, the owner of the Trafford Centre in Manchester and Lakeside in Essex, has been forced to pull an emergency cash call after admitting “extreme” market conditions had left it unable to raise its minimum target of £1.3bn from jittery investors.The failure to secure the funding means Intu, which is struggling under a £4.5bn debt mountain, has missed the criteria set by its banks to grant a new four-year £440m revolving credit facility. The company said that this means there is a risk it could breach certain bank covenants when they are next tested in July.The company has been involved in discussions with shareholders and potential new investors over the last few months to try to raise the target to shore up its balance sheet.“Following these discussions, Intu has concluded it is unable to proceed with an equity raise at this point,” the company said on Wednesday.“While a number of Intu’s shareholders and potential new investors indicated their support for an equity raise, the board believes the current uncertainty in the equity markets and retail property investment markets precluded a number of potential investors from committing capital into the business and Intu was therefore unable to reach the target quantum at the current time.”“While it is disappointing that the extreme market conditions have prevented us from moving forward with our planned equity raise, I am pleased that a number of alternative options have presented themselves during the process, which we will now explore further,” said Matthew Roberts, the chief executive of Intu. “We remain focused on fixing our balance sheet in the near term to ensure this business has the financial footing it needs to realise its significant potential.”The company said it is currently in compliance with its debt covenants but that “there is a risk that, depending on the performance of Intu’s business and movements in valuations, it could be in breach of certain covenants at there scheduled testing date in July 2020”.The company said it is seeking to take “timely mitigating actions”, including seeking covenant waivers, to deal with any potential breaches in July.“We will face further challenges in what has been an extraordinary few months for Intu and the wider sector,” Roberts said. “This is a compelling proposition and one that will stand the test of time. Operationally, our business is strong, delivering a resilient rental performance despite ongoing pressure from CVAs and administrations, with stable occupancy rates and footfall that consistently outperforms the benchmark.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/165329ae985f63bf7a0581a22f7b9acf8bf868d2/0_75_4015_2410/master/4015.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=19c736e99fcc90107b703b2719486076","title":"leadership race labour party membership mps","story":"The current Labour leadership election follows years of messy warfare within the party. MPs have been briefing against each other almost daily, while factions within the membership battle it out at monthly meetings. Corbynites believe that infighting cost Labour the 2017 general election – an analysis that Rebecca Long-Bailey has consistently put forward at hustings over recent weeks. Corbyn-sceptics maintain that the leadership team of Jeremy Corbyn was more interested in winning the internal struggles than elections at large, and that this contributed to the devastating defeat in December. It is no surprise that party unity has become a dominant theme in this contest, and will be a major challenge for Labour’s next leader.The gaping ide between members and MPs that existed under Corbyn is no longer. That’s good news for party unity, especially for the frontrunner. Judging by both nominations and polling, Starmer seems likely to be elected with strong support from both levels of the party, which in turn could weaken the case for Labour left initiatives – such as open selections – that he does not champion. Some members who voted for Corbyn, followed by Starmer rather than Long-Bailey, appear set to change their minds, while others are new or returning members ready to defend a more centrist leadership.By talking of little other than the need for unity, Starmer has set himself a task that looks almost impossible to deliver. He aims to change party culture, which is deeply embedded. He wants everybody who quit Labour over antisemitism to feel comfortable to return, yet this would include former MPs who stood against Labour at the last election – something the incumbent party chair, Ian Lavery, has described as “offensive”. Starmer is not thought likely to initiate a membership purge, preferring soft power moves, but he does want to replace the highest disciplinary body now in place with an independent complaints system.Such an ambition brings us to the most widely overlooked aspect of this leadership election: that Labour’s ruling body, the national executive committee, will be reshaped. A change in the leader alone will affect four NEC places (including three frontbench appointments). Then there are three byelections – two local party representatives, one BAME post – being held alongside the main contest. Party reforms that constitute a crucial part of Starmer’s platform, including an independent complaints system, necessitate rule changes that would have to go through the NEC and conference first. The left majority on the NEC is already considered soft and narrow by Corbynites, which means the byelections are of utmost importance.If Starmer is chosen to be Labour’s next leader, the success of his principal aim – to unify the party – will ultimately depend on the success of his other key pledge – electability. The latest Survation poll for LabourList shows that the top priority of eligible voters in the leadership contest is “credibility as a potential prime minister”. For Starmer to unite Labour, he would need to prove, through local elections, poll ratings and finally the next general election, that he can deliver on his main selling point of being “prime ministerial”. On that basis, the scale of challenge cannot be overstated.• Sienna Rodgers is editor of LabourList"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/19d44ace8f88865e4634e644b2f0a6e9da9b5d5e/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=477e102afa92a3e51b5f9671ad727d85","title":"market coronavirus vaccine us health virus pharmaceutical business","story":"Coronavirus appears to be with us for the long haul. Despite the unprecedented attempts at isolation and containment, with about 50 million people locked down and economic activity virtually halted in China, cases have spiked in recent weeks. Sixty-seven countries are now reporting a total of more than 8,000 infections outside China. The World Health Organization has been wary of using the word pandemic, but last week it advised countries to prepare as if one were imminent.On the same day, in a rare bit of good news, the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) announced it had already received the first candidate for a vaccine against the novel virus, now being called Sars-CoV-2 – produced by a company called Moderna – and that trials could begin as early as April. Anthony Fauci, the institute’s director, said that just three months between discovery and trials was a new record, noting that “nothing has ever gone that fast”, before dropping the other shoe: even with the rapid start, completing the trials and scaling up production would take until at least next year, and there was no guarantee it would even get to that stage.Vaccines remain science’s best – and virtually only – weapon against viruses, and yet the timeline for developing a vaccine, measured in years, seems hopelessly mismatched to a pandemic, which can spread, kill and often disappear in a matter of weeks or months. The modern record doesn’t inspire much confidence. There have been multiple international viral outbreaks over the past two decades – Sars-CoV-1, Mers, Zika, Ebola – that all provoked similar races to produce a vaccine. Yet to date only the efforts on Ebola have been successful, with a vaccine being approved last year.Why is this? Vaccines for epidemics have to overcome the same scientific and regulatory hurdles as other promising treatments, but they also suffer from a near total lack of interest from the markets that drive the pharmaceutical industry. Only a few massive companies retain the ability to develop and produce a vaccine from start to finish, partly because of the expense and the timescales involved and partly because they’ve consolidated the patents on manufacturing processes – a situation analysts openly call an oligopoly. A success for one of these companies is a treatment for a widespread, persistent disease, that they can sell every single year in perpetuity. The last industry blockbuster was Merck’s HPV vaccine Gardasil, in development for nearly 20 years, released in 2006, and still bringing in over £1bn annually. There is no way to easily apply their slow-burn research and profit model to an epidemic. As the leader of the UK’s Ebola response, Adrian Hill, told the Independent in 2014, “unless there’s a big market it’s not worth the while of a mega-company … There was no business case to make an Ebola vaccine for the people who needed it most.”Even if research begins during a pandemic, the unpredictable nature of outbreaks means work is often shelved if the crisis dies down, and so progress halts until the next time a similar infection flares up. Sars and Mers were also coronaviruses but after they petered out, work on them essentially stalled. Jason Schwartz, a professor at the Yale School of Public Health, said as much to the Atlantic earlier this month: “Had we not set the Sars vaccine research program aside, we would have had a lot more of this foundational work that we could apply to this new, closely related virus.”The current setup is often the worst of both worlds – too slow to pick up research on new threats because the money isn’t there and quick to drop it if it can’t be sure the money will be there in the future. It’s a highly market-dependent system, and the market usually fails us. Peter Piot, head of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, previously declared the entire research and development system “not fit for purpose” for epidemics.The question is, how can we fix it? The quick delivery of the first Sars-CoV-2 vaccine candidate suggests that some recent efforts are paying off. The Moderna vaccine is in part backed by the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), an organisation based in Norway and funded by governments and foundations such as the Wellcome Trust. Its goal is to keep research attention on potentially epidemic diseases, even when there isn’t an outbreak, and to develop broader treatments it calls “platforms” that could be tailored to multiple virus variants. For example, the vaccine sent to NIAID is RNA-based, making it far easier to customise and faster to produce than traditional protein-based vaccines. And CEPI was already funding a DNA-based vaccine for another coronavirus, as well as a platform to block viral cell entry, that it hopes to quickly adapt to Sars-CoV-2.These kinds of programmes can maintain long-term vision and planning, foster international collaboration and supercharge vaccine research – but they still can’t deliver a vaccine at pandemic scale, because the biotech firms and universities they work with are simply too small, working on the order of millions of doses. The French pharma giant Sanofi alone produces over a billion doses per year. Even the US army, after producing a promising Zika vaccine in 2017, had to sign over the rights to Sanofi to get it produced. (The deal later fell through after criticism over profiteering by watchdog organisations and senator Bernie Sanders).There have been calls over the years, usually after an outbreak or a terrorist attack, for the state to match its commitment to research – the US government has spent more than £500m on coronavirus research over the past 20 years – with the manufacturing capacity to become truly self-reliant. The US had a facility like that until the 1990s, producing vaccines for the army at pennies per dose. The UK recently announced a new state of the art facility in Oxford that would allow the government to manufacture its own vaccines, an incredible step, but it won’t be operational until 2022.A panicked world will be watching the vaccines inch through clinical trials over the next year. The markets will be watching too. After Fauci said it was “very difficult and very frustrating” that no large pharma companies had stepped up to produce vaccines, both Sanofi and Johnson \u0026amp Johnson announced new partnerships with the US government on potential treatments. However, the health and human services secretary, Alex Azar, gave no guarantee it would be affordable. “We need the private sector to invest,” he said, “price controls won’t get us there.”• Stephen Buranyi is a writer specialising in science and the environment"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/647b0b6315dbb8c0dcbc38cd9c818d24b00adf4b/0_158_4689_2814/master/4689.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=88968813c23b9585318c1aa3e41a0829","title":"priti patel metoo civil service brexit philip rutnam","story":"You’re not really supposed to know who we are – the unelected bureaucrats of the UK. That’s how it’s worked since time immemorial – civil servants are supposed to silently get on with it while ministers take the flak. And that’s how we like it.But this very British convention of public life – like so many others – has been dangerously weakened by Brexit and is now being shredded by an emboldened administration still flexing its muscular majority. It’s now not even controversial that Philip Rutnam is merely one of several senior civil servants on Dominic Cummings’s “shitlist”.I’m half hoping that Hilary Mantel – who’s already shown she can bring the stories of the most heartless, heretic-torturing government enforcers to life – will one day take on this chapter of history. But until then, it’s difficult to properly describe just how shocked we were by the Home Office permanent secretary’s extraordinary on-camera resignation and characterisation of the home secretary as a liar and architect of an alleged “vicious and orchestrated campaign” against him.Sure, we’ve seen increasing coverage of the defenestrations of other top civil servants such as Ivan Rogers in Brussels, Kim Darroch in Washington, and the UK borders chief Karen Wheeler. But this is a watershed moment even in a hostile environment that threatens a deluge of them.More colleagues are now coming forward with further allegations against Patel during her time as an employment minister in 2015. That’s in addition to claims that she, as international development secretary, openly called her staff “fucking useless”. This prompted the Department for International Development’s permanent secretary, Matthew Rycroft, to tell his staff: “Our management board has decided to take further action to address bullying, harassment and discrimination in DfID. The recent people survey highlighted that we have more to do.”“More to do” might be an understatement. The survey Rycroft mentions is a questionnaire that most of the 400,000-strong civil service take part in every year, and which includes questions on the extent of bullying and harassment we experience. The 2018 edition revealed significant problems.So it might not be a stretch to say that this feels like like a sort of #MeToo moment for the civil service. Those who, like me, have been around government for several years reckon more allegations are on the way. There may be blood.It probably won’t be Patel’s. For now, an investigation has been promised into whether she has broken the ministerial code, but swift endorsements from Michael Gove – the minister for the Cabinet Office, which will conduct that investigation – and the prime minister suggest the outcome is already secure. The message seems clear: Priti’s safe.It’s also clear that we have entered a new phase of No 10’s conflict with the civil service: “unprecedented” is a word we are quickly wearing out. Yvette Cooper, the chair of the home affairs select committee, declared that “to end up with one of the most senior public servants in the country taking court action against one of the great offices of state shows a shocking level of breakdown in the normal functioning of government”.She’s right: it is shocking. But civil servants aren’t surprised. While bullying allegations have been mounting up against Patel for years, which she has denied, this is only a part of a “wider pattern of behaviour”, as Rutnam said in his statement.This goes way beyond bullying. Any of the tens of thousands of civil servants who have strained every sinew to respond to the contradictions and convolutions of Brexit will tell you this has been a conflict years in the making. That the latest and worst skirmish has taken place at the Home Office is symbolic given its prominence as arguably the government’s busiest Brexit-facing department. Even before properly facing down the multiple icebergs of a new border inspection regime, a new immigration system and claims of institutional racism, Brexit has already made the Home Office one of the most hazardous workplaces in government. In 2018-19 alone, 2,102 civil servants at the Home Office took time off work because of mental ill-health – at a cost of more than £12m.Add to this toxic landscape the presence and tactics of arguably the government’s most combative senior minister, and it should surprise no one where these particular chickens have first come home to roost. Not even the prime minister may be able – even if he wanted – to adequately chlorinate them.I don’t believe Boris Johnson seeks to actively create a bullying culture inside the civil service. But as the Brexit transition phase comes to an end, he is in danger of creating an enabling environment for the harassment of civil servants who are perceived to not have enough revolutionary zeal to attempt to deliver the impossible. We’ve already seen what happens when civil servants try to be practical about delivering Brexit.The best and most hopeful thing about Rutnam’s stand was that it showed us the ends do not justify the means. “Moving fast and breaking things” may be a catchy slogan for an emboldened new government in a hurry to “get things done”. But when what is being broken is trust, it’s a strategy that in the long-run will hurt us all.• The civil servant works in a Whitehall department and was part of Operation Yellowhammer"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8298fe893f7299306954477ee9cb2b606fe179d0/0_181_4160_2495/master/4160.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=59c27f5d7707c973f5d07ff9667549b0","title":"super tuesday joe biden","story":"Biden won many of these states without any campaign spending, which is unprecedented. How did he do that?With Virginia called for Biden right when polls closed at 7pm it was clear that Super Tuesday was going to play out a lot differently than it was expected to. Building on momentum from his landslide victory in the South Carolina primary, Biden dominated the Super Tuesday states. Biden is thus far winning 9 of the 11 called contests and is competitive to win the remaining three states. This strong performance was a sharp contrast to expectations, which even after revisions to be more favorable to Joe Biden post-South Carolina still predicted Sanders would win most of the night’s contests and come away with a delegate lead, perhaps even a significant one. Instead, even with more than a million ballots still outstanding in the California primary, it is Biden, not Sanders who holds the delegate lead, and with it, a possible lock on a nomination that less than two weeks ago provoked a flurry of columns about brokered conventions.So, what happened to so dramatically alter the contours of the race and make Biden, not Sanders the frontrunner and quite possibly, the presumptive nominee? To be sure, much attention will be given to the decisions of fellow moderates Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar to withdraw from the race the night before the Super Tuesday contests and endorse Joe Biden with the hopes that in so doing, they could help steer the party’s nomination away from Bernie Sanders, who many in the party openly worried threatened the party’s ability to beat Donald Trump in the fall as well as down-ticket races for the Senate, House, and a host of state legislative seats. But the winnowing of the field, even in the spectacular fashion it played out in Monday night in Dallas, Texas likely has less to do with the results than the fact that Sanders’ candidacy ultimately hit the same demographic brick wall it hit in its 2016 iteration.The Sanders campaign always understood that in order to actually win the Democratic party’s nomination, the senator needed to dramatically improve upon his share of black voters from the 2016 cycle. Black voters are the kingmakers of the Democratic primary process – win them over and you will most likely be the party’s nominee even if you struggle in the party’s first two contests in Iowa and New Hampshire as the contest moves into delegate-rich South Carolina. But fail to win them over and even promising starts like Pete Buttigieg’s upstart Iowa caucus win is guaranteed to sputter out. The Sanders campaign had hoped that gains among black voters under age 40 would be enough to offset continued reticence among older black voters, but even when younger voters are more engaged than normal, voter turnout models are heavily lopsided, made up disproportionately of older voters. Sanders’ only pathway to the nomination absolutely required the senator win over older voters of color, and on Tuesday these voters, along with suburban voters of all colors, soundly rejected Sanders’ revolution in favor of Biden’s pragmatism.Had Sanders’ revolution been more digestible, and not saddled with the democratic-socialist label, it may have fared better. Instead, it provoked outright panic throughout the Democratic party, and not just within the party’s so-called establishment. Although Monday night’s coordinated winnowing and endorsement effort was clearly organized by party elites, the rejection of Sanders’ candidacy came at the hands of rank-and-file Democratic voters, who turned out en masse on Tuesday to blunt his path to the party’s nomination. Though it’s true that Biden dominated among moderates, he also performed well among liberals, earning the plurality of this group as well while Sanders only dominated among those who described their ideology as “very” liberal. Biden also dominated among late-deciding voters, capitalizing on natural momentum from his dominant South Carolina win.What makes Tuesday’s results most stunning, is the fact that Biden won many of these states without any campaign spending, something we’ve never seen in a competitive primary before. The cash-strapped Biden operation staggered into South Carolina on life support and had no time to transition their victory there three days prior into investment in the Super Tuesday contests, where his closest ideological rival had invested more than a half billion dollars.Starting on March 10th the calendar moves into states ostensibly more friendly for Biden, not less. The inclusion of states Sanders carried in 2016 like Oklahoma and Minnesota into Biden’s win column Tuesday suggests Sanders will likely underperform the 2016 cycle, where he carried an impressive 23 states. Should Mike Bloomberg withdraw from the race, even the winnowing of Elizabeth Warren will likely not be enough to re-tilt the race in Senator Sanders favor.If Biden does secure a majority of delegates, it will be under a rules system designed in part by Bernie Sanders and absent the direct influence of party elites via super delegates, a major criticism of the Sanders’ team from their 2016 loss."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/37ea760e21e5445af618a703978532b095537bd3/0_154_4928_2956/master/4928.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bd55b9aa736fc1fb7f98050b027d45fc","title":"focus coronavirus shows need climate law says eu official frans timmermans","story":"Frans Timmermans calls for bloc to legislate so it does not lose track of net zero targetTensions at the Greek-Turkish border and the coronavirus show why the European Union needs a climate law that binds member states to net zero emissions by 2050, the EU’s top official on climate action has said.Frans Timmermans, a European commission vice-president who leads on the climate emergency, said the different crises facing Europe underscored the need for a climate law in order not to lose track of reducing emissions.The long-awaited climate law unveiled on Wednesday is the centrepiece of the European Green Deal, a plan to transform Europe’s economy, promised by the European commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, within her first 100 days.“It will be our compass for the next 30 years and it will guide us every step as we build a sustainable new growth model,” Von der Leyen said announcing the law. Some political leaders have argued that the commission needs to focus on the protection of the EU’s external border, rather than the climate crisis – arguments that Timmermans rejected. “The focus this week should be completely on the happening in Syria, in Turkey and what is happening in Greece, should be on containing the coronavirus and solving it. That’s absolutely a priority,” he said. The climate law was “so important”, because “it allows you to focus on other things without losing track of what you need to do to reach climate neutrality”.“Even if the Eye of Sauron is on something else for a bit, the trajectory to 2050 will be clear,” he said, in a reference to the dark forces in the Lord of the Rings. “Because we discipline ourselves with the climate law.”Speaking to the  and six other European newspapers shortly before the law was published, Timmermans said the proposal was revolutionary because all EU legislation would have to be in line with net zero emissions by the mid-century.Even before the text was officially released, the climate activist Greta Thunberg and teenage school strike leaders across Europe gave a blistering verdict, accusing the commission of ignoring climate science.Thunberg, who is meeting Von der Leyen, Timmermans and the rest of the commission’s top team, described the law as “surrender”. In an open letter, she said it failed to respect the goal of capping global heating at 1.5C above pre-industrial levels – an aspiration the EU signed up to in the 2015 Paris agreement.She repeated that message at a meeting with MEPs on the European parliament’s environment committee on Wednesday. “In November 2019 the European parliament declared a climate and environment emergency,” she said. “You stated that yes, the house is actually burning, this was no false alarm, but then you went back inside, finished your dinner and watched your movie and went to bed without even calling the fire department.“When your house is on fire you don’t wait a few more years to start putting it out, and yet this is what the commission are proposing today.”Earlier at a private meeting with EU commissioners the teenage activist was told by Timmermans that the movement she started was the reason the European Green Deal and climate law exists.The European Green Deal is the EU’s answer to what the European commission’s new president, Ursula von der Leyen, called the “existential issue” of the climate emergency. Most EU countries have signed up to goal of a climate neutral EU by 2050, a goal demanding dramatic change in energy use, farming, housing, transport, trade and diplomacy.The European Green Deal is only the start of the journey: laws will have to be drafted and agreed by EU ministers and MEPs money will have to be raised plans will have to be implemented. It is a route map, rather than a destination, and time is running out.The climate scientist Jean-Pascal van Ypersele, a former vice-chair of the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), said the EU was aiming too low and its current targets on reducing emissions set in 2014 were not in line with the 1.5C goal.An IPCC report in 2018 showed that going beyond 1.5C, even by half a degree, would significantly increase the risks of drought, floods, extreme heat and poverty for millions of people.Van Ypersele said the EU should be aiming for carbon neutrality one decade earlier. “If a region as technologically rich, as scientifically rich as the EU is only able to achieve that by 2050 how can you imagine that the rest of the world will do that by the same year? I don’t think it’s very likely.”A dozen EU member states have also voiced reservations about Timmermans’ timetable for proposing an EU climate target for 2030, widely seen as a crucial goal if the world is not to exceed its carbon budget.Timmermans plans to set out the EU’s 2030 goal in September, but the dozen countries argue this is too late to galvanise the rest of the world to make commitments at crucial UN climate talks in Glasgow at the end of the year.The vice-president rejected these arguments, saying his officials needed the summer to do a thorough impact assessment of the 2030 goal. “If the commission were to come out with a not duly assessed number we would have months and months of discussion about a percentage and then the EU would not have a position either.”He said the EU’s 2030 target would be in time for the EU to have a position at the Cop26 talks in Glasgow.Timmermans also voiced confidence in the British government’s preparations for Cop26. Campaigners have been concerned about a shaky start, with the new Cop26 president – the business secretary, Alok Sharma – only appointed three weeks ago, after his predecessor was abruptly sacked. The UK has yet to set out a strategy or timetable for the cconference, widely seen as critical to getting the world back on track with the 2015 Paris goals.This is Europe is a new stream of  journalism that investigates the big challenges that transcend national boundaries, and seeks out the solutions that could benefit us all. These are testing times, and crises are not limited by national borders. But then neither are we. “The UK has formidable capacities in this area,” he said, adding that Brexit had not created a rift between the EU and UK over climate goals. “Brexit weakens the EU, full stop. And, in my view, weakens the UK, full stop,” he said. “I don’t see any object of discord, or disagreement or confrontation between EU and United Kingdom on this issue, of making a success of Glasgow.”The climate law means governments failing to meet targets could be taken to the European court of justice and fined.Timmermans said “the hardest, hardest thing we will have to do” is guaranteeing that the European Green Deal will benefit the whole of society.He said he was angered by claims that tackling climate change was against the poor, while acknowledging that a failure to benefit everyone carried risks. “If we are not able to show that it is done in a fair way more and more people will say no, we will give food to extremist parties, who will try to demonstrate that this is only a plan for Tesla-driving tofu eaters.“But the real victims of the climate crisis will be the poorest people in society. They have no other place to go.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9803a86408fc0b4f698e23c93b547d989085c675/0_0_7407_5354/master/7407.jpg?width=300\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=af430d0271191506d69d82f3e570ae0b","title":"immortal hero review happy science","story":"The self-produced film by faith leader Ryuho Okawa is woefully misjudged and reveals the laughable reality behind Happy ScienceIf you’re going to make a film about yourself called Immortal Hero, hiring an actor with knee-wobbling charisma should be your number-one priority.

Preaching to followers, Mioya declares that people are responsible for their own ill health, making themselves sick by negative thinking. “All the illnesses can be cured be keeping a bright and positive mindset.

While prepping the movie, Affleck was also entering rehab and has spoken since of how playing the role was a unique form of therapy, an intriguing real-world dimension for a film that reads on paper like familiar plane movie fodder. Because the other off-screen journey is that of a project slated for an awards-friendly, festival-bowing October release yanked back to the first weekend of March, a month not typically associated with serious-minded adult dramas.The story of an alcoholic who finds redemption by coaching a high school basketball team, The Way Back sits awkwardly between muted character study and Disney sports movie, mercifully shying away from sentimental cliche yet failing to add enough depth to work as something more substantive. It sleepily hits the beats we expect but without the emotion or passion required to make them land, a by-the-numbers exercise from someone with barely enough energy to count.Affleck is Jack Cunningham, a former high school basketball star whose days consist of working in construction and whose nights revolve around drinking himself into a stupor. What the film does manage to successfully convey is the sheer joylessness of drinking to excess for many addicts. Often on screen, we’ll see an alcoholic start the night as the life and soul of the bar before then falling into self-pitying darkness, but there’s something bracing about that being replaced with a sort of resigned compulsiveness instead. In one of the best scenes, we see Jack spend a night at home with a fridge filled with 30-odd cans of beer. His well-rehearsed routine of placing one in the freezer while starting another leaves him with an empty fridge by the time he mumbles himself to sleep, a bleak window into his lonely weekday life.When he receives an offer from his old high school to coach the ailing basketball team, his initial instinct is to turn it down and what the film is less successful in showing is why his mind then suddenly changes. The majority of the basketball plot feels like it’s been implanted from elsewhere as the script, co-written by O’Connor and Out of the Furnace writer Brad Inglesby, has precious little interest in fleshing out the specifics of Jack’s coaching. There’s no real journey here to speak of: he arrives, barks a few orders, they start winning every game. It’s all far far too easy and so what should have been rousing is instead decidedly flat. O’Connor who previously made the more openly formulaic sports pic Miracle for Disney, is clearly aware of the crowd-pleasing structure of the subgenre and he recycles it here adequately but without any real verve. The kids Jack coaches are ciphers, with two or three of them allowed a brief scene each, but none of them ever coming close to resembling an actual person and there’s no real detail in any of his advice, no scenes of them trying and failing to work better as a team. It just sort of … happens.While, as mentioned, there’s a bit more specificity to Jack’s drinking, it’s not handled with quite enough depth to counter the shallow nature of the sports side of the film. His addiction is easily explained away as the result of a traumatic event in his past, a pat reveal which ignores the messy reality that sometimes people just drink too much without experiencing something devastating first. The scenes between Jack and his ex-wife are perfunctorily scripted and, playing her, The Morning Show’s Janina Gavankar has an entirely thankless task, exemplified most brutally in their final scene together, which denies her a single line of dialogue. It’s really just a vehicle for Affleck, and a fitting one at that, and he’s solid at underplaying what could have been a more outsized role. But O’Connor pulls back so much at so many moments that there’s not a great deal he can really squeeze out of his character, who like everyone else in the film feels sorely underwritten.The Way Back is a film stuck on the runway, quietly circling around, always threatening to fly but never managing to get off the ground. It was a cathartic experience for Affleck but for the rest of us, it carries very little weight."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b3058cb7960c9407e9affe2258e54d2e0b7b1d53/837_1114_6087_3652/master/6087.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3815d89ac9712055244ee3331f9496a0","title":"how to cook the perfect rum babas recipe","story":"The definitive method of making these boozy little classicsThese innocuous-looking, yet intoxicating little cakes have fallen as far out of favour in the UK as their fellow stalwart of the 70s sweet trolley, the black forest gateau, though happily they’re still easy to find in their native France, where they often come with a bonus shot of rum on the side.Once soaked in rum syrup, all are, of course, delicious, but the looser the structure, the more of this is able to be absorbed, and the lighter the overall result. For that reason. I’m going to err on the plainer side of things, and, like Larousse, go for strong bread flour, rather than ordinary, or Koffmann’s soft cake flour, to help on the open crumb front (Koffmann specifies French T45 , but that proves thin on the ground amidst the jumble of spelt and brown rice varieties in my local supermarket).Pic and Leiths use milk rather than water in their doughs, but I don’t think it makes much difference to flavour or texture the principal taste, before soaking, ought be that of butter and just a hint of salt, which stops the end product from being overwhelmingly sweet.As a descendant of the kugelhof, it makes sense that babas would originally have been much larger than the inidual portions common today. Many of the recipes suggest they can also be made in a bigger mould, and I take Leiths up on this by baking its version in a decorative bundt tin. Though it looks impressive, I would caution against doing the same, for the simple reason that it’s much harder to immerse such a thing fully in syrup, so it runs the risk of being rather dry.You can flavour the cakes with citrus zest, as Leiths does, but more common, if controversial, is the addition of dried fruit, usually soaked in rum – Willan chooses currants, Larousse raisins. Such things, as any ice-cream aficionado can attest, pair extremely well with rum, but to my mind, they add too much to the overall sweetness of this dish if I were going to gild this particular lily with anything, it would involve a contrasting flavour, such as sour cherries or bitter candied peel ... but I’m not, because I like the simplicity of the dish without them. If you have a particular yearning for fruit, I’d recommend serving it alongside in the form of fresh berries, or indeed the candied pineapple Koffmann favours.This need be no more than sugar and water, but I think it’s sensible to make it quite strong, because reducing it risks the mixture becoming too thick for the babas to absorb. Though none of the recipes I try suggests it, I’m going to make mine with brown, rather than white sugar, because I think the flavour works well with the rum.Strangely, most are also silent on the specifics of the booze – surely the defining characteristic of this dessert – with only a couple calling for dark rum. I do try it with golden rum, too (the blander white stuff seems a waste of time if that’s all you have, be generous with it), but if you’re buying a bottle especially, the strong molasses note of the dark kind makes it our preference.For a really punchy finish, instead of adding the rum to the syrup, sprinkle it over the finished cakes, as both Larousse and Leiths recommend just don’t let anyone drive afterwards.Pic infuses her syrup with vanilla, Koffmann adds orange and lemon peel, too, while Willan rather intriguingly goes for coriander seeds, which ide the crowd. A mixture of orange and vanilla proves more popular, but you could use cinnamon, star anise, cardamom or just about any spice that takes your fancy.The recipes employ a variety of techniques to get this syrup into the babas, from painting it on to the cake straight from the oven (Leiths) to adding the babas to a boiling pan (Larousse). But the most successful is Pic’s: she immerses them in cold syrup and leaves them to soak, which cuts out the slightly faffy step of tenderly turning them over and over until you judge they’ve absorbed the maximum amount of liquid.Koffmann observes that “Babas need to be very moist … and the best way to guarantee this is to bake the cakes several days in advance and leave them to harden and go slightly stale. Like stale bread, you’ll find that they’ll be desperate to soak up the liquid.” It’s true – if you have the time, make them up to a week ahead.Serving suggestions in the recipes I try include Pic’s chestnut sauce and vanilla cream, and Koffmann’s chantilly, but I’m not sure you need more than simple whipped cream, a shot of rum – and some fresh fruit, if you must.It is best to make these in medium savarin or ring moulds, though you can get by with small dariole basins or even fairy cake tins.Prep 20 min plus proving and soaking Cook 20 minServes 44g dried yeast3 tsp demerara sugar75g butter, plus extra to grease 200g strong bread flour1 tsp fine salt2 eggs, beatenFor the syrup400g demerara sugar 1 vanilla pod, split 200ml dark rumPut the yeast in a bowl with 75ml warm water and a pinch of the sugar, stir to combine. then leave until bubbly on top.

Once throughly combined, gradually beat in the butter until you have a smooth batter.Grease the moulds thoroughly with butter, and ide the batter between them, filling each hole no more than half full. Leave in a non-draughty place until the batter rises nearly to fill the moulds.While the babas are proving, and if you’re planning to serve them imminently, make the syrup. Heat the sugar in 500ml water, then addthe vanilla pod and its seeds. Stir to dissolve the sugar, then, once it comes to a simmer, take it off the heat and set aside to cool. Heat the oven to 180C (160C fan)350Fgas 4. When the syrup is cool, add the rum. Bake the babas for 20-25 minutes, until golden, then leave to cool on a wire rack. Leave for several days, if possible, then immerse in the syrup and leave for two hours, turning occasionally.

In Moscow, given the chance to attend the Bolshoi Theatre he preferred to go to the British Embassy for a screening of an Alf Garnett film. He was not somebody who held any truck for continental sophistication. And yet his greatest lesson came from the Hungarians.Ramsey was at right-back in November 1953 when the Hungary of Ferenc Puskás, Nándor Hidekuti, József Bozsik et al demolished England 6-3 at Wembley. It was the moment at which English football finally woke up: the modern game might have been codified in England and disseminated around the world by British teachers, sailors, bankers and industrialists, but England could no longer claim to be pre-eminent. On a foggy afternoon at Wembley, the myth of English superiority was irrevocably destroyed.What followed was a period of radical change. A shape and a style of play that had essentially been unaltered for quarter of a century was dismantled. Traditional English wing-play, the apogee of which had come just six months before the humiliation against Hungary as Stanley Matthews inspired Blackpool to a dramatic 4-3 victory over Bolton in the FA Cup final, was phased out. W-M became 4-2-4 became 4-3-3.Ramsey, having spent much of his career under Arthur Rowe, the architect of the push-and-run style that helped Tottenham to the title in 1951 and somebody with enough in common with the Hungarian game that he gave a series of lectures there, was perhaps predisposed to questioning the status quo. As Ipswich manager, withdrawing the left-winger Jimmy Leadbitter and winning an implausible league title in 1962, he was at the forefront of the avant garde.By the time Ramsey led England to glory at the 1966 World Cup, he had withdrawn both wingers and developed an early form of 4-4-2. He would never have acknowledged it, perhaps wouldn’t even have admitted it to himself, but the trigger for the revolution that brought England the World Cup was defeat to Hungary.England weren’t the only nation to benefit from the lessons of Hungary. Directly or indirectly, every World Cup winner since Uruguay in 1930 has been in some way shaped by the great blossoming of footballing thought that occurred in Budapest in the years immediately after the First World War and the diaspora that followed. But as the rest of the world continued to adapt, English football remained broadly insular, as though satisfied that the winning formula it had found would remain permanently applicable.But some teams did evolve, most notably Liverpool, whose dominance of the late 70s and early 80s was at least in part rooted in a switch to a more patient approach after Bill Shankly’s side suffered a pair of uncomfortable defeats to a tactically intelligent Red Star Belgrade in the 1973-74 European Cup. “The Europeans showed that building from the back is the only way to play,” Shankly explained. “It started in Europe and we adapted it into our game at Liverpool where our system had always been a collective one … We realised at Liverpool that you can’t score a goal every time you get the ball. And we learned this from Europe.”By the end of the decade, English teams weren’t just learning the lessons of European teams, they were signing European players. The Dutchmen Arnold Mühren and Frans Thijssen were integral to Ipswich’s success under Bobby Robson. Perhaps more would have arrived had it not been for the 1985 Heysel ban, but by 1992, when the Premier League began, there were only 13 players from outside Britain and Ireland.That rapidly changed. The increasing financial clout of English clubs coupled with the Bosman ruling allowed English clubs to entice major foreign stars: Eric Cantona, Jürgen Klinsmann, Ruud Gullit, Dennis Bergkamp, Gianfranco Zola, Gianluca Vialli. And with them began the Premier League’s growth to become the major global league. Each brought their own ideas, their own way of doing things and that, inevitably, began to change the mentality and approach of the British players working and training alongside them.But the greatest influence was a manager. It was Arsène Wenger who dragged English football into its new age with such cunning ruses as improved nutrition, a targeted counterattack and a detailed knowledge of overseas transfer markets. They seem basic strategies now but at the time they were revolutionary by the time Wenger finally left Arsenal in 2018 his problem was that everybody else had caught up. His innovations by then came as standard.After the disappointment of Jozef Vengloš’s brief reign at Aston Villa, Wenger was proof that European ideas could thrive in English football. Gérard Houllier, Rafa Benítez, José Mourinho, Carlo Ancelotti and Roberto Mancini soon followed. The Premier League became less an English league than a world league played in England, the majority of its best managers Europeans.And so we reach the modern age, and the great clash between Pep Guardiola and Jürgen Klopp, a meeting of two schools of football, one Dutch filtered through Spain, the other characteristically German although with its origins in the Soviet Union. Other than Alex Ferguson, Kenny Dalglish and Manuel Pellegrini, every manager who has won the Premier League has been continental European. The worldwide popularity of the Premier League is to a large degree down to the marriage of the British obsession with pace, effort and physicality to subtler external ideas about positioning, shape and tempo.And this perhaps is the lesson of inter-war Budapest. After the British had brought football, why did the city prove so fecund? In part it was a combination of rapid urbanisation leaving vacant lots (the grunds) that proved ideal training grounds for kids, and writers and intellectuals in the coffee-houses debating football, developing for the first time tactical theories. And the spread of those ideas came about because the economic and political turmoil of the time led to great exodus of the gifted. But it was also because Budapest was a vibrant melting pot of ideas, cultures and ethnicities.English football now is a sporting equivalent. It no longer seems outrageous to see Marcelo Bielsa on the touchline at Barnsley or Phillip Cocu at Northampton. The foreign influence is everywhere. Has the influx of foreign players slowed the development of young English players? Perhaps, but that’s at least as much a product of the richer clubs stockpiling young talent and not playing them. When they do break through, the facilities could hardly be better or the environment more challenging.English football’s only international triumph stemmed from a defeat to Hungary that proved local ideas had become outmoded. English football’s most internationally successful club side, was profoundly shaped by defeat to a Yugoslav team. Its step into modernity was led by a Frenchman. Innovation and development are driven by the interplay of ideas. At the moment, the Premier League, for all its inequalities and flaws, is truly international, a place where erse theories can clash against each other and be tested and refined.If that changes as a result of Brexit, if the European influence is diminished, the consequences for the future can only be damaging."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6b7426bb14f35a05141c96dfb69f538434776506/428_1022_4377_2626/master/4377.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fbd92b15167f331a3a36e869f6f071d1","title":"lauren hemp england shebelieves cup manchester city chip shop","story":"Manchester City’s rising talent has been widely praised and the teenage forward will go into the SheBelieves Cup without fearManchester City’s 19-year-old forward Lauren Hemp is having to get used to high praise. Hemp’s rise has been quick but not quiet. Aged 16, before swapping Bristol City for Manchester, she was named England’s young player of the year and a year later the PFA young player of the year.Now, having pinned down a starting berth in a City squad packed with internationals, Hemp has gone from promising youngster to a relied-on player.Phil Neville has for some time had his eye on the nucleus of the squad that won bronze at the Under-20 World Cup in 2018, including Hemp, and is easing them in.“Last year Lauren Hemp and Sandy MacIver came as training players, they smelled the environment and now they are full-time players in the squad,” the manager said when naming his squad for the SheBelieves Cup, which opens for England against the USA on Thursday. “It has been 18 months in the planning and when you pick young players, they give the squad an energy. If you are good enough, you are old enough.”Hemp’s club and England colleague Ellen White has no doubts on that front: “She’s exciting to watch, exciting to play alongside. She brings something different and she is only going to get better. It will be exciting to see what she can do against the USA and some of the best right-backs in the world.”Chelsea’s captain, Magda Eriksson, described Hemp as “fantastic” when discussing the recent exhilarating 3-3 draw at City. Hemp is humbled by the plaudits. “It’s really nice to hear,” she said, having gone from watching the World Cup on her sofa to sitting in England’s Orlando hotel. “It’s exciting that people are talking about me.“They are people I’ve looked up to in the women’s game since I was a kid. So to know they are now speaking highly of me gives me the confidence to be able to showcase what I’ve got and hopefully bring that to the tournament. It gives me the confidence to play without any fear.”Playing without fear is a characteristic many have picked up on in the winger. “If I make a mistake – everyone makes a mistake – it’s just having that confidence to take players on and I know I have that ability,” she said.There will be plenty hoping that, in the absence of the injured Beth Mead, Hemp will at the very least get some minutes off the bench against the USA.“I’m really excited to come up against some of the best full-backs in the world,” she said. “I check the name on the day but I don’t really think about it too much. I’m just going to play my game and hopefully show everyone that I can beat any right-back that I come up against.”“It was some young girls from the local side that I had played for so it was nice that they recognised me. I think it’s nice for them to know that there is a way to get to the top even though you’re from an area that not that many people come from. There’s not that many opportunities from there but as the women’s game grows, it’s nice to see more.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5416b45a8762485adb18fbae47530247011548d6/0_153_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=85a0ac0a6294b35d01390f06dee6883c","title":"roll up roll up for the premier league hall of fame oh and let the arguments begin","story":"These days we call it ‘engagement’ or ‘interaction’ – but make no mistake this latest piece of off-pitch drama is designed to make football fans madA lot of the tech giants tell you they’re investing so heavily in driverless cars because they want to save lives. And you know, that’s so close to the truth – but it’s not quite it. In fact, they’re investing so heavily in driverless cars because they want to capture ever more of your behavioural data, and that’s much easier to do when you’re interacting with their products instead of driving a car. Be in a car, by all means – but ideally you will soon be interacting with their products in that car, as opposed to driving it. Or to put it another way: these guys don’t want to save lives! They want to ruin them a bit more! (I’m kidding, of course. We’re only at the very beginning of understanding all the great stuff this type of technology has done for us.)It’s hard not to see the same relentless altruism in the Premier League, who seem to be making yet further investment in the idea of football-less football. As discussed here a few weeks ago, the sheer volume of content generated about the league’s first winter break showed how much less essential football itself is becoming to the “product”, while football-adjacent content – off-pitch drama, social media engagement, sponsorship culture and so on – performs better and better all the time.Against this backdrop, then, the announcement of a Premier League Hall of Fame met with the expected reception. Which is to say: vast interaction, in the form of vast derision. But as we know, the type of interaction seems to be largely irrelevant these days. Only last week, as has been much noted, Manchester United’s managing director Richard Arnold was announcing smugly that the loan signing of Odion Ighalo was the top trend worldwide on Twitter. It’s an interesting metric of success, though by no means one we should discount. As I type this, the top two trending topics on UK Twitter are Peter Andre and Liz Truss – both of whom would arguably be similarly impressive signings for Arnold, who has yet to alight on one Official Derision Partner of Manchester United.But before we go on, a quick recap on the Premier League’s big idea. At this stage, there do not appear to be plans to make the Premier League Hall of Fame a physical facility, like the Rock ’n’ Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland, Ohio. This is sadly not a museum of Premier League history, which could make space for such priceless cultural artefacts as the Chateau Petrus-soaked napkin on which Richard Scudamore once scribbled “Game 39???”, or the air rifle Ashley Cole shot the work experience kid with.Instead, according to the official portentous press release on the matter, being inducted will come with a medal and will be “the highest inidual honour awarded to players by the League”. Think of this as the Victoria Cross, with any medal a player might have got for actually winning the Premier League hereby immediately downgraded to the equivalent of a mere mention in dispatches. The first two inductees will be announced in two weeks’ time, with the gazillions of fans inevitably enraged by the choice invited to get involved and vote for others to join them. Yup, classic Premier League. They’ve got us right where they want us.We also learned that the Hall of Fame is to be “presented by Budweiser”, whatever that means, whose global vice president of marketing says: “We are passionate about football, and so are our consumers.” And he might be right. They certainly aren’t passionate about beer, that’s for sure.Anyway, that’s about the size of the plan. On the one hand, I quite enjoy the first big idea of new Premier League chief Richard Masters being a best-of-the-best initiative. As a man who was famously something like the seventh choice for his role, this marks him out as a keen ironist.On the other hand, what is the point of any of this stuff but the endless, ferociously pointless online rows it generates? We don’t call them that, of course – it is “engagement”, or “interaction”, or “loyalty”. Inspired by the Eskimos of cliché, we now have 100 different words for calling someone wrong on the internet. Great swathes of modern life and culture are now governed by a series of euphemistic abstract nouns for what is – let’s face it – the business of getting people to spend hours furiously insulting each other online. Or as Masters prefers to sanitise it: “It will be an occasion for our fans around the world to look back over the years and help us celebrate some truly exceptional playing careers.”It will also be an occasion for a lot of newspaper articles – like this one, in fact – that can’t leave well alone. After all, this is how they get you. At the weekend I read a column stating that this Hall of Fame devalues the worthy Hall of Fame that already exists at the National Football Museum in Manchester – a column which then immediately proceeded to devalue the latter Hall of Fame by demanding to know why Terry Butcher wasn’t the crowning glory of it. “Surely nobody can disagree,” this stated, “that he should bestride the Hall of Fame, a bloody bandage round his head.” “If it helps,” I immediately began replying sarcastically to the pixels on my phone, “I can totally disagree?”On that day, I managed to find the strength to delete this wildly unnecessary interjection before I posted it – but now I’ve fallen right off the wagon and written this. That’s the siren-song of football-less football for you: only the truly pure and the truly strong fail to get sucked in."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/28203a6501d1f904d5fc268ef192be50fbceda67/0_0_2698_1619/master/2698.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=805063da69e4476b1d35107b6950c039","title":"wayne rooney not as revered as cantona complete manchester united hero derby","story":"There are plenty of special Rooney moments for Manchester United fans to recall before he faces them with Derby It is a pity in some ways that fifth-round replays have been abolished in the FA Cup. Wayne Rooney turns 35 this year, and with Derby County in the bottom half of the Championship the chances seem slim of a return to Old Trafford to allow the Manchester United faithful one last chance to show their appreciation.Doubtless Rooney will be warmly received by the travelling United support at Pride Park for Thursday’s Cup tie, though one imagines the Manchester reaction to a fleeting visit by a card-carrying club legend would be something to behold. Perhaps the former England striker is not quite as revered as, say, Eric Cantona, because he joined a winning side rather than completing an emerging one stayed longer, possibly a season or two too long confounded a few managers held a gun to the club’s head on a couple of occasions and failed to amuse the world with gnomic utterances about seagulls following trawlers, but if the Frenchman was half-footballer, half-folk myth Rooney has the numbers to prove he is the complete United hero.Among former players Sir Bobby Charlton is still the ultimate Manchester United icon, a survivor of Munich and winner of the World Cup, though Rooney eclipsed his goalscoring records for club and country before moving on from Old Trafford. That sort of productivity brooks no argument, particularly as Rooney scored his 253 goals in around 200 fewer appearances than Charlton made to post the previous record of 249.The comparison is not quite exact or fair, Charlton played more as a midfielder than out-and-out striker, though he did stay at United for practically the whole of his playing career. Rooney ended up in midfield, not always convincingly, but played more than 100 games for Everton either side of his United career, and has just come back from a couple of seasons in America with DC United. While in the States, Rooney not only contributed some spectacular goals and assists, he kept up his overall scoring standard by averaging roughly a goal every other game. He scored 25 times in 52 appearances for DC United, his 253 goals for Manchester United came in 559 appearances, and his England record of 53 goals came from 119 call-ups.That makes him the most-capped England outfield player, second only to Peter Shilton in the appearance list, and with 208 goals Rooney is also the second most prolific scorer of the Premier League era behind Alan Shearer. While all that adds up to a consistently impressive output that few are going to match, it is the special moments in a United shirt that the present generation of Old Trafford supporters hold most dear.The hat-trick on debut against Fenerbahce when debate was still raging about the wisdom of United spending £25m on a teenager. The sum seems trifling now, but Sir Alex Ferguson later confirmed that “plenty of eyebrows were raised” in 2004 when he recommended the signing to the board. Kissing the United badge on his shirt after scoring a goal against Everton. Scoring twice and having a hand in the other three as United came back from a two-goal deficit to win at Tottenham in 2009. The overhead bicycle kick against Manchester City in 2011 that brought just one of Rooney’s goal-of-the-season awards and was described by Ferguson as a personal favourite.There were many other milestones in a 13-year United career, and plenty of colour and controversy too. On and off the field, even as he approached Charlton’s scoring records, Rooney never quite cut the blameless figure of his gentlemanly predecessor, though in terms of cautions and red cards the tolerances for what is permissible have changed massively in the past couple of decades, along with the pace of the game and the demands from managers for forwards to become much more involved in winning the ball back.The FA Cup has changed a lot too, and not necessarily for the better. If it seems ridiculous that United and Derby will know their quarter-final opponent before they kick off, it is no more ridiculous than abandoning the principle of replays halfway through a knockout competition or staggering the fifth round across four weekday nights for maximum television exposure. This venerable old institution, with its semi-finals at Wembley and final kicking off at 5.50pm, looks like something designed by a committee, trying to satisfy everybody and ending up pleasing no one.Yet Rooney coming up against his old club is a plot twist anyone can savour. It will be 18 years in October since the Goodison goal against Arsenal that announced the 16-year-old Rooney’s arrival on the major stage and, despite all the gloomy prognoses of burnout based on too much football at too young an age, his career is still going strong. Not quite as strong as before, granted. But, taken in its entirety, stronger than most."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8c6f0a7d1bba44e781225bce583ee76f55d02a10/0_264_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3a9ddb7f49d6eb948970d7bb5f406937","title":"liverpool enter wobble territory as chelsea peak behind full backs","story":"Three defeats in four games for Jurgen Klopp’s side hint at a vulnerability to be found on the flanksEnter: the wobble. On a chilly, slightly wild night at Stamford Bridge Chelsea progressed to the quarter-finals of the FA Cup at the expense of the team previously known as Jürgen Klopp’s Irresistible Red Machine.Sport loves a premature note of crisis. Perhaps one or two will now be offered, although Klopp has probably earned a little breathing space before the cleaver is unsheathed. Liverpool played well in patches and might have wrenched the game their way with better finishing. But there was something else too, a sense of a pattern emerging. Even, whisper it, of some more systemic vulnerability being winkled out.How do you kill that which cannot be killed? How do you derail a runaway train? The answer, English football seems to have concluded – belatedly, Napoli might say – is you close down the full-backs. Take the flanks. Win wide. Hope they don’t score first. Stick to the plan. Here endeth the lessons of Watford.Chelsea came to Stamford Bridge with something similar in mind. They packed the central midfield, pressed hard on the flanks and took their chances. At the end of which Liverpool have three defeats from four and an FA Cup exit at the hands of a Chelsea team led in midfield by a fine display from Billy Gilmour. Gilmour is 18-years-old and 5ft 5in. He glided about the pitch like some wonderfully gifted Yugoslavia playmaker of the late 1980s, albeit in this case from Scotland via Cobham.How much will this defeat hurt Liverpool? This is not a club that defines itself in FA Cup wins, as two in the last 28 years might suggest. More interesting is the sense of opponents finally locating some traction.Klopp did pick a callow Cup team. Neco Williams started. Curtis Jones, a year older at 19, was in central midfield. Right-back was the key change, though, in a team who locate their attacking pulse on the flanks.It isn’t hard to see who Williams bases his game on. The surge, the stroll. The ball pinged in from the right with vicious fade and slice. Williams was even caught upfield early on, Trent-style, as Pedro skittered in behind, but closed the space with a spurt of gas. If you do not see the thrillingly cavalier red-shirted right-back you require please ask – others are available. That early diagonal pass looked like a plan. Frank Lampard had packed his flanks with speed and hustle, albeit slightly venerable speed and hustle in Pedro and Willian. Between them they helped make Chelsea’s opening goal.Williams passed back into central defence. Chelsea pressed high, dislodging the ball, which ran to Willian. His shot was straight at Adrián, who showed all the quick-footed agility of a municipal wheelie bin, allowing it to hit him and bounce away into the corner. Adrián made exculpatory gestures, suggesting his view had been blocked – Stamford Bridge seemed unsympathetic.Liverpool had plenty of chances to equalise. There was a triple block on the goalline at one point. They dominated the start of the second half in familiar fashion. But there was a lack of razor edge too. Sadio Mané has one goal away from Anfield since November. Divock Origi has none this season, Takumi Minamino neither. It showed at times.But it also made for a fun, carefree Cup tie. There were more than a hundred misplaced passes in the first half alone, along with 19 shots. The key stat, though, was Chelsea’s 35 long passes, many in search of that tender point behind the advancing red lines.Most likely this is just a blip. Liverpool don’t need control to win games. They can run harder than you, fight more furiously. Is this the way it’s going to be from here? A steamrollering team cranking at the throttle, trying to jump-start themselves through the endgame?Certainly the sense of interruption remains after that half-baked mid-season break, a break where it always felt like the phone was still on, inbox still pinging, pulse never quite at rest.Perhaps other teams used that time better, planned better, studied more. Another key to Watford’s success was preying on Liverpool’s high defensive line. No doubt the prospect of Olivier Giroud being fired up like a petrol lawnmower, ears pinned back, goggles clamped, ready to chug in behind Virgil van Dijk will have shot a bolt of terror through the away dressing room. These days Giroud runs like a man remembering, vaguely, how it’s done.But he did his job between the wide players and helped to make the second goal too, drawing Van Dijk upfield and allowing Chelsea to launch a full-length break. Ross Barkley ran on unchallenged then ked the ball past the unhappy Adrián.Chelsea will take great heart from victory. For Liverpool defeat will feel like a minor tremor. This team are too good not to adjust and find their rhythms again. But for the rest of the league, and for Atlético Madrid, due at Anfield in a week’s time, the next few games have their own fascination. Not to mention the sense, at last, of some space to work in."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4b31eb729deb35a97d19963fb45ffca82df4dd16/0_2_8280_4969/master/8280.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9942a0e0fee24a4d1d2c46d27ff57691","title":"10 smart home devices to get the best out of your amazon echo","story":"Improve your domestic life with these Alexa-enabled productsAccording to research by PwC, it’s predicted that the UK will spend an incredible £10.8bn on smart-home technology in 2019.

We asked some Amazon Echo users to share their most-used commandsSmart speakers have become a fact of life in the UK in 2019, so much so that in March this year, they were added to the list of items the government uses to accurately measure the cost of living.For some, the Echo is the perfect device to keep children entertained on a regular basis. Laura Moross, a PR consultant from London, explains that her family’s Echo is placed in the kitchen, so that she can use it when playing with the children or helping her kids with their homework.“At breakfast we can shout out song requests – everything from Baby Shark to G-Love and Special Sauce,” she says.Last Christmas, she says, she used the Echo to amuse her children by asking Alexa to track Santa’s whereabouts around the world, as well as asking: “Alexa, how many sleeps until Christmas?” Meanwhile, her children are also amused to hear the Echo’s various fart noises on demand.Meanwhile, Govind Dhaliwal, 31, from Milton Keynes, uses the device while he cooks – to convert units of measurement, and also as a timer.“I can run multiple Alexa timers simultaneously – and I can identify each one by giving them names, that way I know when to check on the food,” he says.Dhaliwal also uses the BBC Good Food skill from time to time to get specific recipes read out to him. He says that the “hands-free” element helps him to focus on cooking without having to keep washing his hands to revert back to a screen to read the recipe again.“It’s especially helpful as you can ask Alexa to pause the recipe while you carry out each part of the method and then carry on from where you left off,” he says.Kate Smith, 35, from London, asks Alexa to turn on her downstairs lights when she walks into the room. This works using a smart plug, which she has connected to her lamps.“It’s quite nice to walk in and be able to turn on the lamps to provide mood lighting, as we don’t use the main lights as much,” she says.In addition, Smith asks Alexa to add items to her shopping list, which can also be viewed on the Alexa app on her phone, meaning she doesn’t have to worry about forgetting her shopping list anymore.For Paul Granger, 67, from Derbyshire, the main reason he uses the Echo is to listen to Audible in his living room.“Since retiring I have more leisure time, and I enjoy being able to sit down and listen to one of my favourite books, while taking in the view of my garden at the same time,” he says.In addition, Granger uses Alexa to remind him to take his medication and to ask for the latest news from the . To do this he asks Alexa to open the , and then asks for the latest cricket headlines and the latest news on Brexit.There are also those that rely on Alexa to control their smart homes.Kelly Morgan, 23, from Hull, has connected her smart speaker to her smart lights, doorbell, camera and lock. This means she can ask Alexa to lock her front door without the need for keys. It also gives her peace of mind when she’s on holiday.“We keep the Echo on when we’re away, as the doorbell triggers Alexa announcements, and we also have scheduled the lights to go on at certain times to give people the impression that we’re at home,” she says.As our world becomes more connected, smart speakers will only prove more useful – perhaps, one day, even vital. But even in 2019, a mere five years since Amazon Echo first hit the market and took smart speakers mainstream, the question is less “What can I use my Echo for?” and more “What can’t I use it for?”Learn more about what you can do with Alexa"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0ddf1f62130f6cde7a879a721a3d2f98bed2fb92/295_206_1369_822/master/1369.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fa8291b075e33f5895f543aed0b290c8","title":"can alexa help lower my screen time while keeping me connected","story":"With an Amazon Echo Dot at hand,  Alim Kheraj learns to break free of social media bad habitsI used to feel quite superior because of how little I relied on the tiny gods in our pockets – the devices that require so much time and devotion from everyone else. Then I started to get “screen time” notifications. This unwanted weekly intrusion was sobering: on average, I was using my phone for nearly four hours a day. And the bulk of that time was spent on social media.When I really thought about it, I could see how this came to be. Setting an alarm before bed turned into scrolling through Twitter for an hour checking the weather became a marathon Reddit session. All roads led back to social media, even if I’d picked up my phone with entirely different intentions.I was eager, then, to see if an Amazon Echo Dot with Alexa could change my behaviour. Reflecting on how I found myself inevitably in a social media hole whenever I used my phone, it felt logical that, if I could replace tasks I used my phone for with the smart speaker, I’d avoid wandering on to Twitter and ultimately prevent unnecessary phone time.When the Echo Dot arrived, I decided that the living room would be the best place for it. Setting it up was a doddle, although it did involve using my phone, but before long I had linked the speaker with my music streaming provider, my Audible account and had even saved recipes that I thought I might try during the week. That first evening – seduced by the allure of shiny new technology – I sat for two hours listening to podcasts on the sofa, my phone forgotten.Conscious that the Echo wasn’t there just to feed my true crime addiction, I scoped around to find out some other skills and tasks I could assign it. To prevent myself from waking up and looking up the news, weather and tube status on my phone, I decided to programme a morning routine – a set of Alexa’s commands triggered by a simple voice instruction. The next morning while having breakfast, I asked Alexa to “start my day”. First came a fact of the day, then the weather and finally the ’s news briefing, a 30-minute cut of the latest news, sport and reviews, read to you by Alexa.It was all very useful, but, being in a shared flat, having Alexa tell me the weather forecast out loud while my flatmate slept felt a little inconsiderate. And while I wish I had 30 minutes to spare to listen to a podcast each morning before leaving the house, it’s just not realistic. Like with any new addition to your home, Alexa and I needed to adjust.Diving back into the app, I reprogrammed my morning routine, replacing the news briefing with a mindfulness exercise. To get the news, I decided that I would use the  skill. The next morning, after being told that it was Britney Spears’s 38th birthday that day, I luxuriated in a minute’s worth of mindfulness, bathed in the soundscape of a forest, before asking Alexa to read me the headlines. When it was time to leave, I realised that I had only used my phone that morning to tweet a happy birthday to Ms Spears. Win.My phone use in the evening, however, was still a problem. Flatsharing means you have to be flexible, and arriving home after my flatmate I soon understood that it would be impossible to sit in the living room all night listening to audiobooks or podcasts or even doing Harry Potter trivia. I could hardly ask him to turn the TV off and vacate our shared space so I could listen to an episode of My Dad Wrote a Porno. So, the decision was made: I would take Alexa to my bedroom.Not only could I now set up alarms to wake me up, but I could also add little reminders each morning to water the plants or to not forget my phone charger before leaving the house without Alexa booming them out at 8am and freaking my housemate out. In the evenings, I found that I didn’t mind being holed up in my bedroom, as Alexa read me audiobooks and podcasts. As someone who needs background noise to sleep, I found that dozing off to a podcast was far more comfortable than wearing headphones in bed. I even added a sleep timer so that I didn’t miss anything when I eventually fell asleep.Most notable, though, was how easily using the Echo and Alexa replaced my phone. Sure, I was still drawn into the odd scour of Reddit and Twitter, but just asking Alexa to play me the latest episode of What Makes a Killer (yes, I know, not really light bedtime listening) instead of scoping it out on my phone before ultimately playing it while simultaneously bingeing on social media, meant I gave the podcast my full attention. I also didn’t fall asleep with my phone in my bed, either.It’s probably still too early to say that the Echo and Alexa have changed my life. But without doubt, it has shifted my behaviours. I make time in the mornings for mindfulness and engage properly, instead of just getting riled up by the latest scandal on Twitter. Mostly, though, it’s made me realise how much easier it is to find time in the day to take for yourself when you’re not sucked into hours scrolling on your phone. This week alone I’ve made my way through five hours of a new audiobook and my morning mindfulness is a revelation.Learn more about what you can do with Alexa"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c8adbafa13df3beb1dd61f6ff187e3532556d439/0_0_6246_3748/master/6246.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4b7be414563553090e2390b09460f795","title":"so i got an amazon echo but can alexa get my life together","story":"Looking to streamline his life, writer Phil Samba bought an Amazon Echo Dot to see if the smart speaker could provide some assistance … Like every millennial, I’m obsessed with self improvement. Also like every millennial, I somehow constantly manage to never do any of the things I need to do to self-improve. I’m hoping that technology can help me get it together – so I got an Amazon Echo 3rd generation, with Alexa.The Echo Dot comes in a small box, which I open up to reveal a small speaker, just larger in diameter than a drinks coaster, but small enough to hold in your hand. Aesthetically, it’s very futuristic – at the top within the light ring are four tiny microphones and four buttons – volume up, volume down, mute and Alexa. It feels smooth around the sides with adaptor and aux ports at the back.Mine is heather grey, but you can get them in charcoal, plum and sandstone too – you can even get one with a clock to show you the time. There’s an information document, a charger, a user manual and a list of commands to try, such as: “Alexa, set a 10-minute timer” and “Alexa, add toilet paper to my shopping list”.To set up, I need to be connected to my wifi and download the Amazon Alexa app on to my smartphone. Set-up is easy, all within the app, and takes about five to 10 minutes – but if you struggle, there are a million and one tutorials on YouTube for you to follow and a dedicated Echo help page.There are a ton of things you can do with the Echo straight out of the box, such as setting alarms and asking it trivia questions. To unlock even more value, you can add skills via the Alexa smartphone app or just by using your voice.I like to tell people I’d be fitter if I had more time to go to the gym, safe in the knowledge that I don’t actually have the time. Now I have no excuse. I never thought Alexa would be able to help me exercise in any way, but I was wrong. The Body Coach skill allows me to work out as Joe Wicks, the Body Coach, keeps me motivated with cries of: “You’ll smash it!” It has seven 15-minute, high-intensity interval training (HIIT) workouts to help you burn fat when you’re short on time, including marching, star jumps, squats, push-ups and crunches – and that’s just lesson one. I can’t say I’m at my target weight yet, but it’s definitely helping me get more regular exercise in.Learning a new language can be quite daunting but with the Translated skill it no longer has to be. I ask Alexa to teach me how to say any word or phrase in Spanish, and Translated reads it out so I can learn how to say it myself. I can even ask the skill to slow down or repeat the translation until I’m happy I’ve nailed it. I’ve already learned how to introduce myself: Me llamo Phil! I’m hoping that a few minutes a day practising while cooking or cleaning can really make me el experto.I often struggle to get to sleep but Sleep and Relaxation Sounds is excellent at resolving this. It has hundreds of ambient sounds that can be used to help with meditation or lull you into a state of complete relaxation. Once the skill is open, I just say: “Alexa, help me sleep”, or “Alexa, play heavy rain”, and I’m zoning out in no time listening to the downpour.My flatmate has an Echo, so we use Drop In – an inbuilt, two-way, intercom-like feature that connects two Alexa-enabled devices together once permissions are enabled. It’s perfect for letting my housemate on the top floor know that dinner is ready. All I had to do was say: “Alexa, drop in on the attic room”, and I can immediately communicate with my flatmate without walking up the steps.It turns out playing a game with a speaker is actually a lot of fun. I try out Twenty Questions: you think of any animal, mineral, music or vegetable and the skill asks 20 questions that you can answer, aiming to work it out in 20 questions or fewer. I play with Beyoncé’s 2016 single Formation – of course – and Alexa gets it in 10 questions. Impressive! You can also play a variety of other games, such as Deal or No Deal and Pointless.Alexa is a lot of fun, but, importantly, she’s really handy at helping you with those small tasks that can take up time or easily be forgotten. It can play music, tell the time, give you news briefings and weather forecasts, check traffic and so much more. Most surprisingly, it helped me to begin a brand new fitness journey. I’m interested in adding some smart tech soon to make it more powerful. I could turn lights on and off, control TVs, open garage doors and change the temperature. I’m excited to continue exploring all its capabilities.Learn more about what you can do with Alexa"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c940cedd6dbf8e0d9a6f156871582f7fe750290b/48_342_2984_1790/master/2984.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=805355e1b71d221e66ab0b955e920f6a","title":"scientists turn to tech to prevent second wave of locusts in east africa","story":"Researchers use supercomputer to predict potential breeding areas as food security fears growScientists monitoring the movements of the worst locust outbreak in Kenya in 70 years are hopeful that a new tracking programme they will be able to prevent a second surge of the crop-ravaging insects.The UN has described the locust outbreak in the Horn of Africa, and the widespread breeding of the insects in Kenya, Ethiopia and Somalia that has followed, as “extremely alarming”.The UN’s Food and Agriculture Organization has warned that an imminent second hatch of the insects could threaten the food security of 25 million people across the region as it enters the cropping season.Kenneth Mwangi, a satellite information scientist, based at the Intergovernmental Authority on Development climate prediction and applications centre, based in Nairobi, said researchers were running a supercomputer model to predict breeding areas that may have been missed by ground monitoring. These areas could become sources of new swarms if not sprayed.“The model will be able to tell us the areas in which hoppers are emerging,” said Mwangi. “We will also get ground information. These areas can become a source of an upsurge, or a new generation of hoppers. It becomes very difficult and expensive to control, which is why we are looking to prevent an upsurge.“The focus will be on stopping hoppers becoming adults, as that leads to another cycle of infestation. We want to avoid that. We want to advise governments early, before an upsurge happens.”Researchers are now inputting data on soil moisture and vegetation cover to help predict where eggs have been laid and are likely to hatch and thrive. This will then provide data on where African governments can direct their spraying efforts, helping to control the hoppers before they swarm.“So far, we’ve been able to catch where the swarms are going to be,” he said. “We were able to tell the government of Uganda that locusts are expected to come through and they mobilised the army, and that worked well. Now we can focus on the areas that locusts have reproduced.“Governments are working, spraying in areas that hoppers have been reported. So now, the governments might be able to catch areas they have missed and haven’t been reported.”Mwangi added: “Hopefully, based on current intervention, the worst case scenario can be avoided. The Kenyan government is on high alert and effective control measures have been put in place.”Billions of locusts have already devastated crops in Somalia, Ethiopia and Kenya, countries with fragile food security. Swarms have also been spotted in Uganda, Tanzania, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and South Sudan.A single swarm can contain up to 150 million locusts per sq km of farmland.The last locust surge in Africa, in 2003–04, involved two or three generations of the insects across 23 African countries and took two years to control, Mwangi said.“Effective control is estimated to be around $60m (£47m) but, if an upsurge occurs, the cost will soar to $500m.”Now is the most “critical period” for control of the desert locusts, because any eggs laid in the past month coincide with the cropping season.Abubakr Salih Babiker, a climate scientist at Nariobi’s climate and prediction centre, said: “The risk for us is that this is the beginning of a new growing season, from Somalia and Uganda, and if the desert locusts are not controlled it can be a huge crisis in food security of the whole region.”Laura Paterson, the coordination officer for the UN World Meteorological Organization in New York, said: “We have been receiving the model output showing where the locusts are expected to spread. This type of prediction analysis means the UN is on the front foot to know what’s coming, and the UN system on the ground is able to deal with it.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/de73a78294eb3da92a6931c2aea32787400e66e5/0_0_7360_4417/master/7360.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6a57ef7dc331d0faae31f2b292e0c842","title":"tell us are money struggles making you lonely","story":"We want to find out how people are feeling isolated by their financial woesWe may be bad at talking about money but we are arguably even worse at talking about our difficulties managing it.Research by the Money Advice Service found that half of people in debt did not want to talk to friends and family about it because they didn’t want to worry them.Money struggles can lead to people feeling cut off from others for a range of reasons, but withdrawing into financial loneliness can make it even harder to solve your problems.We want to understand more about how people feel isolated as a result of their financial woes.How has your employment status affected your income?

That includes the commander-in-chief.But he wants to set the record straight on a recent dust-up over a performance at a Bernie Sanders rally that got him removed from Public Enemy, the group he helped form. It’s Chuck D, co-founder and core member of the rap group, who Flav has problems with. Not Bernie Sanders.“I don’t have anything against Bernie. I think he’s a good person and I wish him luck,” Flav told the  in an interview at San Diego international airport on Super Tuesday, as he waited for his flight to Las Vegas.“I think they’re all good people,” he said. “Except Trump. Some people tried to say I did this because I’m a Trump supporter and that’s not true. Fuck Trump!”The recent episode started after Sanders’ campaign announced last week that Public Enemy was slated to perform a set at a rally for the Vermont senator. Flav’s lawyers sent a letter, which said that Flav had not endorsed any presidential candidates and that Sanders was not authorized to use the group’s image without his permission.“Hey Bernie, don’t do this,” Flav added in a handwritten note that appended the letter.In response, the group issued a statement saying it would be “moving forward without Flavor Flav” and thanked him for his years of service.In the interview, Flav said the dispute had nothing to do with Sanders, but with Chuck D for including him in plans for a performance he hadn’t agreed to.“Why try to say I’m a part of something I’m not a part of? That was all Chuck D,” said Flav.Chuck D said on Twitter that Flav’s decision to miss the performance came down to money.Tensions between the two rappers date back years Flav once sued Chuck D and the group’s management company over unpaid earnings.Despite the recent flare-up, Flav was met with fist bumps and cheers of “Flava Flaaaaav” from TSA agents patting down his pockets at security. Asked by the  about the day’s Democratic primary contest, Flav said he hadn’t spent it waiting in line to cast a ballot.

Rutherford said: “It feels great, it feels the right time, we’re looking forward to doing it. A lot of our contemporaries have been playing a lot – we’ve done two shows in the UK in the last 28 years.”The group said that they would be joined by Phil Collins’ 18-year-old son Nicholas on drums for the shows. “He plays like me and he kind of has the same attitude as me,” said Collins. “So that was a good starter.”Quizzed on the potential setlist, Collins said: “There are songs you feel you have to play because the audience would feel cheated if you didn’t, then it’s a question of putting the rest of the stuff together from songs we haven’t played for a long time.”Ahead of their appearance on BBC Radio 2, the band posted a clue to their Instagram page, reading: “And then there were three”. The group last played together in 2007, their first tour with drummer Phil Collins in 14 years, and have faced constant speculation about the possibility of a reunion in the intervening years. In January, the trio were spotted at a New York Knicks game at Madison Square Garden, sparking renewed rumours.Genesis formed at Charterhouse school in Surrey in 1967, and enjoyed cult success until the early 1970s, when their fourth album, Foxtrot, became their highest-charting release, and a theatrical tour stoked their reputation.They reached a creative peak with the 1974 album The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway, which would be their last with Peter Gabriel. He left in 1975, at the end of an even more elaborate tour for the record, and embarked on a highly influential solo career.Their progressive origins would gradually smooth into a more generic pop sound. Following Gabriel’s departure, Phil Collins took over as lead singer, and Genesis achieved massive commercial success with A Trick of the Tail in 1976. Steve Hackett would leave the band a year later, leaving them as the trio of Collins, Rutherford and Banks.It is estimated that Genesis have sold between 100 and 150m albums worldwide. In 2010, they were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Their last album was Calling All Stations, released in 1997.Tickets for the Last Domino tour go on sale at 9am on 6 March.

It allegedly occurred when she was international development secretary between 2016 and 2017.Patel denies all the allegations against her.Sir Philip Rutnam dramatically resigned as Home Office permanent secretary on Saturday, claiming he had been subjected to a briefing campaign against him that had been condoned by Patel, and has begun legal action against the government for constructive dismissal.A former aide to Patel, who was previously an employment minister at the Department for Work and Pensions, was also allegedly given a £25,000 payout after taking an overdose of prescription medicine following alleged bullying.Corbyn said the prime minister must make the findings of any investigation public but that he was pushing for an independent procedure as the government could not be “judge and jury” on whether a cabinet member had broken the ministerial code.The Labour leader said: “Will he now commit to an independent investigation into the home secretary’s conduct led by an external lawyer and commit to a date when its findings will be made public?”Johnson replied that it was right there should be an investigation into any allegations of bullying and that is what the Cabinet Office was doing. He said it would be led by Sir Alex Allan, the prime minister’s independent adviser on ministerial standards. He said: “She is keeping this country safe by putting in record numbers of police officers. She believes in stopping the early release of offenders and she is bringing in a system to tackle our migration crisis with an Australian-style points-based system.”Hitting back at Corbyn, he added: “He would scrap stop and search. He believes in getting rid of our security services and he certainly wouldn’t tackle our immigration system.”Corbyn said: “It’s about whether he will release the findings of an investigation into the home secretary’s behaviour. A government cannot be judge and jury over its own conduct. There has to be an independent element to that investigation.”He said the fresh allegations from Patel’s time at the Department for International Development suggested a “shocking and unacceptable pattern of behaviour” across three government departments.Corbyn’s spokesperson subsequently revealed that Labour had been handed details of further questions about the home secretary’s conduct in recent days. “We have been contacted by former staff of Priti Patel saying there are additional allegations of bullying,” the spokesman said.Mocking the prime minister over his previous use of crass language to discuss wasted money, Corbyn said: “On each occasion, tens of thousands of pounds of hard-earned taxpayers’ money has been spaffed up the wall to buy their silence,” and asked Johnson whether he was aware of the allegations and if he was, why had he appointed Patel.Johnson replied: “The home secretary is doing an outstanding job. I have every confidence in her. If there are allegations, of course it’s right they should be properly investigated by the Cabinet Office and that is what is happening.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9bfe5f3038bec0724f25f0f0687df4c81cb9f29d/0_60_1736_1042/master/1736.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=91277c69fd7b3a23562beba37f4102e6","title":"assisted dying maid canada leila bell","story":"Grappling with Alzheimer’s, Leila Bell decided to end her life. She used her final days to call on Canada to change its rulesLeila Bell, an 85-year-old great grandmother in Vancouver, decided the circumstances of her death warranted one last act of advocacy.She told a handful of close friends, her psychologist and her doctor about her plan. Her long-time confidante Sarah Townsend made the arrangements.On 22 August 2019, six days before the day Bell was scheduled to die, a freelance photojournalist and an interviewer met Bell at Townsend’s home. Bell sat in an armchair in the living room, wearing scarlet lipstick and freshly styled hair for the camera, and, looking straight ahead, described her plight.She wanted to live longer, she could live longer, but she had to die now. Otherwise, she risked losing her chance to die with dignity. In order to meet the Canadian regulations for medical assistance in dying, known as Maid, Bell had to die before she became any sicker.This, she believed, was wrong, as she explained on camera. “This is my last activist ...” she said into the camera and paused, searching for the perfect word. She smiled when it came to her. “… Offering.”Bell had been diagnosed with early-stage Alzheimer’s disease 16 months earlier. She had watched her mother die from the same disease decades before. Near the end, her mother couldn’t recognize a table, chairs or her own daughter, Bell recalled. During those visits, Bell told herself that she did not want her family and friends to endure the stress of caring for her if she ever developed Alzheimer’s.“I remember how awful it was to see the deterioration of this woman who lost everything, every part of her ultimately except her shell,” she said.Bell first noticed something amiss when she was 82 years old. She’d lose her line of thought while reading, “and reading was one of my, since childhood, my favourite things to do”, she said. She was taking university courses in writing and philosophy at the time, and dropped them because she couldn’t concentrate.She saw a doctor who gave her the diagnosis: Alzheimer’s disease, early stage.Bell, who lived alone, saw herself changing in the months after her diagnosis. She got physically lost going shopping and mentally lost during conversations. She grew frustrated when she could not find the perfect word or figure out her way through a problem.Solving problems was her job: she’d been a lifelong activist who had advocated for breaking down barriers to women in the workplace since the 1970s. “I never marched or burned my bra,” she said, but “my concern about the status of women in society was a very key one. I tried everything I could to have an impact on that.” She marched in gay pride parades long before most politicians dared to, dyeing her hair purple in support of the LGBTQ+ community.A single mother of three, Bell put herself through university at night while working full-time. She went to become a high-ranking civil servant, overseeing more than 700 employees in the province’s health commission. After retiring, she was wooed back to work for a year, a job she did partly pro bono, to help a not-for-profit organization that supports women and at-risk pregnant teens.Other people might be more easygoing about fumbling for the right word but Bell was not, she said. She was becoming uncharacteristically emotional and found herself weeping in public. “This is thwarting me … one loss piles on top of another loss, and until it gets to the point where, being a human being of my nature and type, there’s scarcely anything left in it,” she said. “I don’t know how best to explain that.”She recognized that her disease was worsening and, in May 2019, she made the choice to apply for an assisted death before she lost her independence.The problem, as she saw it, is that Canada’s Maid law currently only covers people who have the capacity to give informed consent on the day of their death, so a person with advanced Alzheimer’s is unlikely to qualify. What’s more, it is impossible with a disease like Alzheimer’s to predict when a person will lose their capacity to consent. The rate of change can be unpredictable – often, an event like a fall or an infection can suddenly speed up decline.She weighed the decision privately before she set a date. She feared making the wrong choice – of waiting too long and missing out on the chance to have medical help in dying, or dying too early and missing out on time with those she loved, including her grandchildren and great-granddaughter.In the video, Bell is razor-sharp, logical and unemotional. She speaks in sentences of complex structure – contrary to the commonly held stereotype of a person with Alzheimer’s. When she laughs, she throws her head back with delight. But for most of the two hours, she delivers her message with sobriety, arguing that the more than 500,000 Canadians with Alzheimer’s and other dementias should be able to make advanced requests for medical assistance in dying.“If I had been able to do an advanced request, I would not have had to decide to make that decision to die now,” said Bell. “I have been forced to decide now because I fear that at some future time, I will not be able to request it due to the compromise in my brain being much more severe.”You can hear her explain how sure she was:In 2016, the Canadian government passed a law allowing medical assistance in dying. Nurse practitioners or physicians can assess a person’s eligibility for Maid and carry out the procedure, and it is covered by the country’s publicly funded health system.But there are restrictions. To be eligible, a person must meet certain criteria: they must be candidates for health services funded by a government within Canada they must be at least 18 years old and capable of making decisions about their health. They must have a “grievous and irremediable medical condition”. The request must be voluntary, and the person requesting it must be informed of all the means available to relieve their suffering, including palliative care.And, finally, they must give informed consent at least twice: first, on the day they are assessed for eligibility and again, after a minimum 10-day waiting period, on the day they receive Maid. To give informed consent, a person must have “capacity” – a medical concept demonstrated by skills involving memory, judgment and decision-making.Many supporters of Maid in Canada feel the law is too restrictive. They want to see an end to the requirement for informed consent on the day of death. They want the law changed so a person could make an advanced request for Maid – a modification called Audrey’s Amendment, named for Audrey Parker, a Halifax woman who opted to die earlier than she planned because she worried her cognition was beginning to falter, as a result of her incurable cancer.“In cases like Leila’s and Audrey’s, and a number of other cases across the country that we know about, people are fearful that they will lose capacity and therefore they get medical assistance in dying early,” said Jim Cowan, a retired Canadian senator and board member for Dying With Dignity Canada.Since Canada’s Maid law came into effect in June 2016, more than 13,000 Canadians have chosen to die peacefully with the help of a physician or nurse practitioner. It is unknown how many more people were assessed and approved but lost capacity before the procedure was performed, said Cowan. “They continue to suffer intolerably, which is bizarre.”Last month, the Trudeau government introduced a bill to make amendments to the legislation, following a public consultation in which more than 300,000 Canadians participated. If passed, the bill would allow advanced waivers for people who are nearing the end of their lives – meaning, under certain conditions, they would not need to give final and informed consent for an assisted death on the day they died. This would achieve Audrey Parker’s dream.But the amendments would not achieve Bell’s wishes. She hoped that people with dementias would be able to write advanced directives setting out the conditions that would trigger their medically assisted death.Bell wanted to wait until she met the criteria for mid-stage Alzheimer’s.“Leila wanted to be able to set out a condition in advance, not a date,” said Townsend.A parliamentary review of Maid is scheduled to begin by June and will consider further amendments to assisted dying in Canada, including eligibility for people with conditions like dementias that could affect their decision-making capacity at some point in the future.Dr Jennifer Gibson, director of the University of Toronto Joint Centre for Bioethics, called for more discussion about advanced requests in the context of dementia, but she was happy with the direction Canada was moving.“We’re going to need the runway of some time to think about ... how we might be responsive to the interests of persons with dementia who want, like the rest of us without dementia, to be the author of the ends of their own lives,” she said.Informed consent can be difficult for someone struggling with a terminal illness. Cancers tend to follow a general trajectory – the body declines but the mind remains sharp until closer to the end. A person with cancer is an alert witness to their changing body, able to track their own degeneration and make informed decisions about their medical care until closer to the end.Their capacity can deteriorate, and quickly. A combination of disease and medication can wreak havoc with their thought patterns. This is not uncommon in the advanced stages of cancer: patients become drowsy and confused. They forget where they are and what is happening. Even if they have already been approved for Maid, they may be unable to engage with a physician on the day of their planned death to affirm, with certainty, that they understand the stakes, to say this is how and when they choose to end their life.It is different for a person with any type of dementia, including Alzheimer’s. Someone with Alzheimer’s loses their cognitive function progressively, often over years. Their ability to give informed consent can disappear long before their body nears its natural death.It’s that long period of uncertainty, of living without capacity, that Leila Bell feared.For 40 years, Bell supported the right to die with dignity. She longed for assisted dying in Canada before it was legal, as she watched some of the people closest to her die. In 1991, her second husband, Clare, to whom she’d been married for nearly 20 years, died from complications following a heart attack. Leila fell into deep depression and moved in with her best friend, who later died from diabetes. In 2002, Bell’s 49-year-old daughter, Anne, developed an unusual gastrointestinal condition and died, after being cared for by her mother.“I always felt people should have the choice of an assisted death,” Bell said. “We have our own lives to live and we have a right to live those lives in the way we want to as long as we’re not hurting anybody else.”When it was time, Bell sought out Dr Ellen Wiebe, a well-known supporter and practitioner of Maid in Vancouver. Wiebe was the first physician in Canada to perform Maid outside of Quebec. After several appointments, Wiebe told Bell that she was eligible for an assisted death but she’d have to die earlier than she would naturally. Wiebe could see Bell’s capacity deteriorating. “She was at risk within a relatively short time of losing capacity,” said Wiebe.Bell chose a date in late August. She wanted to squeeze in as much time with her family as she could before she died. In June, she flew her two grandchildren to Vancouver. She sat them down and handed them a letter she’d written, explaining her diagnosis and her decision. She wrote that she did not want them to remember her like she remembered her mother in the last stages of Alzheimer’s. They pushed back they said they didn’t see any change in her. They held her letter up as an example of her high level of functioning.Her granddaughter Erin Spence, who has one daughter and is now pregnant with a second child, told her grandmother that she wanted her children to know their great grandmother. She and her brother were not opposed to assisted dying but they could not wrap their minds around the immediacy of her decision.“We just felt like, ‘Why do you do have this now?’” said Spence. “I didn’t notice any difference in her, to be perfectly honest. I really didn’t.”But eventually, Spence and her brother “understood that she had no other choice”.Bell explains how those conversations were difficult for both parties:Bell said she never wavered after her decision, but came up with the idea of recording a video to lobby for change. She paid for the recording of the video and bequeathed it to Dying With Dignity Canada via Townsend.“Leila was extraordinary: independent, stubborn, persistent, an activist,” said Townsend. “But a good death should be available to each ordinary one of us. One shouldn’t have to be extraordinary or lucky to have a good death.”Bell organized a party with her friends four days before she died and a quiet family dinner the night before. She died on 28 August 2019, surrounded by her daughter and her daughter’s partner, Townsend and her partner, and her grandchildren and their spouses.Before she died, Bell thanked everyone in the room for surrounding her with love, “like a warm blanket”.Then, she smiled and winked, and died a few minutes later."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/87f2a5432b00575464088db881bb77a63436cf5a/0_166_4558_2735/master/4558.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=a6fd9a527429108c05f567ea50cfd564","title":"revisor review sadlers wells london gogol","story":"Sadler’s Wells, LondonChoreographer Crystal Pite and theatre-maker Jonathon Young combine their worlds for a riveting pieceActors speak, dancers move. In Revisor, choreographer Crystal Pite and theatre-maker Jonathon Young once again sync their worlds together. As with the searing Betroffenheit and wire-taut The Statement, Revisor finds Pite’s phenomenal dancers performing a kind of physical lip-syncing to scripted voiceovers by Young’s actors. The result is astonishing not for its imitation, but for its exactitude: the rhythms and intonations of speech drive every gesture, stance and step. Choreographically, it’s riveting, both for the inventive articulation of inidual bodies and for the fine-tuned dynamics of the ensemble, as responsive as conversation itself.Young’s text derives from Nikolai Gogol’s 1836 play The Government Inspector (Revizor in Russian), a tale of petty bureaucracy, mistaken identity, mixed motives and revolving doors in short, a farce. With their hunches, strides, flinches and shrugs, the dancers give the script an exaggerated, silent-film feel: broad humour in fine form. Yet there’s an undertow of unease. Body and voice (and indeed sound and lighting) may be super-synced, but they’re also uncannily dissociated.In different ways, Betroffenheit and The Statement prised open this very fissure. Revisor does, too. Just as the action seems on the point of revelation, the music turns to a throb, the stage is cleared of its set, and the performers – now in nondescript dance clothes, not character costumes – replay the first act to a voiceover that is more choreographic than dramatic: it describes moves and figures, gives stage instructions and enumerates scenes.Loosened from the ties of speech and script, the dancing is stretchier and less staccato, but instead of release, the mood is of unnameable anxiety, as in a dream. There’s no explanation, only description and allusion. A comedy costume reappears in the guise of a nightmare creature with claws. There are unnerving glitches, where the choreography sticks like a scratched record. If this act revisits the first, which is the real version and which the revised? When the farce returns, it is irredeemably laced with a disturbing duplicity.Revisor may lack the punch of Betroffenheit and the singularity of The Statement, but its handling of material is every bit as virtuoso and as with those pieces, I wanted to see it again, immediately."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9aa83d2f32b1a217a9bdce084af8ba9264d29e01/0_405_4096_2458/master/4096.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=48afd14f2253a0352e2ab0dc0bba0289","title":"do you have a question about podcasts for our critic miranda sawyer","story":"The Observer’s audio critic is here to help find your perfect podcast.

Now, even more improbably, Joe Biden – who, at 77, is the youngest man in the race for the Democratic nomination – has risen like Lazarus to win eight states on Super Tuesday and become the frontrunner.“We are very much alive!” he told rejoicing supporters in Los Angeles.It was one of the stunning reversals in recent political history. Less than a month ago Biden slunk away from New Hampshire with his tail between his legs even before the votes were counted. When he trailed in fifth, political obituaries were written. Bob Shrum, a Democratic strategist, told the : “For him to recover from this would be a political miracle unlike anything we’ve seen in modern presidential politics.”The conventional wisdom was that Super Tuesday – when a third of Democratic primary delegates (who eventually nominate the candidate at the party’s national convention in July) are decided – would not be a question of can Senator Bernie Sanders win, but how big will his lead be.But last week, everything changed. It started with James Clyburn, who is African American and became a member of the House of Representatives in 1993. Attending his accountant’s funeral, Clyburn was stopped by an older woman near the front of the church. “Young man, I want you to whisper in my ear who you are voting for,” she told him.It was the pivotal moment because it established Biden’s credibility, electability and viability for the moderate wing of the party. It was clear that he – not the billionaire former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg, the former South Bend mayor Pete Buttigieg or the Minnesota senator Amy Klobuchar – stood the best chance of defeating first Bernie Sanders, then Donald Trump in November’s election.It was time for moderates to get in line, especially after Sanders’s comments in a TV interview – acknowledging Cuba’s literacy programme, “Is that a bad thing, even if Fidel Castro did it?” – crystallised their fear of an electoral car crash. Buttigieg remarked: “I don’t want as a Democrat to be explaining why our nominee is encouraging people to look on the bright side of the Castro regime when we are going into the election of our lives.”On Monday Buttigieg and Klobuchar duly quit the race and endorsed Biden, avoiding the fatal error of Republicans who failed to unite against Donald Trump in 2016. The former presidential candidate Beto O’Rourke, the ex-senator Harry Reid and the former national security adviser Susan Rice did so too. Suddenly, Super Tuesday would pit Sanders against the centrist Avengers.“Yes, the moderates are consolidating,” said comedian Stephen Colbert. “We are reaching extreme levels of centrism.”South Carolina proved a blueprint, not an outlier, as Biden looked on course to win the most delegates on Super Tuesday. African Americans in the south, moderates and suburbanites supported him in droves. Counter-intuitively, it was his coalition that boosted turnout, whereas so far in 2020, Sanders has failed to expand his base. A massive surge in Virginia worked in Biden’s favour, a clue as to why Trump has long been wary of him.He added: “Joe Biden brings predictability and security and stability and represents a course correction. People don’t want a radical extreme. They want to wake up and feel good about the country again.”Tuesday’s results also proved Hollywood screenwriter William Goldman’s maxim that “Nobody knows anything”. Democrats have held 10 televised presidential debates, with Buttigieg, California senator Kamala Harris, Klobuchar and Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren notching wins and Biden performing terribly. But in the end, all that talking and sparring counted for nothing. There were five states where Biden did not campaign, and where Sanders and Bloomberg built big operations, yet which Biden still won.Momentum, or “Joementum” as his campaign calls it, beat money. It is, once again, a humbling reminder that most voters are not tuned into every debate or every twist and turn of Twitter. Go to any Trump rally and ask about the latest Washington scandal and you will often be met by blank stares or so-what? shrugs.But Super Tuesday has been clarifying in two other ways: one uplifting, one sad. First, money can’t buy you the presidency: Bloomberg had splashed out half a billion dollars and got hammered. Second, the glass ceiling has been reinforced and America will again not elect a female president: Elizabeth Warren could not even win her home state of Massachusetts. Both will face renewed pressure to withdraw.So what began as the biggest, most erse field history is now a two-person race that looks a lot like 2016: a moderate establishment Democrat representing a third term of Obama versus the leftwing populist Sanders. It should come as no surprise that voting patterns are broadly similar, with Sanders galvanising young people hungry for change but struggling to win over older voters in the suburbs.Hillary Clinton ran up the score on Super Tuesday in 2016 yet the primary dragged on, bitterly and isively, and she eventually lost to Trump. With Sanders taking California, Colorado and Vermont on Tuesday, there is an even greater chance of a long drawn out fight this time, possibly ending in a contested convention. And even if Biden prevails, his age and gaffes could prove a liability.The original comeback kid, Bill Clinton, was 45 at the time of his resurgence in the New Hampshire primary, a fresh face like Jimmy Carter before him and Barack Obama after him. Clinton is now 73 – which still makes him four years younger than Biden."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4422745d7063e181fde31c6ce202fb58fee752d5/0_0_4788_3192/master/4788.jpg?width=700\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=377de6b854786ad421cd3279c82a12ab 1400w","title":"super tuesday 2020 live news bernie sanders joe biden california texas primaries latest updates","story":"The self-help guru and former presidential candidate Marianne Williamson is not happy about last night’s results. Early this morning she described Joe Biden’s Super Tuesday performance as the result of “a coup”.Williamson endorsed Bernie Sanders in February, and has some advice for any fellow supporters feeling disappointed today.Bernie Sanders has pumped out a cheeky ad this morning linking himself to Barack Obama.“Bernie is somebody who has the virtue of saying exactly what he believes. Great authenticity, great passion, and is fearless,” Obama intones in the campaign advert, over video of the former president palling around with Sanders.The ad, which has some suspect audio-editing – take a look around the 24 second mark – scans rather like an endorsement from Obama... who is yet to endorse anyone in the race.Ps – this is Adam Gabbatt taking over from Paul Owen, hello!If you’re waking up in the US after a late-night tracking the Super Tuesday results, here’s a summary of probably the most consequential night of the 2020 presidential race so far.Forgive and forget doesn’t really seem to be in Trump’s vocabulary. Here’s how he greeted the news that his former attorney general Jeff Sessions failed to win back his Alabama Senate seat in one fell swoop and will instead face a run-off:You can refamiliarise yourself with the contents of the Mueller report here. One of America’s most enthusiastic political commentators has swung in with his early-morning take on the Super Tuesday results.Donald Trump continued with his attempts to make the case that the Democratic establishment is ganging up to deny Bernie Sanders the nomination – a suspicion shared by many of Sanders’ supporters.In my view Trump needs to be careful how far he goes portraying Bernie as a valiant outsider. If Sanders becomes the nominee, Trump may find he has lost his edge as the one candidate intent on smashing the system.Trump then moves more into gossip-mag territory ... Elizabeth Warren must also be considering her future, especially after coming third in her home state of Massachusetts.But her campaign was certainly putting on a brave face last night, firing out a bullish email that said: “Here’s the bottom line: There are six more primaries just one week away, and we need your help to keep up the momentum.”The email adds: “Six more states are voting a week from today on March 10. Can you chip in now as results are coming so we can get to work earning more votes and more delegates?”According to Politico, the mood in her campaign is “bleak”, however. The campaign also has financial constraints that come with a unionized staff of over 1,000 people — the largest field operation in the race besides Mike Bloomberg’s — even after raising $29 million in February. With a payroll at over $6 million per month, the campaign likely needs to keep at least several million dollars on hand to cover paychecks, benefits, and other assorted shutdown costs to avoid going into debt. Warren was able to raise a significant amount of that money with her strong debate performances, but there is not another debate until March 15.Axios has more on what Bloomberg might do today as he licks his wounds following last night’s ultra-expensive electoral flop.Look for Bloomberg to drop out as soon as this morning, and try to save face by promising to spend a helluva lot more to defeat President Trump with someone other than him.Bloomberg returned to New York after speaking in West Palm Beach last night. Sources expect him to address staff at his headquarters today.He doesn’t want history to remember him as the spoiler who helps Sanders win the nomination, or hands re-election to Trump.The billionaire businessman and former New York mayor had other pockets of success – some of them in comically friendly territory for the super-rich. Meanwhile people are still voting in California and Texas, which have been plagued by long lines and delays. In California and Texas anyone in line at the time polls close must be allowed to vote.The US has an ongoing problem with long lines on polling day – much of it linked to deliberate voter suppression.  reported yesterday that Texas leads the US south in closing down the most polling stations. Here’s more on what would probably be a nightmare for Democrats: a contested convention.This is basically when no candidate gets a majority on the first ballot, and party bigwigs (“superdelegates”) get to swing in and take part in another round of voting.Sanders’ supporters fear that even if he was ahead in the first round, the superdelegates would hand the nomination to Biden. Adam Gabbatt has the full details:We’re in the middle of the race to decide which Democrat will face Donald Trump in the US presidential election in November. Each state gets a vote, and yesterday a big group of states – including two of the largest, California and Texas – got to have their say.Bernie Sanders, the leftwing senator from Vermont, had been the favourite since his landslide victory in Nevada in February, but former vice-president Joe Biden’s win in South Carolina and the withdrawal of Biden’s fellow centrists Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar meant it suddenly became an extremely close-run thing.Sanders was hoping to fend off Biden and cement his status as indisputable frontrunner. Biden was hoping for a strong enough showing to make the case that he can pull ahead of Sanders, unite the centrist wing, and eventually win the race. Biden had a great night and has probably reclaimed his former status as frontrunner from Sanders. He won in at least nine of the 14 states up for grabs, including Texas, and he beat Elizabeth Warren, another leftwing contender, in Massachusetts, her home state. But Sanders looks to be way ahead in California. Once all the delegates are ided up – which could take days or weeks – Sanders could end up coming out of Super Tuesday with a very similar number of delegates to his centrist rival.What seems clear is that this is now a two-horse race between Sanders and Biden.No … The race goes on. There is another set of primaries next week which Sanders hopes will give him another boost. But it may be that Sanders and Biden now slug it out state by state, week after week, all the way to the Democratic convention in July. If no candidate has got a majority of delegates by the time of the convention, party bigwigs get to play a role. Most of them are terrified of Sanders winning and they are likely to give the crown to Biden – even if Sanders is ahead at that point. If that happens, Sanders’ supporters will be absolutely furious and many may refuse to vote for Biden in the general election. The former New York mayor has spent about half a billion dollars on his campaign ads so far – a record-breaking amount. But he’s worth $60bn. To put that in context, that’s the equivalent of someone whose net worth is $10 grand, say, spending $1 on the election. It’s nowhere close to breaking the bank for him. That said, there will be a great deal of pressure on him now to give way and back Biden too. He won his first two elections as mayor of New York as a Republican and he is not a fan of Sanders and his socialist platform, to put it mildly. He is apparently planning to hunker down with his advisers on Wednesday and decide what to do next. On paper Warren could have been the ideal candidate to unite the liberal and centrist wings of the party but she only really cut through in her powerful attacks on Bloomberg. She has been squeezed out by Sanders on the left, and it’s hard to escape the conclusion that sexism has also played a role. Her campaign suggested last week that she would keep fighting and hope to be handed the crown at the convention if Sanders fails to win a majority of delegates. But that may be untenable and after coming third in her home state this is probably the end of the road for her. The big question is whether she will throw her weight behind Sanders or Biden. Liberals have often fantasised about Sanders making Warren his vice-president and you’ll hear a lot about that again now. Whether he will or not I don’t know, but I’d say it’s a near-certainty that both Sanders and Biden intend to choose a female VP if they get that far. Donald Trump has shown a keen interest in the Democratic race and kept up a running commentary on Twitter. He constantly tears into Biden and Bloomberg on Twitter, but is much kinder to Sanders – stirring the pot by claiming that the Democratic establishment is rigging the race against the Vermont socialist. It seems clear that he wants Sanders to win the race and thinks he’d beat him.The primaries continue next week with contests in Michigan, Mississippi and Washington state, among other places. But this is looking like a battle between Bernie and Biden that will go down to the wire – so we may still be talking about this contest in July.Oliver Laughland has just left the Texas Democratic party headquarters in Austin after a long night, just as Joe Biden declared a major victory for his campaign there.Texas is the second largest state to vote on Super Tuesday with 228 pledged delegates at stake here.It’s worth noting that while Biden has been declared the victor this evening, it’s the margin of victory that really matters as that will determine (via a number of complicated processes) just how many delegates Biden picks up. The executive director of the Texas Democrats, Manny Garcia came to give us (and by us I mean the last three reporters left in the building) a quick briefing before he headed home. He said he expects the delegate count to be declared early Wednesday afternoon as the party waits for full results to come in from Texas’s 254 counties, all of which administer their own elections here.Garcia also spent a significant amount of time addressing the long lines at various polling stations throughout the state, an issue that could come to plague the party at the general election, where the party see a small opportunity to make this deep red state competitive. In a statement the party hailed the high turnout that characterized this primary, but argued the long lines - some of which left voters queuing past 11pm - underline the need for state electoral reform. “We need major improvements across the board: more resources to assist county and state elections officials and increased access to voting. This year will see the highest turnout in Texas history with millions of new voters casting their ballots. We cannot have these long waits happen again in November,” the statement says.This is Paul Owen taking the reins after the Super Tuesday Democratic primaries – probably the most consequential night of the 2020 presidential race so far.Joe Biden has officially been declared the winner of the Texas primary, narrowly edging out Bernie Sanders in the delegate-rich state.The AP called the race moments ago, about five hours after most of Texas’ polling places closed.Texas was considered one of the biggest prizes of the night, not just because of its 228 pledged delegates but also because of how the state’s results were expected to reflect larger dynamics in the fight for the Democratic nomination:Joe Biden declared victory in Texas, even though the AP has not yet called the state.The former vice president celebrated the Texas results in a tweet that parodied the logo of the popular burger chain Whataburger, where Biden stopped with former rival-turned-endorser Beto O’Rourke last night:Looking ahead to the next contests: six states will hold primaries next Tuesday, March 10.Idaho, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, North Dakota and Washington will head to the polls and collextively award 352 pledged delegates.It could be a good night for Bernie Sanders, considering he won Idaho, Michigan, North Dakota and Washington in 2016.But a new poll showed Sanders falling nearly 7 points behind Joe Biden in Michigan, the most delegate-rich state holding a primary next week.Bernie Sanders is also losing a key argument for his candidacy tonight: that he can increase turnout more than any of his competitors.The state of Virginia, where Joe Biden won decisively, offered a harsh reality check on Sanders’ talking point tonight.Virginia has been viewed as a crucial swing state in recent years, but it has become increasngly Democratic as the state’s DC suburbs lean more to the left.Tonight, the turnout in Virginia was nearly double that of the 2016 Democratic primary between Sanders and Hillary Clinton. The result of that increased turnout? Sanders lost to Biden by about 30 points.Joe Biden’s team pointed to his victories tonight as evidence of his popularity among Democratic voters.When asked how the former vice-president had managed to win in states he had paid almost no attention to, like Tennessee, deputy campaign manager Kate Bedingfield told CNN, “It is the power of Joe Biden. It is the fact that people know him.”On the flip side, Biden’s success tonight raises questions about the effectiveness of Mike Bloomberg’s massive advertising spending and Elizabeth Warren’s vast field organization:"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/435bc8141659837bca3a5d98a965229d2c12d9c1/0_0_1630_978/master/1630.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e7a8440822308426436c5bbe4939a10c","title":"super tuesday results primaries democratic delegates live","story":"More than a third of available delegates are up for grabs in Democratic primaries, with potential for one candidate to claim frontrunner statusThere were 52 pledged delegates up for grabs in Alabama’s Democratic presidential primary vote, where the opioid crisis, healthcare and government corruption rank among the top voting issues.

But will it help arrest population decline? Nationalised IVF clinics, generous loans for couples who promise to procreate imminently and lifetime income tax exemption for having four or more children. Welcome to Viktor Orbán’s drive to get Hungarian women to breed: “family-friendly Hungary”, in the words of the giant banners that now greet arrivals at Budapest airport.Across Europe, as falling birthrates lead to projections of shrinking populations, policymakers are pondering a question: can we pay people to have more children?Countries with rightwing populist governments have taken the lead in answering with a resounding yes, as boosting fertility dovetails with their anti-migration and “family values” talking points. Nowhere is the campaign to get women to have more children more intense than in Orbán’s Hungary. The country’s fertility rate – the average number of children per woman – reached an all-time low of 1.23 in 2011 and remains well below the level of 2.1 that is required for population levels to remain constant.It follows neatly on from the government’s relentless anti-migration message of the past five years. “In all of Europe there are fewer and fewer children, and the answer of the west to this is migration,” said Orbán in his annual state of the nation address last year. “They want as many migrants to enter as there are missing kids, so that the numbers will add up. We Hungarians have a different way of thinking. Instead of just numbers, we want Hungarian children. Migration for us is surrender.”Newly nationalised IVF clinics will offer free treatment cycles for all women who want them (as long as they are under 40 and not lesbian), and Orbán recently promised to extend the lifetime exemption from income tax to include mothers with three children.Most strikingly of all, various loans offer money upfront, based on a future promise to have children. One of these loans provides 10 million forint (£25,400) to young married couples. Each time a child is born, payments are deferred. If the couple have three children within the requisite timeframe, the loan is written off. If they don’t, they have to pay it back.Bettina, a 32-year-old teaching assistant from the village of Mágocs, in southern Hungary, is planning to take out the “baby-expecting loan” in March. She and her husband, a policeman, already have one child and are planning another. “The loan is brilliant. If it wasn’t for this help then we would have to live with one of our parents, or in terrible conditions,” she said.The couple already have a 1.4 million forint loan, taken out soon after their marriage and contingent on having two children within a six-year timeframe. “We are trying hard for another baby now but as the term approaches it does increase the pressure,” she admitted.This is Europe is a new stream of  journalism that investigates the big challenges that transcend national boundaries, and seeks out the solutions that could benefit us all. These are testing times, and crises are not limited by national borders. But then neither are we. The kindergarten caters for four villages, including neighbouring Alsómocsolád, which during the communist period had its own kindergarten and school. It has long closed, and now there is just an old-people’s home. “Every year at Christmas we give the kids presents and it’s noticeable that the number now is so much less than it was in the nineties,” said László Dicső, the long-standing mayor of Alsómocsolád. In the countryside, the lack of young children is even more starkly felt, as the lower fertility rates are amplified by the migration of people to the cities and abroad.Across Europe, governments have introduced benefits aimed at stimulating population growth. In Poland, the ruling Law and Justice party introduced the 500+ policy in 2016, under which mothers received 500 złoty (£99) per child per month from the second child onwards. Last year it was expanded to include all children.In Russia, a one-off payment of £5,800 to families with two or more children was launched in 2007. In January, Vladimir Putin announced a new package of demographic measures that will cost 400bn roubles (£4.7bn) per year. “Russia’s fate and its historic prospects depend on how many of us there are … it depends on how many children are born in Russian families,” said Putin when announcing the policy. Italy and Greece have also introduced “baby bonuses” for each child.In the western half of Europe, fertility rates dropped gradually over several decades as more women entered the workforce and began to postpone having children. In the post-communist states, the change happened differently. There was a sudden drop in fertility after the collapse of communism, brought on not by the social changes but by economic misery and social collapse. At a time when the future was uncertain, childbearing was postponed and birthrates fell precipitously.Over the next years, as the economies of the post-communist states recovered and grew, the same dynamics that had gradually changed the rates over many years in western Europe kicked in, meaning the rates did not recover.“There has been a change in mentality, maybe it’s a western influence. The young generation that is now 30, they have gone to university and want to start having children much later. This means they will have fewer children,” said Simonics.In central and eastern Europe, the falling birthrates have been exacerbated by large numbers of people moving westward in search of work, combined with minimal inward migration . In Hungary and other populist-led countries, the shrinking populations have been painted in apocalyptic terms of national survival.A set of global population projections released by the UN in 2017 did little to allay fears. The study projected that the combined population of 10 eastern European countries would fall from 292 million then to 218 million in 2100, while during the same period the population of west Africa would grow from 372 million to 1.6 billion.“Europe has become the continent of the empty crib whereas in Asia and Africa they face demographic challenges of the opposite type,” Katalin Novák, Hungary’s minister of state for family, youth and international affairs, said at a conference on demography last year organised by the Hungarian government.The conference in Budapest opened with a sand animation video of migrants rushing towards Europe, and was laced with references to the “great replacement” conspiracy theory, which suggests that shadowy forces want to replace so-called “native” Europeans with outsiders. “There are political forces in Europe who want a replacement of population for ideological or other reasons,” Orbán told the conference.Ágoston Mráz, who heads a pro-government thinktank in Budapest, said the pro-children policy was a response to a longstanding conservative fear of national extinction, as well as an ideological statement. “It’s anti-liberal, it’s a sign that we are not a multi-coloured country, we believe that while everyone is free to do what they want, there is a hierarchy, and a family made up of a husband and a wife is at the top,” he said.This focus on “traditional families” has become a cornerstone of the Orbán government. Rightwingers from across the world have travelled to Hungary to discuss and praise the country’s family policy. “Hungarian family policy is worthy of close study,” Tim Montgomerie, a former adviser to Boris Johnson, wrote on Twitter in December.The social conservatism underlying such policies is evidenced by the fact that much of the support is available only to married couples. Non-married heterosexual couples and single women are also eligible for free IVF treatment, but not lesbians, meaning one half of a lesbian couple must pretend to be single and heterosexual if they wish to qualify.In Poland, too, government messaging gives a populist twist to the 500+ policy. “In Germany, billions of euros are spent on support for immigrants, but here these billions of złotys are spent on Polish families,” said the prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki. “This is a revolutionary socio-demographic project, and we are proud of it.”Yet despite all the investment, the jury is still out on whether these policies work. In Hungary, the fertility rate has risen from 1.23 to 1.48, though it is hard to gauge how much of that is down to specific policies. In Poland, a brief spike in births after the introduction of the 500+ policy was not sustained. “You don’t expect a breakthrough in two or three years, it’s going to take at least 10,” said Zoltán Kovács, Orbán’s spokesman.The formula for raising birthrates is a slippery thing, with shelves of academic literature and statistical case studies devoted to the debate. Studies show that poorer families tend to have more children than richer families in any case, meaning that boosting birthrates is about more than financial security.“We regret we don’t have good birth rate, but that only comes if we improve our economic life,” Zoran Zaev, North Macedonia’s prime minister until earlier this year, told the  in a recent interview. His social democratic government cut family support policies for larger families that had been introduced by the previous rightwing nationalist government.“There are good birthrates in countries where there is good social care and well-developed economies. These policies change nothing, it just means we spent a lot of money and told our citizens not to work and wait for money,” he added.Anne Gauthier, a professor of comparative family studies at the University of Groningen, said boosting fertility with government spending “can work under very specific circumstances”. She said the key was continuity of policies over many years, giving people the confidence that the support measures are here to stay. She pointed to France, which despite a recent drop still has one of the highest fertility rates in the EU, as a country that has had a generous and sustainable model.Gauthier praised the Hungarian model for offering a package of different measures rather than simply handing out cash. But it’s very difficult to isolate specific reasons for changes in fertility, and researchers still don’t know what effect particular family policies have on the birthrates.“In Scandinavia we thought they got it right, there was a very comprehensive package, focused on gender equality, that ticks all the boxes, and in the past year fertility is going down. So we are scratching our heads and trying to work out what’s going on,” she said.There is a question of whether more targeted spending would be a better use of government resources. The Polish 500+ policy is not means-tested, nor are most of the Hungarian benefits. Indeed, some of the bigger loans actually benefit wealthier families, as they require proof of employment and minimum income levels.The other problem with these policies is that a focus on numbers, with bonuses for each birth, can put statistics ahead of emotions. The upfront payments in the Hungarian system are of particular concern, putting pressure on women to have children they may no longer want. Couples who take out the loan and then get orced have to pay back the whole amount within 120 days. Couples who find out they are infertile are also obliged to repay.“It increases dependencies, and if you’re in a bad or abusive relationship you are even less free to leave it if you’re bound together by these loans,” said Dorottya Szikra, of the Centre for Social Sciences in Budapest.Daniel Szalay, from Budapest, recounted how he and his wife had applied for the “baby-expecting” loan last July, when she was already more than seven months pregnant. She then had a miscarriage. The bank told the couple that as there was no child, they would not get the benefits, even though the law stipulates they should. “It’s so frustrating. After this trauma we suffered, the last thing we expected is to have to go through a never-ending process to prove something with which we have already complied,” he said.For governments who claim national survival is at stake, these inidual traumas are a small price to pay for a potential boost in the birthrate. Funding fertility programmes allows populist governments to tick many boxes: to show they are taking care of families financially, reinforce their focus on “traditional values” and accentuate fears of replacement by migration from abroad if the “native” population continues to shrink.“A good state is where the people are not scared of the future and where the population is rising not due to migration from foreign countries,” said the Czech prime minister, Andrej Babiš, speaking at Orbán’s migration conference. “I don’t wish to scare anyone but we must discuss the issue that we are facing extinction.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0b36abb7f3927ca4f50a4ce0b64f6e705862ea08/0_132_5249_3149/master/5249.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=173bb02a6c39b9c16f92181d887abb7b","title":"climate action the latest target of europes fossil fuel lobbyists","story":"Fossil fuel firms are making good use of the many revolving doors available to them in BrusselsPicture the scene: a dinner for MEPs organised by leading fossil fuel firms to explain the lengths to which their industries have gone to combat climate emergency. On the guest list, the environment minister of Croatia, current holders of the EU’s rotating presidency, and Guido Bortoni, an adviser in the European commission’s energy directorate. Nobody at all from civil society or the NGO sector. In other words a perfect Brussels lobbying event.Billed as “Oil and Gas and the Green Deal” this dinner took place on 17 February, just a fortnight before the unveiling of the EU’s first ever climate law. The meal was sponsored by the International Association of Oil and Gas Producers (IOGP), which represents 29 of Europe’s main fossil fuel operators, including Total, Shell, BP and ExxonMobil.According to the EU transparency register the IOGP spent €350,160 in 2018 lobbying in Brussels, so it can afford to take a few MEPs out to dinner. The European Energy Forum (EEF) is the perfect organiser: it is headed by Jerzy Buzek, an MEP for the European People’s party (EPP), a former prime minister of Poland, a former president of the European parliament and currently chair of its industry research and energy committee. The forum boasts 82 associate members, firms that pay “at least” €7,000 a year in membership fees. Predictably they are all in the oil and gas sector.The EEF politely turned down a media request to attend an earlier gathering on 26 November entitled “Gas: Driving the Energy Transition”. “We do not accept journalists at our events,” was the response. The event was sponsored by Eurogas, the gas industry’s main lobbying organisation, and two German firms, Uniper and Wintershall. An official from the European commissions DG Energy also attended.The European Green Deal, the commission’s €1tn plan to prepare the European economy for confronting the climate crisis, has prompted a round of intensive lobbying activity. “Since 2010, the five main oil and gas corporations and their fossil fuel lobby groups have spent at least a quarter of a billion euros buying influence at the heart of European decision-making,” claims a report produced by a coalition of climate NGOs (Corporate Europe Observatory, Food \u0026amp Water Europe, Friends of the Earth Europe and Greenpeace).Such firms, their business founded on extracting fossil fuels, have an interest in delaying or undermining policies designed to mitigate the effects of the climate crisis. They make much use of Brussels-based thinktanks such as the Centre for European Policy Studies (CEPS). A week before the newly sworn-in commission presented its climate policies, CEPS hosted on 4 December, a “by invitation-only” event on the Green Deal funded by Equinor and Fortum, the energy market leaders in Norway and Finland, respectively. Firms are welcome to join CEPS as corporate members. ExxonMobil, for example, pays €15,000 a year for this access. The thinktank has organised members-only breakfast meetings with guests such as Frans Timmermans, now EU commissioner in charge of the Green Deal. Members of commission president Ursula von der Leyen’s team have been the focus of relentless attention from energy industry and particularly gas lobbyists for months. In the last 10 days of January alone, Eurogas representatives met six commissioners and officials from departments for the environment, trade, budget, agriculture and economic affairs. Each time the declared business of the meeting was the Green Deal.The energy commissioner, Kadri Simson, will be the keynote speaker at this year’s Eurogas conference on 19 March in Brussels. Six members of the association’s staff are accredited for access to EU parliament buildings. Eurogas spent €800,000 on lobbying in 2018 alone. “DG Energy is very permeable to the gas lobby,” says Pascal Canfin, a Renew Europe MEP and chair of the parliament’s environment committee.The IOGP has been busy too. On 17 December it met Ditte Juul Jorgensen, the head of DG Energy, then in January two other European commission members, in different directorates. The topic was of course the Green Deal.Similarly employers’ group Business Europe has shown great interest in the commission’s new plans for the environment. Speakers at the federation’s annual gathering on 4 March – the day the EU’s new climate law is being unveiled – include Von der Leyen in person, two of her vice-presidents and three commissioners.Another means of influencing European policymakers is to use lobbying firms. FTI Consulting is one of the most effective. Transparency International ranked it second for setting up meetings with the EU executive in 2018.With 38 staff members accredited for access to the European parliament FTI billed Eurogas, then a new customer, between €25,000 and €50,000 in 2018. Earnings from ExxonMobil, its second largest account totalled €600,000 to €700,000. The same year it carried out confidential research for Gas Infrastructure Europe. Measures for a Sustainable Gas Storage Market, the resulting study, was subsequently posted and is still on the European commission’s website. The firm has made good use of the many revolving doors available in Brussels. In 2016-18, for instance, Philip Lowe, after heading DG Energy (2010-14), was a senior adviser to FTI on public affairs.Jean-Arnold Vinois is another example of the revolving doors in operation. He is an energy policy adviser at the Jacques Delors Institute, a well known thinktank, but also an honorary director for energy at the commission and a consultant at FleishmanHillard, another big lobbying outfit in Brussels. This firm counts the European Chemical Industry Council (Cefic) – earning it almost €1m in 2018 – the gas lobby Gas Naturally (€25,000 to €50,000) and Fuels Europe, another oil and gas federation, among its customers.Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is the gas industry’s latest hobby-horse, seen as a means of justifying its fossil fuel activities. The snag is that CCS technology is far from being ready for widespread use and even if research succeeds in perfecting the techniques, a drastic reduction in emissions will still be needed over the next 20 years. The gas industry nevertheless persists in promoting it as a solution. Eurogas is working hand-in-hand with the Global CCS Institute, the key lobby in this field. On 18 February, in partnership with the United Kingdom Mission to the EU, it held a conference on the topic in Brussels. It is particularly difficult to pin down the role of EU governments in advancing the interests of their firms. There is no equivalent to the EU transparency register to keep track of the national governments or their missions.Industry is by no means alone in attempting to influence EU lawmakers on climate issues. Powerful environmental thinktanks and NGOs – such as the World Wildlife Fund (WWF), Transport \u0026amp Environment, the Climate Action Network or the European Climate Foundation (ECF) – are hard at work too. Their financial means are substantial but less than their opponents. In 2018 the ECF reported expenditure of between €500,000 and €600,000, while WWF spent €2.2m to €2.4m over the same period.Aude Massiot writes for Liberation on environment issues.

Now I think we are on the borderline between containing and delaying. But many of the things you do to contain it also delay it.”Whitty was pressed on whether the coronavirus was spreading freely in the UK, with patients contracting the virus from unidentified sources.The World Health Organization is recommending that people take simple precautions to reduce exposure to and transmission of the Wuhan coronavirus, for which there is no specific cure or vaccine.Despite a surge in sales of face masks in the aftermath of the coronavirus outbreak, experts are ided over whether they can prevent transmission and infection. There is some evidence to suggest that masks can help prevent hand-to-mouth transmissions, given the large number of times people touch their faces. The consensus appears to be that wearing a mask can limit – but not eliminate – the risks, provided it is used correctly.He said: “If someone has imported a case and they are isolated, that isn’t community transmission. Even if someone gets it who we know about having the disease and it happens to be passed on in the UK, that also isn’t. It’s when it’s going from person to person to person and we pick it up. That’s what we mean by community transmission. It is likely that will happen if not now then very soon … I think it is likely to be happening at the moment, not definite.”Whitty gave his assessment as the government designated the coronavirus a notifiable disease, which means some companies will be able to seek insurance compensation for cancellations.The move brings England into line with Scotland, Northern Ireland and Ireland, which have already added the coronavirus to their lists of notifiable diseases.A spokesman for the Department of Health and Social Care said: “To mitigate the impact on businesses, we will register Covid-19 as a notifiable disease. This will help companies seek compensation through their insurance policies in the event of any cancellations they may have to make as a result of the spread of the virus.”Mark Carney, the Bank of England governor, has also suggested that small firms could get cash boosts to help stay afloat.The government released its coronavirus action plan on Tuesday, showing that sweeping new measures may be necessary if an epidemic occurs. revealed that police investigations into some homicides could be halted and 999 response times extended under contingency plans to help forces cope with a severe coronavirus outbreak.Schools may be closed, public events cancelled and some doctors called in out of retirement, the government also said.As the number of confirmed UK cases reached 51, officials said the worst-case scenario was that up to a fifth of the workforce could be off sick during the peak of a potential epidemic.On Tuesday evening, tests on thousands of patients in hospital intensive care units were ordered by NHS England amid concerns about the possible spread of the virus among people with respiratory problems.Twelve more people across England tested positive for coronavirus – the second-highest single-day increase in cases to date – with all thought to have contracted it abroad. Eight had recently travelled from Italy, while the others came from Germany, Singapore, Japan and Iran."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c25b612abc6bbf754fcb1701447d189361dc8e15/0_357_5351_3210/master/5351.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=918185ad1088d74f2a0794faf1104652","title":"coronavirus office closures expert guide work from home","story":"Companies including Google, Twitter and Sony are sending workers home. Here’s how to stay happy, healthy and productive – even if you’re still in your pyjamasAs coronavirus spreads around the world, more companies are urging their employees to work from home. Sony closed offices in London, Paris and Gdynia, Poland, on Wednesday. Twitter announced this week that it was “strongly encouraging” its 5,000 global workforce not to come into the office. Google’s European headquarters in Dublin are empty as its staff of 8,000 work from home to avoid spreading the virus.But how best to work from home if you’ve never done it before? The experts weigh in.“Engage with the possibility that you might need to work from home now, rather than on day one of having to do it,” suggests Matthew Knight of Leapers, a community that supports the mental health of freelancers and the self-employed. “Make sure you have all the technology you’ll need set up already, so you’re set to go from day one.”If you aren’t in quarantine, try not to spend all day cooped up indoors. “Get out of the house at least once a day,” advises Anna Codrea-Rado, the founder of the Professional Freelancer, a newsletter and community for self-employed workers, and co-host of the Is This Working? podcast. “Even if it’s just going to the shops. You’ll get cabin fever otherwise.”Make sure you are taking proper breaks. “One of the joys of working from home is that you can cook a proper meal,” says Codrea-Rado. If you’re worried that people will think you’re slacking, tell your co-workers that you’re logging off for lunch, to avoid being disturbed.Codrea-Rado encourages you to not work from your sofa, or worse still, your bed. “Have a dedicated place to work, even if it’s just the end of your kitchen table,” she says. “It helps you get in the mind frame of work. If you don’t, it muddies the boundaries between home life and work life – working from your sofa all day and then sitting there watching TV doesn’t feel as relaxing.”But don’t feel you need to put on a suit. “People say don’t work in your pyjamas,” she adds. “But I really disagree with that. The beauty of working from home is that you don’t have to think about the optics of how you’re working, you just have to focus on getting your work done.”Many of the people working from home due to coronavirus will usually work from offices. To make the transition as smooth as possible, Corea-Rado advises managers to establish ground rules. “Set the tone for how the team is going to work from home,” she says. “Schedule regular one-to-one check-ins and explain how and when you’d like people to report back to you.”Although it is tempting to just send an email, Knight advises making the effort to call co-workers or employees whenever you can, particularly if you are a manager, to check in on their mental wellbeing. “Ask them how they are doing and really listen to the answer,” he says.If you’re feeling low, let people know. “Don’t just suffer in silence,” he says. “Let your manager or co-workers know how you’re feeling. Nine times out of 10, sharing how you’re feeling with people really helps.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4b7aeb9ca19b532ea5577ab4ee5b384139663ecc/0_0_4096_2458/master/4096.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7f619a0272a57069f3d429bab48be0db","title":"lesbian priests to lead church service on eve of anglican summit","story":"Service is intended to send strong message to once-a-decade Lambeth conferenceLGBT+ campaigners will hold a church service led by two high-profile married lesbian priests on the eve of the Lambeth conference, a once-a-decade assembly of Anglican bishops from around the world that is expected to be dominated by conflicts over sexuality and marriage.The move is likely to rile conservative bishops who maintain that homosexuality is a sin.An “inclusive” eucharist at a church in Canterbury will be presided over by the Rt Rev Mary Glasspool, the assistant bishop in New York. The preacher will be the Rev Canon Mpho Tutu van Furth, a daughter of Desmond Tutu, the veteran South African anti-apartheid campaigner.The service is intended to send a strong message to up to 1,000 bishops from 165 countries who are due to gather at the University of Kent at the end of July for almost two weeks of prayer and discussion about issues facing the worldwide Anglican church.The split over sexuality – between those who seek to uphold “biblical truth” and those who are pressing for acceptance and inclusivity – dominated the last Lambeth conference, in 2008, leading Rowan Williams, then archbishop of Canterbury, to warn that the church was in “grave peril”.Tutu van Furth, who stepped aside as an Anglican priest in South Africa following her same-sex marriage and now lives in the Netherlands, told the  that her message at the eucharist would be one of a “Christian welcome and hospitality”. She said: “Jesus was always determined to make those who society sees as outsiders be insiders.”She said the church was slowly changing but she wanted to challenge “those in high places: look at what you’re doing.”Glasspool, the first married lesbian bishop in the global Anglican church, said the inclusive service would carry an important message. “The LGBT+ community in the UK and other places might not understand that they are invited to celebrate at the Christian table. We need to make it known that everyone is included – all are invited to this particular celebration.”She said Justin Welby, Williams’ successor as archbishop of Canterbury and leader of the Anglican church, had “gone out of his way to uninvite inidual persons in a breach of hospitality”.Bishops’ spouses have traditionally been guests at the Lambeth conference, but it was deemed “inappropriate” to invite same-sex spouses to this year’s event. Glasspool received a letter from Welby in December 2018 informing her of his decision “not to invite your spouse to the Lambeth conference, a decision that I am well aware will cause you pain, which I regret deeply.”The letter came as a shock, Glasspool said. “It was unnecessary, it was creating an issue where one didn’t exist.” She suspects the move was intended to “appease” conservative Anglicans in the US.The primates of Nigeria, Rwanda and Uganda, who are known to have staunchly conservative views on sexuality, have said they will not attend the Lambeth conference. So far 673 bishops and 521 spouses have registered.The poll highlighted a generational difference, with more than two-thirds of Anglicans under the age of 50 backing same-sex marriage. Paul Bayes, the bishop of Liverpool, said the results “provide a challenge to us in leadership within the Church of England to ensure that we understand the views of the people we serve”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e7b41325eec83e6cf96aa3fd92c73d11b7c2e417/7_0_1982_1190/master/1982.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=75b9545ee2099b1c80a5890b58d9a21f","title":"the best thing about wellington mittens the cat has paws all over new zealand capital","story":"Turkish Angora roams tattoo parlours, office towers and churches, posing for social media snapshots along the wayA feline that roams New Zealand’s capital city and is welcomed into tattoo parlours, hairdressers and office towers has become a social media star, with 30,000 followers who track his every movement online.Mittens first came to attention in 2018 after repeatedly wandering inner-city dwellings, including the university, the post office, and a Catholic church. Mittens was also reportedly taken to the police station by concerned locals.After repeated encounters with Mittens, an SPCA employee started a Facebook page to reassure locals that the cat wasn’t lost and didn’t need to be “rescued” – he was just adventurous.The Facebook page now has 30,000 followers with locals tracking Mittens’ daily activities around town.The page, The Wondrous Adventures of Mittens, also lists a series of rules for interacting with him, including “do not tell Mittens to go home”, “no speculating or asking where Mittens is”, and “no discussing Mittens being picked up”.Mittens also has a Wikipedia page, where his occupation is listed as petlocal celebritymedia personality.A selfie with Mittens has become a bucket-list item for many Wellingtonians. Owner Silvio Bruinsma says Mittens had similar venturesome habits when they lived together in Auckland but Wellington’s compact inner city has now made him much easier to track.Mittens’ brother Latte, also a Turkish angora, does not share the intrepid streak and rarely ventures more than 20m from home, while Mittens can roam up to 2km.“He has made Wellington his playground,” Bruinsma told the Dominion Post.“I suppose my philosophy is, he doesn’t like being locked up and I don’t want to give him a life that is miserable.”Although there was some initial concern for Mittens’ apparently aimless wanderings (no one feeds him but Bruinsma), locals and visitors now actively go looking for the cat and say he shows caution around roads – reportedly even stopping to wait at traffic lights.In one close encounter, detailed in February on the Facebook page, Mittens got stuck in a $2 shop after falling asleep. A combined effort by Facebook members led to him being tracked to his last known location and the owners of the store were contacted to let him out after hours.Sam Thacker, one of the administrators of the Facebook group and a staff member at the SPCA, has known Mittens for years and describes him as “street smart”.“Please don’t pick him up and bring him into the SPCA,” Thacker posted.“He has come in too many times with well meaning people. All this means is that his owner has to come and collect him off us! We have had him in with us recently and he is perfectly healthy.”According to pictures posted online in the last week, Mittens has visited a real estate agent, a Latino salsa bar, a community law centre and Victoria university."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/957c38b0b846e66415c44f181fc141f3db965fb9/620_1187_2581_1548/master/2581.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=024192f60fc10ee63e9e9966135f4573","title":"what is coronavirus symptoms infection wuhan china covid 19","story":"What are the symptoms caused by the virus from Wuhan in China, how does it spread, and should you call a doctor?It is caused by a member of the coronavirus family that has never been encountered before. Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. Many of those initially infected either worked or frequently shopped in the Huanan seafood wholesale market in the centre of the Chinese city.The virus can cause pneumonia. Those who have fallen ill are reported to suffer coughs, fever and breathing difficulties. In severe cases there can be organ failure. As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system. Many of those who have died were already in poor health.In the UK, the medical advice is that if you have recently travelled from areas affected by coronavirus, you should:More NHS advice on what to do if you think you have been exposed to the virus can be found here, and the full travel advice to UK nationals is available here.China’s national health commission has confirmed human-to-human transmission, and there have been such transmissions elsewhere.As of 4 March, the global death toll is 3,190, while more than 93,000 people have been infected in more than 80 countries. In China there have been 2,981 deaths, and there are 80,270 cases in all. South Korea, the nation worst hit by the outbreak outside China, has had 5,328 cases. More than 44,000 people in China have recovered from Covid-19.There have been 51 recorded cases and no fatalities to date in the UK. There have been 41 cases of the virus in Australia.Another key unknown is how contagious the coronavirus is. A crucial difference is that unlike flu, there is no vaccine for the new coronavirus, which means it is more difficult for vulnerable members of the population – elderly people or those with existing respiratory or immune problems – to protect themselves. Hand-washing and avoiding other people if you feel unwell are important. One sensible step is to get the flu vaccine, which will reduce the burden on health services if the outbreak turns into a wider epidemic.No. A pandemic, in WHO terms, is “the worldwide spread of a disease”. The spread of the virus outside China is worrying but not an unexpected development. The WHO has declared the outbreak to be a public health emergency of international concern. The key issues are how transmissible this new coronavirus is between people, and what proportion become severely ill and end up in hospital. Often viruses that spread easily tend to have a milder impact. Generally, the coronavirus appears to be hitting older people hardest, with few cases in children."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/745359f1446afb7ff4ee446366c741c0065267ff/0_167_4020_2412/master/4020.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=389b88573ce584f337f87773f2904ec9","title":"women work for free for two months a year says tuc analysis","story":"Women work an average of 63 unpaid days because of the gender pay gap, according to figuresWomen work for free for two months a year as a result of the gender pay gap, according to analysis by the TUC. The trade union federation marked Wednesday as the first day of the year that the average woman effectively begins to get paid.“Our economy is stacked against working women. At this rate, it will take another 50 years to close the gender pay gap,” said the TUC general secretary, Frances O’Grady. “No more excuses: the government must get on and sort the gender pay gap now.”In professional, scientific and technical jobs, the average woman waits 88 days with her women’s pay day coming on 28 March 2020.The widest gender pay gap is in finance and insurance. Female employees wait for more than a third of the year before pay kicks in on 3 May 2020.The analysis also showed significant regional gender pay differences, linked to the concentration of industries in different regions.Companies with more than 250 employees have been forced to publish their gender pay gap since changes to the Equality Act came into force on 6 April 2017. Previous filings have revealed that almost eight out of 10 British companies pay men more than women.Critics have also warned that inaccurate figures and a lack of sanctions risk making a mockery of the gender pay gap reporting system.  analysis of submissions revealed that mathematically impossible gender pay gap data filed by companies in 2018 had remained uncorrected while the Equality and Human Rights Commission admitted that no companies had been fined for failing to comply with legislation.The TUC has argued that the government should force companies to carry out equal pay audits, produce action plans to close the pay gap in their workplace, and fine companies that fail to comply with the law instantly.“Just publishing gender pay gaps isn’t enough. Companies must be required to explain what steps they’ll take to close their gender pay gaps – and bosses who don’t comply with the law should be fined,” said O’Grady.She said employers should do more to help women balance family responsibilities and work and called for flexible working to be a right for everyone at work from day one.Ahead of the TUC’s annual women’s conference in London, which begins today, she added: “Every year unions help thousands of women get the pay they deserve. And workplaces that recognise unions are more likely to have family-friendly policies and fair pay. That’s why every woman should be in a union.”A Government Equalities Office spokesperson said: “We want to see everyone given the same opportunities at work. This means we want to see employers encouraging shared parental leave, flexible working and other measures which put people in the best place to succeed.”"},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus map cases how covid 19 is spreading","story":"Confirmed cases of Covid-19 now  79 countries, with more than 3,100 deaths, all but 215 in mainland China – data correct at 23:59pm, 3 MarchThe coronavirus outbreak began in Wuhan, a city of more than 11 million people and the capital of Hubei province in China.The vast majority of infections are being reported in mainland China but cases have now been confirmed in 79 countries, including 51 cases in the UK.The number of confirmed cases has risen rapidly since the respiratory virus emerged in December.

Photograph: Tony GentileReuters. Former Italian prime minister Romano Prodi has been given the all-clear to participate in a public conference at Trinity College Dublin after travelling from a coronavirus-hit region of Italy.Mr Prodi arrived hours before Irish people were cautioned against non-essential travel to parts of Italy to prevent the spread of Covid-19 from Europe’s hardest-hit country.The former president of the European Commission is due to speak at a conference entitled Europe and the Future, which is hosted by the university’s debating society, the College Historical Society, and the Institute of International and European Affairs (IIEA).Organisers assessed whether Mr Prodi’s attendance at the event, which is expected to draw a large attendance, should proceed in light of the travel advisory from Department of Foreign Affairs regarding four regions in Italy.After consulting with Trinity College, the IIEA said it had taken the university’s guidance on the matter and that the event would be proceeding as planned with Mr Prodi speaking.“Trinity College is sticking to Government guidelines. At present, those guidelines do not include any restrictions on Italians travelling to Ireland or moving around the country. For this reason, they have advised there will be no restrictions in place at Trinity today,” said a spokesman for the IIEA.The event is taking place as part of a week-long commemoration marking the 250th anniversary of “the Hist” and was open to members of the public who registered online to attend.Mr Prodi travelled into Dublin on Tuesday afternoon from Bologna, the capital of the Emilia-Romagna area, via Munich in Germany, according to a spokesman for the IIEA.The two cases of coronavirus identified in the Republic of Ireland so far have been iniduals who have returned to the country after travelling to Italy.The Department of Foreign Affairs on Tuesday night advised the Irish public against non-essential travel to the Emilia-Romagna and three other regions in northern Italy badly affected by the virus after the second case was confirmed.“We have been closely monitoring the advice of the HSE and Trinity College’s dedicated coronavirus unit and we have been in continual consultation with the Italian embassy in Dublin,” said the IIEA spokesman.“Following all advice available to use, and in consultation with the Hist and Trinity’s chief medical officer, we decided to continue with the event as foreseen.”Mr Prodi is one of a panel of speakers at the event where Taoiseach Leo Varadkar will deliver the opening address. Other speakers include former European Commission president Herman Van Rompuy, former EU secretary-general Catherine Day, former EU ambassador to the US David O’Sullivan and Tony Barber, Europe Editor of The Financial Times.Another former European Commission president José Manuel Barroso was due to speak but he cancelled his appearance due to travel advice relating to the coronavirus.Italy, the European country worst affected by the outbreak, is struggling to contain the spread of the illness with the death toll rising to 79 and the total number of cases reaching 2,502 on Monday.The country’s health authorities are considering setting up a new quarantine red zone to try to contain the virus that is spreading from the wealthy northern regions of Lombardy, Veneto and Emilia-Romagna to the south.Stay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4192427.1583330586!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"dublin bus corridors 2 449 trees would go under latest plans","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tYellow ribbons on trees lining St Mobhi road on Dublin’s northside, protesting the Bus Connects proposal, last year. Photograph: Dave MeehanAlmost 2,500 trees are to be felled to cater for proposed bus corridors in Dublin under the latest BusConnects plans. The plans would see 776 properties lose part of their front gardens and 2,449 trees removed. The original proposals, published in late 2018 and early last year, said 1,400 properties and between 1,500 and 1,600 trees would be impacted. However, the National Transport Authority (NTA) has said the overall number of trees impacted by the revised proposals is “significantly less than the original plans, particularly in relation to larger, mature trees”. “The original brochures recorded the number of roadside trees impacted as full mapping surveys hadn’t been completed at that stage. That number was approximately 1,500,” an NTA spokeswoman said. “Mapping surveys have now been largely completed, and the total number of trees, both roadside trees and off-road trees, impacted by the revised proposals is approximately 2,500 trees. Most of the off-road trees are smaller, more recently planted trees. The replanting scheme will see more trees replanted than the number removed.”The highest number of trees affected are on the Lucan-to-city-centre corridor (509), followed by the Bray-to-city-centre corridor (390) and the Blanchardstown-to-city-centre corridor (368). The Greenhills-to-city-centre route would see the largest number of properties affected (120) followed by Clongriffin to city centre (118). The NTA said the revised proposals were aimed at minimising the impact on properties and trees and include new one-way systems, the introduction of signal controlled priority and bus gates. Around13,000 submissions were received during the last round of public consultation on the bus corridor project, with the largest number (2,760) of those were in relation to the Rathfarnam-to-city-centre corridor. Public consultation on the revised bus corridor proposals runs until April 17th. A series of information events will be hosted by the NTA during March. The NTA said in parallel with public consultation, “work is ongoing on developing the technical, environmental, and transport impact assessment reports necessary for submission of a planning application for each corridor to An Bord Pleanála”. BusConnects aims to overhaul the bus system in the Dublin region by creating 230km of dedicated bus lanes and 200km of cycle tracks along 16 of the busiest corridors and a redesign of the network. The NTA said the plans would result in journey time savings of up to 40 to 50 per cent on the corridors. The final network plan is due to be published this summer, and work will start in early 2021 over a phased three-year period.

File photograph: Dara Mac DónaillThe EU and UK could agree a “device” to extend the transition period if talks fail to secure a trade deal by the July 1st deadline, a former European Commission secretary-general has said.David O’Sullivan, an Irish former EU director-general in charge of trade who brokered the bloc’s trade with South Korea, said the UK government could drop its objection to the extension of the transition period from the end of the year if it could be sold politically at home. This could then “buy” both sides “more time to continue the discussions” to resolve issues where agreement has not agreed and avoid another potential “cliff-edge” no-deal scenario on December 31st, Mr O’Sullivan told The .British prime minister Boris Johnson has threatened to walk away from Brexit trade talks if negotiations have failed to make progress by June and to focus instead on preparations for the UK’s hard exit from EU economic rules on World Trade Organization terms at the end of the year. Under the Brexit withdrawal agreement, both the EU and UK must agree to extend the transition period by July 1st, though the UK government has legislated to prevent this scenario happening.Mr O’Sullivan said that he did not think it possible to agree a comprehensive free trade agreement in the nine-month period available and said that an extension of the transition period could be agreed, “which would not be called an extension”.“As a former negotiator I could imagine such a device being possible if both sides felt it worked for them,” he said.“Obviously it would require the UK to feel they could sell this as not being an extension of the transition phase, but I could imagine that it would have benefits for both sides potentially if it is not possible to solve everything or even to solve most things by the end of the year.”The retired Irish civil servant said he was most worried the EU-UK trade talks, which began on Monday, were not starting from “a position of mutual trust and confidence” in the wake of reports saying that the UK were trying to “get around” the ratified Brexit deal on Northern Ireland. “It is very unhelpful. As Irish people, of course we feel particularly aggrieved by that kind of language,” he said.“Stepping back from the emotions of our nationality, I think the rest of the EU will look at this and say, ‘but wait a minute we have a legal document, legally binding by both sides, ratified and suddenly we are told one side is actively considering how to wriggle out of it.’”‘Unprecedented’Mr O’Sullivan, whose last official posting was as EU ambassador to the US from 2014-2019, described the EU-UK trade talks as “unprecedented” in that the two sides were moving from a position of total free trade to less free trade.The negotiations were “sort of free trade in reverse” as the discussions were uniquely aimed at finding agreement on the degree of ergence rather than convergence, said Mr O’Sullivan. “Typically, in a situation of free trade negotiations, you are talking about two parties who are relatively far apart or have distance between them and you are trying to narrow that distance and you are trying to converge,” he said. “Here we have perfect convergence which we are trying to turn into imperfect ergence.” Mr O’Sullivan will be speaking at an event hosted by the Institute of International and European Affairs in Dublin and Trinity College’s “Hist” debating society on Wednesday alongside former commission president Romano Prodi, and former European Council president and Belgian prime minister Herman Van Rompuy.

Twelve months have passed, but many still can’t afford to replace what was washed away. Rainy season is coming, and they worry.Wednesday marks a year since Cyclone Idai was discovered off the coast of Mozambique. One of the worst tropical cyclones on record to hit Africa, it made landfall ten days later, devastating parts of the east African country, as well as regions in Malawi and Zimbabwe. Roughly 1,300 people died and millions were affected.Five weeks later, Idai was followed by Cyclone Kenneth, which caused more damage, deaths and displacement.Beira’s mayor, Daviz Mbepo Simango, says the roughly half a million residents of the coastal city are still suffering the impact of what happened. “Most citizens lost their houses, especially the roofs,” he told The .“Windows, doors. We had a lot of flooding. The farmers lost their animals. The question was how to start recovering the city after that disaster. We are trying to do our best, that is what we are working on.”Since the cyclones hit, Simango’s job has focused on raising money. He has been involved in international donor meetings, where “we mentioned some important areas like construction, housing, roads, sewage systems, waste management. At this stage now we have some funds for coastal protection”, he said.An assessment after the cyclones determined that $3.2 billion (€2.87 billion) was needed for reconstruction in Mozambique alone ultimately $1.5 billion was pledged by countries including Ireland. On top of that, $600 million was requested by the UN for humanitarian aid, of which it received about $300 million.VulnerableThese sums highlight the massive cost of climate change.Cyclones were cyclical, she noted, and a big one could easily hit again. “This year we’re experiencing rains in the north and drought in the south. The climate is really a very big enemy for sustainable development in Mozambique. The vulnerability of the people is still very high.”Mozambique is a poor country of about 30 million. There is a worsening Islamist insurgency in the north, while elections in October were marred by violence and allegations of vote rigging.Simango, Beira’s mayor, accuses the government in Maputo of not helping fast enough after Idai hit because Beira is an opposition stronghold. Residents are still terrified about a recurrence, he said.Business is slowly returning to the city, Simango said, though many people still struggle. “We have people who don’t have anything. Some are old, some are children, some are unemployed. People were trying to save money for different interests and now they need to use it to rebuild their houses. People are delaying preparing for their future.”Stay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":null,"title":"asia","story":"Measure part of effort to contain Europe\u0026rsquos worst coronavirus outbreakFear, bewilderment among those told to isolate themselves but do not know whyExplainer: Fragile breakthrough aimed at withdrawal of US troops faces many obstaclesCountry\u0026rsquos first weapons test in three months after lockdown to halt spread of coronavirusChengdu Letter: Despite handling of the crisis, Xi Jinping\u0026rsquos government still has support42 dead and neighbourhoods trashed after clashes between Muslim and Hindu communitiesPanic-buying began after death of nation\u0026rsquos first coronavirus victim on February 13thGermany says it is heading for epidemic as France has second death and Greece has first caseUneasy calm follows sectarian violence over citizenship law that critics say is biased against MuslimsClashes erupt between two sides over controversial citizenship law as Trump visitsSweden demands release of Gui Minhai, sentenced on charges of leaking intelligenceDecision by 94-year-old leader threatens future of southeast Asian country\u0026rsquos ruling coalitionItaly battling with explosion of cases, which rose on Saturday to over 150Members of the Irish community in Wuhan react to news that they will not be allowed to leave compounds until March 10thThe simians have lost all fear of humans \u0026ndash irrespective of their importance or statureWindow of opportunity to contain international spread of the virus is closing, WHO warnsSuspects charged with organising and brokering illegal emigration, local reports sayGrace Millane (22) was strangled to death during sex with man she met on Tinder in 2018First deaths from virus-striken boat were Japanese and in their 80sChinese health officials publish first details on nearly 45,000 cases of infectionStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4192415.1583328559!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus italy orders all schools and universities to close until mid march","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tSouth Korean army soldiers wearing protective gears spray disinfectant as a precaution against Covid-19 at a shopping street in Seoul, South Korea, on Wednesday. Photograph: APThe Italian government has decided to close schools and universities across the country until mid-March in a further attempt to contain the worst coronavirus outbreak in Europe. The country’s Ansa news agency reported on Wednesday that the government had already shuttered schools and universities in the worst-affected regions in northern Italy some 10 days ago and quarantined a handful of towns at the epicentre of the outbreak. However, the contagion has spread, with at least 79 people dying and more than 2,500 infected. The wider measure, also applying to pre-schools, will come into force on Thursday and could impact up to 8.7 million children and students. Ireland’s Department of Foreign Affairs on Tuesday night advised the Irish public against non-essential travel to the Emilia-Romagna and three other regions in northern Italy badly affected by the virus after the State’s second case was confirmed. Japan is enforcing a complete school shutdown that is due to last until April. It was also announced that the Coppa Italia semi-final second leg between soccer sides Napoli and Inter Milan, which was scheduled for Thursday evening, has been postponed because of the coronavirus outbreak. The other semi-final return leg between Juventus and AC Milan, which was due to be played on Wednesday, was postponed on Tuesday evening.Meanwhile, Iran and South Korea both reported more than 500 new coronavirus cases on Wednesday. With thousands of sick people waiting for hospital beds in Daegu, the South Korean city at the centre of the worst outbreak outside mainland China, the total number of confirmed cases in the country increased to 5,328, with at least 32 deaths, the Korea Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) said.Most cases were in and around Daegu, the country’s fourth-largest city, where the flu-like virus has spread rapidly through members of a fringe Christian group. Health officials expect the number of new cases to be high for the near future as they complete the testing of more than 200,000 members of the Christian sect, as well as thousands of other suspected cases from smaller clusters.“We need special measures in times of emergency,” South Korean prime minister Chung Sye-kyun told a cabinet meeting, referring to extra medical resources sent to hotspots like Daegu and economic measures including a $9.8 billion stimulus.“In order to overcome Covid-19 as quickly as possible and minimise the impact on the economy, it is necessary to proactively inject all available resources.”Covid-19 is the illness caused by the new coronavirus which emerged from central China late last year and has spread around the world.The total number of cases across the world has risen to 93,017, with the death toll now at 3,201 people. Iran on Wednesday announced that there had been 586 new cases in the previous 24 hours, bringing the total to 2,922. The total number of associated deaths stands at 92, a day on day increase of 15. Tensions over how to contain the spread of coronavirus have escalated in the United States, with the death toll climbing to nine as politicians expressed doubts about the government’s ability to ramp up the speed of testing.All of the deaths have occurred in Washington state, and most were residents of a nursing home in suburban Seattle. The number of cases in the US overall has passed 100 scattered across at least 14 states, with 27 in Washington. In New York state, a second coronavirus case was confirmed in a 50-year-old man with an underlying respiratory illness. He is hospitalised and in a serious condition. New York’s governor, Andrew Cuomo, told reporters at a press conference on Tuesday that the patient had not traveled to countries considered the epicentre of the outbreak but had visited Miami recently. Because the patient is not believed to have come into contact with other infected people, health officials said it raises concerns that the pathogen is spreading locally.In England, the organisers of the London Book Fair, due to take place from March 10th to 12th, has been cancelled by organisers over the escalation of coronavirus in Europe. They said the fair would return, “better than ever” next year. A statement from Reed Exhibitions said: “The effects, actual and projected, of coronavirus are becoming evident across all aspects of our lives here in the UK and across the world, with many of our participants facing travel restrictions. “We have been following UK Government guidelines and working with the rolling advice from the public health authorities and other organisations, and so it is with reluctance that we have taken the decision not to go ahead with this year’s event.” - AgenciesEverything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4190840.1583184618!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit negotiating teams convene for round one of trade talks","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tChief Brexit negotiators Michel Barnier (right) with David Frost at the start of post-Brexit trade talks. Photograph: APNegotiating teams for Britain and the European Union met for the first round of talks on the future relationship between the bloc and its former member in Brussels on Monday.Chief negotiators Michel Barnier and David Frost held a roundtable meeting together with their teams of dozens of negotiators, opening the first of five rounds of talks due to take place by May that will alternate between Brussels and London.On Tuesday and Wednesday, the talks will ide into 11 groups that will run concurrently, focusing on areas including trade in goods, services and the contested so-called level playing field.Britain hopes to achieve a free-trade deal with the European Union that allows it trade easily with the world’s largest economic bloc. But the EU holds that easy access to its single market can come only with close alignment to its rules and standards, as otherwise UK companies would have an unfair advantage over those of the EU – something that London has ruled out.Other sticking points include fishing rights: an economically puny but politically weighty issue, particularly for countries such as Denmark and France. Britain wants to preserve more of the catch in its territorial waters for its own fishing industry, ending the practice of shared fishing waters, but it relies on EU markets to sell much of its fish.The first round of talks will conclude on Thursday with a meeting of all groups and a bilateral meeting between Barnier and Frost, at which they will take stock of progress made so far.Britain has left the EU and is now in a transitional arrangement, continuing to observe the same norms as before until the end of this year. If no deal can be reached, Britain will begin automatically trading with the EU on World Trade Organisation default terms in January.Brinkmanship politics?Both sides have said they are willing to walk away without a deal, even though this would entail economic damage, particularly for Britain and its closest neighbours including Ireland. Britain has said it will prepare for a no-deal scenario if it judges that insufficient progress has been made by June.But whether or not a deal is struck, Britain has made clear that its ambitions are for a more distant relationship with the EU, even if that comes at an economic price.EU trade commissioner Phil Hogan has urged companies to prepare for this by reactivating no-deal Brexit contingency plans.“I am very concerned that there’s not sufficient planning in place presently,” said Hogan. “The last thing we want to see is a logistical nightmare for our exporters at our ports and airports through not being properly prepared.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Photograph: Frederic J. BrownAFP via Getty Images.Former vice-president Joe Biden swept to victory in a string of US states overnight, capping an extraordinary 36 hours which saw the once-faltering candidate surge on Super Tuesday.Mr Biden notched up a series of decisive wins in states across the country, and was positioned to possibly win the highest number of delegates of all candidates, as Americans in more than a dozen states went to the polls to select the Democratic candidate to take on Donald Trump in November.As well as winning southern states like Alabama, Texas\u0026nbspand Tennessee, Mr Biden also secured surprise wins in northeastern states like Massachusetts.Signs that a Biden surge was in the offing were evident within minutes of the polls closing. The former vice-president clocked up early victories in Virginia, North Carolina and Alabama, replicating his game-changing performance in South Carolina on Saturday when he surged to victory on the back of strong African-American support.Though the race was more competitive in states like Tennessee and Arkansas, a broad swathe of southern states were soon called for Mr Biden.Bernie Sanders won his home state of Vermont, as well as Colorado, Utah and California, with exit polls showed more than half of Latino voters had endorsed him.TrailingIn a measure of the swing to Mr Biden, the former vice-president won Minnesota and Massachusetts, where he had been trailing in the polls. Though Mr Biden evidently benefitted from Minnesota-native Amy Klobuchar’s decision to drop out and endorse him, Mr Sanders had been widely expected to clinch the state, given his strong polling in the Minneapolis area and beyond.Similarly, Mr Biden had not been expected to win Massachusetts where Mr Sanders and Elizabeth Warren - the state’s senator - had been leading in polls.Tuesday’s results raised question marks about the future of the campaigns of billionaire Michael Bloomberg and Ms Warren.This was Mr Bloomberg’s first electoral test of the campaign after he chose to sit out the four early-voting states and instead concentrate his resources on Super Tuesday and beyond.But despite spending more than $500 million on advertising, Mr Bloomberg’s only victory was in the Pacific island of American Samoa, where he secured 175 votes, generating four delegates.Addressing supporters at a campaign event in Miami, Mr Bloomberg said he would not step down, but the Associated Press later reported that he was considering making an announcement about the future of his campaign on Wednesday.Similarly, Ms Warren struggled to reach the 15 per cent threshold needed to secure delegates. In a major blow to her campaign, she finished third in her home state of Massachusetts.DefiantMr Sanders struck a hopeful and defiant tone as he addressed supporters in Vermont on Tuesday.“Tonight I tell you with absolute confidence we’re going to win the Democratic nomination,” he said.He also made some coded references to Mr Biden, noting that he himself had not voted to endorse the war in Iraq or in favour of trade deals that hurt parts of working class America.“Let’s go on to the White House,” he said as he concluded his speech.In a speech in Las Vegas, Mr Biden thanked his supporters and welcomed their “bold, progressive vision”.He quoted Seamus Heaney’s The Cure at Troy, saying “History says, don’t hope on this side of the grave, but then, once in a lifetime, the longed-for tidal wave of justice rises up and make hope and history rhyme.”Fourteen states, as well as American Samoa and Democrats Abroad, held their primaries on Tuesday - the most important day so far in the Democratic primary calendar.A third of all delegates will be decided when the results of Tuesday’s contests are confirmed, with a clutch of important states still to vote on March 10th and March 17th.The Democratic nominee to take on Mr Trump in November will be chosen at the Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee in July.Stay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/rugby-union/2020/03/03/TELEMMGLPICT000226703052_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwi","title":"coronavirus cancellations closures sport events concerts flights","story":"Coronavirus latest news: follow our live blog for all updatesMarkets live blog: financial impact of crisisSport events cancelled and threatenedCulture events cancelled and threatenedLatest travel advice and cancellationsGovernment\u0027s coronavirus action plan: the key points explained The coronavirus crisis has led to the Six Nations being disrupted and threatened several other major sporting events, large concerts and festivals being cancelled and airlines reducing flights.Here is everything you need to know about what has been cancelled - and what is under threat.The Premier League has written to each of its 20 clubs regarding the latest contingency plans for combating the spread of the virus.While there has been no change to fixtures and kick-off times as things stand, it is understood the Premier League, which is liaising daily with the Government\u0027s public health experts, has asked clubs to consider the implications if large gatherings were banned, resulting in games taking place behind closed doors.It is understood the Premier League\u0027s current message is \u0027business as usual\u0027 but that it has advised clubs to increase hygiene levels at stadiums and training grounds, cut down on non-essential visitors and keep face-to-face meetings to a minimum.The Italian government is likely to order all Serie A games to be played behind closed doors in an effort to curb Europe\u0027s worst coronavirus outbreak, the country\u0027s sports minister has said.We are heading towards that decision, Vincenzo Spadafora told reporters when asked if the government was thinking of barring fans.The government last month banned sporting events in the worst-affected northern regions. So far, 10 Serie A matches have been postponed as well as two in the Coppa Italia.However, Italy\u0027s epidemic has spread, with 79 dead and 2,502 cases, and ministers are considering new measures.Read the full story.Lufthansa will ground 150 aircraft out of its total fleet of around 770 due to the coronavirus, the German airline said today, confirming what company sources had told Reuters earlier.We are dynamically adjusting our plans to reflect extraordinary circumstances, a Lufthansa spokesman said, adding that 25 of the 150 grounded aircraft are long-haul jets.Last week Lufthansa said it had grounded 23 long-haul aircraft.European airline bosses warned on Tuesday that the worst is still to come for the airline industry in terms of economic damage from the coronavirus outbreak, but they predicted that travel demand could stabilise in the coming weeks.A Lufthansa A380 aircraft lands as the full moon shineThe Coppa Italia semi-final second leg between Napoli and Inter Milan, which was scheduled for Thursday evening, has become the latest fixture in Italy to be postponed because of the coronavirus outbreak.A Serie A statement said: The president of the Serie A League, having taken note of the order of the Prefect of Naples of 4 March 2020 n. 0069870 which orders the postponement to a later date of the semi-final return match of the Coppa Italia Napoli-Inter scheduled on March 5 at 20.45, announces that the aforementioned is postponed until a later date.The other semi-final return leg between Juventus and AC Milan, which was due to be played on Wednesday, was postponed on Tuesday evening.A decision on whether France\u0027s final match of the Six Nations against Ireland will go ahead may come this afternoon, Ben Coles reports in Paris.The French government is planning to meet with representatives from each of France\u0027s sporting organisations at 4pm GMT to discuss how to contain the spread of the coronavirus.One possibility may be to hold the match at the Stade de France behind closed doors, in order to prevent the scenario of Irish supporters travelling to Paris. France are unbeaten and aiming to win a first Six Nations title since 2010. Ireland\u0027s fourth-round match with Italy has already been postponed. The Six Nations reiterated on Monday that all other fixtures at the time were set to go ahead as planned.Indoor gatherings of more than 5,000 people have already been banned in France, while Sunday\u0027s half-marathon in Paris has also been cancelled. More than 100 cases have been reported in the country, while two people have died since contracting the illness.The Stade de France in ParisThree of the biggest races on the Italian cycling calendar are in doubt following a clampdown on public events that was announced by the Italian government on Tuesday, John MacLeary reports.  .Just days after the UAE Tour was brought to a premature end due to a coronavirus scare, Strade Bianche, due to be raced on Saturday, Tirreno-Adriatico (March 11-17) and Milan-Sanremo (March 21) now appear set to be cancelled.After instructing teams on Mondaythat Tuscan race Strade Bianche would go ahead, Mauro Vegni, director of race organisers RCS, told Italian website Tuttobiciweb on Wednesday that appears unlikely.We\u0027re close to the dates for three big races: Strade Bianche, Tirreno-Adriatico and Milan-San Remo and as we said a few days ago, our intention is to put on the races and so put on a show for the fans, Vegni told Tuttobiciweb on Wednesday.We intend to work alongside the UCI to find a new place on the calendar for these tests, which we absolutely do not want to miss.There has been a big drop in the number of people taking flights - this picture shows a near-empty BA flight travelling from London to Milan:Six more people with links to the cancelled UAE Tour cycling race have been infected with the virus spreading around the world, AP reports.The Ministry of Health in the United Arab Emirates said in a statement that two Russians, two Italians, one German and one Colombian have been diagnosed with the virus. They were all linked to two previous cases involving Italians, it said.Rider Igor Boev of the Gazprom-RusVelo team told Russian news agency RIA Novosti that he was in the hospital after being diagnosed. Boev said he was waiting for more test results and said the hospital food was more than fine for a normal person but not enough for a pro rider.Riders from other teams are staying in isolation in case they develop symptoms. Arnaud Demare of Groupama-FDJ posted a video of makeshift fitness routines in his hotel room and eating food delivered in a paper bag.Cofidis team president Thierry Vittu said today he was told to stay in quarantine until March 14. He said it was a relief to have a deadline for when riders and staff could leave, even if it\u0027s still some time away.Now we know where we stand, and even if the confinement in the room continues, everyone will manage to find occupations, distractions, activities, he said on the team website. We are going to stay in solidarity with each other, conscious that we are living a collective adventure, that we would have liked not to live, but which will teach us about ourselves and others. We already tell ourselves that in a few months, we will be laughing about it among ourselves.Riders of the Groupama-FDJ team in action during the first stage of the UAE Tour 2020 cycling race in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, on 23 FebruaryBritish Olympic Association chief executive Andy Anson has emphasised preparations for Tokyo 2020 continue despite the uncertainty caused by the coronavirus outbreak.Anson said a planned preparatory trip to Tokyo, with around 55 people travelling, was still set to go ahead as the BOA received information from every possible source in a rapidly evolving situation.On Tuesday, Japan\u0027s Olympic minister Seiko Hashimoto suggested this summer\u0027s Games could be postponed until later in the year because of the outbreak, but the International Olympic Committee announced it remains committed to staging the event as scheduled between July 24 and August 9.Anson told BBC Sport: It is not affecting our plans in any way, in that we are absolutely focused on getting the team to Tokyo for the Olympics in July and everyone is obsessed with that, that is the number one focus.At the same time we are getting information from all the relevant bodies, so we have got the most up-to-date information on coronavirus, and it is changing every day as you can see with the news stories.But we\u0027re in touch with Public Health England, the World Health Organisation, the IOC, the British Government. We are getting information from every possible source so we can make decisions in real time as we go along.It\u0027s obviously a rapidly evolving situation, there\u0027s a lot of uncertainty about where it goes. So our assumption is the Olympics is going to happen, but at the same time we are making sure we are aware of what is going on in the world.We are going out to Tokyo a week on Saturday for a detailed operational recce, we\u0027re going to take about 55 people, the team leaders from inidual sports. We are still going ahead with that because all of the information we are getting says travel to Japan is safe.Of course we\u0027ll take all the precautions we\u0027re being advised to take, we\u0027ll make sensible, smart decisions about where people stay and how they interact, but we are going to do that because we think it is an absolutely vital element of our preparation for Tokyo 2020.Milan’s Furniture Fair (Salone del Mobile) has been postponed to June. The decision has come as a relief to many who thought the event may be cancelled altogether, Kiki Deere reports.The largest furniture design trade fair in the world, the Salone yearly attracts millions of visitors and is a major driver for the Italian economy. Many, however, are not pleased with the newly announced dates (16th–21st June) as they overlap with two days of Men’s Fashion Week in Milan (20–24th June), and with Pitti Uomo, an international event for menswear and accessory collections in Florence (16–19th June). Hotels are particularly concerned as they fear they will not be able to host visitors for both the Furniture Fair and Fashion Week.A number of other major events in Italy have been postponed, including the 54th edition of Vinitaly, a major international trade fair for wine in Verona (now due to take place 14–17th June), and Bologna’s cosmetic trade show Cosmoprof (now 11th–15th June).Tourists wearing protective face masks at Milan CathedralJapan\u0027s Olympic minister has said the contract to hold the Tokyo Games only specifies the event has to be held during 2020.Seiko Hashimoto\u0027s response to a question in the upper house of parliament implies the Olympics could be held later in the year and would not have to start on July 24 as planned. The Paralympics open on Aug 25.The IOC has the right to cancel the games only if they are not held during 2020, Hashimoto told parliament. This can be interpreted to mean the games can be postponed as long as they are held during the calendar year.However, the suggestion of a possible change of plan was quickly batted back at a meeting of the International Olympic Committee\u0027s executive board in Switzerland.We are going to have the games on the 24th of July, IOC spokesman Mark Adams said at a briefing.A women\u0027s golf event in Abu Dhabi which was due to start on Friday has been postponed due to the coronavirus outbreak.Organisers of The Ladies Open at Yas Links announced today that the two-day event featuring 36 professionals playing with amateur partners had been called off.A statement on the tournament\u0027s Twitter feed read: As a precautionary and proactive measure, in conjunction with the local authorities, the decision has been made to postpone The Ladies Open at Yas Links Abu Dhabi until further notice.This decision is to ensure the health, safety and well-being of players, guests and visitors.On the men\u0027s European Tour, Italy\u0027s Francesco Laporta has been forced out of this week\u0027s Qatar Masters after being faced with two weeks\u0027 quarantine on arriving in Doha.Under travel restrictions imposed on Sunday, passengers arriving in Doha on direct flights from Italy, or those having been in Italy in the last two weeks, will be taken into quarantine for 14 days.Laporta competed in the Oman Open last week but told the ANSA news agency that he was checked, along with 40 compatriots arriving from Milan Malpensa, when landing in Doha.We were treated with respect and welcomed also by the Italian ambassador but there were two solutions, quarantine for two weeks or return home, Laporta said.I had no alternative. I took a flight to Rome and now I\u0027m going to Puglia.Six other Italian players who competed in Oman were allowed into Qatar.Japan has today cancelled the Tokyo Olympics\u0027 rugby test event in the latest disruption caused by coronavirus, which has raised concerns over whether the Games will go ahead on time, AFP reports.Organisers said they couldn\u0027t guarantee a safe running of the Asia Sevens Invitational, scheduled for April 25-26.As the impact of the novel coronavirus spreads across the world, we are not able to guarantee that the tournament will be held safely at this point, Japan Rugby Football Union said in a statement.The tournament\u0027s demise comes after the Hong Kong and Singapore Sevens were postponed as chaos caused by the virus sweeps through the sporting calendar.The Olympic stadium in Tokyo on WednesdayThe London Book Fair due to take place from March 10 to 12 has been cancelled by organisers over the escalation of coronavirus in Europe.A statement from Reed Exhibitions on Twitter said:The effects, actual and projected, of coronavirus are becoming evident across all aspects of our lives here in the UK and across the world, with many of our participants facing travel restrictions.We have been following UK Government guidelines and working with the rolling advice from the public health authorities and other organisations, and so it is with reluctance that we have taken the decision not to go ahead with this year\u0027s event.We recognise that business has to continue. With this in mind, we will of course support and collaborate with exhibitors and visitors to keep our world moving during this difficult period.We thank all those from the UK and a multitude of other countries who have prepared over the last year to deliver what promised to be a wonderful book fair showcasing, as ever, the exciting best of the global book industry.The London Book Fair will return, better than ever, in 2021.Finnair is cancelling flights to mainland China, South Korea and Milan because of the coronavirus outbreak and will open talks with unions next week about temporary staff layoffs, the airline has said.Finnair is cancelling all flights to mainland China until April 30, to Milan in northern Italy from March 9 to April 7, and to Seoul in South Korea from March 9 until April 16.

I hope so. But what we know for sure is still pretty worrying: that the virus can spread rapidly, and can, in some cases, lead to serious and even fatal conditions like severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure or pneumonia.I know about pneumonia, and it’s not to be sniffed at. In fact, it’s horrific. In early February 2015, I felt the first signs of a fever. I was used to developing fevers in winter, and had always battled through them. But there was a rage to this one that singled it out. It felt different and much worse.Even so, being self-employed, my instinct was to carry on working, and just warn people not to shake hands with me or come too close. That’s the business culture I was used to. Get into work if you possibly can, and fulfil your commitments.So, although I’d spent a sleepless weekend in bed with an angry, high temperature, when Monday came and I had to decide whether to stay there or travel into London, drugged, to conduct a training session. I – stupidly – plumped for the latter. By soldiering on and refusing to give in to influenza, I allowed myself to develop not just pneumonia, but double pneumonia. (The double bit means both lungs.) My self-imposed macho business attitude could have killed me.Double pneumonia feels like this: your temperature spikes to 40-plus and stays there your body aches absolutely everywhere you can’t get enough air into your lungs it takes all your energy just to turn over in bed you can’t stand up without a massive effort going to the loo means crawling there. Sleep? Forget it. Food? You won’t be able to face anything. Walk more than a couple of paces? No way.After my mad trip into London, I spent four days at home, getting worse and worse before finally being taken to A\u0026ampE, followed by ten days in hospital during which the maximum dose of paracetamol merely forced my temperature just below 40 for about an hour before angrily surging back up, leaving me freezing cold and shaking uncontrollably. I developed pleurisy. Over two weeks, I lost a stone and a half in weight and looked like I’d aged a decade.Having been stupid enough to ignore my symptoms, I then took one sensible decision: to follow the advice of the medics rather than to look up my condition on the web. If I’d succumbed to that temptation, I’d have seen, according to one authority I’ve since consulted, that of every ten people hospitalised with double pneumonia (most of them elderly, admittedly), only six or seven survive. Sobering stuff.But what doesn’t kill you makes you stronger, and ever since then I’ve taken some simple but, so far, effective measures to reduce the risk of catching flu again – many of which the government is now encouraging people to adopt to protect themselves against coronavirus.I’ve become an obsessive hand washer, and carry hand gel around with me. When opening a door in any public place, I try to use one finger, right at the end of the handle, which I figure most people won’t touch. When going down an escalator to the London tube, I lean on the handrail, but don’t touch it. Once down there, if someone’s coughing and spluttering, I unashamedly move as far away as possible. I take daily vitamin tablets to strengthen immunity.Obsessive? Maybe. But I’ve had no fever since 2015. So, I’m pretty sure that about half my measures must be working (though, like Henry Ford, I don’t know which half).The evidence suggests that, for most, catching coronavirus will be more of an uncomfortable inconvenience than a threat, particularly for young people, rather like catching a really bad cold. But none of us can be sure how our bodies will react, and some won’t be so lucky. Surely, then, the sensible approach is to carry on, work as normal, but take precautions that might anyway become good habits for the future.And, of course, if you do feel a fever coming on, do exactly what I didn’t. Stay home. Don’t be a hero. Or you might very well end up a villain.The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

In 2003 the disease killed 774 people in more than two dozen countries.The rate of recovery in China has been improving by the day as containment measures begin to take effect.The country has pursued an aggressive policy of containment since early in the outbreak, imposing travel restrictions as the virus spread. On February 19th, the number of people confirmed to be infected with coronavirus recovering overtook new cases being diagnosed for the first time.And on March 3, just 125 new cases were diagnosed, compared with more than 2,700 recoveries documented that day.It has helped reduce the number of active cases globally from close to 59,000 on February 17th, to just over 41,000 in early March.Outside China, there have been cases confirmed in more than 70 countries.The first Briton to die from the virus had been on board the Diamond Princess cruise ship which was quarantined off the coast of Japan.He was the sixth passenger from the ship to die after more than 700 tourists contracted coronavirus on board.There have been 51 confirmed cases in the UK, with nearly 14,000 people tested.Scientists predict the UK would see a coronavirus peak two to three months after sustained person-to-person transmission becomes established across the country.There will then be a further two to three months of decline, meaning an outbreak could last around four to six months.Officials hope to delay the peak of the virus until the warmer months when health services are less busy coping with seasonal flu.Thorough hand-washing, maintaining distance from others and avoiding handshakes are among the most effective measures for reducing the risk of catching coronavirus.Everyday precautions like carrying hand sanitiser, covering your mouth and nose with a tissue or sleeve when you cough or sneeze, rather than your hands, and binning used tissues immediately is also helpful, according to the NHS.However, after reports of people bulk buying food and clearing shelves of antibacterial gel and other supplies the Government has warned people not to panic buy.Initial symptoms include fever, cough, tightness of the chest, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties.More severe cases can cause pneumonia, Sars, sepsis and septic shock, which can lead to death.There are no specific treatments or vaccines but symptoms can be treated.The UK Government says most cases appear to be mild and those who have died in Wuhan appear to have had pre-existing health conditions.The Government\u0027s new battle plan says the elderly and people with pre-existing illnesses would be at highest risk.Overall around one per cent of people who become infected might end up dying but this is significantly higher among people over 80, officials said.More from NewsMore

the east of the country last month to limit social contact after 10 new confirmed coronavirus infections were traced to the event.Christophe Lannelongue, the head of the eastern France health agency, said on Wednesday that he expected more confirmed cases of coronavirus to appear in the region following the discovery of the 10 cases in two families, linked to a Lent church service in which some 2,000 people took part.The chain of contamination clearly started at the meeting of the Lent week of the \u0027Porte Ouverte Chretienne\u0027... we can expect new cases in coming hours, Mr Lannelongue said.Health officials are trying to track all those who attended the service, but local prefect Laurent Touvet said this would be difficult because the event was open to the public and there had been no registration of participants.Mr Lannelongue called on people who took part to isolate themselves and report to medical authorities if they showed symptoms of coronavirus infection.The prefecture has also closed two schools attended by children of the infected families, as well as a school close to the evangelical church where the infection originated.Doctors in South Korea are testing more than 200,000 members of a fringe Christian group in the city of Daegu, the centre of the worst outbreak outside China, to which most of the South Korean cases have been traced.In France, more than 200 people have been infected with the virus and four people have died, but the virus has appeared separately in several regions and under different circumstances.More from NewsMore from The We urge you

on inviting gay partners.The Lambeth Conference is a once-a-decade event in which an assembly of Anglican bishops from around the world. However this year’s event has been dogged by an increasingly fractious split between liberals and a faction of hardline traditionalists over LGBT+ issues.Bishops’ spouses have traditionally been guests at the Lambeth conference, but it was deemed “inappropriate” to invite same-sex spouses to this year’s event after the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Most Rev Justin Welby , last year issued a ban on same-sex partners from attending.As an act of protest, LGBT+ campaigners will now hold their own church service led by two high-profile married lesbian priests on the eve of the conference.An “inclusive” eucharist at a church in Canterbury will be presided over by the the first married lesbian bishop in the Anglican Communion, the Rt Rev Mary Glasspool, the assistant bishop in New York.The Holland-based preacher will be the Rev Canon Mpho Tutu van Furth, a daughter of Desmond Tutu, the veteran South African anti-apartheid campaigner.The service is intended to send a strong message to up to 1,000 bishops from 165 countries who are due to gather at the University of Kent for almost two weeks of prayer and discussion in July about issues facing the worldwide Anglican church.It is also likely to incense conservative bishops who believe that homosexuality is a sin.The split over sexuality – between those who seek to uphold “biblical truth” and those who are pressing for inclusivity – dominated the last Lambeth conference, in 2008, leading Rowan Williams, who was then Archbishop of Canterbury, to warn that the church was in “grave peril”.Bishop Glasspool explained the need for an inclusive service, saying: “It is an honour and a privilege to be a part of this “Inclusive Eucharist,” in which we say to all people everywhere: You are loved by our Loving God and welcome at Christ’s table.“Like others, I initially queried the use of the phrase “Inclusive Eucharist”, given that all eucharistic celebrations are, of their very essence, inclusive. However, I am aware that there are sadly many places in the world where this is not yet the case. I hope that, in some small way, this celebration can be a part of changing that.”Revd Canon Tutu van Furth added: “Welcome and hospitality are prized values of the Middle Eastern heritage of our Christian tradition. We want every person who joins us in worship to know to the very fibre of their being that they are welcome.”More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2020/01/05/TELEMMGLPICT000210017597_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqqVzuuqpFlyLIwiB6NTmJwQksq39z_LG8feNTt61Q-5E.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"forget wind turbines can meet net zero without derailing economy","story":"The idea that renewable energy could power the UK is delusionalTo meet the Conservatives’ net-zero emissions target, the UK will need around 40GW of new, low-carbon baseload generation by 2050. Technology undoubtedly holds the answer to achieving that. But it is no use setting our hopes on fashionable technologies simply for their superficial appeal.Sadly, however, the Government’s latest decision to revive onshore wind seems to fall into this trap. It is welcome that the plans will still give local people a strong say in new development decisions. Indeed, they should have the final say. But the problems of wind turbines go far beyond their being mere eyesores.Wind turbines are already close to their maximum theoretical efficiency – the Betz limit – and their effectiveness will always be determined by the wind available. Given that, for wind turbines to supply only the annual global growth in demand, nearly 350,000 would need to be built each year. This is 1.5 times as many as have been built since the early 2000s, and would require more land than the area of the British Isles every year.Allied to this, the mining of rare-earth metals in Mongolia for the magnets generates toxic and radioactive waste on a massive scale. It takes about 150 tonnes of coal to make a turbine. To build the 350,000 needed to meet growth, we would need 50 million tonnes of coal per year – about half the EU’s entire coal-mining output. The arithmetic is, therefore, against wind energy ever making a significant contribution to world energy supply. It is small wonder that the Renewable Energy Policy Network’s 2019 Global Status Report showed that wind and solar power together still provide just 2 per cent of global energy consumption or that former Chief Scientific Adviser to DECC Sir David MacKay declared the idea that renewable energy could power the UK an “appalling delusion” because there is simply not enough land.Clearly, we need to do better than onshore wind. Nuclear power is an obvious candidate, but there is a problem in achieving that capacity from large fission plants: there are neither enough suitable sites nor enough time to build them. Reaching the net-zero target would require opening a new Hinkley Point-sized station every four months until 2050. That could cost anything from £6 trillion if we could find enough civil engineers, even without the spiralling costs which similar projects have faced at the Olkiluoto nuclear project in Finland and at Flamanville in France. Both are struggling even to make the technology work.With modular nuclear reactors (SMRs), however, we see a proven technology which can provide power much more reliably than intermittent renewable sources. Rolls Royce estimates that each reactor – small enough to be transported by lorry – could provide the power equivalent of 150 onshore wind turbines. Lower construction costs through economies of series production, short construction time and the potential to use small reactors in Combined Heat and Power systems, make SMRs a technology with enormous potential to provide clean, sustainable and reliable energy.Implemented nationally, this revolutionary programme of localised electricity production would massively increase the resilience of the system, considerably improve energy efficiency overall, and ease pressure on the distribution system.In December 2017, the Government provided funding of up to £56 million over three years to support SMR research, which could facilitate an expansion in CHP. Outside the EU and its state aid rules, the Government must continue to make this a priority alongside plans for the first conceptual hydrogen fusion power plant by 2024. The Government announced a £200m investment into the project in October, designed to demonstrate commercial energy production by 2040. In a similar vein, the Advanced Propulsion Centre administers a £1bn Government investment fund for promising, low-emission powertrain technologies, including hydrogen fuel cells. In tandem, we should review our regulatory framework to ensure that the burdens and costs of regulation do not unduly hold back full commercial exploitation.The human race has come through adversity before, by harnessing the full potential of our creative, innovative power and fully exploiting the very latest technologies. The way to address the impact of greenhouse gas emissions now is to innovate our way out of the problem with cutting edge techniques.The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

The climate law is central to the European Green Deal, which includes a €100 billion package to help fossil-fuel dependent regions move to cleaner technologies.Ms Thunberg savaged the law as unenforceable and unambitious and accused the EU, which styles itself as global frontrunner in climate action, of a lack of leadership. She said it had a less than 50 per cent chance of  limiting the global average temperature rise to below 1.5 degrees celsius, which is a goal of the Paris Agreement on climate change.Speaking in the European Parliament, Ms Thunberg accused Brussels lawmakers of “pretending” and “giving up”.  “This climate law is surrender because nature doesn’t bargain and you cannot make deals with physics,” she said, You can’t escape no matter how badly you want to or how hard you try and the longer you keep running away from that truth, the bigger your betrayal to your own children.”“When your house is on fire you don\u0027t wait a few more years to put it out. And yet that is what the commission is proposing,” she added. “The Climate Law is the legal translation of our political commitment, and sets us irreversibly on the path to a more sustainable future,” Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the commission, insisted. “It gives direction to our green growth strategy and guarantees that the transition will be gradual and fair.”The law is likely to face opposition from coal-addicted Poland, which refused to sign up to the EU-wide target at a December EU summit. The commission said it would propose a new target for greenhouse gas emissions for 2030 by September, after an impact assessment was completed. The current target was agreed in 2014, before the Paris Agreement was struck and is too low to reach the net zero goal in time. A dozen countries including Austria, Denmark, Finland, France, Italy, Latvia, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal, Slovenia, Spain and Sweden sent a letter to the commission calling for the 2030 target to be drawn up “as soon as possible”.NGOs have criticised the commission for not revising the target sooner, arguing that the failure to do so means the EU will not have time to agree the increase before the UN climate conference in Glasgow in November. Both the Council of Ministers and the European Parliament will have to agree an identical version of the Climate Law, after both sides amend it separately, before it can become law. The current goal is an emissions reduction of at least 40 percent compared to 1990 levels. The commission is pushing for an increase of up to 55 per cent, which most MEPs say should be the minimum. Miss Thunberg has called for a minimum 80 per cent reductions, which is more than Green MEPs, who want 65 per cent. Plans to revise progress and potentially increase targets every five years from September 2023 have been criticised as a power grab. They are likely to be resisted by national governments as they use a mechanism to allow the commission to adjust the target without seeking the backing of the Council of Ministers and MEPs. The commission would also be empowered to issue recommendations to laggardly countries, who would be obliged to take remedial action or explain their reasons not to.Britain has also pledged to cut carbon emissions to net zero by 2050. More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"western forces race against time prepare west african states","story":"Jihadists who have brought bloodshed to the Sahel are advancing rapidly on four previously unaffected states in West Africa, threatening to open a new front in their insurgency.Security officials in the Gulf of Guinea say that under-resourced, under-manned and often ill-prepared armies in Ghana, Ivory Coast, Benin and Togo are involved “in a race against time” to protect their frontiers.All four states border Burkina Faso, where groups affiliated to al Qaeda and Islamic State have launched a bloody and stunningly effective campaign that has swept throughout a country regarded until recently as among the most stable in West Africa.In recent weeks, the jihadists have begun to test the country’s borders with its southern neighbours, raising fears in Western capitals that an already serious crisis is about to evolve into a far broader regional conflagration.Last month suspected militants based in Burkina Faso raided a police station just inside Benin, while a security source in Ghana said that Islamist groups were now carrying out attacks within three miles of Ghanaian territory.“They are steadily pushing south from Burkina Faso,” he said. “It is worrying. We have porous borders and we believe that if the heat is turned up on the jihadists in Burkina Faso they will seek to regroup in Ghana.”Britain is already being drawn ever deeper into the Sahel crisis. It has deployed three heavy-lift Chinook helicopters and nearly 100 personnel to support France’s counterterrorist mission in the Sahel, a vast stretch of arid scrubland on the southern fringe of the Sahara. It will send 250 more to join the UN’s force in Mali in the coming months.But any jihadist infiltration into Ghana would raise pressure on Britain to play a much more decisive role in what has so far been a French-led response to the crisis.The three Sahelian states at the epicentre of the insurgency – Mali, Niger and Burkina Faso – are all former French colonies, as are three of the latter’s four southern neighbours. Until 1957 Ghana was the British colony of the Gold Coast.Just as in the Sahel, none of the Gulf of Guinea states are thought to be anywhere near ready to beat back Islamist groups that have carried out hundreds of attacks on military and civilian targets alike, killing thousands of people a year.Britain has taken a leading role, alongside France, the United States and Israel, in helping Ghana develop a special forces capability, the Ghanaian source said.Last week, British officers also joined Flintlock, an annual Pentagon-sponsored exercise to train 15 African armies in counterterrorism techniques.Given the rapidly deteriorating situation in the Sahel, where the number of attacks has increased five-fold since 2016, this year’s manoeuvres, held in the Senegalese town of Thies and in the desert state of Mauritania, took on an added urgency.For Gulf of Guinea states there is not only terror about what their armies may also soon be facing, but concern, too, that America could be abandoning them to the fight.Even as Britain and France step up their presence in the region, the Trump administration says it is considering substantial cuts to its military presence and ending aid to the France’s Sahelian mission, Operation Barkhane.Whatever happens, Western military trainers at Flintlock say that training and equipping Sahelian armies is vital to winning the battle on the African front of the war on terror. Ultimately, western forces will not be able to leave the region until local armies are strong enough to take the battle to the foe. British officers talk of seeking “to learn the lessons of Afghanistan and Iraq”. “The solution is going to be local,” says Brig Gus Fair, commander of the Specialised Infantry Group, a British army unit that trains foreign forces, echoing the mantra repeated by American officers, “African solutions to African problems”.The challenges facing local armies were painfully on display during a training exercise for special forces soldiers from Burkina Faso at Flintlock in Thies last week.Under orders to attack a jihadist camp then capture or kill a pre-identified terrorist commander and recover documents with key intelligence in his office, the soldiers mixed up north and south, captured the wrong man and forgot the intelligence documents.Such mistakes could happen in any training mission in the heat of the moment, even the best British or American soldiers might slip up. But typically such exercises are repeated up to six times. The Burkinabe soldiers got to do it just once, given the time-constraints of the instructors working with so many armies. Amid a growing terror of being overwhelmed, Sahelian states have announced massive army recruitment drives. Given the scale of the slaughter, persuading volunteers is far from easy, however. Instead, some states are increasingly relying on outsourcing the war to ethnic militias – tacitly in Mali’s case, openly in Burkina Faso’s – who have fast established a reputation both for brutality and for carrying out massacres against communities perceived, mostly without basis, as supporting the jihadists.Western officials hope that, should it come to it, Burkina Faso’s neighbours will avoid making similar mistakes. Others worry they may have no choice.The Gulf of Guinea states are supposedly stronger than the Sahel, one of the world’s poorest regions. Ghana and Ivory Coast are West Africa’s second and third richest states, eclipsed only by Nigeria, the continent’s biggest economy. Unlike the Sahel, they are also seen as comparatively strong, functioning states.Yet there are also too many similarities for comfort. The northern regions of both Ghana and Ivory Coast are not just more Muslim but far poorer than the remainder of either country.The jihadists exploited similarly marginalised communities in Sahelian states, using local grievances as a highly effective recruiting tool. There are religious differences to exploit too, both within Islam along the ide between Sunnis and Sufis, and outside it, between Muslims and Christians.A series of massacres in Burkina Faso that has seen gunmen burst into Sunday church services and massacre people at prayer has already sparked anger and terror among Christians in northern Ghana.Some churches have already banned backpacks and placed scanning machines outside their entrances, fearing suicide bombs.If religious and ethnic tensions are mounting in the Gulf of Guinea’s stronger states, the problem is even more acute in Togo and Benin, much poorer, more dysfunctional and more similar to the Sahelian states.Last year two French tourists were kidnapped in the Pendjari national park in northern Benin by Islamic State militants and two French soldiers killed in their eventual rescue.The militants may have been helped, a regional security source said, by locals with land grievances caused by the displacement of locals to create the park, a key refuge for some of the world’s last substantial populations of forest elephant.The jihadists are thought to have slipped into Benin along one of the many smuggler and bandit routes that dot Burkina Faso’s borders with its southern neighbours, he said.Protect yourself and your family by learning more about Global Health Security.

They could pay statutory minimum sick pay or anything up to full wages for several months.Greggs will pay workers who self isolate due to coronavirusEmployment dispute resolution service Acas says employers must resolve workers\u0027 genuine concerns about the virus.

Insurance policies for accident, illness and unemployment may cover wages lost to coronavirus infection.Sickness cover is unlikely to cover the cost of self-isolation or loss of earnings if work dries up because people are staying home in response to the virus.If you have this kind of protection policy, check what cover you have with your insurer.Uber’s “partner protection” policy, for example covers severe sickness and injury if a medical practitioner signs a driver off for over seven days. From day eight, drivers are eligible for a daily payment for up to 15 days.Work and pensions minister, Justin Tomlinson, attracted criticism when he suggested people rely on benefits if they could not work during the outbreak.“Those whose employers ask them to stay away from the workplace due to coronavirus concerns, who do not qualify for Statutory Sick Pay, may be able to claim Universal Credit andor new-style employment and support allowance,” he said.Universal Credit claimants have to wait up to five weeks for their first payment, however. Given that the government forecasts up to one fifth of the workforce is forecast to be off sick meaning that a significant number of people could struggle to make ends meet.People with no sick pay who may not be able to afford two weeks of self-isolationAlternatively, workers who are unable to work because of a health condition can claim employment and support allowance but only if they have paid National Insurance for the last two to three years.\u0026nbspThe rate for the first 13 weeks is up to £57.90 per week if your aged under 25 or up to £73.10 for over-25s. It then rises to as much as £111.65 depending on inidual circumstances.A spokesperson for the UK government’s Department for Work and Pensions said: “Our staff are ready to support people if they are affected – we urge them to contact us by phone, or their work coach via their online journal, to explain their situation.If people have to stay home on less than full pay, more people will get into debt.

They are starting to\u0026nbsptake\u0026nbspit very seriously and are thus demanding that investee companies take it very seriously.Resolutions like this one rarely win, although sooner or later the dam\u0026nbspwill break.Even if it doesn’t this time, a significant vote in favour will still send a powerful message to Barclays’ board, which has come up with the usual guff about listening to shareholders in response to the move, and whomever is appointed to fill the roll of chief executive when Jes Staley departs.\u0026nbspBehind the scenes, the bank has quietly argued that it should be compared with a US, rather than a European peer group, because\u0026nbspit is a transatlantic investment bank.\u0026nbspThat won’t wash. It simply says, look, our peer group is ok with mucking up the planet so you should let us carry on too. Its a specious and short term argument.\u0026nbspThe bank also needs to wake up to the fact that while European money managers are ahead of the curve when it comes to the climate crisis, there have been tentative signs that American ones are belatedly starting to wake up.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

However, many organisations offer their staff sick pay which goes beyond this and so employees should look at their contract or speak with your employer or HR department.“If you are genuinely self-employed, you will not be eligible for statutory sick pay.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The tests simulate a range of potential shocks, including\u0026nbspa dramatic economic slowdown in China and Hong Kong. The Chinese economy has been impacted significantly by the virus with factories shut down and planes grounded, delivering a knock-on effect for companies that source goods and materials from China.“We don’t know what’s going to happen,” Mr Carney said. “Certainly the situation we are entering, the economic situation we are entering because of the virus – we didn’t run a stress test against that specific situation but we can learn from the stress tests we’ve been carrying out since 2014 about the resilience of the institutions against that type of risk.”Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

We don’t have any zero contract hours,” he told the BBC.Wetherspoons said last week that its 45,000 employees would be paid statutory sick pay if they isolate themselves. Statutory sick pay is £94.25 per week for workers who have been off for more than four days.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

We on our side will continue to support the athletes and their NOC’s (National Olympic Committees) with regular updates and information on their website.”Speculation that the Games could be delayed had mounted earlier in the day after Hashimoto had told the Japanese parliament that the organising committee’s agreement with the IOC could allow for such a scenario.She said: “The contract calls for the Games to be held within 2020. That could be interpreted as allowing a postponement.”Klopp responds to coronavirus fears after Chelsea lossThe coronavirus is having an increasing impact on sport as governing bodies attempt to protect athletes and spectators at the same time as responding proportionately.Cofidis president Thierry Vittu has expressed anger that his riders remain among four cycling teams still in quarantine in Abu Dhabi following the cancellation of the final two stages of the UAE Tour.He said in a statement: “This situation is really not normal. We’re being held against our will in a place we didn’t choose and for an unknown length of time.”However, FIFA president Gianni Infantino has urged football’s administrators “not to panic” with Switzerland and Italy among countries to have postponed fixtures as a result of the outbreak.Speaking to member associations at UEFA’s Congress in Amsterdam on Tuesday, he said: “Some of you have had to take important decisions in this respect. Every competition organiser has to study it of course and has to take decisions.“It is important to consider all the information from the authorities, but it’s also important not to panic.“Those who have to take decisions, like happened in Switzerland, will take decisions and then be able to move forward.“Someone said to me football can be an antidote to coronavirus. I wouldn’t go that far, but sometimes football is an antidote to many other illnesses like discrimination and racism, and this is a fight we need to fight all together.”UEFA president Aleksander Ceferin is confident this summer’s Euro 2020 finals will also go ahead as planned.He said: “Let’s try to be optimistic and not think about dark scenarios. There’s time for that later.”UEFA general secretary Theodore Theodoridis added: “We have been working on detailed scenarios, and don’t forget – the Euros starts in June.“We have plenty of matches in the next couple of weeks, so there are different scenarios which we are not allowed to share further details of right now. But I assure you that yes, there are plans for everything.“We do not want to start speculating at this stage. We want to take it very seriously, case by case, involving the different stakeholders. We do not want to start speculating on what may happen in three or four months’ time.”However, the Scottish Football Association has confirmed that national team manager Steve Clarke did not travel to the Nations League draw in Amsterdam on Tuesday evening because of the outbreak.Scotland are scheduled to face Israel in a Euro 2020 play-off semi-final at Hampden Park on March 26 and SFA chief executive Ian Maxwell said: “It was our suggestion for Steve not to come to the draw.“What’s the point of him travelling through four different airports and risking exposing himself? He’s the key man. If something happens to a player or someone in the administration then someone else can step into their shoes.”Scottish football’s coronavirus response group has also told players and match officials not to shake hands before and after matches.In England, the PA news agency understands that government advice has been for the Football Association to continue as usual, although contingency plans have been looked at.According to a YouGov survey conducted over the weekend, 36 per cent of people believe that the government should cancel large sporting events, concerts or other large events to contain the coronavirus.In tennis, the ATP has cancelled a Challenger Tour event which was due to take place in China in April and postponed a further four events, three in South Korea and another in Spain.A wheelchair rugby test event which was due to take place between March 12 and 15 has been called off by the Japan Para Sports Association.Six people connected with cycling’s cancelled UAE Tour have tested positive for the coronavirus, heath officials in the United Arab Emirates announced.Motorsport has also been hit with three members of the Renault Sport Academy – F2 driver Christian Lundgaard, Caio Collet and 16-year-old Hadrien David – continuing winter training at their hotel in Tenerife after they and academy director Mia Sharizman were held in quarantine following a positive coronavirus diagnosis for another guest.The sport’s governing body, the FIA, says it is “closely monitoring the evolving situation” regarding the virus, with organisers of next month’s London Marathon also keeping an eye on developments.The Coppa Italia semi-final between Juventus and AC Milan, which had been scheduled for Wednesday evening, has been postponed as the coronavirus continued to disrupt Italian fixtures.Juventus said the game had been postponed to a date yet to be confirmed “after taking action from the order of the Prefecture of Turin” following a meeting on Tuesday.PA contributed to this reportLive Rugby union coverage direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Several key partners have also withdrawn from the project, including Mastercard, PayPal, Stripe and Visa.Created with Sketch.Facebook birthday: 15 defining moments for the social network Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.On 4 Feb, 2004, 19-year-old Harvard student Mark Zuckerberg launched a website called \u0027TheFacebook\u0027 from his dorm.

So that\u0027s something that\u0027s already being considered.David Marcus, who heads the organisation that oversees Libra\u0027s development, outlined what such a system might look like.We could have a series of stablecoins: a dollar stablecoin, a euro stablecoin, a sterling pound stable coin, etc., Mr Marcus told a banking seminar in October.We could definitely approach this with having a multitude of stablecoins that represent national currencies in a tokenised digital form...

For this reason, his son is accompanying the band on their reunion tour.Created with Sketch.18 of the greatest gigs ever – according to our critics Show all 18Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The long gone Rainbow in London’s Finsbury Park was one of the great rock venues, and though I was young at the time it would be impossible to forget the impact of Bowie in one of his first outings as Ziggy Stardust. “They haven’t even finished building the stage,” I said with breathtaking naievety to the person next to me, on observing the scaffolding and ladder. Of course, it was all part of the Ziggy theatrics, a show that began with DavidZiggy walking out to the drums of “Five Years” and continued with mime, flamboyance and songs that have all become classics. I remember his appearance being heralded by music from Beethoven’s Ninth (also used in A Clockwork Orange, the film being current at the time). In those years Bowie always used it as his theme music. I also remember being blown away by the support act – a fresh, imaginative outfit called Roxy Music. (David Lister)Truly charismatic performers leave an indelible impression and I marvelled at the way Chuck Berry had the crowd in the palm of his hand when I saw him in the 1970s. But few could match Dolly Parton in her prime for her larger-than-life enthusiasm and sheer sense of fun. When the country superstar came to London’s Dominion Theatre in 1983, she played some mean finger-picking banjo, sang beautifully, especially on an a capella version of “Do I Ever Cross Your Mind?” and even did an Elvis impression. Her concert was filmed for a video release and about half an hour after the crowd had left in, they brought in a large group of young punks and Goths (to intercut into crowd shots) and suggest an edgy young following. Happily, I had stayed around and saw her deliver this impromptu extra set, which was full of risqué jokes and blue banter. There’s no one quite like her. (Martin Chilton)You don’t usually realise you’re present at what will become a moment in history. But that sunny July afternoon at Wembley Stadium felt special right from the off, even if the off was Status Quo doing “Rockin’ All Over The World”. There were numerous stand-out moments perhaps on paper the biggest was the return of Paul McCartney, topping the bill after nearly five years self-enforced absence from high-profile performing following the shooting of John Lennon. Somewhat sadly the sound failed for part of “Let It Be”, but we can draw a veil over that. The most stunning set of the day came from Queen: a high energy medley through “Bohemian Rhapsody” and “Radio Ga Ga” to “We Will Rock You” and “We Are The Champions”. No one fired up the crowd quite as much that day. And since the band had not been at their most visible around that time, this proved to be their resurrection. (David Lister)Blues titan BB King released two of the greatest concert albums of the 20th-century in Live at the Regal (1964) and Live in Cook County Jail (1971). Even though he was 60 when I saw him at London’s Hammersmith Odeon in 1985, he was still full of energy. He sang with passion and his guitar work was transcendent, especially on gloriously funky version of “The Thrill is Gone”. I skipped my graduation ceremony for the concert and had the good fortune to bump into an old family friend called Ray Bolden, who had worked at Dobell\u0027s Record Shop in Charing Cross Road. King\u0027s face lit up to see Ray, who had put him up in his London flat in the 1950s. The blues superstar could not have been friendlier, despite his tiredness after a long gig. Seeing Muddy Waters live in 1979 was special but BB King at full power, bending guitar notes like no one else, topped even that. (Martin Chilton)When The Jesus \u0026amp Mary Chain reached the status of noisenik godheads with their fourth album Honey’s Dead in 1992, they decided to put together a visceral modern rock revue tour called Rollercoaster that’s still ringing in my ears almost 30 years on. Of the three revolving support acts, Blur opened the night, mid-transformation from baggy latecomers to art-pop pioneers. With Damon Albarn flinging himself wildly around the stage and clambering up amp stacks, they premiered ferocious second-album character studies like “Colin Zeal” while screening films of the journey of meat from slaughterhouse to defecation, in reverse. Most crucially, with their all-horns-blazing new single “Popscene”, they kick-started Britpop right before our eyes. The Mary Chain, meanwhile, were at peak malicious, I left with my skull buzzing, my eyes opened and my tastes re-arranged, convinced I\u0027d seen the new music, and I had. A gig that didn’t just make my night, it made me. (Mark Beaumont)When Pixies came onto a London stage on my birthday in 2004 and played Pixies songs – and music just doesn’t get better than that – it was pure relief, euphoria and dark-hearted epiphany. “Tame” sent me feral, “Gigantic” was titanic, “Bone Machine” crushed out my marrow. Black Francis snarled, barked and ranted through “Gouge Away”, “Monkey Gone To Heaven” and “Debaser”, every bit the demented pervert preacher he ever was Kim Deal’s angelic coos and bass melodies made an unholy pact with Joey Santiago’s werewolf guitar riffs, seemingly played with a plectrum made of Satan’s fingernail. Of their four Brixton dates that week, I lost every ounce of my s*** at three. Best gigs ever, no particular order.North London’s tiny and now-defunct, Buffalo Bar in the 2000s, hosted early gigs from the likes of Bloc Party, The Libertines, The Maccabees – or Foals. Their show took place 14 months before the release of their debut album Antidotes, and it justified their precocious reputation as a live act. That night, the energy of their high-octane math-rock was infectious it’s not often that you see a band in their earliest days and know that this is probably the last time you’ll be able to reach out and touch them. The songs followed: The French Open, Balloons, Hummer”, “Mathletics”, all fuelled by astoundingly complex polyrhythms, interweaving staccato synths and guitar played high on the fretboard in angular electro harmonies, set to punk-disco techno beats and urgent new wave vocals. I’d never seen a rock gig so precisely engineered (a sticker on the synth read Math is for Everyone), yet so exhilarating. There was a true sense we’d discovered something great. (Elisa Bray)Problematic in every way given singer Alice Glass’s October 2017 statement accusing her former bandmate Ethan Kath of sexual abuse, non-consensual sex and controlling behaviour, but this short set in front of a small crowd in a Camden bar was proof that when a performer truly plugs into the mother lode, the intensity they generate can burn itself into your retinas and shake your soul. Glass was 19 years old, and for most of the set just a blur of spectral movement frozen into violent shapes by an almost incessant strobe singing, shouting and screaming her way through songs such as “Courtship Dating”. The result was a reminder that whenever one of your heroes gets on stage to try to channel that primal essence of “rock ’n’ roll” – or whatever the hell it is – most of the time, they’re just trying to find an echo of something that once flowed through them. That can go on for 50 years or more. There’s sadness now in the memory, but on this day in April 2008, Glass had it. (Chris Harvey)918 Nick Cave \u0026amp the Bad Seeds, Brighton Centre, 2008It used to be that rock’n’roll was a young person’s game anyone over the age of 50 still tearing it up on stage needed to calm down and have a word with themselves. Nick Cave, the latter-day harbinger of the apocalypse still identifiable by his raven hair and pallbearer’s suit, has consistently shown us the idiocy of this thinking. I’ve seen Cave perform scores of times and he has never let me down, but this show, which coincided with the release of the album Dig!!! Lazarus Dig!!!, was a whole new level of spectacular: funny, furious, life-affirming, heavy on the biblical melodrama. Alongside the Bad Seeds, then operating as a seven-piece coolly attired in suits, open-necked shirts and slicked-back hair, Cave showed how musical talent can deepen rather than ebb in mid-life, and how he was – and indeed remains – untouchable in terms of intellect, charisma and sheer feral energy. (Fiona Sturges)Leonard Cohen steps onto the stage, dressed in grey shirt and tie, black waistcoat, trilby concealing his white hair. It\u0027s sweltering. And yet Cohen, in his mid Seventies, is barely breaking into a sweat. Much like his attire, the songs - such as Dance Me to the End of Love and So Long, Marianne – are immaculate, his voice no longer a wail but a raw, rumbling baritone. The Spanish sun is beating down and my friends and I are genuflecting before one of the greatest lyricists of all time. This was to be the only time I saw him live and no performance has ever, in terms of pure emotional intensity, targeted me with such laser-guided precision as his rendition of Hallelujah. The song\u0027s been covered by everyone from Jeff Buckley to Alexandra Burke, but sung by him that day, it\u0027s surely never felt as moving. (Patrick Smith)The great Sixties and Seventies soul singers are nearly all gone now, and I doubt we’ll ever see their like again. Bobby Womack had recovered from colon cancer but was in the early stages of Alzheimer’s Disease, and less than a year from his death in June 2014, when he played the UK in the summer of 2013. He came on stage on a sunny Saturday afternoon at the Latitude festival, to play songs from his brilliant comeback album, The Bravest Man in the Universe, to a basking, picnicking audience. “All soul singers come from gospel,” he told them. Womack’s voice still seemed like a gift from God. The years of cocaine addiction hadn’t altered its richness and warmth. To be in the presence of Womack that day, knowing it would likely be the last time, was very special.1218 St Vincent, End of the Road, 2014Most rockstars, terrified of seeming to be trying too hard, would never dream of hiring a choreographer. But St Vincent, AKA Annie Clark, is no ordinary rockstar. For her Digital Witness tour, the musician recruited Annie B Carson to help her dream up a procession of strange, shuffling moves to perform alongside her brilliant self-titled fourth album. At End of the Road Festival – a small, Dorset delight which she had played with David Byrne a year earlier – her headline set was scuzzy, eccentric, and thrilling. At one point, without missing a lick on her guitar, she rolled herself down an oversized flight of white stairs like a glitching robot. Then again, no robot can play guitar like that. (Alexandra Pollard)After 35 years away from the stage it was a moment Kate Bush fans never thought would happen. Beforehand, I was reporting from outside the venue for NME and the excitement and energy was extraordinary, like nothing I\u0027ve ever experienced. One woman told me it would be fine if she died after the gig because she would die happy. The show started with a greatest hits section. And then it all got a bit more, well, Kate Bush, with a dramatic adaptation of The Ninth Wave. Sinking ships, confetti cannons, surreal fish people and a soliloquy about sausages. Act three was more pastoral. The second side of Aerial, The Sky of Honey, was performed in front of the most beautiful visuals I\u0027ve ever seen: birds, a red sun, a moon tilting on its axis and then Kate suspended into the air. Pure theatre. As we filed out, there was a sense that the audience was stunned. I still am. (Lucy Jones)Patti Smith was celebrating the 40th anniversary of her seminal 1975 album Horses at Field Day in Victoria Park, London, 2015. The sky was a perfect blue, and the sun was still blazing hot at 7pm. “I’m sorry about the dark glasses,” Smith said by way of introduction. “I’m not trying to be cool, it’s just, you know… the sun.” “You’re the f***ing coolest!” a fan screamed back. From there, she and her band, including long-serving guitarist Lenny Kaye, embarked on a blistering set that had myself, and many other audience members, in tears. Smith is a ferocious performer, she spat and snarled and howled tearing up her guitar as though it just insulted one of her favourite poets. It didn’t matter if she messed up, as she did on “Break it Up”, because she offered the instantly immortal words: “I don’t do nothing perfect. I only f*** up perfect.” You felt you were in the presence of something momentous. (Roisin O’Connor)When D’Angelo released his surprise third record – the politically fraught Black Messiah – it ended the 14-year hiatus that followed 2000’s Voodoo. It also reminded music fans that the American hip-hop artist was still as monumentally talented as he was back then. Accompanied by his eight-strong band The Vanguard, his show at the Hammersmith Apollo was a visceral, quasi-religious experience. Jesse Johnson, formerly of Prince-produced outfit The Time, added funky hooks to “Sugah Daddy”, while legendary bassist Pino Palladino took time out from The Who\u0027s live shows to join in the fun. At one point D’Angelo led a classic James Brown funk staple, holding three fingers in the air so the band could respond with three loud vamps. One encore was followed by a second that broke the curfew with free abandon, until D’Angelo was left on stage alone, reflective and blissful. It inspired a ine kind of worship, for a show that was appropriately titled The Second Coming. (Roisin O’Connor)A week before she played Brighton, I reviewed Lorde’s Alexandra Palace show in London. It was a five-star performance – the New Zealand musician exorcised the pain of the break-up she\u0027d chronicled on her brilliant second album Melodrama, twitching and twirling as an abstract house party played out in glass boxes around her. The stage design was so good, in fact, that Kanye West may or may not have nicked it a year later. Seeing her in Brighton the following week, without a notepad in my hand, I saw even more clearly all the intimate nuances of her performance – and was free to give in entirely to the exhilarating, heartbreaking melodrama of it all. (Alexandra Pollard)When you’ve been going to gigs for decades, you tend not to expect anything new, just variations – some mind-blowing, others not – on what you have seen before. So when I saw David Byrne’s American Utopia show, it felt like stumbling on the Ark of the Covenant. Here was a man who had been working in music for 40 years completely redrawing the rules of pop performance – no drum riser, no cables, no visible amps or microphones – and taking it deep into the territory of experimental theatre. In opposition to the usual freeform live music set-up, this tour was the result of fastidious planning, with everything rehearsed to the last nanosecond. And yet, forever on the move, dressed in matching grey suits and dancing barefoot in formation, Byrne and his 12-piece band were loose-limbed, unfettered and joyous to watch. And the music was pretty great too. (Fiona Sturges)1818 Christine and the Queens, Hammersmith Apollo, 2018Before her short run at Hammersmith Apollo last year, Héloïse Letissier – known as Christine and the Queens, though she dropped all but the Chris for her second album – tweeted: “I think we finally have some surprises for those who come to the shows!” She delivered on that promise – falling snow and sand, and a balcony homage to Romeo and Juliet – as she redefined what a pop show could be. With a gender-fluid cohort of athletic dancers, she brought to theatrical life her tumultuous journey towards embracing her pansexual identity, and finding liberation. And we went through all those emotions with her, those alternately tender and powerful vocals never faltering despite the restless dance routines. Everyone was on their feet dancing, and her declaration of inclusivity could not have been more empowering: “Vive everyone!” We left thrilled and elated. (Elisa Bray)The long gone Rainbow in London’s Finsbury Park was one of the great rock venues, and though I was young at the time it would be impossible to forget the impact of Bowie in one of his first outings as Ziggy Stardust. “They haven’t even finished building the stage,” I said with breathtaking naievety to the person next to me, on observing the scaffolding and ladder.

But that sunny July afternoon at Wembley Stadium felt special right from the off, even if the off was Status Quo doing “Rockin’ All Over The World”. There were numerous stand-out moments perhaps on paper the biggest was the return of Paul McCartney, topping the bill after nearly five years self-enforced absence from high-profile performing following the shooting of John Lennon. Somewhat sadly the sound failed for part of “Let It Be”, but we can draw a veil over that. The most stunning set of the day came from Queen: a high energy medley through “Bohemian Rhapsody” and “Radio Ga Ga” to “We Will Rock You” and “We Are The Champions”. No one fired up the crowd quite as much that day. And since the band had not been at their most visible around that time, this proved to be their resurrection. (David Lister)Blues titan BB King released two of the greatest concert albums of the 20th-century in Live at the Regal (1964) and Live in Cook County Jail (1971). Even though he was 60 when I saw him at London’s Hammersmith Odeon in 1985, he was still full of energy. He sang with passion and his guitar work was transcendent, especially on gloriously funky version of “The Thrill is Gone”. I skipped my graduation ceremony for the concert and had the good fortune to bump into an old family friend called Ray Bolden, who had worked at Dobell\u0027s Record Shop in Charing Cross Road. King\u0027s face lit up to see Ray, who had put him up in his London flat in the 1950s. The blues superstar could not have been friendlier, despite his tiredness after a long gig. Seeing Muddy Waters live in 1979 was special but BB King at full power, bending guitar notes like no one else, topped even that. (Martin Chilton)When The Jesus \u0026amp Mary Chain reached the status of noisenik godheads with their fourth album Honey’s Dead in 1992, they decided to put together a visceral modern rock revue tour called Rollercoaster that’s still ringing in my ears almost 30 years on. Of the three revolving support acts, Blur opened the night, mid-transformation from baggy latecomers to art-pop pioneers. With Damon Albarn flinging himself wildly around the stage and clambering up amp stacks, they premiered ferocious second-album character studies like “Colin Zeal” while screening films of the journey of meat from slaughterhouse to defecation, in reverse. Most crucially, with their all-horns-blazing new single “Popscene”, they kick-started Britpop right before our eyes. The Mary Chain, meanwhile, were at peak malicious, I left with my skull buzzing, my eyes opened and my tastes re-arranged, convinced I\u0027d seen the new music, and I had. A gig that didn’t just make my night, it made me. (Mark Beaumont)When Pixies came onto a London stage on my birthday in 2004 and played Pixies songs – and music just doesn’t get better than that – it was pure relief, euphoria and dark-hearted epiphany. “Tame” sent me feral, “Gigantic” was titanic, “Bone Machine” crushed out my marrow. Black Francis snarled, barked and ranted through “Gouge Away”, “Monkey Gone To Heaven” and “Debaser”, every bit the demented pervert preacher he ever was Kim Deal’s angelic coos and bass melodies made an unholy pact with Joey Santiago’s werewolf guitar riffs, seemingly played with a plectrum made of Satan’s fingernail. Of their four Brixton dates that week, I lost every ounce of my s*** at three. Best gigs ever, no particular order.North London’s tiny and now-defunct, Buffalo Bar in the 2000s, hosted early gigs from the likes of Bloc Party, The Libertines, The Maccabees – or Foals. Their show took place 14 months before the release of their debut album Antidotes, and it justified their precocious reputation as a live act. That night, the energy of their high-octane math-rock was infectious it’s not often that you see a band in their earliest days and know that this is probably the last time you’ll be able to reach out and touch them. The songs followed: The French Open, Balloons, Hummer”, “Mathletics”, all fuelled by astoundingly complex polyrhythms, interweaving staccato synths and guitar played high on the fretboard in angular electro harmonies, set to punk-disco techno beats and urgent new wave vocals. I’d never seen a rock gig so precisely engineered (a sticker on the synth read Math is for Everyone), yet so exhilarating. There was a true sense we’d discovered something great. (Elisa Bray)Problematic in every way given singer Alice Glass’s October 2017 statement accusing her former bandmate Ethan Kath of sexual abuse, non-consensual sex and controlling behaviour, but this short set in front of a small crowd in a Camden bar was proof that when a performer truly plugs into the mother lode, the intensity they generate can burn itself into your retinas and shake your soul. Glass was 19 years old, and for most of the set just a blur of spectral movement frozen into violent shapes by an almost incessant strobe singing, shouting and screaming her way through songs such as “Courtship Dating”. The result was a reminder that whenever one of your heroes gets on stage to try to channel that primal essence of “rock ’n’ roll” – or whatever the hell it is – most of the time, they’re just trying to find an echo of something that once flowed through them. That can go on for 50 years or more. There’s sadness now in the memory, but on this day in April 2008, Glass had it. (Chris Harvey)918 Nick Cave \u0026amp the Bad Seeds, Brighton Centre, 2008It used to be that rock’n’roll was a young person’s game anyone over the age of 50 still tearing it up on stage needed to calm down and have a word with themselves. Nick Cave, the latter-day harbinger of the apocalypse still identifiable by his raven hair and pallbearer’s suit, has consistently shown us the idiocy of this thinking. I’ve seen Cave perform scores of times and he has never let me down, but this show, which coincided with the release of the album Dig!!! Lazarus Dig!!!, was a whole new level of spectacular: funny, furious, life-affirming, heavy on the biblical melodrama. Alongside the Bad Seeds, then operating as a seven-piece coolly attired in suits, open-necked shirts and slicked-back hair, Cave showed how musical talent can deepen rather than ebb in mid-life, and how he was – and indeed remains – untouchable in terms of intellect, charisma and sheer feral energy. (Fiona Sturges)Leonard Cohen steps onto the stage, dressed in grey shirt and tie, black waistcoat, trilby concealing his white hair. It\u0027s sweltering. And yet Cohen, in his mid Seventies, is barely breaking into a sweat. Much like his attire, the songs - such as Dance Me to the End of Love and So Long, Marianne – are immaculate, his voice no longer a wail but a raw, rumbling baritone. The Spanish sun is beating down and my friends and I are genuflecting before one of the greatest lyricists of all time. This was to be the only time I saw him live and no performance has ever, in terms of pure emotional intensity, targeted me with such laser-guided precision as his rendition of Hallelujah. The song\u0027s been covered by everyone from Jeff Buckley to Alexandra Burke, but sung by him that day, it\u0027s surely never felt as moving. (Patrick Smith)The great Sixties and Seventies soul singers are nearly all gone now, and I doubt we’ll ever see their like again. Bobby Womack had recovered from colon cancer but was in the early stages of Alzheimer’s Disease, and less than a year from his death in June 2014, when he played the UK in the summer of 2013. He came on stage on a sunny Saturday afternoon at the Latitude festival, to play songs from his brilliant comeback album, The Bravest Man in the Universe, to a basking, picnicking audience. “All soul singers come from gospel,” he told them. Womack’s voice still seemed like a gift from God. The years of cocaine addiction hadn’t altered its richness and warmth. To be in the presence of Womack that day, knowing it would likely be the last time, was very special.1218 St Vincent, End of the Road, 2014Most rockstars, terrified of seeming to be trying too hard, would never dream of hiring a choreographer. But St Vincent, AKA Annie Clark, is no ordinary rockstar. For her Digital Witness tour, the musician recruited Annie B Carson to help her dream up a procession of strange, shuffling moves to perform alongside her brilliant self-titled fourth album. At End of the Road Festival – a small, Dorset delight which she had played with David Byrne a year earlier – her headline set was scuzzy, eccentric, and thrilling. At one point, without missing a lick on her guitar, she rolled herself down an oversized flight of white stairs like a glitching robot. Then again, no robot can play guitar like that. (Alexandra Pollard)After 35 years away from the stage it was a moment Kate Bush fans never thought would happen. Beforehand, I was reporting from outside the venue for NME and the excitement and energy was extraordinary, like nothing I\u0027ve ever experienced. One woman told me it would be fine if she died after the gig because she would die happy. The show started with a greatest hits section. And then it all got a bit more, well, Kate Bush, with a dramatic adaptation of The Ninth Wave. Sinking ships, confetti cannons, surreal fish people and a soliloquy about sausages. Act three was more pastoral. The second side of Aerial, The Sky of Honey, was performed in front of the most beautiful visuals I\u0027ve ever seen: birds, a red sun, a moon tilting on its axis and then Kate suspended into the air. Pure theatre. As we filed out, there was a sense that the audience was stunned. I still am. (Lucy Jones)Patti Smith was celebrating the 40th anniversary of her seminal 1975 album Horses at Field Day in Victoria Park, London, 2015. The sky was a perfect blue, and the sun was still blazing hot at 7pm. “I’m sorry about the dark glasses,” Smith said by way of introduction. “I’m not trying to be cool, it’s just, you know… the sun.” “You’re the f***ing coolest!” a fan screamed back. From there, she and her band, including long-serving guitarist Lenny Kaye, embarked on a blistering set that had myself, and many other audience members, in tears. Smith is a ferocious performer, she spat and snarled and howled tearing up her guitar as though it just insulted one of her favourite poets. It didn’t matter if she messed up, as she did on “Break it Up”, because she offered the instantly immortal words: “I don’t do nothing perfect. I only f*** up perfect.” You felt you were in the presence of something momentous. (Roisin O’Connor)When D’Angelo released his surprise third record – the politically fraught Black Messiah – it ended the 14-year hiatus that followed 2000’s Voodoo. It also reminded music fans that the American hip-hop artist was still as monumentally talented as he was back then. Accompanied by his eight-strong band The Vanguard, his show at the Hammersmith Apollo was a visceral, quasi-religious experience. Jesse Johnson, formerly of Prince-produced outfit The Time, added funky hooks to “Sugah Daddy”, while legendary bassist Pino Palladino took time out from The Who\u0027s live shows to join in the fun. At one point D’Angelo led a classic James Brown funk staple, holding three fingers in the air so the band could respond with three loud vamps. One encore was followed by a second that broke the curfew with free abandon, until D’Angelo was left on stage alone, reflective and blissful. It inspired a ine kind of worship, for a show that was appropriately titled The Second Coming. (Roisin O’Connor)A week before she played Brighton, I reviewed Lorde’s Alexandra Palace show in London. It was a five-star performance – the New Zealand musician exorcised the pain of the break-up she\u0027d chronicled on her brilliant second album Melodrama, twitching and twirling as an abstract house party played out in glass boxes around her. The stage design was so good, in fact, that Kanye West may or may not have nicked it a year later. Seeing her in Brighton the following week, without a notepad in my hand, I saw even more clearly all the intimate nuances of her performance – and was free to give in entirely to the exhilarating, heartbreaking melodrama of it all. (Alexandra Pollard)When you’ve been going to gigs for decades, you tend not to expect anything new, just variations – some mind-blowing, others not – on what you have seen before. So when I saw David Byrne’s American Utopia show, it felt like stumbling on the Ark of the Covenant. Here was a man who had been working in music for 40 years completely redrawing the rules of pop performance – no drum riser, no cables, no visible amps or microphones – and taking it deep into the territory of experimental theatre. In opposition to the usual freeform live music set-up, this tour was the result of fastidious planning, with everything rehearsed to the last nanosecond. And yet, forever on the move, dressed in matching grey suits and dancing barefoot in formation, Byrne and his 12-piece band were loose-limbed, unfettered and joyous to watch. And the music was pretty great too. (Fiona Sturges)1818 Christine and the Queens, Hammersmith Apollo, 2018Before her short run at Hammersmith Apollo last year, Héloïse Letissier – known as Christine and the Queens, though she dropped all but the Chris for her second album – tweeted: “I think we finally have some surprises for those who come to the shows!” She delivered on that promise – falling snow and sand, and a balcony homage to Romeo and Juliet – as she redefined what a pop show could be. With a gender-fluid cohort of athletic dancers, she brought to theatrical life her tumultuous journey towards embracing her pansexual identity, and finding liberation. And we went through all those emotions with her, those alternately tender and powerful vocals never faltering despite the restless dance routines. Everyone was on their feet dancing, and her declaration of inclusivity could not have been more empowering: “Vive everyone!” We left thrilled and elated. (Elisa Bray)Peter Gabriel, a founding member of the group who left in 1975, will not be participating.“I’m looking forward to doing it,” said Rutherford. “I worked it out and we’ve only done two shows in the UK in the last 28 years, so we haven’t over-worked it.”Tickets will be on general sale at\u0026nbsp9am on Friday 6 March\u0026nbspfrom\u0026nbspwww.LiveNation\u0026nbspand\u0026nbspwww.ticketmaster.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It could not find an explanation for the circular crater that surrounds the hole – or a proper estimate of just how far the underlying cavern might extend.Holes such as this are of particular interest because their interior caves are relatively protected from the harsh surface of Mars, making them relatively good candidates to contain Martian life, Nasa wrote on its Astronomy Picture of the Day page, where it shared the image this week.Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s groundbreaking decade of space exploration: In pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Mystic Mountain, a pillar of gas and dust standing at three-light-years tall, bursting with jets of gas flom fledgling stars buried within, was captured by Nasa\u0027s Hubble Space Telelscope in February 2010The first ever selfie taken on an alien planet, captured by Nasa\u0027s Curiosity Rover in the early days of its mission to explore Mars in 2012Death of a star: This image from Nasa\u0027s Chandra X-ray telescope shows the supernova of Tycho, a star in our Milky Way galaxyArrokoth, the most distant object ever explored, pictured here on 1 January 2019 by a camera on Nasa\u0027s New Horizons spaceraft at a distance of 4.1 billion miles from EarthAn image of the Large Magellanic Cloud galaxy seen in infrared light by the Herschel Space Observatory in January 2012.

But why can’t we find it?Scientists are sure it exists because without the extra matter the movements and gravitational interactions of galaxies and stars make no sense.\u0026nbspBut despite decades of study and numerous different theories and tests to find its origin, it has remained a shadowy enigma.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesNow, nuclear physicists at the University of York have identified an “exciting” new particle which they are putting forward as a candidate to explain the formation of dark matter.They have named the new particle the “d-star hexaquark”.Created with Sketch.Science Photographer of the Year shortlist  Show all 9Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.19 Soap bubble structures showing light interference colours and patterningBubbles want to optimise space and minimise their surface area for a given volume of air.

This new result is particularly exciting since it doesn’t require any concepts that are new to physics.”Co-author of the paper Dr Bashkanov said: “The next step to establish this new dark matter candidate will be to obtain a better understanding of how the d-stars interact: when do they attract and when do they repel each other?“We are leading new measurements to create d-stars inside an atomic nucleus and see if their properties are different to when they are in free space.”The research team at York will now collaborate with scientists in Germany and the US to test their theory of dark matter and search for d-star hexaquarks in the cosmos.A New Possibility for Light-Quark Dark Matter is published in the Journal of Physics G Letters.University of York\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

But her statement carried by state media, the first in kind, indicated her political status has been further elevated.In the statement, she criticised South Korea’s presidential office of Blue House for expressing strong concerns over the North’s firing drills and urging it to stop such an act that doesn’t contribute to efforts to reduce military animosities.Sharing the full story, not just the headlines“As far as I know, the Southside is also fond of joint military exercises and it is preoccupied with all the disgusting acts like purchasing ultra-modern military hardware,” Kim Yo Jong said. “They meant they need to get militarily prepared but we should be discouraged from military exercises. Such a gangster-like assertion can never be expected from those with a normal way of thinking.”Describing the Blue House as “a mere child” and “a burnt child dreading fire”, she went on to say that: “How can all its words and acts be so perfectly foolish in detail.”Coronavirus: Fear and anger in South Korea as president and secretive South Korea on ‘red alert’ as sixth person dies from coronavirusTrump’s birthday wishes for Kim Jong-un insufficient, Pyongyang saysTrump insists Kim Jong-un is ‘man of his word’Kim Yo Jong still didn’t mention by name liberal South Korean President Moon Jae-in, whom she met several times. She only said: “The South side’s response is so regretful and disappointing but it is somewhat fortunate that it was not direct statement of the president.”Earlier Tuesday, state media said Kim Jong Un supervised a live-fire rocket artillery exercise in an apparent reference to the two short-range ballistic missile launches reported by South Korea’s military a day earlier. On Saturday, North Korea said Kim Jong Un also guided an artillery drill aimed at testing the combat readiness of military units.The back-to-back firing exercises were an apparent show of force by Kim, who had earlier vowed to bolster his nuclear deterrent and warned of “shocking action” over now-stalled nuclear negotiations with Trump. The latest firing drills were his first weapons tests since late November.Kim Yo Jong’s statement was issued in her capacity as a first vice-department director of the Workers Party’s Central Committee. She also serves as an alternate member of the North’s powerful Politburo and a member of the rubber-stamp parliament. South Korean officials and experts say she’s virtually the North’s top propaganda official.Coronavirus apps let people avoid high-risk locations in South KoreaKim Yo Jong’s statement “suggests that her status and influence have been expanded to such an extent as to express her opinions externally and beyond playing a role of assisting Chairman Kim Jong Un on his public activities,” said analyst Cheong Seong-Chang at South Korea’s private Sejong Institute.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Her proximity to her brother during the summit sparked outside speculation that she may be the No. 2 in the North after her brother executed and purged potential rivals who could pose a threat to his family’s rule.Earlier in 2018, she came to South Korea to attend the opening ceremony of the\u0026nbspPyeongchang Winter Olympics, becoming the first member of the North’s ruling family to visit the South since the end of the 1950-53 Korean War. At the time, she met Moon and conveyed her brother’s invitation to meet in Pyongyang.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Hook, line, and sinker, I guess. He did it.”Mr Adigrati said the thief probably did not know the value of the necklace.“This particular necklace looks a lot more expensive than what it is, so obviously the temptation was there: gold, bright, iconic Medusa head, so that would have been the temptation,” he told ABC News.Police are appealing for more information on the man, who has yet to be identified. He is described as white, aged between 40 to 50 years old and about 5ft 9in.The thief left just one clue behind – the hook from his fishing line.Senior constable Bede Whitty said he had never seen a crime quite like it before.“It’s fairly blatant and it’s quite bold as well, to have someone attend with a fishing rod in the middle of the night,” he said.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

We will not allow you to surrender on our future.Thunberg says young climate activists to ‘be the adults in the room’The high-profile 17-year old\u0026nbspSwedish activist, who has acted as a lightning rod of the climate movement, accused the EU nations of\u0026nbsppretending that you can be a climate leader while it continues building and subsidising new fossil fuel infrastructure.The EU has agreed a package of measures to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, the same as the UK\u0027s target. The UN\u0027s climate authority the IPCC says that globally, carbon emissions must be cut to net zero by 2050 in order to limit global warming to 1.5C.While global warming of 1.5C will still have significant negative effects, the effects are less pronounced than if warming reached 2.0C. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) says.Some countries have decided to go to net zero faster Finland has said it will achieve the target by 2035.The less ambitious 2050 target is controversial for developed countries like EU member states because under the Paris climate agreement, richer countries are expected to take the lead in decarbonising their economies.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

We need to start cutting carbon emissions drastically at the source, now. Your distant targets will mean nothing is high emissions continue for business as usual even for just a few more years, because that will use up our remaining carbon budget before you have the chance to even deliver on your 2030 goals.When your house is on fire you don\u0027t wait a few more years to start putting it out. And yet, this is what the Commission are proposing today, Ms Thunberg said, following a meeting with Commission president Ursula von der Leyen earlier in the day.When the EU presents this climate law and net zero by 2050 you indirectly admit surrender: that you are giving up on the Paris agreement, giving up on your promises and giving up on doing everything that you possibly can to ensure a safe future for your children.The activist added: Such a law sends a strong signal that real sufficient action is taking place when in fact it is not. The hard truth is that neither the awareness not politics needed are in sight. We are still in a crisis that has never once been treated for a crisis.Created with Sketch.Climate change: Decade\u0027s defining issue in pictures Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.In this decade, humans have become ever more aware of climate change.

The visit coincides with the European Commission\u0027s adoption of the EU\u0027s new climate law.President of the Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, said: “We are acting today to make the EU the world’s first climate neutral economic bloc by 2050. The Climate Law is the legal translation of our political commitment, and sets us irreversibly on the path to a more sustainable future. It is the heart of the European Green Deal.”Executive Vice-President for the European Green Deal, Frans Timmermans, added: “We are turning words into action today, to show our European citizens that we are serious about reaching net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.

The Department for Transport is set to announce plans to make a new fuel, blended with % bioethanol, the standard offering at pumps. The move, to be unveiled today, will cut carbon dioxide emissions by , tonnes a year, experts say. This is the equivalent of taking , cars off the road, as standard fuel currently available contains %. Bioethanol is a form of renewable energy which is produced using crops. However there is concern that around a million cars registered before  could be unable to use the new petrol without being damaged. Transport secretary Grant Shapps said: The next  years will be absolutely crucial for slashing emissions from our roads, as we all start to feel the benefits of the transition to a zero-emission future. But before electric cars become the norm, we want to take advantage of reduced CO emissions today. This small switch to petrol containing bioethanol at % will help drivers across country reduce the environmental impact of every journey. Overall this could equate to about , cars being taken off our roads entirely. Mr Shapps said the proposed new fuel was the latest in a series of steps to help the UK move towards a net zero future.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid Email Former US Vice President Joe Biden will wake up this morning as the unexpected victor of Super Tuesday.The  spectacularly geeky evening  saw  states - plus American Samoa - vote for which candidate they want to take on Donald Trump in the  US election.And not even an awkward moment where Joe appeared to mix up his we and his sister was enough to rain on his parade. It seems the apparent ability to give President Trump a proper fight was a key reason US Democrats voted for Joe. The early exit polls suggested the ability to defeat Trump was more of a factor in people’s decision than whether the person they voted for shared their views on the issues. That’s quite an extraordinary statement on how hated Donald Trump is in much of America. For all of the packed rallies and bluster about his being a man of the people, for the vast majority of his time in office Trump has enjoyed the worst approval ratings of any sitting President since records began. And in his only electoral test since he set up camp in the Oval Office, ’s midterm elections, he got a bruising. For America’s enormous middle-class, the choice is between an avuncular father-figure, who evokes feelings of warmth and safety despite occasionally forgetting to finish his sentences and a spiky, energeticfigure who promises a full on revolution. Elsewhere in the race, Elizabeth Warren, who seems perfectly competent, but only scraped third place in her own home state last night - remains on the ballot. But the  million Michael Bloomberg spent on advertising in the run up to Super Tuesday now looks like the biggest waste of money since the tuition fees at Trump University. At the time of writing the billionaire media mogul was “considering the future” of his campaign - and was determined not to be the guy who “helped Sanders become the nominee”. For now, presented with the risk of another four years of Donald Trump, it looks Democrats in Super Tuesday states have decided not to let the great be the enemy of the good. But there’s still a long way to go in the primary election - and it could still culminate in a bitter, messy floor-fight at the Democratic convention where the final winner will be decided.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailPriti Patel could be forced to give evidence under oath to an employment tribunal, it has emerged as a third shock bullying claim erupts against the Home Secretary. Ms Patel is now facing allegations of bullying from staff in three separate government departments - the Home Office, Department for Work and Pensions and Department for International Development. She denies bullying and allies have accused disturbing dark forces of trying to get her sacked. Claims began at the Home Office where her most senior civil servant, Sir Philip Rutnam, has resigned and vowed to sue for constructive dismissal. Then it emerged a DWP staffer, who allegedly took an overdose after being bullied by Ms Patel as Employment Minister, was given a £, payout. Last night the third claim emerged, this time at DFID when she was aid minister. Reported by the BBC, Sun and Times, it is claimed she repeatedly harassed and belittled her private secretary so badly that he signed off with stress. The senior staffer signed off after six months of alleged abuse and asked to be moved, The Sun said. The number and spread of allegations - all denied by Ms Patel - could prove decisive when a Cabinet Office inquiry seeks to establish whether the Cabinet minister broke the Ministerial Code on ethics. Last night it was confirmed Sir Philip - who refused a payout from the Home Office - has taken the first step towards bringing an employment tribunal. His union, the FDA, has lodged a formal complaint with the mediation service ACAS. Crucially, the legal papers name Ms Patel personally among the respondents to the case - meaningthe case proceeds to a tribunal, she could be called to give evidence under oath. If she refuses, and the tribunal judge decides she has relevant evidence to give, she could be issued with a witness order compelling her to attend the hearing. Failure to comply with a witness order, without a reasonable excuse, is a criminal offence. It is possible Ms Patel wouldnapost be asked to appear before a tribunal, but an ally of Sir Philip told the Mirror: Sheaposs a central protagonist in all this. Itaposs almost impossible to imagine this wouldnapost be the case. Last nightaposs claims allege Ms Patel bullied staff in her private office shortly before she was sacked as Secretary of State for International Development in  after she made an unauthorised trip to Israel. A senior member of that department is understood to have raised concerns of a raft of allegations to the Cabinet Office shortly after Ms Patel left her post in case she ed to government later, according to BBCaposs Newsnight. The programme described the nature of the accusations as similar to those already alleged to have happened in the Home Office and DWP - including humiliating civil servants in front of others.The PM has asked the Cabinet Office to “establish the facts” over allegations Ms Patel broke the ministerial code in her dealings with several officials. However, she has been defended by PM Boris Johnson and Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove . Labouraposs Diane Abbott called for the Tory minister to stand down while the probe is carried out.But a spokesperson for the Home Office told BBC Newsnight Ms Patel categorically rejects all of these allegations. A Tory source told the programme: What we are seeing is a concerted effort by certain sections of the Civil Service to undermine a Home Secretary trying to deliver what people want on crime and immigration. It is deeply disturbing that dark forces are trying to influence the findings of a Cabinet Office inquiry.

In a surprisingly strong showing, former vice-president Biden rolled to victories across the South, Midwest and New England on the biggest day of voting in the Democratic campaign. Sanders, who was way out in front coming into the crucial day of voting, was leading in the biggest race in Calornia at the time of publication, setting up a one-on-one battle for the Democratic presidential nomination. However Biden has secured the second-biggest state of Texas and is now the bookies favourite to go toe-to-toe with Donald Trump later this year. Last night Americans in  states were casting ballots to decide who should challenge Republican President Donald Trump in the November  general election. For those who have been knocked down, counted out, left behind, this is your campaign, said Biden. Barack Obamaaposs deputy had performed poorly in the first three nominating contests, but broke through with a win in South Carolina last week. We are very much alive, he told roaring supporters in Los Angeles. Sanders, the one-time front-runner who had hoped to take a big step toward the nomination on Tuesday, won Colorado, Utah and his home state of Vermont, Edison Research said. Fox News and AP projected Sanders won Calornia, whose  delegates represent the largest haul in the nominating contest. But Edison Research and other networks held off declaring a winner as results trickled in. With overwhelming support from African American, moderate and older voters, Biden swept to wins in Alabama, Arkansas, Massachusetts, Minnesota, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Tennessee and Virginia. Early on Wednesday Texas, the state ing the second number of delegates - who eventually chose the nominee - was declared for Biden. Maine remained too close to call however.  It was a spectacular turn of events for Biden, whose campaign was on le support after poor showings in Iowa and New Hampshire. Until a week ago he trailed Sanders in most state and national polls. Bidenaposs blowout win in South Carolina on Saturday provided a burst of new momentum, fueling a wave of endorsements from elected Democratic officials and former presidential rivals including Pete Buttigieg, a former mayor, and U.S. Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota .  The results also left Michael Bloomberg, the billionaire former New York mayor who spent more than half a billion dollars on advertising, largely out of the running. His only victory came in the US territory of American Samoa. Bloomberg campaign officials said he would reassess whether to stay in the race on Wednesday, but they said that did not mean he would drop out. Biden was hoping to stay within reach of Sanders in delegates, giving him a chance to catch up as the race moved on. But after Tuesday, Biden leads Sanders in delegates  to .  Without naming him, Sanders took direct aim at Biden during a rally with supporters in Vermont. He criticized his  vote to authorize the war in Iraq and his support for global trade deals that Sanders opposed. Weaposre going to win the Democratic nomination and we are going to defeat the most dangerous president in the history of this country, Sanders said. Biden repeated his strong performance with black voters in South Carolina on Saturday.  Edison Research exit polls showed Biden winning large majorities of African-American voters in the South. He also won strong support from older people, college graduates and those who considered themselves liberal or moderate. Sanders countered with a strong showing among Latinos, young people and white men, helping him to wins in the West. The results were disappointing for U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren, who finished well behind Sanders and Biden in most states and trailed them even in her home state of Massachusetts.  Bloomberg, who was on the ballot for the first time yesterday having entered the contest late, won some delegates, in Tennessee, Texas, Colorado, Utah, Calornia and Arkansas by picking up more than % of the vote. The billionaire skipped the first four contests and bombarded Super Tuesday and later voting states with ads. However, his poll numbers slipped after he came under fire during Democratic debates over past comments criticized as sexist. That effort gained fresh momentum on the eve of Tuesdayaposs voting as moderates Buttigieg and Klobuchar endorsed Biden after withdrawing from the race.

We have also helped him tweak his manners, he will now happily swap his toys for another or something equally as fun. Once he is comfortable with you, he is an absolute diamond.

He has such an affectionate side to him as well as a cheeky side to his personality which we just find very charming!” Diefer would like to live in an adult-only home with no other pets as he is choosy about the dogs he likes to interact with and doesn’t like sharing human affection.

On March , , Sergei and Yulia Skripal were poisoned with the deadly Novichok nerve agent, one of the deadliest chemical weapons ever made. He had been a former general in Russiaaposs miliatry intelligence but after he turned double agent, he was convicted in his mother country of spying for the UK. The nerve gas attack, which was smeared on his front door, bore a chilling resemblence to the fatal poisoning of former Russian spuy, Alexander Litvinenko in . Yulia had flown to the UK from her native Moscow to visit her father, a ex Russian military officer who was now a double agent for the UKaposs intelligence services. The following day they were both fighting for their lives in hospital. Sergei and Yulia had spent the morning at his home in Salisbury before driving into town and heading to the Bishops Mill pub for a drink. Father and daughter then enjoyed a lunch at Zizziaposs restaurant and took a stroll in a nearby park. They were found, unconscious, on a park bench and rushed to Salisbury District Hospital where medics battled to save the pair. Yulia was discharged on April  and transported to a secure location while her father was allowed out of hospital on May . A week after her father was discharged, a written not from Yulia was given to the press. In it, she said she was lucky to be alive, but insisted her recovery would be slow and dficult. Father and daughter were not the only ones to be seriously hurt by the deadly poison. Det Sgt Nick Bailey was one of the officers to search Sergeiaposs home. He was taken to hospital in a serious condition. Thankfully, he was discharged by March  but admitted in a poignant statement that normal le for me will probably never be the same. Det Sgt Bailey, who was wearing a forensic suit when he examined Sergeiaposs home, and his family lost everything in the aftermath of the attack. His home and all their belongings had to be destroyed because of possible contamination. Within days of the Skripals being taken ill, the government had pointed the finger of blame firmly at Russia. Hundreds of experts and equipment was drafted into Salisbury for the clean-up operation and to determine how the Skripals had injested the poison. It seemed it had been used at Sergeiaposs home, with the front door smeared in Novichok. By March , just eight days after the attack, the UK government were certain Russian agents were behind it. Then Prime Minister Theresa May told the House of Commons: It is now clear that Mr Skripal and his daughter were poisoned with a military-grade nerve agent of a type developed by Russia. She gave Russia  hours to tell the worldthe attack had been deliberate orthey had allowed the deadly chemical weapons to fall into the wrong hands. May warned Russia measures would followthere was no credible response. A day later a far reaching probe was launched into the deaths of  Russian exiles and businessmen in the UK into the possibility Moscow had been involved. By March , with no response from Russia,  Russian diplomats were expelled from the UK in what May described as actions to dismantle the Russian espionage network in the UK. She said these diplomats had been identied by the UK as undeclared intelligence agents. The US backed Britainaposs belief that Russia was behind the attack and placed sanctions on Russian banks and exports. The EU also expressed unqualied solidarity with the UK and its support, including for the UKaposs efforts to bring those responsible for this crime to justice. But Russia described the claims as balderdash and expelled  British diplomats from St Petersberg in retaliation. But there was one more tragedy, an innocent le that would be claimed by the chilling events in Salisbury. On June  Dawn Sturgess was at her home on Amesbury, Wiltshire - eight miles from Salisbury - when she suddenly collapsed. She was taken to hospital and placed on le support. A few hours later, her boyfriend, Charlie Rowley, was also admitted to hospital with similar symptoms. Medics realised they were experiencing Novichok poisoning. Charlie had found a bottle of perfume while he was scavenging in a bin, something he regularly did to look for things to sell. He gave it to Dawn, who sprayed the contents on her wrists, sealing her tragic fate. Doctors switched off Dawnaposs le support on July  and she passed away in hospital. Charlie regained consciousness two days later but is still experiencing harrowing symptoms. Chillingly, the bottle of perfume contained enough Novichok to kill thousands of people. In early September two Russian agents, Anatoily Chepiga and Alexander Mishkin, who went under the names Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov, when they landed in the UK, were being charged in absentia. Despite the CPS insistence there was enough evidence to charge the two men, it did not apply for them to be extradited from Russia. Instead Interpol Red Notices and European Arrest warrants were issued. A spokesman said: A realistic prospect of conviction means the CPS is satisfied on an objective assessment that the evidence can be used in court and that an objective, impartial and reasonable jury hearing the case, properly directed and acting in accordance with the law, is more likely than not to convict these two iniduals of the charges. It is of course for a jury to decide whether the evidence is enough for them to be sure of the suspectsapos guilt. “We will not be applying to Russia for the extradition of these men as the Russian constitution does not permit extradition of its own nationals. Russia has made this clear following requests for extradition in other cases. Should this position change then an extradition request would be made. “We have, however, obtained a European Arrest Warrant which means thateither man travels to a country where an EAW is valid, they will be arrested and face extradition on these charges for which there is no statute of limitations.” The two men were in the UK for just  hours, landing at Heathrow, then travelling to Salisbury, then back to London, before ing to Salisbury  to fly home. President Vladmir Putin finally had his say, claiming the two men were ordinary citizens who had simply travelled to the UK to see the sights. He insisted they had simply ed to Salisbury twice in  hours because bad weather had ruined their first trip. In the two years that have followed two more Russian agents have emerged as suspects. The leader of the specialist GRU unit has been unmasked as Major General Denis Sergeev, who is said to have been in the UK when Mr Skripal was poisoned. And Egor Gordienko may have helped set up the bid to assassinate former Kremlin spy. But even though the authorities are certain they know who was responsibile for the Novichok poisonings, they have admitted they will probably escape justice. Sajid Javid admitted when he was Home Secretary that the reality is we’ll probably never see them in the UK. And Neil Basu, national head of counter terrorism, has previously said it was a brutal truth the police could now do little unless then men entered a country with an extradition treaty with the UK. Putin’s government denies involvement and refuses to hand over the suspects. However, unwitting victim Charlie Rowley, has appointed a legal team to sue the Russian state.

The government has said that from aposmid-apos every new passport sent out will be blue.On Monday, the Home Office Twitter account posted a clip flicking through the new look with the caption: Britons will once again be able to travel with a blue passport when the iconic colour s for the first time in almost  years.A sea of comments flooded in criticising the move, with one writing: Offering the ability to work, live, retire in one declining country.

Esme had just been picked up by her mum, Jenner, in October  when the incident occurred. Jenner fell ill and started vomiting before fainting as the pair, from Yeovil, Somerset, were driving along a busy A road. Esme jumped into action and reached for her mumaposs phone, before calling  and summoning help to the scene. The schoolgirl has been credited as saving her mumaposs le and has been recognised for her bravery with an award. Speaking to the BBC, Jenner said: Iaposm surprised she knew what to do as weaposve never spoken about it, so it was a big surprise when she took the phone out and called the ambulance. Without a doubt she saved my le. Iaposm grateful she knew what to do, I dread to think what would have happened otherwise. Esme said: When she vomited and her eyes were shut, and she didnapost speak that well, I knew my mummy was unwell. When the ambulance came I was very happy. Jenner had pulled over into a lay by on the dual carriageway before she fell unconscious, and Esme was able to describe their location to the ambulance service. Lauren Saunders, from the South Western Ambulance Service NHS Foundation Trust, said: “Esme was brilliant. She told me exactly what was wrong, where she was, and stayed on the phone until helped arrived. She listened to all my questions, and answered them really well.  “Esme was so brave in a potentially scary situation. She is a credit to her mum, and fully deserves to be recognised for what she did.” Esme was now been presented with an award for her brave actions, at the annual Somerset Police and Crime Commissioner Pride Awards. The awards took place on January , at Police and Fire Headquarters in Portishead, Somerset. Police and Crime Commissioner Sue Mountstevens said: “The Pride Awards are something I always look forward to in my role as I get to say a big thank you to some truly extraordinary people in our community.

And we all find it easier to list her negative qualities than use any of the positive descriptions that would be commonly used for a man in her position.  When Theresa May was Home Secretary, she was labelled incompetent and mildly racist with her “Go Home” vans and the germination of the Windrush scandal. It flowered under her replacement Amber Rudd, whose political career was choked as a result. When Jacqui Smith was in the same job, her achievements were lost behind a scandal in which her husband was found to have watched pornography while she was absent. Those are the only four women who’ve held this great office of state, and they’ve all been labelled as uniquely feminine failures – not being in charge, not being able to escape, not being woman enough for her husband. Ninety men have held the same post. One, the Duke of Wellington, built his fortune from plundering Indian towns his soldiers attacked.

At the beginning of last year my kids and I had bronchitis. We have never had it before and I think itaposs from living here because the mould keeps growing all the time. When we came to view the flat it was lovely. Mould then started to appear about three to four months after we moved in on July , . There was quite a lot of mould and there was a funny smell I couldnapost pinpoint. I then found mould in the cupboards, as well as on the walls around the flat. I got in touch with The Guinness Partnership and told them how bad it was, and have been back to them numerous time since. Thermal boards were put in the front room and my bedroom. I was told it would stop the mould but it hasnapost.  In September last year, Lauren had a new bath, towel rail and flooring fitted, and some wall tiles replaced. The ceiling also had mould treatment but she said it failed to solve the problem and work is now being carried out on it again. The housing association says the property is suffering from penetrating damp and a damp specialist will be attending to identy works required. Lauren said: The mould has been growing back horrendously since. The bathroom is now completely ruined and paint is coming off.  In my daughteraposs room there is bad mould by the side of her bed as well as at the back of my bed. We also get mould in the wardrobes and on the ceilings. I keep being promised things which have not yet been done. I have previously been told the reason for the mould is the type of house it is and to keep the windows open and the property ventilated, which I do anyway. I have also tried treating it myself. I continue to wipe the mould away and have painted the walls with anti-mould paint, but it doesnapost work. A housing officer and surveyor came out two weeks ago and I was told they would look at the drains to seethey are blocked because I have damp as well as mould.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailA Tory peer grabbed a masseuseaposs bottom, pointed to his groin and askedshe did extras, a court heard today. Lord Holmes of Richmond, , denies sexual touching in the luxury hotel’s spa on March  last year. The nine-time Paralympic champion, who went blind at , claims he was only trying to trace her outline. But he is alleged to have firmly grabbed the masseuseaposs bottom towards the end of the treatment, and askedhe could touch her breasts and give him sexual release. He is also said to have taken advantage of the masseuseaposs unease at being around blind people so he could talk himself out of it.  Southwark Crown Court heard that when she said she was a professional after the touching, Holmes asked her: Are you sure youaposve never done it  Linda Strudwick, prosecuting, said Holmes had paid for a  minute massage costing £, and may have initially broken the disposable underwear given to him before he went into the spa. She said: Mr Holmes had been given disposable underwear to use during the massage. This underwear appears to have become broken, whether Mr Holmes did this deliberately or it was an accident the prosecution quite do not know. It is right to say that these garments are not the sturdiest of underpants. Mr Holmes askedhe could take them off and [the woman] said that he could provided he ensured that the towel covered him. [The masseuse] noticed that Mr Holmes appeared to flick the towel so as to leave his buttocks uncovered. She assumed that this was accidental and so she recovered him tucking the towel under his stomach. As she was massaging her left thigh, he said that aposshe could go highershe wanted toapos. Mr Holmes grabbed her left arm and levered himself to sitting position asking whether he could see how she looked. [The masseuse] was a bit confused by that but agreed thinking that this was what blind people do. Ms Strudwick continued: What happened next was a deliberate sexual assault. Mr Holmes wanted more than a massage.  She began to feel uncomfortable and tried to move away from him. She was prevented from doing so by Mr Holmes grabbing her buttocks and thus holding her in place. Thataposs between his legs. He askedhe could touch her boobs and he pointed to his groin and askedshe did extras, plainly you may think a reference to her giving him some sort of sexual relief. She said, aposno I am a professionalapos. She was shocked and she was embarrassed. Nothing like this had ever happened to her before. Mr Holmes realising that he was not going to get what he wanted he began to apologise and spent time reassuring and calming her. Ms Strudwick said Holmes denies any sexual touching, and read out a statement he gave to police. He said: As I am blind I cannot aposseeapos - but I can get a sense of what a person looks like through touch, which is the only sense I can use to get an image in my mind of peopleaposs appearance. It is obviously a bit strange to be massaged by someone, without knowing what they look like. By touching I mean lightly tracing the outline of the other person rather than grabbing them in a firm way. As I am basing my recollection only on touch I cannot be sure exactly where my hands rested but there was absolutely no intention to touch her in a sexual way. It was purely to give me an idea of her appearance. I am certain that I did not ask the therapist for aposextrasapos and am adamant that I did not point to the area of my groin at any time. I did not ask the therapist for sexual services of any kind and I am well aware that those sorts of services are not available in respectable hotel spas, with trained massage therapists.  I can completely understand that the therapist may have been confused and upset by my request to touch her as I cannot imagine that she sees very many completely blind clients, who would make a request of this kind. It is always dficult for me and other blind people to ask to touch sighed people, but it is a basic human instinct to want to know what somebody looks like and this is the only way we have. The prosecutor however said his motives were not innocent. Ms Strudwick added: To ask at the end when he was never going to see the masseuse again suggests his motives were not innocent. Some people do not like to be touched, some women wear makeup and dress their hair, and none of these matters were addressed by Mr Holmes. Rather, he knew that the sighted are often embarrassed and do not know what to do around blind people and he used that. Mr Holmes thought thathe was not successful in his bid for sexual release he could talk his way out of it. The prosecutor said the masseuse was immediately upset and told her manager, who said she was shaking. Ms Strudwick added: The defence will say that she has made up this allegation. That she is deliberately lying to gain some benefit, some compensation.  Given her allegation was made immediately, when she was still shocked and has not changed at all, you may think that is not credible and that the defence are only using the only defence they have. You might also want to consider that[the masseuse] is lying with a motive of financial gain, she might have made a rather more serious allegation. The court heard that Holmes did not want to be known by his full title, Lord Holmes of Richmond, at the hearings. The politician, who wore a navy suit and a yellow striped tie, was led into Southwark Crown Court with defence counsel Sarah Forshaw QC and his assistant black Labrador, Nancy. He was allowed to sit outside the dock to better hear the opening, although the jury was told Holmes will be ed when the complainant gives evidence behind a screen.

He lowered his head towards the table and began to cry, his granddaughter Hayley Dickson, , recalled. At that point a manager came over. Hayley claimed the member of staff accused Fred of being drunk and falling asleep at the table, asking them to leave. However, a spokesperson from the pub chain said it fully backed the actions of staff and said the group were asked to leave due to a genuine belief that they were intoxicated and one of them then became abusive towards staff. The family strongly deny the claims. My Nan passed away two weeks ago and the funeral was on Monday, Hayley said. The next day my grandad was really upset so we decided to take him out for a meal and a drink. They were married for  years and had known each other for  years. Heaposd had something to eat in the pub and he hadnapost even touched his second glass of wine when he put his head down and started crying.

But she just kept repeating the same thing - that itaposs company policy to ask someone who is drunk and asleep to leave. Hayley asked to speak to another manager, but was told no one was available. She was eventually given an email address that she could send a complaint to. Hayley said: I went back to the bar and asked for a drink for myself and the supervisor said he wasnapost serving me because aposyour group got told to leave before.apos I said let me tell you what happened and he told me not to tell him what to do which I wasnapost. I was livid. Hayley said her grandad was left feeling embarrassed by what happened and still had his head down as they left the restaurant.  She said: We all got up to leave and the staff stood watching as my grandad walked out with his head down. He was so embarrassed. I had been polite and didnapost get angry but when we were leaving I did shout that my nan had lung cancer and had just passed away, so that everyone in the pub could hear. I wanted everyone to know how theyaposd treated us and that we hadnapost done anything wrong. I think itaposs disgusting that they could treat an -year-old man like that.

Over on Twitter people have also been talking about this, with users sharing photos of people actually wearing the condoms on their fingers. Condoms in Singapore sold out amidst Coronavirus fear. Since Singaporeans have been using the condom as a protective measure when touching the elevator buttons in their apartments and other buildings to prevent being contaminated, wrote one person. Another said: Ok so because of the Coronavirus the supermarkets are empty cuz Singaporeans keep stocking up on food at home out of fear of going outside. My mom just told me in one supermarket the condom aisle is completely empty.

Picking up on the left of the penalty area, he squared up Paul Watson but could only swerve his effort wide four minutes before the interval.Just a minute later, United looked in as Shankland stood up a ball for McMullan to attack in the six-yard box but Daniel Harvie was able to get back in and clear off the line with Doohan stranded.Harkes was at the centre of what United did well in the opening moments of the second period, forcing a corner with his deep cross and making a late run into the box in an attempt to race onto Bingham#s through ball.On  minutes, Dillon Powers, useful at set-plays all night, found Mark Connolly at the back post with a deep free-kick but the Irishman#s header across the box had no takers.Just after the hour-mark, Kelly fired a dipping free-kick over the bar for the hosts # their first chance of the half.On  minutes, Sam Roscoe acrobatically hooked a half volley over the bar as Ayr grew into proceedings once more.Harkes was again clear for United as the goal opened up for him moments later. Played in by McMullan on the left of the box, the American could only slash wide with just Doohan to beat.Entering the final quarter of the game, United were still struggling to break down a rigid Ayr defence.Haring through surrounded by a glut of white shirts, Shankland perhaps should have slipped in a freer Peter Pawlett, only just off the bench, but elected to go it alone and was crowded out.Boss Robbie Neilson erred on the side off caution by replacing McMullan with Robson on  minutes after the winger went down with cramp.Drinan smashed an effort wide for the home side two minutes later, before Jordan Houston tested Siegrist with a header.Drinan again powered a drive just over the United crossbar with nine minutes remaining before Harvie fizzed an effort wide.In the final minute, Drinan could only drag a shot across the ground and straight into the grateful arms of Siegrist as third-placed Ayr went for the kill.The Tangerines, too, pushed for a late winner late on but it never came as they enter the final round of fixtures still out in front.Ayr United XI : DoohanHouston, Bell , Roscoe, Harvie Kerr , Muirhead McCowan , Kelly, ForrestDrinan.Subs not used: Hare-Reid , Smith, Gillespie and Murphy.Dundee United XI : SiegristSmith, Watson, Connolly, ReynoldsMcMullan , Powers, Harkes, Appere Bingham , Shankland.Subs not used: Deniz , Sporle, Glass, Freeman and Neilson.Referee: David Munro.Att: , ."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2020/03/Gjen_Dundee_United_Academy-4-scaled.jpg ","title":"dundee united academy coaches helping club move with trends in modern game","story":"Dundee United academy duo Thomas Courts and Andy Payne are working to shape ‘modern’ stars of the future under the club’s revamped grassroots set-up.Since academy director Andy Goldie took charge of the Terrors’ youth ranks in February last year, the club have achieved ‘Elite’ status in the Scottish FA’s Project Brave initiative and helped introduced the likes of Louis Appere and Declan Glass to Robbie Neilson’s first team.Helping make United’s one of the best youth set-ups in the country has been a new staff, including head of tactical performance Courts, formerly manager of Kelty Hearts, and head of technical performance Payne, coach at the club for  years and nephew of ex-Tannadice star Graham.Their remit oversees the younger kids in the academy from U  to U , with the pair working closely to develop players equipped for the on-the-ball and off-the-ball demands of first-team football in .And theirs are roles they find very rewarding as they watch youngsters fulfil their potential – whether that’s with Dundee United, another club or outwith football altogether.Courts said: “I think within the academy set-up what we’re trying to do is give them a technical and tactical framework that can allow them to maximise their potential.“It’s actually also about surviving and thriving domestically and playing within Scotland.“We’re taking them down to the elite level in England and overseas in Europe for games and learning.“We want to design a game model that allows them to go into dferent environments and feel they have the skillset to fulfil their potential.” vw, px\"  Both men feel there is a profile of ‘creative flair’ when you think of a Dundee United player, which they are keen to maintain within their plans.Payne said: “I suppose there is. Obviously, we look at it by position to try to make them better technically and tactically but we want all players comfortable in taking the ball.“We’re not fixated on systems and formations right across the club, we want to do what’s right for our inidual players.“It’s also about getting us to empower the coaches to be able to deliver those same messages across the board. We’re constantly reviewing and adapting our model. We don’t want to just stand still. We need to move forward with the modern trends of the game.“There’s needs to be a balance of letting kids express themselves and being free at certain points but also hammering home the technical and tactical elements of their game.”Of the environment at Tannadice, Courts added: “The club’s invested quite heavily in additional staff members like ourselves but also video analysis and physical performance.“We look at the full player as an athlete, first and foremost, but it’s all in collaboration with the technical, tactical and physical performance.“It’s a club on an upward trajectory again and they’ve got a phenomenal reputation historically for developing young players.“There’s a blueprint and something ingrained within the club. The calibre of people you are working with on a daily basis is great. We’ve got some of the best people around.“If you look at the profile of the type of player this club tends to produce, there’s a creative flair but we want to help by giving them as much information as possible.”Payne added: “Logan Chalmers and Keiran Freeman are next in line.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2020/02/Dundee-Arbroath.jpg ","title":"ness nearing dundee first team comeback as mcghee returns","story":"Jamie Ness is nearing ato the Dundee first-team as he steps up his recovery from a calf problem.The former Rangers and Stoke man has been in full training this week after suffering yet another injury problem in the Scottish Cup defeat to Motherwell in January.The central midfielder’s time at Dens Park has been more stop than start with an ankle complaint picked up in July at Cove Rangers the first of a number of spells on the sidelines.Boss James McPake says tomorrow’s home clash with Arbroath may be too soon but a hectic spell over the next few weeks could see Ness pressed back into action.“Tomorrow might come too early for Jamie but he’s had part of a session Monday, full sessions Tuesday and Wednesday with new insoles in his boots which seem to be helping,” said James.“He’s not had much game time so we’ll maybe get him up to speed in training.“Four games in  days might change that, though.”After the visit of the Red Lichties tomorrow, Dundee face Alloa at Dens on Tuesday ahead of a trip to Ayr United next weekend.The Honest Men then call in at Dens the following Tuesday before another home game for the Dark Blues sees Dunfermline in town in just over a fortnight.The Dens men go into tomorrow’s contest with almost a full squad of players. vw, px\"  Long-term absentee Jordan Marshall is the only first-team player ruled out.Jordan McGhee is ready toafter surgery to sort a wrist complaint while Cammy Kerr will push for Christie Elliott’s spot on the right side of defence after recovering from his own surgery on his knee."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/03/2.49479701-1-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/03/2.49479701-1-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/03/2.49479701-1-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/03/2.49479701-1-240x180.jpg 300w ","title":"three cases of coronavirus confirmed in scotland","story":"The two latest Scottish coronavirus cases are confirmed to be in the Grampian and Ayrshire areas.Both patients are described as #currently clinically well#.One patient has recently travelled to northern Italy.The other has had contact with a known positive case, although officials said it was not with the first positive case in Scotland, a patient in Tayside.Clinicians have begun contact tracing, the process of gathering details of the places they have visited and the people they have been in contact with.Scotland#s Health Secretary Jeane Freeman said: #Our first thoughts must be with the patients diagnosed with coronavirus, I wish them a full and speedy recovery.Scotland#s Chief Medical Officer Dr Catherine Calderwood said: #Scotland is well equipped to deal with infections of this kind.

But it was Dick who made his own decision – a decision he doesn’t regret.”The discussion then suddenly veered into who was the best football player to ever play in Dundee Junior leagues.Rob went on: “The journeymen were veterans of WW, when young men of their generation had lived and breathed football in that glorious sports decade of the ’s when Dundee was saturated with talent and the city was a giant encompassing sports stadium.“They were men from another time.“A name came forth – Tiddler Forbes.“According to two of the journeymen, he was the greatest dribbler of a ball – bar none.“They were emphatic that Tiddler could do things with a ball that no other mortal could.“Some years ago, I am positive I read in BwB a reference to Tiddler Forbes.“However, I can’t recall the content of the article.“What stays with me is not just the name, what stays with me is the utmost conviction of the journeymen who declared Tiddler Forbes the greatest junior football player of their generation.”I also can’t recall the reference, so, is there a BwB reader with any information on Tiddler Forbes "},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/03/2.32479702-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/03/2.32479702-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/03/2.32479702-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/03/2.32479702-240x180.jpg 300w ","title":"where should johns scrapbook rest","story":"Lochgelly resident Gary Lister got in touch regarding his late father.John Lister died in  and was one of the last remaining members of the great St Andrews United side which won the Scottish Junior Cup  years ago in .Gary, , said: “My father was very well known in Fe junior circles as, in addition to playing in that great St Andrews United side, he also had spells with other clubs such as Steelend Vics, Lochore Welfare, Newburgh, Valleyfield Colliery, Dunfermline Jubilee, Lochgelly Albert and Halbeath.“Indeed, he played as a goalkeeper at that level from  to .“My father, who worked as a blacksmith at Rosyth docks, turned out  times for St Andrews, which included a run of  consecutive appearances.”The main reason for Gary getting in touch was his father’s scrapbooks and he continued: “I have three scrapbooks, photos, cuttings, articles from The Courier, Saturday pink paper, yellow paper, Sunday Post.“They are all just tucked away in a drawer.“What I’m looking for is some place to put them on display so others may be able to enjoy them.

It’s quite a deep cut because goalies usually play with longer studs than we play with.“So Joe’s stud really went in – it wasn’t nice to look at when it happened.“It’s not painful or anything and it’s not restricting me.“It was weird because after I missed games people were like ‘are you injured ’“And it’s classed as an injury, but it doesn’t feel like an injury. it’s just because it’s on a weird spot on the knee.“I couldn’t feel anything and it wasn’t even painful, but I couldn’t play.“It was frustrating. But there was no way I could play so I just had to deal with that.”After the cup win at Rugby Park, Ojo expects a fired-up Kilmarnock tonight but believes Aberdeen will be able to cope.He said: “With the confidence we have I expect a game where we can impose our will on them.“I didn’t play but it was good for the boys we won there a couple of weeks ago.“They’re going to be determined to get a win, especially because they’re playing at home.“But it’s not the first time I’ve played them.“The teams have played plenty of times and I just feel we are the better team.”"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column january 10 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsCouncillors wil be put in an unenviable position when they finally decidewhere the axe will fall on council services.But exactly how much Argyll and Bute will have to spend will not be known until the daffodils are beginning to pop through the ground.

Nearly three years later I fear the dream is still a long way from that reality.Mid Argyll Youth Development Servicescertainly seems to have ambitious plans for an indoor skate park and this is to be lauded, however a quick look online will show an apparent apathy with regard to moving forward with the project. A young man created the #Lochgilphead Skate Park Association# on Facebook in , yet a final post in  indicated how little the proposal had moved forward. If the project needs more money to actually get it built we need to know how much, so that appropriate funding can be sought.What is causing the project to take years to come to fruition The potential for help by the £ million Tarbert and Lochgilphead Regeneration Fund in  was dashed when councillors instead decided that improvements to road junctions, streets, a cycle track and indoor bowling were more important, and allocated a staggering £, to feasibility studies for these projects alone, this is before any work is actually done, you understand.That is a great deal of money for feasibility studies and design works.Let us be realistic # in nine long years the community has gone from the initial excited buzz about a skate park to finally managing to purchase a plot of land upon which to build it in early . From there it seems the project has not been able to move.In the meantime the youngsters who worked so hard to give momentum to the project appear to have given up hope and are now probably giving thought to employment prospects rather than having fun.It is a sad state of affairs.But rather than giving up hope, let us reignite this campaign for our children to have the dream of a skate park in Lochgilphead whilst they are still young enough to enjoy it.Nick MacIneskar, TayvallichSir,With regard to your story in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser #Inveraray seawall in need of attention#, would it be possible to contact BEAR Scotland and ask themthey could also create an access point to the shore Possibly at the bus stop at Barn Brae. Thanks very much.Marion McIntosh, InveraraySir,I should like to make an appeal to all MPs, MSPs, councillors and all lawmakers that in  they make no new laws.At the beginning of this new decade they should improve the laws they already passed. I would even like for them to go further and reduce the number of laws that are in existence.Now please don’t get me wrong, I am not against all laws. What I fear is that instead of addressing the issues which are negative to iniduals and society, legislators believing that by extending what are regarded as crimes changes society for the better. Their belief is wrong.We know that parking on pavements is wrong #upskirting# is horrying smoking in a car in which they are children is unacceptable dropping litter is shameful driving through a red light is dangerous.What we need is the range of social and cultural influences that help us feel that we should behave in a positive way. In the s, s and s the majority of people regularly attended churches and religious organisations. In these environments people developed feelings of what was right and wrong. Positive behaviour was also developed by participating in the extensions of these organisations through activities in young mother groups women#s guilds, choirs, and religious celebrations. These helped develop positive moral compass in people.Equally, most children and young people went to youth organisations such as the Girl Guides, Scouts, the BBs, army and naval cadets. Even into the s local authorities ran youth clubs and had excellent people called #youth leaders#. No more. #We cannot afford them# is the call of the day. Without them the honourable behaviour of society will continue to deteriorate.So my plea to politicians is simple # stop making us all criminals by passing more and more laws and start supporting and encouraging agencies, groups and people who indirectly and directly instil in iniduals behaviour of which all can be proud.Finlay CraigCoveSir,There is all the hoo-ha at the moment over the lesser royals deciding its going to be a better le that beckons from opting out from royal duties # perhaps wanting a less stressful, more normal, le for themselves and their family as ordinary people away from the media hype and national newspapers.It was lovely, however, to see in the same week front page on the local paper a real regional award for a less well-known commoner.An MBE given for services to the local youth community, making this two great awards for Lochgilphead in recent years and showing that local strong ladies in Mid Argyll do have what it takes.Hard work and true Scottish grit and determination in their hearts for the area and community. More of the same meritorious awards for the ordinary people of Scotland please.Credit to all editors and staff for their outstanding journalism given over the years in all of Scotlands progressive, thriving local papers.Stephen Jones, Oban"},{"url":null,"title":"keep that mojo burning 4 below","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsFrom Oban,  Below previously graced the MOJO stage before in  with a blistering set from their debut album Alpha, to great acclaim.

A wee van and a motorbike were behind them at the time and they let them pass and they disappeared down the twisty road at an incrediblespeed.They reached Tighnabruaich at about  o#clock and saw Fulmar in the water, but when they stopped to speak to Johnny Malcolm and Donald Turner they were told she was not in the water more than # an hour and still not fully rigged. They were quite right but George Smith said they were busy getting Psyche ready for launchingbut they would be out first thing in the morning to bend on the sails and finish off the rigging.They got their storesin the yard and with these and their luggage went aboard in two trips. Things were soon put sufficiently enough in order to allow them to get to bed and after watching Psyche go down the slip they were soon in their bunks. It was a beautully clear evening but distinctly cold.Next morning they were up at sevenand about eight the yard men came out and finished up their jobs. Jimmy Smith fixed up the slipping clutch and suggested we do away with the present gear lever fancy arrangement which was not strong enough for its work. This the Skipper agreed to though it meant a less handy working but it did away with the pin and shield that broke up the dog-house seat, they being replaced by a removable hatch cover. It certainly made sitting in the dog-house more comfortable.The Skipper went ashore to the village for meat and some curtain hooks while Archie watered ship and the other two continued cleaning and clearing up aboard.At quarter to twelve they were away under full sail and in brilliant sunshine but with a cold north-westerly they ran to Ardlamont then beat up to Tarbert, being passed just outside Tarbert as an aeroplane flew close overhead, by Blink. They noticed a huge oil tanker doing trials just off Arran.They were anchored off the herring pier before  o#clock and they had supper-cum-lunch then went ashore. The Pilot to visit a friend, the others to get milk in the village then to walk to the end of the road on Loch Fyne. On their way they spoke to an enthusiastic English pair, working in their garden, who wanted to know off which yacht they had come.During the evening Arcturus and Tunnag came in and one or two motor boats. Zaidie was in when they arrived and Leonora was anchored across Loch Fyne in Buck Bay.All aboard, Margaret and Archie went off to the islet in the harbour to get some roots for their new garden then soon afterwards all turned in, for though it was a glorious looking evening it was perishingly cold and the stove, lit as soon as they anchored, had been very welcome.On Sunday they were again up early and found a dull overcast day. The Pilot, ashore for water, heard a poor weather forecastfrom a fishing board. On the strength of this they hurried breakfast and by  o’clock were away with a south-westerly breeze.The Skipper gave the first beacon a rap with the boom-end as they ran out of the harbour. The beat down to Ardlamontand thee ran the engine for five minutes to get out of a nasty lop. The sun came out for about five minutes but by the time they had reached the Carry Buoythe rain had started and it got heavier and heavier.The wind strengthened with the rain and they moved up very fast into Tighnabruaich Bay then up to Loch Riddon to anchor off the pier at Ormidale. As they passed Tighnabruaich they saw Torridon was on Fulmar’s mooring and they watched her crew panicking to get off before Fulmar arrived. They wondered what the Torridons said when they saw Fulmar pass on through and realised that they could have stayed where they were. As they passed Glen Caladh the new Jansi of Kames passed under a not very healthy-sounding engine.They had lunch and the stove was lit then Margaret and Archie went ashore to visit friends and when they came back they brought with them a big sack of coal . The late afternoon and evening were spent below talking and listening to the rain hammering on the deck.Monday morning it was dry but blowing hard. They got the anchor early and motored to the moorings. The sails were hoisted to dry them and St Roma came close by to make their number and at one time a big school of thrasher whales went through the Kyles heading east and at a great speed.About noon they went ashore for a visit to the hotel and for a run round the Ardlamont road . Back aboard they had lunch and soon after packed up and came home."},{"url":null,"title":"the cinema on wheels returns","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe screen machine will be rolling back into Mid Argyll at the end of the month.Bringing with it a host of movies for film fans the Screen Machine will be in Campbeltown Road car park in Tarbert from Wednesday January  to Thursday January  and Lochgilphead Resource Centre car park from Friday January  to Sunday February .Musical fantasy film Cats, based on the Andrew Lloyd Webber stage musical, features an ensemble cast including James Corden, Judi Dench, Jason Derulo, Idris Elba, Jenner Hudson, Ian McKellen, Taylor Swt, Rebel Wilson, and Francesca Hayward.Also known as Star Wars: Episode IX, Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker is an epic space-opera film.

So how did Britain look before human interventions  Dense forest  or open woodland Research now favours the latter.Plants and animals evolved in equilibrium for thousands of years before humans impacted the landscape. Essential to this balance were ‘keynote species’ including aurochs , bison and tarpan . By grazing, these animals trampled and eroded soils, dispersed seeds and redistributed nutrients, thereby keeping the forest open. This in turn encouraged growth of large trees while also creating numerous habitats and microenvironments for a wonderful ersity of plants and smaller animals.Now this bioersity is severely threatened by modern monocultures , and massive quantities of pesticides, fungicides, fertilisers and #weed# killers. It is no wonder that insect numbers have plummeted, many bird species are endangered and wild-flower meadows have virtually vanished. So could we recreate this natural order on unproductive land and save our wildle For Isabella Tree and her husband Charlie Burrell the answer is a resounding #yes#. In her book #Wilding#, Tree describes #wilding# their , acre farm at Knepp, West Sussex, that had been unproductive for years.They introduced longhorn cattle, Exmore ponies, deer and pigs but otherwise left well alone. Within months they saw a dference # most scrub was cleared, producing an explosion of plant and animal species. And where grazers were deterred by spiny or unpalatable plants, oaks emerged that will eventually form an open woodland.But Knepp is isolated. More rewilding sites are needed with wildle corridors between them to support the populations and genetic ersity essential for long-term survival.Surely parts of Argyll are ideal for rewilding. We already have beavers creating new waterways to support aquatic species – now how about some large grazers to open up the landscape and perhaps one day recreate the ancient Celtic rainforest "},{"url":null,"title":"hair raising happenings at the co op","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowLochgilphead Co-op staff are on a fundraising mission which they hope will raise awareness and help overcome stigma around mental illness.Trusting her hairdresser Nicky MacDougall, from Casa in Ardrishaig, Tina Holloway will have her hair shaved off to raise funds for the Scottish Association for Mental Health .Explaining why she decided to take on the challenge, Tina said: #I didn#t really think before I opened my mouth.

This is a stunning route and the views over the Sound of Jura to the islands of Islay and Gigha are a rich reward for screaming muscles on the testing climbs.This will be the third year this increasingly popular event will take to the road.

Of course, for more competitive cyclists who want to push themselves or who are in training, the Kilberry Loop Sportive is a great event to get a personal best.The quicker cyclists in  managed the course # which has almost  metres of climbing # in under two hours, which is quick, and there are others who complete the course inside a comfortable four hours, so there is room for all abilities.Around  cyclists of all ages took part last year, with a couple of gentlemen in their early s and those in their twenties joining in # and organisers hope this year#s sportive will attract even more athletes.To make the event even more attractive Mid Argyll Cycling and Triathlon Club hopes to include race timing for the first time. And, for the third year, the Kilberry Loop Sportive is supported by British Cycling, the nation’s largest cycling organisation and national governing body for cyclesport, which actively helps and encourages people to get into cycling.If you’d like to sign up for this year’s Kilberry Loop Sportive or want more information visit the Mid Argyll Cycling and Triathlon Club website."},{"url":null,"title":"the voyages of the fulmar part four","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAs crew for our cruise we were lucky, as we have been for the four previous years, and were able to get both the Doctor and Pilot to come again. The Purser, however, found the lure of the theatre too great and she decided to spend her holidays working with a Repertory Company in Aberdeen.Again we were lucky in having a ready-made substitute in Chris Paterson, the Pilot’s we of nearly a year’s standing. We gave her the rank of Tanky – a piece of gunroom slang meaning the midshipman who trots around with the navigator or, in other words the Pilot’s Mate.As usual at the beginning of a cruise we got up early – .am – and quickly finished up our packing, loaded the car, shut up the house, and were on our road by ten minutes past seven. It was a fine bright morning with a light southerly breeze and quite promising though the weather forecast the night before had been not too cheerful. It was dead low water at Renfrew Ferry and as there was a big convoy of Army Transports crossing from north to south there was no delay in our getting across and at .am we were at the top of The Rest having had an easy and practically trafficless trip up Loch Lomond. Twenty minutes later we had Inveraray behind us.We called in at the BRS Depot at Lochgilpheadand collected our three boxes of stores and at ten to ten arrived at Crinan having passed several yachts already making their way east. The basin was busy with in it, amongst others, Arcturus, Vivien, Makoya, Boomerang, and Tookay, most of which were homeward bound. The Fulmar was lying at the back of the basin outside a motor boat and Vanda and as we unloaded the car we had a long carry round and everything was dumped on the basin wall before being taken aboard. Luckily it was turning into a lovely day. The only fly in the ointment was the poor Major – he had developed a paralysis of his back legs the day before and could do nothing but sit where put and look pitully about and only occasionally managed to drag himself a foot or two.The Mate and Bosun after being treated to tea on board Vivien got down to unpacking and stowing our gear and while they were about it the Doctor arrived with his gear and plentul supplies of Medical Comforts, a huge cake, packets of chocolate and a big box of chocolates. Dumping his stuff with the rest on deck he and the Skipper then went to the hotel and drank success to the cruise. They learnt that the night before had been a bit of a night and Arcturus was still showing its effects rather markedly.While the Mate continued the storing the Bosun got petrol and paraffin and the Tar went up to the farm for milk and at half past twelve they, with the Doctor, had lunch. Meanwhile the Skipper had gone to Ardrishaig and got a lot of fresh storesa new screwdriver, and meths. Being too early for the steamer he, after having had a beer at The Anchor, sat on a seat near the pier and had his lunch of six cookies and a sausage roll and listened to the Test Match on a portable set a man sharing the seat had with him .The Pilot and Tanky duly came off the steamer and by half past one all were aboard and the final gear stowing was completed. The car was parked on the steep hill between the farm and the basin and the batteries were disconnected then, while the Bosun, Doctor and Pilot, shted Fulmar to outside Melora on the east wall, the Skipper and Mate went up to the shop and got some strawberry tarts.At half past two the Karma came in from sea and we went into her water but had to wait in the lock for a wee motor boat whose owner had not turned up but was due soon. While we waited a man from a big Belfast motor boat that was lying in the basin spoke to the Skipper and complimented him on the sailing directions and thanked him for them. The Skipper did his best not to look smugly gratied. We filled in the waiting time by having a cup of coffee and one was handed up to the Doctor who was waiting to see us sail.At five past three we were away under engine being waved on our way by the Doctor and promising to be at Tobermory on the following Friday to pick him up. As the wind was light west-south-west we kept the motor going until we could fetch the Dorus Mor then up went the sails and beer was indulged in to mark the start of the cruise.We went nicely for a little but the wind fell very light. An unknown yacht and Mimosa were coming south and, against the flood tide, were making nothing of it. We passed close by the latter and spoke to John Hamilton then as we headed up for the Ardluing buoy we could see her being pushed slowly back to the northwards stern first. We, too, were being carried too far to the eastward and the engine went on to get us into the Scarba Sound stream and we kept it going till up to Leica Point where the wind came away again, this time from the true west.The tide rips at Fladda were in very good form and we fairly roared through the narrows and on up to Easdale but thereafter the breeze went flukey and light ying between north-west and south-west but, as the sun was shining brightly, it was very pleasant slipping along slowly in the smooth water. There was no sign of the usual heavy swell one expects to meet either side of Easdale Point. Away up to the north between Duart and Loch Don we could see half a dozen boats, led by Cerigo, making their way south.At six o’clock we heard a poor forecast promising rain and strong winds to come and listened for a while to the Test Match and heard of the collapse of the Australians in the st innings. The glass was slowly but steadily coming back and we feared the forecast was probably on the right lines.As we came round the north-west point of Seil Island and headed over for Dun Island off Puilladobhrain the wind died and the sea turned to glass so we got the sails down and stowed and the motor was started up.As we approached Puilladobhrain we saw a nished yawl coming down from the Oban direction under power and she passed in just ahead of us. As we were to learn later she was the Sol and at her helmwas a #bearded ancient# with a shock of white hair and a white beard. As we rounded the Fulmar Beacon we passed Kerlo coming out. In the anchorage were two motor boats and as we went slowly up to the south end of the pool we passed far too close to the bows of one of them owing to the Skipper misjudging the tidal drt. One of the crew came hurriedly out on to her forecastle and frowned at us as we slipped past with only inches to spare.It was dead calm when we anchored at half past seven but we were sorry to see that the drop in the glass was now being accelerated."},{"url":null,"title":"ormsary man in oman endurance event","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowAn Ormsary man is about to embark on the challenge of a letime as he cycles over ,km in a bid to be crowned BikingMan Oman .Lindsay McCrae, , will be one of only  cyclists to take part in BikingMan Oman, part of a series of ultra-endurance cycling events where competitors test their limits of strength and stamina.In , Lindsay bought a road bike through his employer#s cycle to work scheme and what started out as an active commute with a few local races thrown in for fun, soon became an opportunity to challenge himself in some of the toughest races on two wheels.His first big win came in the gruelling City to Summit duathlon from Edinburgh to Ben Nevis. The race was a half marathon of road running, km ride through Glen Coe then back on foot for the final off-road marathon summitting Ben Nevis and finishing in Fort William.Bitten by the cycling bug, he went on to win Revolve  at Brands Hatch race circuit, completing  miles and ascending , feet in  hours. Adding a second-place finish in last year#s BikingMan Portugal event against some of the sport#s top athletes means Lindsay has truly made his mark on the endurance scene.Lindsay said: #In my first few races I just wanted to see how I would get on but now I#m definitely in it to win it. I think I#m just stubborn and that#s what keeps me pushing on when other people take rest breaks.#Lindsay, who works in sales technical support for an aquaculture equipment company in Inverness, fits his training around his job, spending one to two hours on a turbo in his garage three or four times a week, with longer rides of two to five hours at the weekends. His father#s greenhouse in Ardrishaig proved to be a useful training venue to shelter from the elements over the Christmas holidays as he prepared for his biggest challenge yet.The BikingMan Oman race starts in Muscat, Oman#s capital city, before heading out on the Arabian Peninsula, through the Hajar Mountains, across the Ash Sharqiyah Desert and along coastal roads back to the capital. The competitors will climb over m during the race, that#s the equivalent of climbing Ben Nevis almost seven times.Unlike cyclists on the Tour de France, BikingMan athletes are unsupported so must carry all their food and equipment with them.For Lindsay, one of the biggest challenges will be the weather. #Temperatures at the moment are around - degrees but can reach higher which can be dficult to manage on the steeper sections of the course. That#s where my nutrition and hydration strategy will need to be spot on.#But in case it all sounds like hard work, Lindsay highlights one of the main benefits of his high-octane adventures: #The best part is definitely refuelling after the race. I will burn about , calories over the -hours of my target time, so my recovery will mainly involve eating cakes and other calorie rich foods.#Lindsay grew up on the Ormsary Estate and attended Lochgilphead High School. His family still live in the local area and will be following his adventures closely over the five days of competition.The race takes place from February  to  and Lindsay will cover ,km in a bid to take the title."},{"url":null,"title":"ceilidh to boost hall funds","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowToe-tapping tunes and a busy dance floor are on the cards for a Craignish ceilidh.Ardfern ceilidh band, All about the Cake, will take the stage and have the dancers reeling all night.

It was all so surprising.#I have never won anything for essentially just being myself. Anyone  in the category absolutely deserved to win, so it really is an honour.#Throughout high school, Josh was a victim of bullying, struggling to understand who he was as a person and confused by his own thoughts and feelings.

As we stood about on deck while the dishes were being washed a boy from one of the motor boats passed in his dinghy. He was wearing blue shorts and red stockings which brought from the Pilot the remark: #In Brodickyou don’t wear red stockings you might just as well be in Lamlash.#All but the Skipper and Mate went ashore on Centre Island for a stroll. The Major was still completely paralysed in his hind quarters but he was full of spirit and when the Bosun held up his hind legshe galloped along. It was a quiet peaceful evening with a very light northerly breeze but it was distinctly chilly and there was a magnicentsomewhat lurid sunset. The shore party back aboard the Bosun took the Tar off in the dinghy and they landed on Eilean na Beithe and while the former explored the island the latter played on a shingly shore – it was long after dark when they ed.At half past ten we began to turn in and, as always on the first evening, this was a longer business then usual as pillows and blankets had to be allocated and pillowslips put on but by a quarter past eleven we were all in bed and shortly after that a light shower pattered on the deck. The problem of what to do with the Doctor’s mattress was solved by the Pilot double banking his bunk. We were all very glad to have had such a good day for the start.It was noticed that voices were still coming from the ladies’ cabin when the last of us in the main cabin fell asleep.The Tanky brought an innovation to the Fulmar # #Quickies# # a patent washing gadget that saved precious water.We had a dead quiet night with, as far as any of us knew, no rain but the forecast was not good, promising north to north-east winds, force  to  with frequent heavy showers. The glass had continued its steady drop. When we turned out, a light but cold north wind was blowing from a well broken up sky.We had a breakfast of bacon and eggs then the Bosun took the Major ashore for his walk. The latter was possibly a little better and was able to take a few steps on the deck, but ashore on the rough ground could do nothing. While they were ashore the big motor boat with the red-stockinged boy left after very nearly going ashore on Seil Island while getting his anchor aboard.At twenty past ten we were away under engine, but as soon as we were outside the sails went up to the north-easterly breeze and we set off for the Sound of Mull. There was no sign of the swell that is usually met south of Kerrera and we got along quite well, but we could not point any higher than a mile or so south of Loch Don. The Pilot went below and brewed a welcome cup of tea which warmed us up, then we took a tack right up to the south coast of Kerrera and had a close up view of Gylen Castle and the Skipper waxed historical.Putting about again we passed close south of the Potlid Island, but when we were about halfway across to Loch Don the wind died and the strong ebb began to force us south and about the same time the rain came on.The engine was started and we headed up for Duart, but our progress was pitully slow, and indeed at one period we but barely held our ground. The Lady Rock and Lismore Lighthouse seemed never to get any nearer closing. When the engine had run an hour we waited for the first sign of the old familiar falter but none came and we began to hope a cure for its stopping had been effected by replacing the HT coil.This change was a despairing effort made because it was the only thing we had not tried, though all the pundits declare it could not possibly be the cause. The engine would either go or not go, they said, and it would never startthe coil was defective. We got one scare when it staggered for a moment, but the Bosun, who was at the tiller at the time, said we had just passed though a big mass of floating seaweed and may have got some round our propeller.As we were to prove later the cure had been found and the engine ran impeccably all the cruise and the Skipper had a lot of unkind thoughts about all the many professional motor experts who had caused him a great deal of trouble, not a little acute anxiety and more than considerable expense through their failure to diagnose a not very obscure disease.As we came up to the Black Memorial Tower Leonora crossed our bows making for Oban and another yachtpassed close by south bound under engine though by this time quite a reasonable and, for then, favourable breeze was blowing from the north-east and our sails were drawing.We learnt later that the owner’s we would not allow a sail to be set under any conditions as long as she was aboard – a pity, we thought, as she certainly was a lovely job and we felt it would have been betterthe we had decided to stay ashore.At Duart we stopped the engine and were able to make good progress, but the rain got heavier and heavier and our sandwich lunch was taken below in relays. Then at about three with the turn of the tide the wind died completely and the engine was started again. Near the Grey Rocks we saw St Roma coming south under power so we altered course to intercept her then at slow speed turned back the way we had come for a few hundred yards while we exchanged news.We heard a thoroughly bad forecast at mid-day, the wind had gone, the rain was stotting in the glassy sea, and, though the glass had come back only a fraction, we decided to call it a day so, with the Bosun the only dissentient, made for Loch Aline. As we turned inshore at Ardtornish we saw Seewolf to the north of us, becalmed but heading south, and guessed she would be joining us later. Coming in, when between Morven Pier and the Ferry Pier, the Skipper held too close to the west shore and the bottom showed up suddenly far too clearly for our peace of mind and a quick sheer out was necessary.Through the narrows we turned to starboard and anchored at half past four in Kyle Bay in a flat calm and the rain coming down heavier than ever. Gratefully we realised that it was not quite as bitterly cold as it had been out in the Sound.Seewolf came in shortly after going very slowly and Hamish Lawrence called over that he had run a big end and was on his way to Oban for repairs and to hand over to brother Alec and his family. Soon after that we were joined by a small motor boat, Saguenay, flying a blue ensign which, in view of her size, the Skipper was sure she was not entitled to do and then a little later, while we were warming up with some coffee, Lindisfarne arrived and anchored close beside us with Guy Clephane in his usual tremendousform – he’s a proper marvel is Guy.Hamish Lawrence came across in his dinghy and came aboard for a gin and while he was there Guy called over inviting Tanky and the Pilot across to Lindisfarne then sent the Pilot back to Fulmar to fetch the Bosun. Hamish gone, the Skipper began to put nine inch tacklines into our line of flags as we had discovered at Rothesay at the Royal Clyde Centenary Regatta that without them our line was about fteen feet too short and we wanted them to be right for the Queen’s visit to Tobermory.When the Pilot came back he and the Bosun got the tents up as the rain was by then torrential.We had a supper of sausages and beans and while the dishes were being done the Bosun took the Major ashore. He was walking a little bettervery slowly, but there was, unfortunately, no concrete results from his exercise.At nine o’clock we went in two loads across to Seewolf and were offered drinks OR tea, but the Skipper insisted on both. We were, however, not allowed any biscuits with our tea as to have them would have meant opening a new box and broaching Alec Lawrence’s stores. The Tanky had not wanted anything but tea, but Hamish had given her a good strong gin which she tried to hide on a shelf behind her and it was only got rid of when the Pilot took it off her hands and quickly put it to its proper use. The Bosun was drinking beer and when he opened up the tin a goodly portion of it bubbled onto the fitted carpet in the cabin.On board Seewolf were, besides the two paid hands, Hamish’s mother and his two sisters. The old lady, well over eighty, was in grand form and waxed eloquent on #The old days# and the greatness of #Belshaft#. Also on board was a great big collie who was obviously petted and spoilt beyond measure and he behaved more like a lap dog than the great big clumsy creature he was.It was half past eleven before we went back to Fulmar all in one load with little enough freeboard for the dinghy considering the conditions. There was a nasty little lop on the water, the northerly wind was bitterly cold, and the rain was as heavy as ever. As quickly as possible we got below and into our warm bunks, not even the Bosun wasting any time about it, though he did read for some time after all the rest were sound asleep."},{"url":null,"title":"emergency-work-begin-scotlands-first-wallace-statue","story":"SCOTLANDS first-ever monument to William Wallace is to be saved.Concern has been raised about cracks appearing in the -foot statue which overlooks the Tweed near St Boswells.And fears were growing for the future of the -year-old iconic sculpture.But the few remaining Trustees of the statue have arranged for emergency work to be carried out in April.And it is hoped that a fundraising drive through the summer will lead to further preservation work to prevent any more deterioration.Jesse Rae, who is one of the William Wallace Trustees, told us: \"Emergency repairs will be made to the plinth this spring.\"I was up at the statue last summer with friends and I noticed there was damage beginning to appear.\"When I went back up a few months ago it was looking in a sad way.\"We know what needs to be done and well make a start with the repairs to the plinth in April.\"William Wallaces role in Scotlands history was brought to a world-wide audience by the film Braveheart.But the th century freedom fighter, who was proclaimedof Scotland in Selkirk, had been revered at home for centuries before the Mel Gibson movie.In  David Stuart Erskine, the th Earl of Buchan, commissioned the statue for a site overlooking the Tweed.Although the likeness to Wallace is questionable, and the style of sculpture has a isive effect on opinion, the statue has and continues to attract visitors to the Borders.Isabel Hay from the William Wallace Society believes more should be done to protect the monument.She said: \"I am concerned about the disrepair of the statue.\"It hasnt been looked after and its in the public interest for this tribute to William Wallace to be saved.\"We as a Society want to help preserve the Wallace monument and make sure its condition doesnt get any worse.\"The Saltire Society raised pound, back in  for the monument to be repaired and ed to its original state.And around a decade later the locally-based William Wallace Trustees raised enough money to improve the car park and access path to the statue.But weathering has led to fresh problems with the stonework.Musician Jesse, who made a fundraising song for the statue in the late s, hopes to announce new trustees to look after the statue in the coming weeks as well as plans, which include promotions through a television station, to raise funds for a second phase of preservation works.He added: \"Many of the original Trustees are no longer with us but we have people lined up.\"The second phase of works will include the Claymore - we need to get the emergency repairs done first.\""},{"url":null,"title":"community-given-reassurance-ahead-melrose-sevens","story":"RUGBY chiefs insist they are doing all they can to keep disruption to a minimum during the Melrose Sevens.For the first time, this yearrsquos event will run over four days at Easter.But after local residents expressed their concerns over drunken behaviour at previous tournaments, bosses have been forced to step up their efforts to combat disorder.And last week, the townrsquos community councillors were given reassurance by organisers.Phil Morris, Sevens director at Melrose, said: ldquoWe are listening to all of the suggestions that have been put forward.

It afforded him an invaluable insight into the business, supplemented by day release classes at the nearby Scottish College of Textiles in Galashiels.Additional work placements were undertaken at Ballantyne Sportswearrsquos Caerlee Mills in Innerleithen and at another family-run mill in Dalkeith. By his mid-s, Roly had been appointed mill manager at Ballantynersquos March Street Mills in Peebles.In  the Peebles operation was taken over by DawsonLtd ndash later to become Dawson International plc ndash before a restructuring of the Dawson empire in the mid-s saw Robert Noble Ltd take over as the new management company at March Street Mills.By now Mr Brett has risen to become the firmrsquos production director, and a further change of ownership came in the late s when Robert Noble was sold to Yorkshire-based textile company Moorhouse  Brook. Shortly afterwards Robert Noblersquos new managing director resigned, and Mr Brett was appointed his successor, remaining in post with the company until his retiral in  at the age of .Richard Ryley, a sales director with Robert Noble who worked alongside Mr Brett for  years, described him as a great colleague and incredibly approachable. ldquoHe was respected and well-liked not only by workers at the mill, but by associates in the textile trade throughout the United Kingdom and beyond.ldquoHe possessed great charm, but never shied away from making big or tough decisions. He was a wonderful mentor, and I will always be grateful for his sound advice and the support he willingly gave to myself and to all members of staff.In  he was appointed Deacon of the Scottish Borders Manufacturersrsquo Corporation, later serving as a Walkerburn Community Councillor, and for a time was a director of Live Borders, the culture, sport and leisure trust for the Scottish Borders.However, without a doubt the most important event in Roly Brettrsquos le was his marriage to Betty Taylor, at that time working as an auditor with Edinburgh firm Rolleston Somerville. They first met by chance, as Rolyrsquos cousin Alastair happened to be going out with Bettyrsquos flatmate Stroma.Love quickly blossomed, and Roly and Betty were married in Strathdon Church, Aberdeenshire, on September , . After honeymooning in Perthshire, the couple set up home in a rented cottage at Cardrona, then at Kaimend, Innerleithen, before a final move in  to the family home at Caberston House, Walkerburn.The couplersquos four sons - Chris, Jeremy, Mike and Alex ndash were all schooled locally and shared their fatherrsquos passion for sport and motor cars. Family le meant everything to Roly, with Betty and the boys always at the centre of his le.His exploits on the cricket field matched his business achievements. A member of the England Schools side that included future test stars Mike Brearley and Richard Hobbs, the young all-rounder turned down a county contract with Lancashire and opted instead to play his cricket north of the border.An elegant batsman and skilful off-spin bowler, Rolyrsquos cricket career included spells with the Dunfermline, Kelso and Selkirk clubs. He captained Selkirk on their ground-breaking tour to Barbados in , and the following year led the Souters to a Border League  Border Knock-out Cup double.Once his playing days were over, Roly qualied as a cricket coach, helping steer the South of Scotland u- side to its first Scottish Championship.A familiar adversary during his cricketing career was Gala wicket-keeper Ronnie Murray. ldquoRoly was a breath of fresh air when he first arrived on the Border scene, said Ronnie. ldquoHe was an excellent all-rounder, a true sportsman and also great fun to be with.ldquoHe played in a very good Kelso team that included players like John Rutherford and Michael Taylor, before helping inspire Selkirk to a string of successes in the s. You could always depend on Roly to anchor an innings, while he had a knack of picking up quick wickets when he came on to bowl.Golf was another sport at which he excelled, twice winning the Woollen Merchants  Manufacturers Cup, competed for annually at Sunningdale. The ornate trophy is kept on display at the British Golf Museum in St Andrews.As well as being a member of Peebles Golf Club, he also held memberships with Luffness Golf Club in East Lothian and Port Salon Golf Club in Donegal, close to Rathmullan where his father moved after retiring from the army.An interest in classic cars led to the ownership of a number of models being kept at Walkerburn over the years, including a vintage Daimler, Porsche and Mercedes SL.In  Mr Brett was diagnosed with frontal lobe dementia, a progressive condition affecting behaviour, personality and speech.As the disease began to take its inevitable toll, the love and support shown by Betty, members of his family and close friends , in addition to the kindness and understanding shown by staff in the BGHrsquos Cauldshiels Ward and at Murray House, Kelso, ensured Roly received the best possible care in his final months.Mr Brett is survived by Betty and their four sons, his sister Jo, brother Will, daughters-in-law Denise, Shona, Debbie and Mumba, and by eight grandchildren.A service of thanksgiving for Roly Brettrsquos le will be held in the Borders Crematorium, Melrose, on Tuesday, March , at pm.J.D.R.S."},{"url":null,"title":"dates-confirmed-2020-innerleithen-music-festival","story":"ORGANISERS have announced that this years Innerleithen Music Festival will take place during the weekend of August -to-.Now in its th year the festival continues to provide a great  for fantastic music in the heart of the Borders.True to its tradition there will be events taking place across multiple venues in Innerleithen.And, as usual, much of the activity will be centred at the Vale Club where lsquoLive and Localrsquo will be staged over the three days.Andy Wright from Innerleithen Music Festival said: \"The Innerleithen Music Festival has a strong reputation amongst artists and audience alike.\"Bands and singers approach us throughout the year enquiring about performance opportunities.\"Over the years we have showcased hundreds of bands and solo performers from across Scotland and farther afield, including such household names as Eddie Reader, Capercaillie, Skipinnish as well as traditional music favourites Phil and Aly.\"Last year one of our largest audiences was for local musician and rising star Tommy Ashby who is currently carving out a great reputation on the national music scene.\"Ahead of the festival this summer a fundraising concert will be held in the Union Club on Saturday, March .Already confirmed for next months concert are Redwood Rejects, Soul , All the Angels, Bobs Boiler Room and Dylan Paterson.Tickets go on sale from lsquoThe Hub on the High Streetrsquo, Innerleithen on March ."},{"url":null,"title":"gareths-newspaper-snaps-help-replace-peebles-high-camera","story":"A local photographer who captured haunting images of firefighters tackling the blaze at Peebles High School has donated the profits of his pictures to the school.Award winning photographer Gareth Easton was in Peebles when his children, both pupils at Peebles High, called to say the school was on fire.This week he spoke to reporter and former colleague Hilary Scott, about how he turned his pictures of the pupils running from the burning school, into an image of students with beaming smiles.INNERLEITHEN photographer Gareth Easton has snapped murder scenes, G riots, drugs raids, and even gambled with his own le aboard a trawler by capturing the danger inherent in commercial fishing ndash which netted him a national award.Never did he imagine that his next big job would be photographing the inferno of the secondary school both his children attend.ldquoOn the day of the fire I was working in Peebles.

and minimise the spread of the Coronavirus.Nicole Rogers, Solicitor at DAS Law, has been looking at the impact this has on workers rights and pay.If I feel that I should be lsquoself-isolatingrsquo, can my employer deduct my pay for the time I am away from work This will depend on the facts.If you are otherwise fit for work but are taking precautionary steps by lsquoself-isolatingrsquo, technically you are not entitled to pay.However, it is good practice for employers not to deduct pay in these situations.An employee would usually be lsquoself-isolatingrsquo on the advice of a doctor and it is sensible for an employer to show understanding in order to fulfil health and safety obligation and maintain good staff relations.In addition, to withhold pay could encourage an employee toto work prematurely which might potentially risk spreading the virus.Many employers can allow temporary flexible working arrangements where employees can work from home.What are my rightsIrsquom quarantined and my boss refuses to pay my salary If you have contracted the virus, normal rules around sick pay will apply and you will either receive Statutory Sick Payor contractual sick pay.If your employer has specically told you not to come into the workplace as you have been in or to an affected area, you would ordinarily receive your normal pay.What is unclear is a situation where an employee remains off work as they have been quarantined or recommended to isolate themselves.In those circumstances, it would not strictly be considered as sick as the reason for the absence isnrsquot because the employee is unwell and therefore has no entitlement to sick pay.There may be a contractual clause relating to such circumstances and how this time off should be paid.In the absence of any contractual clause, the position will be that the leave will be unpaid .Can I be forced to use my annual leaveI am lsquoself-isolatingrsquo You cannot be forced to use annual leaveyou are medically unfit for work.However in many other circumstances, your employer can force you to take annual leavethey provide you with adequate notice twice the amount of the days you are being forced to take.For example, to force you to use  daysrsquo holiday, your employer must give you  daysrsquo notice.Again, this may risk good staff relations and given that employers and employees will likely be unfamiliar in dealing with a health crisis of this magnitude, it will be good practice for both parties to mutually agree how leave will be taken.,params: .pushWill I be paid statutory sick pay while Irsquom away from work Onlyyou are medically unfit for work and meet the eligibility criteria for Statutory Sick Pay.Will my pay be affectedI have to stay at home due to my childrsquos school being

employer as soon as possible and advise, where practicable, how long the disruption is likely to last.This time off is unpaid but you may request to use this time as paid annual leave.If I am on a lsquozero hoursrsquo contract will I lose pay for the time I am away from work Genuine zero-hour workers have no right to be offered work and no obligation to accept work.Therefore, you will likely have no right to pay.In the event that you have been advised to self-isolate, your employer will be entitled to simply not offer you any work until the isolation period has

Catriona, although only -years-old, seems mature beyond her years, taking the lead role in her stride, proving to be every inch the sophisticated s New Yorker.And Jacks lead role as Billy is perfectly paired with his unlikely partner, found in Dan Wilsons portrayal of Public Enemy , Moonface Martin. The duo first meet when stowing themselves away on the cruise liner, and their hare-brained schemes get them into some serious trouble, but also provides plenty of entertainment.A notable performance comes from Holly Nichol, who makes her GAOS principal role debut as the feisty and sassy nightclub singer, Reno Sweeney. Hollys passion for musical theatre is clear in her performance. Reno is a pivotal role, featuring in many musical numbers, and Holly doesnt miss a beat.A heavy dose of comedy is packed into this performance, whether drunk Eli Whitney, played by Simon Thomson, slurring around the ship, trying his hardest to woo the high-strung Mrs Harcourt, or the bumbling idiot, Lord Evelyn Oakleigh, who manages to make a mess of even the simplest of New York sayings.The audience will double over in laughter as James Bennetts performance of the incredibly posh Evelyn raises eyebrows, and Excalibur, when he sees Reno in her nightgown.As well as their top talent as actors and singers, this productions cast show they also have what it takes in the dancing department too. From the high kicks in the opening number, I Get a Kick Out of You, to the tap dancing break in the Act One finale performance of Anything Goes, members of the audience will be transfixed.Congratulations must go to musical director Jeff Thomson for creating a remarkable show.CAST LISTBilly Crocker - Jack McAuleyHope Harcourt - Catriona LambReno Sweeney - Holly NicholMoonface Martin - Dan WilsonErma - Jess ThomsonEvelyn Oakleigh - James BennettEvangeline Harcourt - Lorraine KempElisha J.

She was full of old stories. She had come to East Lothian when she was a young girl and lived there ever since. But she brought with her the stories she had been told when she was wee. They were tales told to her by her grandfather, a crofter from the west of Scotland, who had moved his family to the north east in hard times. Her grandfather had shared the stories collected by folklorist Donald Mackenzie, who wrote Wonder Tales from Scottish Myth and Legend.Now, in her old age, she loved sharing her version of these stories with her grandchildren. They were a mix of old legends and she knew that there were dferent versions. But the version told to her by her grandfather was of course her favourite.Her grandchildren settled around her fireplace and sipped their hot chocolate in anticipation. Their gran always sat in silence for a moment before speaking. It was asshe was waiting for a curtain to raise in their imagination.Then she began her story.ldquoBeria was the queen orsquo the dark times, the ruler of winter. She wis tall and strang. In fact she carried a great hammer, with which she made the Scottish mountains. She had a fearsome temper and looked scary, with one eye and lang white hair. There are mony stories aboot her, this is just ane orsquo them.ldquoYe see, while she ruled winter, at this time orsquo year, the signs orsquo spring began tae appear, and she felt she wis loosing her power. People grew less feart orsquo her and began tae resist her power. They looked forrit tae the arrival orsquo the summer queen, who wis carsquod Bride. She was the bringer of light and plentul times, and so people loved her and looked forward to her arrival. Beria was jealous orsquo her.ldquoThis is why Beria kept Bride a prisoner. She made Bride work hard and kept her in ragged claes.ldquoLike Cinderella! exclaimed the youngest, excitedly. Her gran smiled and nodded.ldquoBut Bride managed tae escape, helped by the man she loved, who became known as King Angus, and ever since people have celebrated that day. It wis oan February , but many years ago the calendar changed, and sae itrsquos February  that I celebrate Bridersquos day.ldquoAnd sae Bride wis free and wore new claes, which were bright and colourful. She set aboot sowing the seeds orsquo spring. She sprinkled snawdraps, and the blossom was encouraged tae bloom. The first bird tae sing in celebration of Bridersquos freedom was a wee linnet. Its sweet singing filled the air with the sound orsquo spring, and ever since folk huv carsquod the linnet lsquoThe Bird orsquo Bridersquo.ldquoBut what about Beria, wasnrsquot she mad that Bride escaped  asked one of her grandchildren.ldquoIrsquom coming tae that. She wis indeed. When she heard that Bride had escaped, she was furious, her rage knew no limits! She knew that this would end her power. She tried tae capture her again but she fled with Angus. Sae Beira took her great hammer and struck the ground with it, making ice and frost tae kill the grass and flowers that had dared tae start grawing. But the linnets continued to sing and this encouraged mair birds tae sing as well. It became a chorus.ldquoEnraged, Beria collected her servants, who were hags who rode on shaggy goats, while she rode on a huge black steed. They raised storms and winds tae silence the birds, and tae blow ower trees and strip them orsquo branches.ldquoThen she pursquod dark clouds ower the land, and ripped them open, sae cauld rain drenched the land, destroying food and making the soil drookit, killing livestock and ruining peoplersquos hames.ldquoWow, Beria was angry, and pretty mean too, said a grandchild.ldquoAye, she wis. She wanted tae keep winter going sae her power would last longer. She whipped up a gale wi a wind sae cauld and sharp it felt like a bird pecking at yer skin. It lasted fir mair than a week!ldquoWi arsquo these storms fishermen couldnae fish, the food orsquo folk was being wasted as the fodder and winter stores were ravaged by the storms.ldquoBut then March arrived and mair light filled the days. This increased the strength orsquo Bride, the summer queen, who ed with her husband Angus to sow mair seeds orsquo spring.ldquoIn a last desperate attempt tae keep her power, Beria took three days orsquo deep winter she hud kept aside, and used them tae bring blizzards and snowstorms. She coated the land in a white freezing blanket.ldquoBut after these three days, the winter queenrsquos power wis spent. Bride and Angus once again ed, riding through the countryside, chasing awa the hags and sowing spring wherever they went. The birds sang their heids off.ldquoIt wis arsquo over for Beria, at least for this winter. She fled, throwing her hammer underneath a holly tree, which is why nae grass grows under a holly tree. She hid for a while on top orsquo a mountain on the Isle of Skye, carsquod Beinn na Caillich. But she was weak now, and when the days and nights became equal inshe knew her reign was over.ldquoSae she retreated to the Green Island tae drink frae the magic well orsquo youth, tae replenish her strength. She bade her time there, kenning she would be able taeand reclaim her throne when darkness once again ed tae the land.ldquoIn autumn, said one of the children.ldquoAye, smiled the gran.ldquoAnd thatrsquos why we hae arsquo these winds and storms just noo.

So the number they have is partially due to that response.\": Scotland facing chronic shortage of consultantsA WHO report published on Friday February  credited Chinas \"aggressive response\" for curtailing the spread of the virus.The number of new cases peaked in early February and has been slowing ever since, while transmission has escalated in the rest of the world.The WHO report said China had \"rolled out perhaps the most ambitious, agile, and aggressive disease containment effort in history\", and in doing so \"has changed the course of a rapidly escalating and deadly epidemic.Interventions included the lockdown of Wuhan - the city at the centre of the outbreak - and nearby cities in Hubei province.Elsewhere in China people voluntarily quarantined themselves with their compliance monitored by appointed neighbourhood leaders.Two new dedicated hospitals were built in Wuhan within a week - with many of the beds now lying empty - and aggressive \"social distancing\" measures were implemented, such as cancelling sporting fixtures, closing theatres and cinemas, and extending the Chinese New Year school holidays.WHO scientists who visited hospitals, railway stations, food markets, and other public spaces described \"a sense of responsibility and collective action...therersquos war footing to get things done.In Western democracies, such stringent controls and cooperation are harder to imagine, but the UK governments battle plan includes potential measures such as school closures, putting the Army on standby to help fill gaps in emergency services arising from an outbreak, giving health boards the power to detain people with the virus and stop them from travelling, or forcing those suspected of having the virus to be tested and quarantined under court order.Professor Kao believes the -% figure for peak outbreak in the UK has probably been extrapolated using something called the \"basic reproduction number\", a theoretical model used by scientists to predict the limits of an outbreak.He added: \"Its a funny thing because you want to motivate people enough to listen, but you dont want to scare them.\"You want them to do the things that are sensible. If people dont take it seriously, theyre pretty much going to go about their daily business.\"That includes people who are a little bit sick still going to work, or still sending their kids to school.\"So what youre trying to do is say look,we actually do nothing, these are the kinds of numbers we could end up with.\"A Scottish Government spokesmansaid: ldquoA lsquoreasonable worst case scenariorsquo would be that -% of the population might become infected.

Initially, it consisted of a single layer of gauze which at first proved somewhat ineffective in preventing surgical wound sepsis, until a second layer was added to create more separation between the mask and the mouth.They developed from there Over time, advances were made in the field, with further research seeing design changes that made masks more efficient, including making them bigger, the inclusion of filters and the integration of antibiotics or antiviral coatings to increase protection.One thing remains the same The ear-loop design that holds it in place has remained the same through the generations.They were already popular in Asian countries The practice of wearing face masks began in Japan during the early th century during the global Spanish flu pandemic that killed around  million people. Covering faces with scarves and veils became common practice and then, after an earthquake in  in Japan, face masks were again worn to protect against ash and smoke in the air.In Chinese medicine, breathing is also seen as key to maintaining good \"qi\" ndash positive energy - in the body, perhaps encouraging their wear.But do they work There is a long-standing debate over how effective they are, with key factors including the material used, how often they are changed andthey are worn correctly. Experts have also warned that the Covid- virus could even enter the body through the eyes, which most masks do not cover. Public Health England also said that ldquoAlthough there is a perception that the wearing of facemasks may be beneficial, there is in fact very little evidence of widespread benefit from their use outside of these clinical settings.\"However Sales are rocketing as anxious consumers buy so many of them, prices are surging and counterfeit products are surfacing online.

Itrsquos that containment measures and closures ndash should they prove necessary ndash create practical headaches, too shutting a school, for example, will almost certainly take out of action a lot of healthcare workers, as would public transport restrictions.If it turns out that widespread ldquoself-isolation becomes necessary, it will obviously have a huge impact on such frontline services, and on sectors such as retail, logistics and hospitality.A lot of other parts of the economy, however, may be surprisingly resilient. Itrsquos dficult to find out how many of those employed in the UK would be ableto work from home, but itrsquos likely to be a fair number. Most people who spend the majority of their time on a computer and telephone ndash which must be a signicant proportion of the workforce ndash could as easily do that at home.Managers, professionals, administrative and secretarial workers are more than  per cent of all those employed not all of them will be able to do everything remotely, but five years ago, more than  per cent of the UK workforceworked almost exclusively from home. At that stage, it was estimated that half the UK workforce would work remotely by .That obviously isnrsquot the case, and I donrsquot suppose that anyone would regard it as a vindication of the predictionit were to happen this year, but only as a result of a pandemic that had us all quarantined in our bedrooms, checking in with the office on Skype, Slack or Microsoft Teams.But given we have such tools for security, video-conferencing, multi-user messaging and real-time supervision, itrsquos rather odd that ldquotelecommuting hasnrsquot become the default for more jobs. With the exception of a few industries, remote working tends to be something that, for those who do it at all, is confined to a day or two a week, rather than the norm.Yet, as well as the obvious savings for employers in providing office space, as well as ancillary costs , all the research suggests that those who work mainly from home are more productive, motivated and happier. The advantages arenrsquot just flexibility in work le balance or quality of living there are real material advantages in commuting and housing costs ndash especially for those who live outside major cities.We should be using the necessity for such measures during our current dficulties to overcome the resistance to introducing this kind of model much more widely. Think, for example, of the boon for meeting climate targets,we could take a few million daily commuters out of the equation, and the likely geographical redistribution of skilled work and income.Imagine the savings in care costs that would be produced with a more flexible workforce, the boost to small businesses and local high streetspeople popped out from home, on foot or by bicycle, for their errands, rather than concentrating their spending around office blocks in city centres.If it comes to that, it could have a profound impact on housing, one of the great distortions in the economy, by allowing the repurposing of city centre offices for accommodation, while offering those who prefer the country or the suburbs the ability to work there instead.

They asserted that it went against current council policy, which dictates that there should be no permanent increases to the current officer establishment.At the end of discussions, the council leader received more support, and councillor Stockan’s motion won,  votes to seven.However, at a general meeting of the council yesterday, Tuesday, the council leader agreed that the issue should be referred back to the policy and resources committee, following a further call by Councillor Tullock.Councillor Tullock said that he made his amendment in light of the failure of Scottish Government to provide a budget settlement to OIC, plus the concerns expressed to him by his constituents on the issue.Councillor Stockan said that he himself had received support for the establishment of the post, but he was happy to have it taken back to committee.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

If Singapore — a city-state with no rural areas — is the economic model for those who inform this Government’s thinking then it speaks volumes about their priorities. This London-focused vision of the United Kingdom risks undermining the future of farmers, crofters and fishermen – and the communities that rely on them.“These views seem to be expressed at the heart of Government decision-making, and the pattern is all too similar to when the UK joined the Common Fisheries Policy. The Tory Government at the time claimed it would protect UK fishermen while privately dismissing them as “expendable”.He continued: “The Government must remember that the United Kingdom is far more than simply London or London’s financial sector. We should embrace and enhance the geographic and economic ersity of the United Kingdom, not toss it away in the name of a single-minded metropolitan view.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

After a third-place finish in the North District event in December and a fth place finish in the Inter Districts event in January, expectations were high for another strong performance in what is the flagship age grade cross country championship of the season.A field of  athletes took to the start line at Callendar Park in conditions which saw everything from sunshine, wind, hail and snow.

From the former perspective, the big positive about the Scots so far this year is that they have conceded the fewest tries and the least points of any of the six teams. Few would have predicted that a month ago.Hamish Watson got the nod for man of the match against the Italians, another indication that the open-side flanker is back to his very best. Others to stand out were loose-head prop Rory Sutherland, the find of the tournament, and Watson’s back row colleague Jamie Ritchie.Elsewhere at the weekend France proved just too good for Wales in Cardf, and are now the only side left with the chance of a Grand Slam. The French have been very impressive this season and have about five or six players who would be in a combined Six Nations team so far.At Twickenham there was a typical battle between two outfits who prefer brute strength to artistry. What little flair was evident mostly emanated from Ireland in the latter stages, but England had got so far ahead by half-time the game was really over.Sadly once again we had a referee, this time Jaco Peyper, seemingly unwilling to penalise a side which is consistently in breach of the offside rule.Irish fly-half Jonny Sexton, who had an awful game himself including making a complete mess of two kicks, could regularly be seen complaining to the referee. That even included pointing to players who were blatantly in the wrong place, but Peyper refused to take action.Only midway through the second half, when the Irish were all but buried, did Peyper appear to notice that so many white shirts were lying on the wrong side of the ball. I found that absolutely baffling.A week on Sunday Scotland will be in action again, this time back at Murrayfield against leaders France. That could be close, with the French chasing a clean sweep and the Scots still harbouring hopes of finishing third or fourth in the table.While the Finn Russell saga shows no sign of sorting itself out, and Adam Hastings likely to continue at number  despite being out of touch against Italy, it would be good to have a couple of players back from injury. The presence of either winger Darcy Graham and lock back row Sam Skinner would strengthen things in both departments.Team of the tournament so far: Elliot DalyJonny May , Robbie Henshaw , Gael Fickou , Mattia BelliniRomain Ntamack , Antoine DupontC J Stander , Jamie Ritchie , Gregory AlldrittAlun Wyn Jones , Bernard Le RouxRory Sutherland , Julien Marchand , Joe Marler .: : : : : : : :Two of my favourite footballers, in my opinion the greatest ever strikers from their respective international sides, celebrated their th birthdays over the past week.Last Thursday it was the turn of Jimmy Greaves, who sadly is not in good health having suffered a serious stroke five years ago.A documentary on BT Sport that evening covered all aspects of Greaves’ career, ranging from his early days at Cha, a big money move to AC Milan, theto Tottenham Hotspur, the shock transfer to West Ham and his final days in non-league football.The programme also touched on the hepatitis which he suffered from during the - season. He was warned that he would lose up to a yard in pace as a result of the illness, but bounced back with four goals in an away victory over Norway.Then came the  World Cup, an injury against France and Greaves’ omission from the side for the final. To see his replacement Geoff Hurst, who was an inferior player, score a hat trick and ultimately receive a knighthood, must have been dficult for Greaves. But typically he was magnanimous about the issue.At the end of his West Ham career Greaves succumbed to severe alcoholism, which brought his contract to an end. After four years away from the game he made a comeback with Barnet among other non-league clubs, and although still impressive his best was long gone.Greaves later forged a new career in television, first with Star Soccer and then more famously as the funny half of the Saint and Greavsie double act with Ian St John.I have to laugh when the likes of Gary Lineker and Harry Kane are sometimes compared to Greaves. Watching old footage reveals how a good number of his goals involved running from just inside the opposition half, beating two or three players and then rounding the keeper. Comparison  There really is none.On Monday it was the th for Denis Law, my boyhood hero and favourite player of all time.Law has also not enjoyed the best of health, suffering from debilitating eye problems and also from prostate cancer. But happily he appears to be in reasonable fettle at the moment, well enough to appear at the recent BBC Sports Personality of the Year event and attend former Manchester United team mate Harry Gregg’s funeral at the weekend.They say it is not always advisable to meet your heroes, but I would gladly pay money to interview Law.: : : : : : : :It was reported last week that Neil Fenwick is in the frame for the Shetland football manager’s job.If that turns out to be the case then good luck to the Lerwick Spurs player coach.When the position was first advertised last year the wording suggested it would be a dficult task, with the applicant likely to need a strong back-up team. That probably explains why so few people came forward.I’m not convinced anyone needs to be going through an interview process over this. None of the most successful people to have held the position were subjected to such scrutiny, and they mostly did the job very well.If Fenwick is indeed the man, let’s all get behind him.: : : : : : : :There is obviously still plenty of power in the conveyor belt which produces Shetland athletics talent, as evidenced by the success of young Layla Todd at the weekend.The -year-old’s fourth-place finish in the Scottish National Cross Country Championships was a tremendous achievement, a credit to both her and her coaches.With distance runner Seumas MacKay now too old for the junior inter-county squad and sprinter Katie Dinwoodie just having a year or two left, it will be necessary for younger competitors to fill the void. Todd will likely be one of those in the frame soon for the , metres event.: : : : : : : :Boxer Tyson Fury’s display against Deontay Wilder on Sunday morning, to claim the WBC heavyweight crown, was sensational.After the previous draw between the two, when Fury was ahead on points but floored twice late on, many predicted that this time Wilder would have his measure. No chance.Whatever you think of the so-called “gypsy king”, who has not always endeared himself to the general public, he is massive box-office entertainment.Wilder may still be given a third fight, which would be disappointing, or Fury’s next outing could be a unication battle with fellow Briton Anthony Joshua.That could well be a mismatch, as Fury appears to be in a dferent league from the muscle-bound Joshua.

He works extensively at Westminster, Dublin and Stormont.In the late s, he was music critic for the News Letter and contributed to the New Musical Express.He says he uses music to escape from the pain of supporting Everton, Cltonville and Ballymena Rugby Club, not to mention the politics.And he equivocates excellently in true political fashion over his choices - and how they could all change overnight!He says: “The problem with picking a Top Ten is my taste can change from time to time. So perhaps the best option is mixing some old favourites with a few which only made the grade recently.” . Anyone who knows me will not be surprised my first pick will be a Van Morrison track. There are so many which mean so much. Caravan, In the Garden, Tupelo Honey among dozens of classic songs. But I’ve decided to go with a track from the new album Three Chords and the Truth. Morrison thrives when he dips into spirituality and mysticism. At  the Man still has it. The song is Dark Night of the Soul, Van Morrison.  Glen Hansard’s music has been a source of much enjoyment in recent years. Great tunes but my choice is a track featuring Clarence Clemons’ son Jake. Drive All Night, Glen Hansard  John Martyn was a genius. His music transcends styles and fashions. Solid Air one of the finest albums ever produced. This song is just beautul.May You Never, John Martyn. .Nick Drake died a young man but left a powerful legacy of fine music. This song is particularly haunting. Northern Sky, Nick Drake  Following a pattern here, this artist is also dead. Sandy Denny remains a personal favourite. The combination of her voice and the genius of Richard Thompson leaves a song which will never grow old. Who Knows Where the Time Goes, Fairport Convention.  There has to be some sweet soul music. The Rev Al Green remains a voice without equal. Let’s Stay Together, Al Green.  In the same direction, Marvin Gaye could melt the hardest heart. His music both political and romantic. Of course, he’s dead too.What’s Going On, Marvin Gaye . Big fan of the Waterboys. Mike Scott is immensely talented. This is a wonderful version of a Van song from Astral Weeks. Sweet Thing, The Waterboys.  The Alabama Three never receive the plaudits which they deserve. Woke Up This Morning is generally the band’s signature tune but this is even better. Hello..I’m Johnny Cash, Alabama Three . Just love J J Cale. This track is magical. Cocaine by J J Cale My choice will probably change next week and I’m amazed I’ve missed Springsteen and Peter Green’s Fleetwood Mac. But that’s it for now, pop pickers.

My love of music comes from sitting in the back bedroom of the house listening to my parentsrecord collection, Jim Reeves, The Platters, Bobby Darrin and Ray Charles amongst others.My sister Patricia and I would also try and listen to Radio Luxemburg and Radio when we were not be asked to turn it down!For many years I was a DJ in the town, mobile at the start but ended up working in clubs, got to perform in Burberrys, Kelly’s amongst others, but ended up in Tullyglass- Maxwells Plum!For the last  years of that type of work, stopped when I was  as I just didn’t want to play the dance music they wanted me too!I used to promote bands in the George and McKendry’s, best bands at that time on the local circuit where, Ghost of an American Airman, Carpenter Joe, Violet Sky and the famous Blues Brothers nights with Otis and the Elevators, great days indeed.I suppose my lasting mark will be as a founder member of Radio Cracker in Ballymena, along with Andy Thompson, Ernie Kilpatrick and many others So, here’s my Top  in no particular order –. Van Morrison – Tupelo Honey, lesser known song from the Belfast Cowboy that in all the times I have seen him live, he has naturally never played!. The Waterboys – Whole of the Moon - just a wonderful anthem of my youth and still such a great song today, took me a long time to realise the lyric was a comparison between two people, “I see the crescent, you see the whole of the moon”. Sam Baker – Broken Fingers, a Texan who “got caught up in someone ’s war” after terrible injuries learned to play the guitar again and wrote this song about the process, read the back story before listening.. Dr Feelgood – All Through the City – first live band I seen in Belfast at  years old, had a huge impact on me and after all these years, Jim Bolan thank you for taking me!. Foy Vance – Two Shades of Hope – a wonderful singer songwriter from our wee country, and what a song!. Linda Rondstadt – Your No Good - I have probably bought this album times in dferent formats, loved it from no age.. David Bowie – Heroes - A song and artist who came alive for me when I went to Live Aid with John Connor in , best performance of the day . Bap Kennedy – Working Man – from the fantastic Sailors Revenge album, sadly Bap is not with us anymore, greatly missed. Was lucky enough to have him play at my th birthday party in the BT club, Vincent Close got him to do some Energy Orchard stuff!. Van Morrison – Into the Mystic- is there a better song to raise the spirit, “let your soul and spirit fly into the mystic” ace. The Undertones – You’ve got my number , I could be spotted from an early age jumping up and down on a dance floorafter forcing a DJto play it!

For these were not just trad troubadours whose genius would grace any stage where Irish music is celebrated but each of them in turn was exemplary in passing on the tradition to the next generation.Mayo harpist Laoise Kelly, who reminded us that the cry in Ireland from our betters was once, ‘hang the harpists and destroy their instruments’, not only excels at our national instrument but has founded an international school for an cláirseach on Achill Island. No better person to pick up the Musician of the Year Award.Ned Kelly from Tipperary, a box player, has inspired an entire community to use music to give hope with his ‘In Tune for Le’ traditional orchestra — scores of whom played from the balconies at the Waterfront Hall as his accordion raised the roof in Béal Feirste Cois Cuain.Then there was the golden-voicedheartbroken Lilis Ó Laoire from the Donegal Gaeltacht whose voice and values connect us with an area where language and song are the very backbone of the community. Lilis had buried his mother the previous day and his presence paid homage to all those who had acted as a bridge of song from the past to the present day. His rousing closing number – a traditional ditty rewritten to mark the event — was a highwater mark of an outstanding evening. Ón osna is sine a thig an ceol is binne, as Seosamh Mac Grianna observed Full marks to the set-designers who used images of Belfast to illuminate a glittering gathering – the shards from the surface of the Titanic Centre, the dome from the Dome of Delight and the yellow cranes in comic-book style —and kudos also to TG for bringing these awards to Belfast for the third year in a row. Maximum Respect. Meas Mór.Both those who attended and those who followed the live broadcast on TG were, indeed, “immeasurably enriched” by the Gradam Ceoil Awards, as the VIP who opened the Waterfront Hall had predicted.And who was he Prince Charles, of course.You can watch back at Gradam Ceoil on the TG player at www.tg.ie"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"from street busker to empire headliner","story":"JOHN Garrity is a familiar face to many around Belfast city centre, entertaining shoppers with his on-street busking.Originally from Enniskillen, the -year-old has made Belfast his home ever since ing from a spell in America and next month is set to headline a gig in the Empire with companion Jonathan Cariaga in a duo known as the  Johnatones.John, who has had a lelong passion for music, decided he wanted to have a shot at making a living from it.“When I left school, I was doing my best to focus on music. It was mostly country back then but now, it is totally dferent,” he explained.“The country scene isn’t as big so I have been out broadening my style and have started to write my own material.“Busking has been good for me and that is where people recognise me from. It was a bit of luck in that I bit the bullet and went out and did it.“It is great when people come up and ask for a photo which is all a bit surreal and new to me but I am enjoying it.”John hit the headlines in July last year after coming under attack when singing the ballad Grace in Donegall Place. He was verbally abused by a mystery woman, who went on to kick over his equipment. Footage of the incident went viral on social media, with John receiving widespread support at the time. He bounced back from the incident and says it hasn’t deterred him from singing the love song about Joseph Plunkett and Grace Gford.“I think it was just bad timing. I picked myself up and moved on quickly enough.“I don’t see Grace as a republican song. For me, it is very much a love song. People can have their own judgement on it but I love it and that one-off incident won’t stop me from keeping singing it.”John received publicity of a more positive note earlier this year when he caught the attention of Irish band Kodaline following his stunning performance of their song ‘All I Want’.The viral rendition also caught the attention of the band#s lead singer, Steve Garrigan, who wants John to join the band on stage at their next Belfast gig.John is enjoying unprecedented popularity thanks to his internet fame and is now doing more gigs than busking.In his biggest ever gig in Belfast, John, who previously appeared on the hit TV show Britain’s Got Talent, will take to the stage of the Empire Hall in Botanic Avenue on Sunday, March  for his biggest show to date.Looking ahead to the gig, an excited John said: “Things are good at the minute and we seem to be doing really well. We have been working hard and the style of our play is starting to take shape.“We are very excited about our first big gig in the Empire. Tickets have been flying out and there are only a few left at this stage.“It is going to be a big night and we are expecting a big crowd.“This is will be the biggest gig we have ever had and hopefully won’t be the last.“I would encourage people to buy a ticket and come along. It is going to be a lot dferent toyou have heard me on the streets or in the bars.”John’s sidekick Jonathan Cariagais originally from Argentina and has now made Belfast his home after teaming up with him.“I wanted to study music at university in Dublin and planned to only stay in Belfast a few months,” he told us. “I got some work gigging and have been here over three years now.“I was playing around bars in the city centre and got in contact with John. We met on a Thursday and by Sunday, we were playing together. We really enjoyed doing it together and haven’t looked back since.“It is really fun working with John. He is a really free and open singer so we can play whatever we want all the time.“I am so excited about the gig in the Empire. I really like the place and always wanted to play there.”John Garrity live in concert at the Belfast Empire is on Sunday, March . Doors open at pm.

And caps. I have quite a nice collection of headwear, worn and aged, like myself, dispersed between Dublin and Belfast, Donegal, the car boot and all the places in between. It used to be customary for men to wear headware. Look at any old photos. Dunchers and flatcaps galore. Peaky blinders in multitudes outside factories, mills, shipyards, farmyards, public houses, marts, markets, country fairs. Hats were also popular. Paddy hats, trilbys, bowlers. Though bowlers were more for Orangemen on parade or English civil servants on The Mall. Country men were hat and cap people. Christy Ring even played hurling in a cap. So my grá for head gear used to be widespread. And now its coming back into vogue. Especially the omnipresent baseball cap. It is the preferred head covering for rappers, golfers, other sports people, urban youth.I have a couple of baseball caps. And a few hand-knitted wooly hats. Síle Darragh knitted me a dark blue tea cosy-type one. Lucilita a white one. Both were too big. But very warm all the same. Wooly ear warmers. There are really fine knitted yokes for sale in expensive shops in the west of Ireland. But they are very dear. I covet one of those. Hint hint. Extra Large.I also have a Stetson. It was presented to me in Texas. It has an enormous brim. I only wear it indoors, usually while watching Westerns on TV. I haven’t the nerve to wear it outdoors. Before the presentation our man in America, Larry Downes, was very concerned that the Stetson should not be a black one. Apparently the bad guys wore black ones. So he insisted that my Stetson would be white. So it is. I never told Larry but I preferred a black one. I favour Jesse James or Billy the Kid over Hopalong Cassidy or The Lone Ranger. But Larry had his way.I have another hat which I’m also shy about wearing outdoors although I like it very much. It’s not unlike the one Martin McGuinness wore during the Easter Centenary events. I wore mine as well. I would like to have the nerve to wear it more often the way Martin started to do. Martins hat now features in many posters and pictures of him. I think the hat darkens his face too much and he looks too stern. He was stern sometimes but my best memories of Martin are when he was hatless and happy.One day he and I were going to see Brit Secretary of State Peter Mandelson. On the coat stand outside his office a hat was perched. To Martin’s chagrin I put the hat on my head and we breezed in to talk to Peter.“I have a hat like that” Peter told me cheerfully. “I wear it in the grounds of Hillsborough House.”“If you want to get ahead get a hat,” I replied, removing it and placing it on my knee. “You have very good taste in headware. That’s something we have in common.”When we finished our meeting I put Peter’s hat back on my head and Martin and I left.“You can’t take his hat,” Martin hissed at me. “That’s stealing”.“Stealing! They stole our country,” I said. “In the gospel according to Cleaky, I’m liberating it. This is appropriating the Imperialist Misappropriators.” Cleaky was a great liberator. An outstanding appropriator.One time in Australia John Little gave RG and me some fine head covers. We picked up two Koalas as well. Ach is é sín scéal eile. But that’s another story. No Koalas were harmed in the telling of this tale.I like tweed caps. I have one which belonged to my friend, the late Kevin McKenna. We swapped caps one time. I wear Kevin’s cap regularly. I also have a cap belonging to another friend, the late Stan Corrigan. His lovely we Kathleen gave me it. It is that cap which triggered this column. I lost it last week after the recent Ard Chomairle meeting in Dublin which mandated Mary Lou to explore the possibilty of agreeing a Programme for A Government For Change.I was distraught about the loss of Stan’s cap. I realised very quickly after the meeting that it was missing. But where  I enlisted the help of Saint Anthony. Again.Was it in Dawn Doyle’s car  No she told me when I phoned her. Or out the back of Ard Oig where RG picked me up  No. There was no sight of it when Keith searched the back lane in the dark in the midst of Storm Ciara.Next morning the search continued. I prowled the back lane of Ard Oig before being summoned heartbroken into a meeting. While I was so engaged, that darling man Mick O Brien drove back to the CWU building where the Ard Chomairle met.He ed triumphantly.“I have your hat,” he declared and handed me a Russian Cossack type piece of hairy millinery.“That’s not my hat,” I told him as I tried it on.“It’s lovely on you,” Mick told me. And so it was.But I was still fretting for big Stan’s cap. Negotiations for Government  The Sinn Féin surge  The posturing by Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael’s leaders  Shadowy friggers running Sinn Féin  I focused with my comrades on all this but beneath my new, well nearly new, Cossack hat my wee mind refused to give up on big Stan’s missing cap. Apart from the sense of loss how could I face Kathleen  She’s a Tyrone woman. Hell hath no fury like a Tyrone woman chastising a man, particularly a Belfast man. My nerves were wrecked.“An bhfuil cead agam dul amach ” I asked Mary Lou. “May I go out ”“Tá” she said “Yes, but please take off that Russian hat#. and get your hair cut.”I exited despondently stage left, as sheepishly as Micheál Martin after Mary Lou scalped his arse. Out the back of Ard Oig the old Dominic Street flats, now demolished, are a building site. I made my way gingerly through the muck. A burly workman greeted me.“A great election result,” he said.“Yup,” I replied, “Did you find a cap ”“Is it a Bugatti ” He asked.I wonderedhe had a selection of caps. A Malloy. A Hanna. A Magee. But no he only had one. Stan’s Bugatti. He pulled it out – a grey wet crumpled item – from beneath his yellow high-vis vest.“That’s it!” I cried as I resisted the urge to hug him. Instead I told him about big Stan. His eyes welled up with tears.“I’m glad I found it,” he told me.“You look very like a painting my Granny had of Saint Anthony,” I told him.He looked at me warily.“Thank you,” I gushed.“No problem. Tell me one thing,” he asked.“Anything,” I replied.“When are you getting your hair cut ” He asked.“Soon,” I told him. After all he did find big Stan’s cap.He smiled at me and as he turned away I really could see that he looked remarkably like my Granny’s picture of Saint Anthony. I felt an urge to fall on my knees in the muck to offer a prayer of thanks to him but I suppressed this. So instead I just thanked him again. He smiled beatically.Now I’ve Mick’s Russian hat as well as big Stan’s cap. It’s great. No need to worry about the wrath of Kathleen. Or Mary Lou. Unlike Micheál Martin. If I had two heads I’d be landed."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"residents in limbo over move","story":"CHAIR of the Riverdale Finaghy Tenants’ Association says he, along with other members, remain in “limbo” over a proposed “take-over” of properties under the ownership ofVictoria Housing Estatesto Choice Housing.Currently a joint consultation is underway between VHE and Choice around proposals to agree a transfer of its stock in Riverdale to the housing body. Chair Joby Fox told the Andersonstown News that at a recent meeting with VHE and Choice, tenants initially thought that on the “face of it, the proposal looked like a good offer”.“But when presented with the details tenants felt angry and left with the threat of their homes being sold on the open market to the highest bidderthey don’t accept the deal. This is clearly a case of duress.“The issue now is that the terms that are being offered for the option to buy our properties or move to Choice Housing do not reflect the time that people have lived in their homes,” explained Joby.“VHE are only offering the properties at current market prices with no offer for commission based on the time we have resided in our homes or indeed no reflection on the severe hardship which we have endured under the watch of VHE and the Charity Commission NI ,” he said. “The biggest majority of our tenants and their families have lived and maintained the houses for over  years”.Joby said that he believes the proposal is “unlikely” to go through.“It would mean that VHE and CCNI put themselves beyond accountability, so we have to ask, who’s agenda is best served by this move  It’s clear that VHE and CCNI want to sweep their five years of failure under the carpet.”Commenting on the ongoing consultation Sinn Féin MLA Alex Maskey said: “The problems regarding Victoria Housing are well known, I have spoken about these issues with residents and representatives of Victoria Housing both publicly and privately. These issues are of a hugely concerning nature to the tenants of Victoria Housing. We are talking about the core rights of tenants and the condition of their homes.“This is why this consultation is so vitally important and I would ask that every tenant feeds into this consultation because it is the very basis of the future of their homes. Please seek independent advice being offered by the Housing Rights service and by Supporting Communities and exhaust every question you have.“It is up to the residents to shape this consultation and I look forward to the results of the consultation and most importantly hearing solutions to the problems Victoria Housing residents face.”No-one from Victoria Housing Estates was available for comment."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"rising star alanna gives hope to those in distress","story":"A SPRING Ball is set to take place at the Devenish Complex with all proceeds raised from the night going towards the vital work of mental health awareness charities.‘Stand By Me’, the brainchild of local man Daniel McGinley, will take place on Friday, March  and will feature an array of vocal talent including the launch of ‘Hidden Hope’, the new album and single from rising Twinbrook talent Alanna Flynn.A songwriter since age of , Alanna told the Andersonstown News how music has always been an important part of her le and how songwriting helped her through her own struggles with mental health.“I have always wanted to make an album for charity and the reason why the proceeds raised from it and the single will go towards Suicide Awareness and Support Group is because I’ve struggled with my own mental health,” she told us. “I went through a really dark period of time, I know what’s it like to be in a dark place. Music has been my escape in a way and that has really helped me to where I am today.“Music and songwriting really helped me, I always found it hard to open up, talk about my feelings and emotions. I found that writing it down was a way to get how I was feeling off my chest.”Alanna said she hopes her music will go some way to helping people in distress amidst the suicide crisis in the city.“I would never want anyone to feel like they don’t have someone to talk to. The suicide rates just keep going up and up every year. Mental health, struggles with mental health, is a sickness, it’s a sickness you can’t see but it’s there. Everybody’s mental health struggles are dferent. With the release of the song, the album, I hope when people hear it it gives them a bit of comfort, to hear that there is always hope”.Alanna will be attending as well as performing on the night of the ball along with fellow artists Joleen Burns, Leah Hawkins and Second Nature.“Invitations have gone out to MPs from across the city to attend and whoever shows up is showing their support for this cause.”Alanna spoke of the pressures facing young people as they prepare to leave school for the next chapter of their lives.“For your entire le you are being looked after by your mummy and daddy and then, all of a sudden, it’s like you need to know what you want to do with your le. A lot of pressure is put on you, you’re made to do your UCAS form in school, there were people who didn’t want to go to uni when I was at school. I got accepted to go to Liverpool for Performing Arts but when it came to it I didn’t want to go, as much as I would’ve enjoyed the experience I just knew it wasn’t for me. Young people look to drugs, to alcohol, to feel better as they don’t have all the answers at that stage in their le.”She continued: “I do think we need more resources in our mental health services. This Ball is a way to help those charities that are helping others. It will be a positive night and a chance to hear that there are people that you can depend on. There will be people speaking about their own experiences but ultimately it will be an uplting night. A big ‘ball’ of happiness for everyone on the night.“I’d like to thank Supervalu in the Dairy Farm and ver Photos along with other businesses who helped get the album made and for their support and I’m looking forward to people hearing it.”• The Stand By Me Spring Ball will take place on Friday, March .

There are risks to the whole population, he said, older people and with chronic conditions will be most vulnerable.Anyone taking medication for a condition which makes them more vulnerable to the disease was urged to follow their own doctor#s advice.

He said medical professionals used specialised masks which could stop transmission.More effective is handwashing, he told the BBC Stephen Nolan show during a special Radio Ulster programme on the outbreak. People should not be wearing face masks. The most important thing we can do to keep ourselves save is to practice good respiratory hygiene.

Until , the shop was still here and the bar could only hold maybe seven or eight people.“It would have been mostly locals in the bar and then in  they built on the upstairs and it would have hosted a lot of music – mostly country and western music.”Jack is quietly spoken but points me in the direction of black and white photographs on the wall, where he featured in the Kildoag Wanderers FC side and the local cricket team in a previous era.Both teams used the bar as their base, and the social aspect the rural pub brought to the area is something Jack feels will be greatly missed.“The place would have been packed out on a Saturday night – people would have come from Donemana, Waterside and Claudy for the music.“We just enjoyed the craic. You had the odd tall story told. It’s hard to beat a good story, evenit’s not true!”Mervyn McComb lays claim to being the bar’s oldest customer. “I’ve been coming here about  years,” boasts the -year-old. “I was in it when the old bar was in the other room. Then, when they opened up the lounge, the place was packed to the rafters. “A lot of old bars seem to be closing up, there’s not the customers there used to be. It’s going to be badly missed.“It’s local people that come here.”Right on cue, a loud cheer erupts from the men as another regular walks into the bar, while Ian informs me the bar has its own taxi driver in residence.Barman Andy Nutt prepares to explain further. He mutes the small television mounted above the bar. This is serious stuff now.“There were six women arrived from Cumbria in England on a Tuesday night. They were on a biking tour and on their way to Park.“They came in and asked to use the toilet and I said that was no bother at all. One of them askedthis was a bar and I said it’s been called many things, but you could definitely call it a bar.“She askedthere was any chance they could have a drink and to cut a long story short, they ended up leaving the bikes here!“They stayed all night so I said I would get them a taxi man to get them back to Park. I rung up Eddie Curry and askedhe could do a run.“Eddie said ‘I’m definitely not going to Park’. Then I told him it was six women and he asked what time I wanted him down!“I got a text from them that evening then – I think they were in Portrush.“It said: Andy, no Guinness at pound., no gin and tonic at pound. – we shouldn’t have left you!”The tale is typical of the kind of comical, slightly embellished yarns that used to be commonplace in bars across the country, but rural decline is threatening to silence them.Mervyn McComb’s son, Ian, believes that people make the bar what it is.“It’s a good wee bar, with great people in it,” he says. “There were memorable nights here every weekend. It was always good craic.“There used to be bands in upstairs and the place would have been jammed. It always did a good trade, was well run and there was never any trouble.“I’m  now so I’ve been coming here maybe  years. It will be sorely missed and it’ll hurt the community.”The range of presentation cheques that adorn the bar’s walls give an indication of how the community will suffer without its hub. Each year, the bar ran a charity drive and the evidence of their impact is clear in the many comments left on social media following news of Knobbs’ closure. Nicola Doherty fondly recalled a vintage tractor rally held at Knobbs’ after her father had beaten cancer.She commented: “We held our first tractor run in there when my dad beat cancer and bought a vintage tractor. “We hoped for a few tractors to show up and to raise a couple of hundred, but the place was packed, and we raised pound, for the Sperrin Room. “Great memories, I’m sad to see it close the doors.”The doors will indeed close, but Saturday night’s punters were treated to the nostalgic sight of the rafters reverberating to the sound of the Father and Son Remo band in the lounge above.There is a black cat that Jack Knobbs says follows him to and from his house to the bar on every visit.It sits almost sentry-like on the windowsill outside Knobbs.On a bright summer’s afternoon, Jack’s feline companion would be treated to a breathtaking view of the Faughan valley, but on Knobbs’ farewell night, Storm Jorge’s wind and rain battered its weary walls.The storm will have calmed by Thursday, as Andy Nutt prepares to close the doors. There is no doubt that Jack Knobbs will be there to oversee what will be an emotional moment.Knobbs concedes to the march of time.“I’m just a customer now,” says the former owner.“Sometimes I sit too long.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

We used to dob mass and Clare and my sister, Megan, would go and buy fags and theyd buy me a Taz bar to shut my mouth, she smiled. Clare made her acting debut in Sunday Paul Greengrasss film about Bloody Sunday. She had also landed a gig presenting a youth show on Channel  and had been approached by Nickelodeon about further presenting roles. googletag.cmd.push In the year , Clares friend had to drop out of a trip to Spain and she was asked to go in her place. It was only after her name was on the ticket that Clare realised it was a Retreat, organised by the religious order the Home of the Mother. She thought she was going to Ibiza for a free trip away, laughed Shauna. Clare would later describe how she spent the first few days of the trip smoking and sunbathing, but on Good Friday she experienced something that was to change her le. The group attended a Good Friday service and the congregation were asked to kiss the Crucix. When Clares turn came, she had an overwhelming feeling that Jesus loved her and had died for her. She later told people that her sins had nailed him to the cross. She kissed the cross and it was her le. That was it, said Shauna. Clare ed to Derry as a very dferent girl, but it took her another year to answer Gods call to become a nun. She tried to fight it, said Shauna. If our father was giving her a lt to the Bound for Boston bar she would say dont drive past the Long Tower chapel because God used to stand at the gate calling to her. On one of her many nights out Clare had too much to drink and went into a toilet cubicle to be sick. She had a strong sense that someone was watching her and then heard Gods voice in her head saying why do you keep hurting me  Clare said she felt that she was nailing Jesus to the cross once again, and in that moment she decided she should devote her le to him.  She told her family she was moving to Spain to be a nun with the Servant Sisters of the Home of the Mother who she had met on the Retreat. We were shocked, admitted Shauna. She was the most dramatic, outgoing person you could ever meet in your le. I think the priests thought she was a big eejit at the start. But Clare had always been her own person and was determined not to let anything stand in her way. She didnt care what anyone  said, Shauna recalled. She had never cared what anyone thought of her. She used to wear horrible clothes, well to me they were horrible. Clare was stunning, but she didnt care what she looked like. She would just run her fingers through her hair and go out the door. Heartbroken at their daughters decision to start a new le so far from home, the Crocketts hoped she would be back after a few weeks, but Clare surprised everybody by fully embracing her new way of le. That was her le and there was no talking to her, said Shauna. We still sit and say did that really happen, did she really go away and become a nun  but she was so happy and she never complained. She made a dference to so many peoples lives. Clares determination to become a nun never wavered. She later said God told her I will be your mother, your father, your language, your country. After taking her first vows on February ,  she took the religious name Sister Clare Maria of the Trinity and the Heart of Mary. She went on to take her perpetual vows on September ,  and served the Servant Sisters of the House of the Mother in Belmonte and Valencia in Spain, Jacksonville in America and Guayaquil and Playa Prieta in Ecuador. Clares magnetic personality and gt for music and song helped her connect with people and she had a special affinity with children. Carmelite priest, Fr Stephen Quinn, who celebrates a Mass in memory of Sister Clare every month, said her extraordinary story blew him away. He first heard about Sr Clares story when he watched All or Nothing:Sr Clare Crockett the film made by the House Of The Mother Order about her le. The film shows footage of Clare during her  years with the Order and charts her le from her first Retreat until just days before her death. To witness someone of little or no faith experience Christ in such a radical way and who lived her le in such a radical way is amazing. She fitted more into her  years than most of us ever will. Its not just the attributed miracles. You have to look at who this girl was and the le she came from and how she became a nun. When you see nuns these days they are old women in their s and s, but this is a girl who gave her whole le to God and that is the greatest miracle of all. Towards the end of her le Clare started suffering from severe migraines that made her physically sick. It emerged after her death she was suffering from a bleed to her brain, but she had continued to work as hard as ever telling her Sisters that she wrote a blank cheque to God every day. Every time you saw her she had a guitar in her hand and she was singing and she had a whole tribe of wains behind her, Shauna recalled. Just days before she passed away Sister Clare told her fellow nuns that she knew she was going to die young and even suggested she might die at  like Jesus had. On April , , Sister Clare was crushed to death in the stairwell of her school in Playa Prieta in Ecuador as she attempted to guide five girls to safety during an earthquake. She was -years-old. When her body was discovered she was carrying a piece of her guitar in her hand.  Her mum, Margaret, who passed away on lSeptember  last year at  from vascular dementia, never got over her daughters death. She cried a wile lot, said Shauna. Shed say why did our Clare leave me  but shes doing more now that she has died than she could ever have done alive. It makes the grieving easier. She is doing so much for people. After Clare died she was brought back to Derry and laid to rest at the City Cemetery where her grave has become a place of pilgrimage for visitors from around the world. We were overwhelmed, said Shauna. Shes just not another person who died, people have kept her legacy and her name going. Theres a wee man who comes from Toome every fortnight with flowers from Marks  Spencer and goes to her grave. Thats her effect everywhere you go. People are just devoted to her. A prayer group which asks Sister Clare to intercede for them meets weekly in Derry. We have a packed room every time and people get a great feeling, said Shauna. Several miracles have been attributed to Sister Clare, including the birth of twins to an infertile couple and the recovery of a young boy on le support whose parents had been told he would die. So what would Sister Clare make of calls for her to be made a saint  She would love it, smiled Shauna. She went from only ever wanting to be famous and live a le of luxury to giving everything up. But she made the right choice. She said Im going to be famous. Im going to be a famous nun. The Mass in memory of Sister Clare takes place on the second Sunday of every month in Termonbacca at pm.Her anniversary Mass will take place on Sunday, April , in Termonbacca. The Sister Clare Novena prayer group meets every Monday at the Search youth group premises in the Iona Business Parkat .pm.

Ryan McGeough was coached by Gregg at Portstewart FC for three or four years as a teenager. “My mum texted me about his death and I couldnt believe it,” McGeough said. “I hadnt seen him in a few years and I would have loved to run into him and have a yarn but unfortunately I never got the chance.” Gregg, who was voted as the best goalkeeper of the  World Cup, a native of Tobermore, passed away at the age of  and aside from his talents between the posts he was most famous in football circles for his heroics during the Munich air disaster in February  which claimed the lives of  people. googletag.cmd.push Harry pulled some of his team-mates from the burning plane, after disaster struck on theirjourney from a European Cup victory over Red Star Belgrade. Among those he saved were Bobby Charlton, Jackie Blanchflower and manager Sir Matt Busby. Harry played  games but was a larger than le presence. Anybody who ever had a conversation with Harry would have remembered it,” stated Irish FA Chief Executive Patrick Nelson in a statement to the County Derry Post. Gregg started his club career with Windsor Park Swts, the reserve team of Linfield, before signing for his local club Coleraine. At the age of  he earned a move to Second Division side Doncaster Rovers before switching to Manchester United for pound,, which was a world record fee for a goalkeeper at the time and made  appearances for the Red Devils. googletag.cmd.push He entered management and became manager of Shrewsbury Town, before taking charge of Swansea City, Crewe Alexandra and Carlisle United. Gregg also had a spell as goalkeeping coach at Manchester United and as assistant manager at Swindon Town. Harry was appointed an MBE by The Queen in  for services to football, and was then made an OBE in , also for services to football. Each week the Harry Gregg Foundation facilitates a wide range of activities for thousands of people in the Coleraine area and beyond through participation in football and ious other activities. Sir Alex Ferguson, who took his United team to play in Harrys testimonial in Belfast in , paid a tribute on Manchester Uniteds Official Website. “Harry was a man of great character and a true legend at our club. I remember that he was always very excited and proud to host our youth team at his boarding house for the Milk Cup every summer, so he could recount the tales of his playing days. I loved his company and the many pieces of advice he gave me.” While back in Ireland, Gregg bought the Windsor Hotel in Portstewart and began coaching the local soccer team. One player who remembers him fondly was goalkeeper Ryan McGeough who would go on to win two Derry championship medals with Coleraine GAA team. GREGG THE COACH “He was thecoach but as a goalkeeper you got a lot more attention from him than everybody. He was the first goalkeeper coach I ever came across that made the goalkeepers train with the outfielders. “Ray Woods was an England capped goalkeeper whenUnited won the league in   and they bought Harry for a record fee. “Harry said to me the only reason why they bought him was that Woods was a linie,” recalls McGeough, referring to Woods reluctance to leave his six-yard box. “Harry was the first goalkeeper to sweep outside his box and cover for defenders. He would always have had you out in the box organising your defenders.” McGeough soon learned Greggs approach to goalkeeping during one of those coaching sessions with Portstewart. “Peter Schmeichel was my hero and having played European handball, he brought in the spreading himself”, McGeough continues, explaining the Danes trademark star-jump, making himself as imposing as possible. Harry Gregg didnt agree and stopped his young proteacutegeacute advancing a la Schmeichel during training.   It was by far and away the best coaching I have ever had. Ryan McGeough  “He dropped the ball and said you, e on it and you , challenge him. If you do the spread again, you will do this all night. In Harrys era, you ed and took the ball and man. “It was by far and away the best coaching I have ever had. I havent spread myself since in case Harry was watching,” laughs the affable McGeough. “He would have taken it as serious coaching a  year old as a senior.” “He taught you how to manipulate forwards on a one on one and force the forward to make the first move. What he was teaching was far and beyond seen before. “If another manager, who is not a goalkeeper, says something to you, you could question it butHarry said something to you - you just did it. “Wed sit around the changing room listening to him for an hour and a half after training. Hed be telling us stories about Best, Charlton and Busby. When you are a big Man Utd head, you are in dreamland listening to him.” McGeough speaks of how goalkeeping has changed and in the era of televised games too much of the routines being similar. “In Harrys day there were so many dferent styles and I would prefer to play the way Harry played.” READ ALSO - He was larger than le on the pitch.

McDonagh admitted that the win was important for team morale.“Our first win of the season means it gives us a wee bit of confidence going into the Waterford, so yeah it was important to win,” he said. “We have got a bit of confidence now and I know all the boys will be looking forward to the Waterford match.“We’ll be going there looking to exploit them and get three points again, because that feeling of getting three points against Bohs is special and we want to get as many points as possible.”The importance of keeping a clean sheet was not lost on the Derry City players, particularly after two scoreless draws between the club last season.“Whenever we came in at half-time the manager talked about making sure we keep a clean-sheet,” McDonagh continued. “Obviously we felt comfortable in the first half and knew that we were doing quite well and knew that we just needed to get that goal and keep a clean-sheet.“If you keep a clean-sheet in this league you have a good chance in winning games, so we done that and that’s credit to the back-four and everyone as a whole, but as I said keeping clean-sheets are ideal. “It will stand us in good stead and we’ll be looking to keep this momentum going and hopefully we can get a few more clean-sheets, because I’m sure we have got the players to win us more games.” googletag.cmd.push ImportantMcDonagh heaped praise on goal scorer Stephen Mallon, who made a memorable contribution on his first start for the club.“That’s why Stevie was brought to the club and we see that in training every day and that’s why he was given his chance,” he explained.“It’s important in those close games that we take our chances and Stevie did that tonight. It was a bit of magic from him and it’s a great goal from him. I think it was important to get up and running and get the three points, as it will do the team a world of good.”McDonagh is now hoping that the Candystripes can build on the momentum from Friday, both inidually and collectively.“There were a lot of good performances and we looked solid at the back and the whole team collectively you could see we are starting to come together, things are starting to work and we can only get better from now,” he stated. “Waltergetting his goal will also do him the world of good as well and it’s good to get two dferent goalscorers and it will give the boys confidence.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

However, McKnight was not to be denied and in the seventh minute he dispossessed Corey Laverty and hit a shot that squirmed through Leneghanrsquos hands and into the net.Albion had barely time to celebrate as, virtually from the restart, Tollymore won a free kick that was delivered into the box, by McLister, for Ruairi Toner to shoot into the net.United slowly began to take a stranglehold in midfield with Marty McCourt and Tommy Kane dominating Burke and Rooney. On the left wing, Marty Devlin was giving the Albion defence a torrid time with his pace and power.Just on the stroke of half-time Albionrsquos Ryan Beckett fired a free kick over the Bearsrsquo crossbar.Despite having wind advantage, Tollymore were unable to create any chances of note and they were rocked in the th minute when Albion centre half Allan Cousins found himself unmarked in the Tollymore area to head a corner kick past Leneghan.Despite this setback, Tollymore held their nerve and Jack McCourt and Matt McCormick linked up for McCourt to run through on goal. Unfortunately, Albion lsquokeeper Joel Collins made a superb finger tip save to block McCourtrsquos shot.United were well on top, but were lacking the guile to open up the Moira defence until the introduction of veteran striker Adrian lsquoSparkyrsquo Howard.Within moments of Howardrsquos arrival in the st minute he got on the end of a McLister flick to shoot past Collins in the Albion goal.It was now all Tollymore as the Bears pushed for a winner and Albion were reduced to ten-men after Darryl Irwin was dismissed for a cynical foul on Marty Devlin as the striker burst through on goal, after being put clear by Tommy Kane.Virtually on the stroke of full time, Corey Laverty picked out Howard with a superb pass only for Collins to make another excellent save. Extra time saw Tollymore playing with the wind and forcing a succession of corners that Albion did well to defend.Albion seemed content to play for penalty kicks and it was only in the last couple of minutes of the game that they came out of their defensive shell, but were unable to penetrate a resolute Tollymore defence.Albion netted their first penalty with Marty McCourt equalising and then the fun started. Leneghan saved the second spot kick and Albionrsquos Joel Collins then blocked Corey Lavertyrsquos effort to keep things level at -. Leneghan then saved the third Albion kick before Marty Devlin scored to nudge the Bears in front at -.The Moira men levelled things with a cracking penalty leaving United with two more penalties to win. Unfortunately, Howard shot wide to leave the scores - and one penalty apiece left.Once again Leneghan made an unbelievable save to hand the initiative to United and Adam Rea stepped up to blast the ball into the net to send United into the final.Match sponsor: Diamond Pats, Newcastle.Tollymore United Moira Albion MID ULSTER LEAGUE CUP S

South Down MP Chris Hazzard during a meeting in Berlin last weekend with representatives from the Executive Board of the European Left.The MP was warmly received by delegates from the EU member states

workersrsquo rights, gender equality and the increasing need to counter the growth in extreme, far-right politics throughout Europe.Also this week, the South Down MP described British government immigration proposals as ldquounpopular, unworkable and a direct threat to economic well-being in South Down.Responding to proposals confirmed by the Home Office that immigration policy in Northern Ireland will change from next year, the MP warned that far from strengthening the economic wellbeing of society, the proposals are a direct threat to the local hospitality, tourism, retail and agri-food sectors.Mr Hazzard declared: ldquoIt is hard not to view these proposals as an elitist, xenophobic attack on overseas and low-paid workers, the vast majority of whom we simply cannot live without.ldquoIndeed, most worryingly, these proposals are a cruel attack on our care sector the wonderful, selfless heroes whom we all rely on to take care of us and our families in our hour of need.Mr Hazzard said it is ldquoabundantly clear that the Home Office has completely ignored what he described as the ldquoNorthrsquos unique and special circumstances and has shown nothing but contempt for local business and industry leaders who have engaged constructively with British government officials in recent years.The MP added: ldquoSinn Feacutein will be raising these concerns

roads in NI  ","story":"TWO of the worst roads in Northern Ireland are in Down District and just miles apart, it has been revealed.They are the Shore Road in Strangford and the Blackstaff Road in Clough which are placed first and third respectively in the list of the provincersquos worst roads, the Department for Infrastructure has confirmed.New statistics revealed by the government department confirm that a total of  defects mdash including pot holes mdash were recorded on both roads last year.Government officials say that  defects were recorded on the Shore Road and  on the Blackstaff Road.The Department has confirmed that between  and  it paid out a staggering pound.m to drivers across Northern Ireland whose vehicles had been damaged by potholes.Years of underinvestment has led to a deterioration of Northern Irelandrsquos roads according to Stormont infrastructure minister, Nichola Mallon, who is making poundm available to help address the issue.The cash will also be used for winter gritting services and to help repair the tens of thousands of street lights that are out across the country.Ms Mallon explained that years of underinvestment as well as the impact of severe winter weather has led to deterioration in the road network and in recent years this has impacted on the level of vehicle damage compensation payments.Last year, Northern Irelandrsquos public spending watchdog warned that it would cost more than poundbn to deal with structural maintenance.The Northern Ireland Audit Office published a report highlighting how a lack of investment was having a deteriorating effect on the overall condition of Northern Irelandrsquos road network and found that a lack of funding had led to a signicant reduction in the number of potholes being recorded and approved for repair.Ms Mallon said that ldquofrustratingly for a number of years now not enough money had been allocated to her departmentrsquos budget to maintain roads and repairs were having to be done on a priority basis.ldquoWhile I have inherited severe and challenging budget constraints, I am committed to finding solutions that deliver better for our communities and improve lives, she said.ldquoI have impressed on the new finance minister the need for additional money to deal with this issue and other critical pressures. Sustainable infrastructure is key to improving lives and connecting communities.Confirmation of the poundm funding package to deal with roads maintenance, winter gritting and defective street lights comes just weeks after the Recorder revealed that while the lights were back on at Stormont after MLAs ed to work, they were continuing to go out across the district at an alarming rate.In mid-January, almost  street lights were not working in East Down, plunging many areas into darkness and the Department for Infrastructure confirming that due to budgetary pressures it was only able to provide a limited repair service.Province-wide, it was estimated that in excess of , street lights were not working with the government department having only a small number of engineers at its disposal to repair all of them.Downpatrick topped the league table for broken street lights in East Down with  in need of repair. Newcastle was in second place with  street lights not working.Other district hot spots included Ballynahinch where  street lights were out of order, while where,  faults were reported in Killyleagh,  in Castlewellan and Crossgar and  in Saintfield.In Ballygowan,  street lights are currently out of order with  and  faults reported in Ardglass and Killough respectively.Downpatrick councillor, Dermot Curran, has welcomed the infrastructure ministerrsquos commitment to invest poundm and hopes that many of the potholes and defective street lights across the district will be repaired.He said while the defects will be repaired according to their priority, he hopes that Ms Mallon will secure additional support from the Stormont Executive to carry out a full repair programme.ldquoThe minister is having to deal with a legacy of under investment in the roads network and she must be given every assistance by her Stormont colleagues. There are clearly budgetary pressures across a range of departments but it is is vital that we invest in our roads and wastewater infrastructure in particular, continued Cllr Curran.ldquoMs Mallon clearly has the needs of people at heart and hopefully she will be given additional monies to help address the particular problems we have in Down District.

I started to do some practice tricks with Stella where she would move between and around my legs and she was fantastic.ldquoI loved the thought of going to a dog show with mum for the whole day and meeting lots of other dogs so I started going to class regularly with mum.Ann, Fiona and their dogs, Stella, Minty and Turfy mdash another Bichon Frise mdash are trained by Irene Hull, from KARC in Dromore,As Stella was going deaf when Ann first started to work with her, Irene knew that the OneMind Dogs method of training using body language would be perfect for Ann and Stella.Fiona said: ldquoI really donrsquot know how Ann does it, but she picked up the technique so fast and now her and Stella are so effective together. Ann has become a much better trainer that I am and Stella competes better with her than she did with me.Ann added: ldquoThe only problem I used to have is that Stella would run off to mumshe missed a weave and I couldnrsquot call her back.ldquoConnection is the most important thing for Stella and I at the moment as because she is deaf, I have to keep her looking at me and focusing on me when she is running. I guide her with my hands, feet and my chest laser point.Apart from training, Ann and Stella have a normal loving relationship between a child and a best friend who happens to be a dog.Ann said: ldquoStella loves snacks and as soon as the fridge door opens, she goes wild, spinning in circles of joy.ldquoShersquos allowed to sleep on my bed the nights she has a bath. Thatrsquos what mum and dad think but as soon as they turn off my light, she sneaks under the blanket for a proper snuggle.She has her eyes set on claiming her mumrsquos other dog, Turfy.ldquoMum had her eye on training Turfy as he is fast and very keen, but he loves me more and runs way better for me, said Ann. ldquoI have been training him as well and we should be ready for competitions this summer.Ann hopes to show what she and Stella can do in front of her classmates as her principal has said she can bring the dog into school for a demonstration..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/26th February 2020 This.jpg","title":"This Is Your Life surprise as David celebrates 100th birthday  ","story":"IT was a case of lsquoThis Is Your Lersquo for retired Carryduff farmer David Patterson when he was presented with a book chronicling  years of his amazing le.Mr Patterson, from the townland of Clontonacally, was surrounded by family, friends and members of his church, Trinity Presbyterian Church in Boardmills, when he celebrated becoming a centenarian at the weekend.For younger readers, This is Your Le was a famous TV programme where celebrities and people of note from all walks of le were surprised by the presenter with a book detailing the personrsquos many achievements.Mr Pattersonrsquos book, lovingly put together by his children, Margaret and Martin, was just one highlight of the weekend of celebrations hosted in his honour.The book shows the many changes that the diary farmer witnessed over the last  years, including pictures of him gathering in hay using horses and carts in the s and s, through to his international travels in later years.His family took him to Las Vegas for his th birthday, which included a helicopter flight over the Grand Canyon.

It was Captain Robertrsquos who did it.Mr Davies spent time conducting research in Bilbao, Durango, Gernika, and Alicante where he consulted Spanish historians and met with descendants of those involved in the civil war.Outwitting Franco: The Welsh Maritime Heroes of the Spanish Civil War can be purchased on Amazon for pound in paperback.Alternatively, it can be purchased digitally for pound on Kindle. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Of those who received the benefit,  per cent were unemployed.Universal Credit began in  and has been gradually rolled out across the country. It was designed to simply the benefits system for working age people by merging six separate benefits into one payment.But features such as the -week wait, the -child limit and the benefits cap, as well as public spending cuts, have been associated with a rise in rent arrears, food bank usage and child poverty.Local homelessness charity, Llamau, has expressed concern for young people who are being enrolled on the scheme.Joe Payne, head of vale services and family mediation for Llamau, said: ldquoPrior to the introduction of Universal Credit, a young person may have claimed Job Seekers Allowance or Employment Support Allowance but this is no longer an option.ldquoUndoubtedly, the five week waiting time and a very low National Minimum Wage for people under  is going to cause young people untold hardship and in a lot of cases, spiralling debt.A Department for Work and Pension spokesman said the increase in  to -year olds claiming Universal Credit is lsquoin line with expectationsrsquo as it has been rolled out to every job centre.Jane Hutt, AM for the Vale of Glamorgan, said: ldquoI am concerned at the rise in the number of claimants, particularly young people, who need to access Universal Credit.ldquoCare leavers in particular are being disadvantaged by the changes. I do not believe the concerns that have been raised by claimants, by employers and by organisations advising and supporting people affected, including those who are in employment, have been addressed and I will continue to raise them on behalf of my constituents.The government has committed to ending a four-year benefit freeze in April this year, meaning millions of people will see their payments rise by the same rate as inflation.Councillor Kathryn McCaffer, Vale of Glamorgan Council youth champion, said: ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council is working with a range of partners to mitigate any adverse impacts and offer a iety of support to young people in financial dficulties. Those classed as Not in Education, Employment or Trainingcan access the Inspire  Work programme, which provides financial help to pay for the likes of work clothes, training and travel costs.ldquoVulnerable tenants are protected from debt through the direct payments system. Currently around  per cent of tenants have this system in place, which allows a portion of Universal Credit payments to be made directly to the council to cover rent.ldquoThis year, the council has been able to secure over pound, of additional income for tenants by helping them secure backdated claims, ensuring the correct benefits are being received, assisting with appeals, and helping secure the best tarfs for utilities. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He made me feel very relaxed, said one patient after meeting Charles.ldquoWithin  seconds I felt at ease. It was nice to be able to say what you wanted, and he genuinely had an interest in the patients, said Kathryn Guercio, a Health Care Assistant at Marie Curie.For Kathryn, the royal visit was an opportunity to thank the prince.ldquoWhen I was  I left school with no qualications. I was an absolute angry drop out. I joined the Princes Trust volunteers because they didnrsquot know what  to do with me, Kathryn said.Established by Charles in , the Princes Trust helps vulnerable young people to find employment and gain valuable training.ldquoI did a fortnight of caring in Surry and I loved it. I absolutely loved it. Thatrsquos when I thought I could do this. I just love looking after people.ldquoItrsquos because of that choice to join the Princes Trust volunteers that I ended up where I am, so I genuinely do thank him for taming a very wayward -year-old.Describing her job at Marie Curie, Kathryn said: ldquoI love it here. Therersquos no comparison. You can give that  percent every sht. And wersquove got a cracking view. The sun rises and then the moon rises. We get to see it all across the water. Itrsquos gorgeous.Following the tour, the prince ended his visit at a reception where he met actor and Marie Curie ambassador, Suzanna Packer.In a brief speech, he commended the staff and volunteers for their dedication which he called lsquotruly remarkable.rsquoHe then unveiled a plaque to commemorate his visit and cut a daffodil-themed cake made by local Michelin-starred chef, James Sommerin.Angelina Hall and Cathy OrsquoDoherty, co-owners of Glass By Design at Station Approach, were commissioned to design and produce the plaque.ldquoIt was an honour for us as local artists to be asked to make this, said Cathy. ldquoItrsquos something which is going to be here for people to enjoy.His Royal Highness was also the first person to sign the charityrsquos Great Big Daffodil - a -foot tall model with paper books in the shape of petals which will start a UK wide tour this week.The Great Daffodil Appeal is an opportunity for people to share their stories, memories, or tributes to a loved one.After signing the book and cutting the cake, Charles gave a final farewell to the staff who had gathered to see him and left with his entourage.The prince met with flood victims in Pontypridd later that afternoon.His trip to South Wales also included engagements at the CAF train factory in Newport, the Aston Martin Lagonda factory in St. Athan, Barry, and the British Airways Maintenance Centre in Cardf. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

How do those people then stay, snuggled in snoozy paradise for hour upon hour until their alarm gives them a nudge and they arise rested and ready for a new day  I have never been a good sleeper, even as a child. If anything at all is playing on my mind, I never lose my appetite, but I will lose slumber. I have friends who similarly suffer. I use the word suffer quite deliberately, because lying there in the dark at am it can feel like everyone  is snuffling softly but for the wide-awake person, it can feel horrendous. As the time ticks closer to the alarm and still sleep will not come, it can feel quite anxiety-inducing and so the vicious circle whizzes, fizzes and flies through your brain making sleep feel further and further away.But, as this is a lelong way of living for me and I am overwhelmingly a lsquocrack on kinda womanrsquo, I have developed ways to use this time effectively. I listen to podcasts, and have learned about biohacking, how broccoli defends itself and the many twists and turns of the Brexit negotiations whilst the street snoozes. I catch up with messages . I also think a lot. I just lay there in the dark and puzzle though story ideas, events from the day and issues facing friends, family and myself. In a twisted way, this time and opportunity has become quite precious to me. I donrsquot know when  in the day Irsquod have the time and space to just ponder, muse, consider and percolate. It is during this time that I have considered my earlier point about jealousy. None of us know what is going on behind the closed door of either someonersquos home or their mind and whilst I hope you sleep well,you canrsquot, use that time wisely to think, to empathise and to learn. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Rather than adhering to a nationally prescribed learning program, schools and practitioners will be able to make decisions that best meet the needs of specic learners.As well as contributing to the framework, St Josephrsquos has also introduced their own bespoke curriculum, and is one of only  Curriculum Innovation Schools in Wales.The St Josephrsquos curriculum is based on findings in child development and cognitive science, with staff undertaking extensive learning on how childrenrsquos bodies and minds develop.Lessons have been designed to enhance pupilsrsquo personal, social and physical development, whilst also providing a detailed knowledge and understanding of the world, both past and present.The school has also benefitted from signicant on-site works, including the refurbishment of all classrooms, a complete reconfiguration of the Foundation Phase learning spaces and a state of the art new-build Nursery.Staff regularly deliver learning experiences outside of the classroom, as the schoolrsquos grounds include a playing field, wooded area, pond, orchard, wildflower meadow and polytunnel.The implementation of the schoolrsquos ambitious curriculum has seen standards improve year on year. Last yearrsquos National Reading Tests saw the average child in St Josephrsquos score within the top  percent of the country, with similarly high standards achieved in mathematics.Headteacher, Gareth Rein said: ldquoWersquore extremely proud of our achievements at St Josephrsquos. Everything we do is based on the best available research and is designed to help each inidual child thrive.Cabinet Member for Education and Regeneration, Councillor Lis Burnett, said: ldquoThe new Curriculum for Wales is inspiring schools to take a more holistic approach toward learning. It encourages them to focus more on how and why the curriculum is being delivered, rather than delivering specic content and academic results.ldquoSt Josephrsquos have done a brilliant job in helping craft this approach, and in turn have seen their own curriculum and learning practices blossom.St Josephrsquos will be hosting an open day on Wednesday March .

The short list of potential locations for e-bike stations includes Penarth Town Centre, Cogan Train Centre, Penarth Train Station, Llandough Hospital, The Esplanade, Cosmeston Country Park, Cardf Bay Barrage, and Pont-y-Werin Bridge.The scheme hopes to encourage people to switch from their daily car journey to e-bikes, saving on average g of CO for every  kilometre travelled.The average round trip from Penarth to Cardf is km, which would save ,g of COused daily.Nextbike Managing Director, Krysia Solheim, said the Penarth scheme would be great for those who commute into the capital.ldquoWe know from our research that a lot of commuters already cycle from Penarth into Cardf, said Ms Solheim.ldquoE-bikes will make that journey easier and quicker than ever before, which will hopefully persuade more people to switch from four wheels to two on a daily basis. Picking up an e-bike instead of jumping in the car is also a great way for people to reduce their own personal carbon footprints to help our communities tackle climate change.ldquoPenarth will play an important part in leading the bike share revolution in Wales - itrsquos an exciting time - and we want the community to be as involved as possible.\"Councillor Peter King, Cabinet Member for Neighbourhood Services and Transport, said: ldquoFeedback from the Nextbike consultation was overwhelmingly positive, with many residents hoping to see the expansion of the scheme to the wider Vale.ldquoHaving declared a climate emergency last year, and having recently proposed a pound.m investment into tackling environmental issues, the Nextbike scheme will be a leading example of our commitment to tackling climate change and improving the wellbeing of our residents. We hope this will inspire the launch of similar schemes in future.The Nextbike project is being funded by Section  sustainable transport contributions. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

In the last few years Pulse PR has worked with clients include Applegreen, during the roll-out of its first stores in Northern Ireland, jewellery retailer Argento that has over  high street stores in Ireland and one of Ireland’s most iconic gt wear brands, Belleek. And with a business spirit which has helped take root due to her father’s own entrepreneurial background, Grainne’s developed her own firm over the last  years – growing with the changing media landscape, creating communications and marketing strategies, working with tech start-ups from the ground up and building on strong media relationships. “For seven years I had worked with PR agencies and businesses such as Barclays, Tayto and Tesco. I was approaching  and I decided it was now or never,” she told Ulster Business. Networking at Down Royal Racecourse with a pocket full of business cards saw her leave with three clients, and from that, the business was born. Although Pulse PR was initially centred around work with public relations and press, Grainne now works with a lot of start-ups, particularly those within tech – her business is also based at Catalyst, formerly the Northern Ireland Science Park, which is the largest technology park here. One of those she’s now working closely with is IRP Commerce – a £m turnover software development company which made it on to Deloitte’s Technology Fast  list of high growth technology companies seven times. “That relationship started eight years ago with a press release, and now I work with them to target retailers, manufacturers and distributors across the UK, promoting its e-commerce  at national conferences and building strategic relationships with key players in the e-commerce industry. When I started it was very traditional PR, and dealing with newspapers and magazines. Now, it’s also grown further into the digital sphere with online PR, blogging and video testimonials. “I’ve seen a big sht in how my time is spent from when I started  years ago. Although clients still value print coverage, there is definitely a demand to create engaging campaigns for social media. “Because of how the world is changing, I have had to ersy as well. It’s about being flexible and realising the developing trends, and trying to adapt. I’ve always been comfortable in front of the camera or with a microphone in my hand so turned this into a business opportunity to host events, commentate on radio or host  at tech conferences – there is an under-representation of women in this sector so it’s a gap I believe I fill.” As a self-employed businesswoman, Grainne extends her reach with clients by collaborating with freelance photographers, designers and videographers. “You have to get results for your clients. I purposely keep my client list manageable so I’m not competing against myself and I can broaden the scope of activity I do for them,” she says. Grainne also works with Catalyst on its Springboard programme as a marketing domain expert, giving start-up companies assistance when they are bringing their product to market. She says most of her clients come through referrals from other companies she’s been involved with. “Referrals are great as it means I’ve done a good job for the person referring me. I also find a lot of work comes from people I have previously worked with or went to school with. Northern Ireland is known for having two degrees of separation – this also applies in the business world.” She’s also been working with the Ulster Farmers’ Union this year to help promote the organisation’s Open Farm Weekend. It’s an initiative, sponsored by Bank of Ireland UK, to allow members of the public to pay a visit to a farm for the first time. “This is a new sector for me, but the principles are the same – find out the end user and then apply the right marketing tools to engage with them. “It’s about fitting in with a company and how that business thinks – being adaptable and working out what they want, and trying to help them grow. It’s about presenting a strong and clear message, developing strong media contacts and also working across digital and print media to boost reach.” In  years, the media and PR landscape has evolved, including how information is consumed. “But I’m still a firm believer in knowing the basics,” she says. “It’s about having the experience and the education to be able to do it. After my degree and Master’s, I studied to gain additional post-graduate qualications from the Chartered Institute of Marketing. I’m a firm believer in le-long learning. Too many people starting in the industry think all the need is a smartphone and an Instagram account. “It’s competitive, but there’s always enough business for everyone out there. You really just need a few clients and then you turn your focus to them, as well as working with others as and when they come. A few projects naturally ended last year so I’ll be expanding my client list in the coming months. It’s always exciting to start with a new company or entrepreneur. “It’s about being flexible and being aware of what is going on with your clients, and being proactive. Being a sole-trader means you are flexible and can work closely with companies, either in their office or remotely as an extended member of their marketing team. I have often thought about employing more staff, but I believe clients want to see me working on their account, rather than meeting me at the pitch and then being passed over to a junior member of staff. “There’s a great satisfaction in helping an innovative small business, which is set for bigger things, and working alongside them in getting their message out there, building, growing and creating jobs. You really want to work with them and help build their business. “It’s about building the relationships and contacts, and that’s something you can’t teach. People buy from people and I believe one of the reasons I have kept many of the same clients for  years is because I always go the extra mile and am true to my word.” Grainne’s desire  years ago to go it alone with Pulse PR is something she says is very much part of the family story. “My father Malachy is an entrepreneur, a mechanic by trade, but he’s always been able to turn his hand to everything,” she says. My sister Orla was also self-employed as a pharmacist. I’ve been brought up in that environment and we’ve always had support and a ‘can do’ attitude from our mother Geraldine. I had a baby, Gabriel, four months ago but didn’t get the option to take maternity leave. This is the downside of being self-employed, but the flipside means I can work from home when I need to.” As for the next  years, Grainne says it’s about trying to give something back, using her skills to help those who have little or no experience in knowing how to bring their message and products to the fore. “I’m still as passionate about business as I was  years ago. I’m excited to see how I can continue to use my skills to add value to clients to ensure their message and their voice is heard.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail_MM-Photo-1.jpg","title":"manufacturing month ni to showcase strength of sector","story":"Posted on Tuesday  January  by Ulster Business Economy Minister Diane Doods with Manufacturing NIs Stephen Kelly Northern Ireland’s burgeoning manufacturing sector will be showcased as part of a major initiative to highlight the strength and excellence of the industry here.

The revamp is part of the Department of Finance’s Reval – which is a reassessment of the rates system which businesses pay. While still a draft schedule of values, each council will also have to apply its own regional rate, based on the new proposed figures.“The Cathedral Quarter isn’t just about eating and drinking,” Gareth Neill, BID manager, Destination CQ told Ulster Business.“We have a vibrant ecosystem of arts and culture and fantastic built heritage that makes this area stand out, hospitality plays an integral part to the quality of le in this part of Belfast – for a city to be striving to attract new residents, increase our tourism offer these are crucial to the city’s success. “We are concerned about that the potential knock-on effects to the affected business owners and there’s a very real possibility it will have an impact on the price of a pint to the people who come to socialise in Cathedral Quarter. The knock-on effect of outdated methodology for calculation of rates on licensed premiseshas a potentially crippling effect on jobs and character of this area.”A spokesman for Land  Property Services said: “In Northern Ireland, nearly % of pubs will have no change or a decrease in their Net Annual Value .“Any business rate payer who thinks their new valuation may be incorrect, can contact LPS to arrange an informal review and supply any relevant information before the new valuation list comes into force on  April .”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/mip1.jpg","title":"mipim taking belfast to the world","story":"Posted on Friday  January  by Ulster Business Joe ONeill and Suzanne Wylie Belfast Harbour boss Joe O’Neill will help lead a private and public sector delegation to MIPIM – the world’s biggest commercial property event – as chairman of the taskforce. He chats to John Mulgrew about the big announcements, fighting off the competition and attracting a global giant to Northern Ireland For Joe O’Neill and the wider delegation heading to potentially warmer climates, the proposition of selling the city and wider region to major investors has gotten easier.In the five years since Belfast ed to MIPIM – an event which sees tens of thousands descend on Cannes in France for four days of real estate and development – the private and public team, and taskforce, have developed a “strong ” in which to sell the city and Northern Ireland, with hopes of attracting a big name insurance or tech firm on the list.“MIPIM is a great  for the promotion of city-wide initiatives, and demonstrating to investors and to occupiers the growth potential in the city, and the opportunities for them and that the key stakeholders are all aligned behind an appropriate growth agenda,” Joe says.“You see dferent sizes and scales of stands out there – you see some really ambitious stands and proposed developments, so Belfast has to see it’s entry point into that. Belfast first and foremost will be competing against peer group cities within the UK… but then it is a worldwide show, so you will be competing against other cities.”Belfast is leading a major delegation this year, and will also be joined by representatives from other Northern Ireland councils, including those that are part of the Belfast Region City Deal, such as Mid  East Antrim. That deal is also going to be a focus for announcements and development, during the event.This year’s delegation will be led by a host of top private sector developers in Northern Ireland, alongside Belfast City Council and organisations such as Belfast Harbour. That includes Bywater, Wirefox, Titanic Quarter, Tribeca, McAleer  Rushe and Graham Group, along with the two universities and others working within related fields from law, professional services and the supply chain.For Joe and the delegation, MIPIM represents an opportunity to announce some of Belfast and Northern Ireland’s wider major new infrastructure and commercial plans. Previous visits have included the announcement of major offices schemes, hotels and apartment developments.“We will have a series of announcements – some of those announcements will be new, and some will be progress, and demonstrating to investors or occupiers that progress has been madeit’s a multi-year scheme, to show we are delivering.“… we have new projects coming through the pipeline in ious sectors. This year we are looking at launching schemes around digital innovation. That aligns with one of the themes in the Belfast Region City Deal, for the city and councils in the deal. We have a particular focus on cyber-security as an investment and operating location – particular those from the US.”Joe says that would be in addition to the already well-established cyber-security development at Catalyst in the Titanic Quarter, and that new names are coming in to the marketplace creating a “cluster” around the sector, and setting up Belfast and beyond as a new global hub.“We are looking at announcing some details around the Belfast-Dublin-London corridor,” Joe says.“As an economic corridor, or triangle. Post-Brexit, there are clear synergies in developing a proposition where companies can avail of the three locationsthey are looking at a global footprint, and see advantages to locations in three cities.”The issue of increasing connectivity between Belfast and Dublin also remains high on the list – improving the speed and frequency, and making developers aware of the new Belfast Transport Hub, which will transform the city’s rail and bus connectivity when complete.For Belfast Harbour, it’s also bringing the expansion of its already successful film studios to MIPIM, amid further plans to grow and develop the hub to attract big names and become the largest of its kind outside London.“We will be revealing more of our expansion plans, which is being supported by NI Screen,” Joe said. Some of those delivering their own presentations to potential investors will include the Harbour, Belfast City Council, Catalyst and the universities. “We are out looking around, when we are there, at what dferent cities are doing – seeing whether something works well, and looking at our competitive advantage in that area.”As for the strengths and attraction for potential investors, Joe says: “Skills, talent and technology are very much at the fore. Agility as a small region and to be able to respond, and seeing that team Belfast is there and that we are aligned with a particular project. It doesn’t have to be taken back home and introduced to someone .“There is the emergence of Belfast as an attractive city – investment opening up, and people are always looking at new markets. “Part of the initial roll-out when I took on the chair of MIPIM, the role was to go around to ask those who were on board previously to ask about it,it had changed. Everyone noticed and recognised considerablechange over the last four years. “We were pioneering and establishing ourselves four years ago, now they felt we were very much a concerted and effective operating team… the collective was a powerful message, and having  or lunches involving all of the stakeholders at one time. It’s a really strong  to take on the next chapter.”So, for Joe and the rest of the MIPIM delegation, what would be considered a major goal or success on the back of the visit to the commercial property show in March  “A particular focus this year is to attract key institutional investors – the big insurance companies for example. That’s a chicken and egg situation… you need to have product, to have product you have to show that you have occupiers and a steady revenue stream. “What we have been able to say to the investment market is ‘we have product and we now have sustainable occupation coming through… now it feels like the right time for you as an investor, to come in, and to support further investment’.”Asked whether replicating the successes of our neighbours in Dublin in attracting tech giants such as Apple, Facebook and Google is also on the cards, Joe says: “Something like that, or a major investor. For them to do that – a technology or an investment company – they need to see that the public, private and third-tier sectors are all collaborating together to make an effective market, and I think we are good at doing that now.”And the timing couldn’t be better for the delegation – now able to go in with a clear mandate and message with the restoration of the Executive and ato day-to-day power-sharing politics.“The positive thing for us is with the government and secondly, somearound Brexit… it takes those two challenging issues off the table.” πView all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/johnm1.jpg","title":"companies must act quickly on new ir legislation reforms","story":"Posted on Monday February  by Ulster Business At the start of this year the government launched a review into the changes to IR legislation which will affect medium and large private sector organisations and have far-reaching impacts on the way they engage with non-permanent workers, writes John Moore, managing director, Hays NI.The timeframe between the review and the reforms coming into effect in April is shorter than many would have liked but with the reforms now on the horizon, companies need to act, particularly those in sectors such as technology, construction and finance where use of contractors operating as personal services companiesis common. At a basic level, the reforms to IR legislation sht the responsibility of determining the tax status of personal services company workers to the company that engages them where previously they could self-certy. The original rules required the freelance contractor to determine their tax status, but HMRC believed non-compliance was common.Now,a person’s assignment falls outside of IR legislation, they are deemed to be self-employed, so gross payment will be made to the PSC. Butthe assignment falls inside of IR, the professional should be treated as an employee, applying PAYE and NIC deductions from their payment. In simple terms, the tax arrangements for contractors are changing so that they won’t get such a good dealthey can’t demonstrate their work is out of scope and employers will have to pay more for using and keeping what were previously non-payroll workers.This will have a big effect on how people choose to work and who they choose to work for, not to mention how organisations plan and budget. An organisation’s policy towards contractors will affect how attractive they are to freelancers. But on the other side we’ve already seen some risk averse companies adopt a blanket ban on freelancers just to be safe – meaning they are missing out on skilled professionals they need to deliver projects.In Northern Ireland, as where, it’s likely the IR reforms will hit technology hardest, but the effects could be wide ranging across roles in construction, project management and finance.We’ve heard anecdotal evidence of IT contractors leaving the big banks and starting to view early stage tech companies with less than  employees more favourably because they fall outside the scope of the legislation. When similar legislation was introduced in the public sector in , hundreds of highly skilled contractors left roles to join organisations who were prepared, often leading to projects being scrapped. Now the private sector is catching up, preparation is key and anyone who hasn’t done a review of what it means for their capacity should do so urgently. A Hays survey showed % of private sector firms expect cost increases when IR reforms come into effect, % expect to lose key talent and % think it will be harder to bring in non-permanent workers. A third of organisations surveyed were completely unaware of the reforms – a big concern given how tight the labour market is.So, first you need to determine whether assignments are inside or outside of IR. You need to have full visibility of all workers your organisation engages who are paid via agencies and consultancies as well as knowledge of how they are paid. You will also need to have the expertise to determine the tax status of each assignment. When you know that you can then start communicating with freelance workers, renegotiating working arrangements, standardising onboarding procedures and decidingany specialist skills need to be brought in house to get projects over the line.If you expect to use a high volume of temporary workers in , outsourcing your temporary worker provision through a managed services programme could be an option, as an expert would carry out accurate assessments for every temporary worker placed with you.Whatever stage you are at, don’t ignore IR. It’s coming and you need to understand it.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/EHP_20200109_-3489_web.jpg","title":"nie networks keeping the lights on and a focus on the future of power","story":"Posted on Thursday February  by Ulster Business Paul Stapleton, managing director of NIE Networks, sits down with Ulster Business to chat about the future of energy here, huge investment across Northern Ireland and the responsibility of keeping the lights on for almost two million people In the last three decades, Paul Stapleton has already seen signicant sweeping changes across the energy industry, and is now helping lead the charge towards a carbon neutral economy with an ever-increasing focus on green power.He is now at the helm of NIE Networks – an organisation responsible for the electricity network here, delivering reliable power to , businesses, homes and farms right across Northern Ireland.“Our role is to provide a safe and reliable network – keeping the lights on  ,  days a year,” Paul told Ulster Business.And part of that responsibility and ability to ensure strong and reliable electricity flow is an investment of around £m each year, working towards a  ‘net zero’ carbon emissions target and embracing the key changes and evolution in power here.“Many dferent players need to work together to ensure the electricity system of the future can achieve what it needs to achieve in terms of zero carbon and remaining economically efficient, and reliable, at the same time,” he says.“We are the custodians of the electricity network – everything between where power is generated and up to and including the meter in your home or business.“Our network is connected to , customers – that’s every home, every farm, every business, and every organisation in NI. It’s a regulated utility business, and commercially, everything is regulated by the Utility Regulator.”Paul’s been in the energy industry for his entire working le. The Limerick man joined ESB in  where he held a number of senior management positions, before taking up his current role in May .He’s taken over NIE Networks as it’s hitting record performance targets, with those likely to improve further still this year.“The network is in as good as condition as it ever was, and we are giving a good service in terms of continuity of supply. “In , we achieved a ‘customer minutes lost’ average of  minutes, which is the lowest in our history. But we will continue to look at improving further. Where faults do occur, % are fixed within three hours and % within less than  hours. “We operate in business cycles around regulatory price controls. We are now just over two years into a six year price control. “There has been some downsizing, cost-reduction and efficiencies, while we are gearing up to deliver a signicant capital investment programme. We are investing more than £m a year in upgrading, refurbishing and maintaining the network.“The focus in present terms is about delivering for today and looking to enhance our services to customers.”But it’s the future of NIE Networks, power generation, and a new Strategic Energy Framework, which will become the focus for Paul and his team in the coming years.“A lot of my focus is about planning for the future, as well as the day-to-day,” he says. “The longer term horizon is now looking out to ,” he says. “The UK Government has enshrined in legislation the target that the economy will be entirely carbon neutral.”For Northern Ireland, it’s already broken recent records in terms of the move towards green energy. “There is a huge amount to be done and it’s a very challenging target,” he says.“It’s a huge change and transition. But I think all the scientic evidence regarding climate change suggests it has to be done, and maybe has to be done sooner.“The headline target was that we would hit % from renewable sources by . We actually achieved that target and are now at %. That is very signicant progress. It puts us ahead of GB and the Republic of Ireland.”NIE Networks has invested around £m in the network to facilitate this generation. In the last few years the number of power generators connecting to the network has grown to ,, whereas two decades ago it was reliant on the three main power stations here.“The bigger challenge is how do we use that green energy to displace carbon  That brings in transport and heat, and that’s something where the electricity sector will play an important role.“As we all start adopting electric vehicles, as I think we all will in the next decade, we have to make sure people have the ability to charge them, at home and in public spaces. It’s our role to connect the chargers and to make sure we have a network which has the capability to meet the demands.”But Paul says there’s signicant positivity out there, with a younger generation in Northern Ireland and throughout the world embracing the small everyday changes that have to be made in order to tackle an international problem.“We are in the policy framing stage and  is going to be key. There is a call for evidence now from the Department for the Economy to inform the development of a new Energy Strategy for Northern Ireland and I would encourage anyone who has any interest in energy or climate change to contribute into that.“Hopefully that will lead to the development of clear policy initiatives, targets and measures for Northern Ireland and that will set the context for the market to respond.“I think there is economic opportunity for Northern Ireland, but there will be some downsides. We need to minimise the downsides and maximise the opportunities.”NIE Networks is currently examining its role in the future energy market in Northern Ireland. That includes looking at how it can make the distribution network more open and accessible in order to allow burgeoning technologies, such as battery storage, heat pumps and electric vehicles, to be introduced and operate in a sustainable way.“We see our role as evolving. Historically, we were somewhat passive – we provided an infrastructure which shipped electricity from A to B. Now, we need to be much more proactive and we are part of an overall system.”That includes a role in balancing when green energy is available and when it is required and in high demand on the distribution system. “All of that needs a more connected and dynamic distribution system – rather than just being seen as a physical infrastructure,” Paul says.“We need private investment and developers who are willing to invest in new solutions, whether it’s wind, solar, electric vehicle charging or heat delivery. All of those need policy directions, but they also need a network to connect to, so we have a major role to enable all of that.”Paul says most businesses and iniduals now know that they “have to get on this journey” in order to play their part in tackling climate change, reducing their carbon emissions and improving energy efficiency.With Brexit, there have been concerns over the future of the all-island energy market. But Paul is confident that it will be secured, despite the UK’s exit from the EU. “That continuing is really important for businesses in Northern Ireland. Currently, all sides in the Brexit debate seem comfortable that the Single Electricity Marketwill continue, so we don’t see any specic threat around that.”As part of NIE Networks’ Northern Ireland-wide investment in infrastructure – of around £m a year – it has recently completed a £, investment in the Cathedral Quarter area of Belfast – where our interview took place – which is home to many of its best known pubs and restaurants. “That gives us a more resilient and reliable supply, as well as capacity for the future,” Paul says. Some of the other latest investments include projects in Enniskillen in advance of a new public realm scheme, along with another in Newry.“Right across Northern Ireland we are continuing to invest,” Paul says. “There is a lot going on. There’s a lot to do today, challenges, to keep efficient supply for the economy, but equally we need to plan for the future.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
