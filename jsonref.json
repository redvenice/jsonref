Among the tweets were ones that pictured Jarrett next to a character from Planet of the Apes, and a doctored image of Whoopie Goldberg wearing a t-shirt that shows Trump shooting himself in the head      Despite apologizing for her previous comments about George Soros and Valerie Jarrett, Barr retweeted a stream of content that backed her remarks while wading into other right-wing causes and conspiracies      Barr also said she thought former Obama adviser Valerie Jarrett was white when she penned the racist tweet that got her show pulled from television          Barr said she though Jarrett \u0027was Jewish and Persian\u0027 amid a bizarre flurry tweets penned late on Tuesday night          Valerie Jarrett was born in Iran but both of her parents are African American, and her great-grandfather was the first credited African American architect. She appeared on MSNBC on Tuesday (pictured) to lay blame for Barr\u0027s rhetoric at the feet of President Trump, saying: \u0027The tone comes from the top\u0027          The shamed star also blamed her racist rant on sleeping pill Ambien. Users have previously reported going into blackouts and performing complex actions such as driving and making food without recalling it           Roseanne\u0027s show was the most viewed program on ABC before it was cancelled over a tweet in which she said Jarrett was the lovechild of the \u0027Muslim Brotherhood and Planet of the Apes\u0027          Actor John Goodman, 65, stepped out to walk his dog in New Orleans on Tuesday soon after news broke that his show \u0027Roseanne\u0027 had been canceled because of his castmate Roseanne Barr\u0027s racist tweets          She then went on to rant about what she described as a Soros plot to overthrow America \u0027by buyingbacking candidates 4 local district attorney races who will ignore US law \u0026amp favor \u0027feelings\u0027 instead-and call everyone who is alarmed by that \u0027racist\u0027.\u0027Following on from that, she called on Americans to unite against his narrative while throwing a reference to MK Ultra, a discontinued CIA program that right-wing conspiracy theorists believe is still ongoing, into the mix           It was during this rant that Barr made the comment \u0027muslim brotherhood and planet of the apes had a babyvj\u0027, using Valerie Jarrett\u0027s initials, that would see her show axed.Barr subsequently deleted the tweet but not before it had been copied and shared across social media, leading to swift calls for her show to be pulled from the air.          After Barr\u0027s now-infamous Planet of the Apes tweet had been sent, Clinton replied around 9am to say that she was not in fact married to a Soros, though she admired the work his foundation does.Barr subsequently sent a Tweet apologizing to Clinton for the mistake, though launched another broadside at Soros by claiming he was a \u0027Nazi\u0027 who betrayed Jews during the holocaust.The actress also launched a salvo at Clinton\u0027s actual husband, Marc Mezvinsky, saying: \u0027HER HUSBAND IS THE SON OF A CORRUPT SENATOR.\u0027Clinton\u0027s father-in-law is a former congressman and convicted felon who in March of 2001 plead guilty to 31 of 69 felony charges of mail, bank and wire fraud.            But as the Clinton saga wound to a close Barr\u0027s tweet about Jarrett was catching a massive amount of attention, forcing the actress to brand her remark \u0027a joke\u0027.She also defended herself against allegations of racism by countering that Islam \u0027is not a race\u0027.The remarks were not enough, however, and around an hour later she offered a full apology to Jarrett and announced that she would be leaving Twitter.           Shortly after midday Wanda Sykes, an African-American comedian and writer working on the Roseanne reboot, announced that she was walking away from the program.Around an hour later ABC broke its silence over the controversy to say that Roseanne was being cancelled.We now know that the network spent this time contacting Jarrett to apologize and inform her of the cancellation.Barr later said that the network had bowed to pressure amid calls for a boycott of Roseanne\u0027s advertisers, though ABC did not immediately respond to her remark.In its statement, ABC said Roseanne\u0027s remark was \u0027abhorrent, repugnant and inconsistent with our values\u0027.       Soon after the news broke, Goodman, who played Barr\u0027s husband Dan on the TV show, was spotted looking very glum as he walked his dog          Goodman, 65, is yet to offer any comment on Barr\u0027s tweets or their show being axed          Gilbert, who played Darlene Conner on the series, had earlier slammed Barr\u0027s tweets as \u0027abhorrent\u0027  Barr also lashed out at former costar Sara Gilbert for her reaction to the racism row, in which Gilbert called her comments \u0027abhorrent\u0027 and \u0027disappointing\u0027, by saying \u0027wow! unreal\u0027  Bar clapped back at Michael Fishman, who played DJ Conner for the entirety of the series and was featured in the revival with a biracial daughter, accusing him of throwing her under a bus      Barr was widely condemned after she tweeted that Jarrett looked like \u0027Muslim brotherhood \u0026amp planet of the apes had a baby\u0027.Jarrett responded to the ordeal when she spoke at a town hall on MSNBC called \u0027Everyday Racism in America\u0027 later on Tuesday. She revealed that Disney CEO Bob Iger had called her to apologize.\u0027He wanted me to know before he made it public that he was canceling the show,\u0027 she said. \u0027First of all, I think we have to turn it into a teaching moment. I\u0027m fine. I\u0027m worried about all the people out there who don\u0027t have a circle of friends and followers coming to their defense. \u0027The person walking down the street minding their own business and they see someone clinging to their purse or walk across the street... or every black parent I know who has a boy who has to sit down and have a conversation, the talk as we call it.\u0027Those ordinary examples of racism that happen every single day.\u0027     ABC has decided to cancel Roseanne Barr\u0027s television show just hours after the comedian posted a racist tweet about Valerie Jarrett          \u0027We have decided to cancel her show,\u0027 Channing Dungey, President of ABC Entertainment, announced on Tuesday afternoon           Disney CEO Bob Iger  tweeted about ABC\u0027s decision, saying: \u0027There was only one thing to do here, and that was the right thing.\u0027 Disney owns ABC Television Group   Barr came under fire for a racist tweet about Valerie Jarrett during an unhinged rant on Tuesday morning          Many on Twitter were appalled by Barr\u0027s tweet, which was in response to an article from a conspiracy website The Disney CEO also tweeted about the decision to terminate the show, saying: \u0027There was only one thing to do here, and that was the right thing.\u0027Shortly after Barr\u0027s show was cancelled, talent agency ICM Partners revealed they were dropping her as a client. \u0027We are all greatly distressed by the disgraceful and unacceptable tweet from Roseanne Barr this morning,\u0027 ICM said in an internal note to employees that was obtained by the Hollywood Reporter. \u0027What she wrote is antithetical to our core values, both as iniduals and as an agency.\u0027 \u0027Consequently, we have notified her that we will not represent her. Effective immediately, Roseanne Barr is no longer a client.\u0027 It appears the cancellation of the show will also affect the cast\u0027s Emmy prospects, as ABC revealed it is suspending the show\u0027s FYC (For Your Consideration) campaign. Other networks including Viacom also dropped reruns of the original Roseanne as the industry turned its back on the show and its star performer. The swift fallout from the tweet began when Wanda Sykes  quit her role as the show\u0027s consulting producer and celebrities condemned Barr\u0027s words.   Emma Kenney, who played Sara Gilbert\u0027s daughter on the show, also revealed on Twitter that she planned to quit before finding out the show had been cancelled. \u0027I am hurt, embarrassed, and disappointed. The racist and distasteful comments from Roseanne are inexcusable,\u0027 the 18-year-old wrote. \u0027As I called my manager to quit working on Roseanne, I was told it was cancelled. I feel so empowered by @iamwandasykes , Channing Dungey and anyone at ABC standing up for morals and abuse of power. Bullies will NEVER win.\u0027Tom Arnold, who co-starred on the show from 1989 to 1993 and was married to Barr from 1990 to 1994, praised the decision to cancel the show.   \u0027Ton of respect for Bob Iger. Tough decision with financial consequences for his company but right for America,\u0027 he wrote. Michael Fishman, who played DJ Conner for the entirety of the series and was featured in the revival with a biracial daughter, said he was \u0027devastated\u0027. \u0027Today is one of the hardest days of my life. I feel devastated, not for the end of the Roseanne show, but for all those who poured their hearts and souls into our jobs, and the audience that welcomed us into their home,\u0027 he wrote on Twitter. Comedian Wanda Sykes had earlier revealed she would not return to the show following the comedian\u0027s racist tweet about Valerie Jarrett (Pictured L-R: Sykes, Russell Peters, Barr, JB Smoove, Keenen Ivory Wayans in 2014)          Sykes, a consulting producer for Barr\u0027s eponymous show on ABC, revealed the news on Twitter          Emma Kenney, who played Sara Gilbert\u0027s daughter on the show, revealed on Twitter that she planned to quit before finding out the show had been cancelled           Tom Arnold, who co-starred on the show from 1989 to 1993 and was married to Barr from 1990 to 1994, praised the decision to cancel the showFishman said he condemned Roseanne\u0027s statement \u0027vehemently\u0027, saying they were \u0027reprehensible and intolerable\u0027 and \u0027truly offensive\u0027.  \u0027My character was designed to represent the inclusive nature of my views. To represent potions of society often marginalized,\u0027 he wrote. \u0027In this moment it is important to be clear. We must stand up against bias, hatred, bigotry, and ignorance to make society a better place for all.\u0027  Many called on ABC to fire Barr or drop the show as others criticized the broadcast network for its enduring silence amid recent controversies with the comedian.Others were skeptical that ABC would dare touch the hit series, which is the third highest-rated show this year following Sunday Night Football and This Is Us.The revival of Roseanne was a ratings juggernaut when it premiered on ABC to a whopping 25 million viewers in April.It\u0027s surprising success even elicited a congratulatory phone call and tweet from President Donald Trump. Ratings dropped steadily thereafter, with last week\u0027s season finale garnering 10.33 million viewers.ABC  initially ordered 13 episodes for the second season and said the show would move away from its controversial politics and focus on family.    Roseanne\u0027s mention of the \u0027Muslim brotherhood\u0027 seems to be due to the long-running conspiracy theory that Jarrett is Muslim, despite there being no supporting evidence           She also retweeted an article with the headline: \u0027Valerie Jarrett...was her mommy a Commie?\u0027The show most recently came under fire for featuring an episode in which Barr\u0027s character believes her new Muslim neighbors are terrorists. Roseanne\u0027s mention of the \u0027Muslim brotherhood\u0027 in her Tuesday tweet seems to be due to the long-running conspiracy theory that Jarrett is Muslim. Jarrett, who was Obama\u0027s senior adviser during his presidency, was born in Iran to American parents and lived in Shiraz for six years. The family had moved to Iran because her father was part of a program that sent American physicians to help developing countries. He ran a children\u0027s hospital.There has never been any indication that Jarrett or her parents are Muslim.  Barr later claimed the comment was a \u0027joke\u0027 when she was called out on Twitter by CNN reporter Andrew Kaczynski. \u0027ABC is doing their best to ignore some of these statements from Roseanne and she is making it really hard for them by taking it to the next level here,\u0027 he wrote. After Roseanne responds, Kaczynski replied: \u0027understand it\u0027s a joke, but can you see why some people think comparing a black woman to Planet of the Apes might be racist and find the Muslim Brotherhood reference to be conspiratorial and Islamophobic?\u0027  EDL founder Tommy Robinson arrested by police outside court\u0027I\u0027m not buying her book\u0027: Emily Hunt on Greer\u0027s rape commentsYoung boy tries multiple times to give President Trump a hugOut of control bus causes cars to collide on main roadHow to survive a knife attack: Chinese police\u0027s 12 second advice goes viralShocking moment cyclist pulls knife on driver in fit of road rageMichael Rotondo talks his mental health and losing his son\u0027She can\u0027t handle whiskey at all\u0027: Lyndsey on fight with Black JuicyWomen throw mugs of tea and council bins at each other in street brawlShocking brawl breaks out between English and French touristsMan headbutts thug who is beating his ex-wife in Turkish street    A number of stars have since condemned Barr for the tweet, including Patricia Arquette and Julianne Moore. Rev Al Sharpton used ABC to fire Barr, while Rosie O\u0027Donnell defended her          Not everyone was happy with ABC\u0027s decision to cancel the show. Some stood by in their support for Barr, while others said the network should have continued without her A number of celebrities  also condemned Barr for the tweet, with some urging ABC to fire her from the show completely.\u0027I am repulsed that Valerie Jarret had that racist and bigoted \u0027joke\u0027 made at her expense and I am sickened that any Black or Muslim person has to keep hearing this sickness in 2018,\u0027 Patricia Arquette tweeted. \u0027You can take @RoseanneOnABC out of racism but you can\u0027t take the racism out of @therealroseanne,\u0027 Don Cheadle wrote. \u0027I told y\u0027all about Roseanne. I told you. So,\u0027 author Roxane Gay added, to which Julianne Moore replied: \u0027Yes you did. #FireRoseanne.\u0027 Reverend Al Sharpton also criticized the comedian and called on ABC to \u0027take action now\u0027. \u0027The comparison by Rosanne Barr on ABC of Former Obama aide, Valerie Jarrett to an APE is racist and inexcusable,\u0027 he tweeted. Tomi Lahren was a rare prominent conservative voice to hit out at Roseanne. \u0027What Roseanne said was wrong,\u0027 she tweeted. \u0027I\u0027m sure she knows that. She made a mistake.\u0027 \u0027I don\u0027t know why fellow conservatives are playing mental gymnastics trying to justify it. Come on. Wrong is wrong.\u0027 Only Rosie O\u0027Donnell appeared to lend some support to Roseanne, writing that she loved her \u0027quite a bit\u0027. \u0027The comment Roseanne tweeted was racist and childish and beneath her best self,\u0027 O\u0027Donnell wrote. \u0027She has apologized. Twitter is a dangerous place.\u0027 EDL founder Tommy Robinson arrested by police outside court\u0027I\u0027m not buying her book\u0027: Emily Hunt on Greer\u0027s rape commentsYoung boy tries multiple times to give President Trump a hugOut of control bus causes cars to collide on main roadHow to survive a knife attack: Chinese police\u0027s 12 second advice goes viralShocking moment cyclist pulls knife on driver in fit of road rageMichael Rotondo talks his mental health and losing his son\u0027She can\u0027t handle whiskey at all\u0027: Lyndsey on fight with Black JuicyWomen throw mugs of tea and council bins at each other in street brawlShocking brawl breaks out between English and French touristsMan headbutts thug who is beating his ex-wife in Turkish street    Barr came under fire on the very night the revival of Roseanne premiered in April when she accused Parkland shooting survivor David Hogg of giving a \u0027Nazi Salute\u0027.Barr swiftly took the tweet down and claimed that she had seen a \u0027doctored\u0027 image of Hogg. But internet sleuths found a grab of Barr\u0027s original tweet, which revealed she was commenting on picture of Hogg raising his fist at the March For Our Lives rally. That same week, Barr also made headlines when she tweeted about a bizarre right-wing conspiracy theory claiming Trump broke up a pedophile ring created by Democratic politicians.  Barr claimed that it was Trump who had freed \u0027so many children held in bondage to pimps all over this world\u0027.           In 2015 Barr made headlines after tweeting she \u0027hope UC Davis gets nuked\u0027 after the student body voted to est from companies that have ties to Israel\u0027He has broken up trafficking rings in high places everywhere. notice that. I disagree on some things, but give him benefit of doubt-4 now,\u0027 she added. The tweet was similar to when, in 2015, Barr revealed that she believed the Pizzagate conspiracy theory that Hillary Clinton was running a child sex-ring in a pizza shop. \u0027Americans! The reason #DEMOCRATS aren\u0027t approving #Sessions is bc he will prosecure #HRC – and make arrests over PedoGate RT THIS!! WAKE UP!!\u0027Barr was slammed and derided for the tweets. She later apologized for mentioning child trafficking and said Twitter was \u0027not the place for it\u0027. In 2015 Barr made headlines after tweeting she \u0027hope all the jews leave UC Davis and then it gets nuked!\u0027 after the student body voted to est from companies that have ties to Israel           In 2012 the comedian came under fire after she spoke out against transgender bathroom rightsIn 2012 the comedian came under fire after she spoke out against transgender bathroom rights. \u0027Women do not want your penises forced in their faces or in private bathrooms. Respect that,\u0027 she wrote.  After the comedian\u0027s most recent Twitter controversies came to light, Walt Disney President Ben Sherwood responded that \u0027you can\u0027t control Roseanne Barr\u0027.\u0027Many who have tried have failed. She\u0027s the one and only,\u0027 he added. But as Tuesday\u0027s news has proved, you can still cancel here.                         \u0027You\u0027re a racist pig \u0026amp ABC should be ashamed that they give you a platform,\u0027 another added. Roseanne later tweeted, in an attempt to defend herself, that \u0027Islam is not a race\u0027. \u0027Islam includes EVERY RACE of people,\u0027 she added, still without acknowledging the fact that there is no evidence Jarrett has ties to the Islamic faith. She also retweeted an article whose headline read: \u0027Valerie Jarrett...was her mommy a Commie?\u0027 About an hour later, Roseanne apologized and said she was leaving Twitter.     \u0027I apologize to Valerie Jarrett and to all Americans,\u0027 she wrote in a separate tweet. \u0027I am truly sorry for making a bad joke about her politics and her looks. I should have known better. Forgive me-my joke was in bad taste.\u0027         EDL founder Tommy Robinson arrested by police outside court\u0027I\u0027m not buying her book\u0027: Emily Hunt on Greer\u0027s rape commentsYoung boy tries multiple times to give President Trump a hugOut of control bus causes cars to collide on main roadHow to survive a knife attack: Chinese police\u0027s 12 second advice goes viralShocking moment cyclist pulls knife on driver in fit of road rageMichael Rotondo talks his mental health and losing his son\u0027She can\u0027t handle whiskey at all\u0027: Lyndsey on fight with Black JuicyWomen throw mugs of tea and council bins at each other in street brawlShocking brawl breaks out between English and French touristsMan headbutts thug who is beating his ex-wife in Turkish street    Much like its revival, Roseanne was an almost instant success when it premiered in 1988 and quickly became the umber one show on television It also turned Barr, who previously performed stand-up comedy on Johnny Carson\u0027s Tonight Show, into a household name. The show ran for nine seasons, featuring numerous storylines that were rare for network sitcoms in the nineties.   The show  tackled episodes that focused on taboo topics for the times like homophobia, abortion, teen pregnancy, masturbation, and domestic abuse.Barr, who has a lesbian sister and a gay brother, also made sure to feature a number of LGBT characters on the show. One episode of the show even featured Roseanne contemplating whether or not she should have an abortion, while others discussed previously taboo topics like masturbation.           The show ran for nine seasons, featuring numerous storylines that were rare for network sitcoms in the nineties - such as issues paying bills and homophobia The show won both Barr and Laurie Metcalf, who played her sister, respective Emmy Awards for Best Actress and Best Supporting Actress. It also won the prestigious Peabody Award in 1992. ABC announced in May 2017 that it planned to do a revival of the beloved series, which aired in March of the following year. The news garnered controversy from the beginning when it was revealed Roseanne would return as a pro-Trump grandmother. It also featured episodes that include her husband Dan, played by John Goodman, losing his job to an illegal immigrant and Roseanne\u0027s fears after finding out her new next-door neighbors are Muslim.

One stupid joke in a lifetime of fighting 4 civil rights 4 all minorities, against networks, studios, at the expense of my nervous systemfamilywealth will NEVER b taken from me.\u0027That comment came hours after Barr retweeted an outlandish statement suggesting that Michelle Obama played a role in her firing.       She suggested Michelle Obama was behind her firing by retweeting two unsourced claims alleging that the former first lady conspired with Channing Dungey ahead of ABC\u0027s decision          \u0027According to sources ABC President Channing Dungey had a long conversation via phone with former First Lady Michelle Obama before deciding to cancel the Roseanne show,\u0027 read the tweet. \u0027Michelle Obama was reportedly enraged and insisted an apology was inadequate.\u0027Barr also retweeted a post that further suggested this was an attempt by the Obamas to get revenge after she mocked the couple\u0027s Netflix deal with a hashtag last week that became a trending topic.\u0027Interesting. A few days after the popular #ObmasNetflixShows was all over the place making people giggle. Not surprised and I would not doubt it being very true,\u0027 read the post that Barr shared with her followers.These were just two of the conspiracy theories retweeted by Barr in the wake of the show\u0027s cancellation.    ABC decided to cancel Roseanne Barr\u0027s television show \u0027Roseanne\u0027 on Tuesday just hours after the comedian posted a racist tweet about Valerie Jarrett          Valerie Jarrett has spoken out on the controversy surrounding Roseanne Barr\u0027s racist tweets, saying the ABC made the right decision to cancel her show          Roseanne caused outrage when she compared ex-Obama adviser Valerie Jarrett to an ape on Twitter           Keeping above the fray: Barr also retweeted an inidual who suggested the Obamas, who employed and are close friends with Valerie Jarrett, did this as revenge because Barr mocked their $50 million Netflix deal (l to r: Jarrett, Michelle and Barack in 2014)It comes after her ex-husband Tom Arnold told CNN\u0027s Anderson Cooper that he wasn\u0027t surprised and it was only a matter of time before all hell broke loose. Arnold - who was a writer on the original Rosanne series - claimed that Barr\u0027s politics and social media showed that she was obsessed with the conspiracy theories that Donald Trump has been feeding to the masses.  \u0027This monkey thing is something that she tweeted before about black people, its a meme that she and thousands of her alt-right fans do. They love to call black people monkeys, it\u0027s not a one time joke,\u0027 Arnold said. \u0027They can do this because we have a white trash racist president. That\u0027s a fact!\u0027Arnold shared his disgust with how Trump was only concerned with how the media had treated him when news of Barr\u0027s tweets made their way to him.        Meanwhile, Barr\u0027s son Jake shared text exchanges with his mother on Wednesday to seemingly prove she was not racist.\u0027Her and her dad, I thought they were white,\u0027 Barr wrote in a text message she purportedly sent her son.She followed that up by saying: \u0027I would never have called a black woman an ape I\u0027m not stupid!\u0027 That is a lie however, with Barr having called former national security advisor Susan Rice just that in a 2014 tweet. The third text stated: \u0027I thought she was Jewish of Iranian.\u0027 Her son captioned the image by writing: \u0027Mom and I are too dumb for the internet lol.           On Wednesday, actor Tom Arnold appeared on AC360 to share that he wasn\u0027t surprised when ABC pulled the plug on the \u0027Roseanne\u0027 reboot  Contextual: Her son also shared text messages that he and his mother purportedly exchanged in which Barr writes that she thought Jarrett was \u0027white\u0027 and \u0027Iranian,\u0027 posted eight hours after the show was cancelled            Commander-in-chief: President Trump complained that ABC president Bob Iger \u0027never ... apologized for the HORRIBLE statements made and said about me on ABC\u0027Barr had previously blasted two of her co-stars for speaking out against her in tweets posted around midnight.Hours after claiming she was quitting Twitter, Barr began to rail against her critics while also posting an occasional apology.Michael Fishman, who played D.J. Conner on the show and started working with Barr when he was just six, was the first to feel the wrath of the show\u0027s creator after he released a statement criticizing her racist tweet saying Jarrett looks like the lovechild of the \u0027Muslim Brotherhood and Planet of the Apes\u0027.\u0027I condemn these statements vehemently,\u0027 wrote Fishman, who is the father of a black daughter in the reboot. \u0027They are reprehensible and intolerable, contradicting my beliefs and outlook on life and society. I have always lived and taught my children to be inclusive. I believe our show strived to embrace different backgrounds and opinions, through open dialogue.\u0027Barr was none too happy with that statement and fired back on Twitter. \u0027I created the platform for that inclusivity and you know it. ME. You throw me under the bus. nice!\u0027, she wrote.Fishman responded, stating: \u0027You fought, built, and designed Roseanne for inclusiveness. That is why yesterday was so out of character with the last 30 years. It was in your hands from the beginning to the end. No one can deny that.\u0027Barr fired back: \u0027Please leave me alone, thanks.\u0027             Michael Fishman, who played D.J. Conner on the show, released a statement criticizing Barr\u0027s racist tweet  Weighing in: Gilbert, who is a producer on the reboot, let her disgust be known on TuesdayBut Fishman was not the only original cast member to take a stand, with Sara Gilbert, who played Roseanne\u0027s daughter Darlene, also releasing a statement that very much echoed the one released shortly after by ABC cancelling the show.\u0027Roseanne’s recent comments about Valerie Jarrett, and so much more, are abhorrent and do not reflect the beliefs of our cast and crew or anyone associated with our show. I am disappointed in her actions to say the least,\u0027 wrote Gilbert, who was a producer on the reboot and largely responsible for reuniting the cast.\u0027This is incredibly sad and difficult for all of us, as we’ve created a show that we believe in, are proud of, and that audiences love— one that is separate and apart from the opinions and words of one cast member.\u0027\u0027Wow! unreal,\u0027 wrote Barr, who had confessed in earlier interviews to the difficult job Gilbert had of trying to rein in her impulse to tweet offensive comments.However, she later followed up, tweeting: \u0027No, I understand her position and why she said what she said. i forgive her. It just shocked me a bit, but I indeed f***ed up.\u0027She reiterated this soon after when a follower criticized Gilbert, saying: \u0027She\u0027s distancing herself from me and my tweet-she has to.\u0027A downcast Gilbert was photographed on her phone outside an LA restaurant yesterday as John Goodman, who played Barr\u0027s husband Dan on the show, looked similarly bereft as he walked his dog in New Orleans.   "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/30/15/4CC1DAEB00000578-0-image-m-21_1527689211545.jpg","title":"The Queen placed handbag chair meeting George Brandis means","story":"    A handbag (circled) on a side chair at Buckingham Palace could be a good omen for Australia\u0027s relations with the QueenRoyal historian Hugo Vickers has previously spoken of how the monarch uses her bag to send secret signals to her staff to indicate when she\u0027s ready to move on from a conversation.Granny\u0027s pride and joy!

a sentiment which he has successfully exploited.Salvini, who in 2009 was caught on video singing songs about \u0027stinking\u0027 Neapolitans and in 2012 said the south didn\u0027t deserve the euro, represents impoverished southern region Calabria in the Senate and has redirected his regional chauvinism to take the League nationwide. Born and raised in Milan in 1973, Salvini joined what was then the Northern League in 1990, aged just 17, rising quickly through the ranks.At the time, the Northern League was a regional party known for its separatist campaign to secede from Italy, with Salvini making his name while running its Radio Padania - the wealthier northern region they wanted to see independent.One of his shows was called \u0027Never Say Italy\u0027 and in 2011, he won notoriety for boycotting Italy\u0027s 150-year anniversary celebrations, putting his desk outside Milan city hall to show he was working.\u0027The Tricolore doesn\u0027t represent me,\u0027 Salvini said of the Italian flag in 2014.But by 2018, he was campaigning as far south as Matera in the impoverished Basilicata region, where he promised \u0027order, rules, cleanliness\u0027 and railed against \u0027out of control\u0027 immigration.In a recent video on his Facebook page, which has more than two million fans, Salvini said he would work to \u0027stop the landings\u0027 once in power.He opposes same-sex unions, wants to deport foreign criminals and to bulldoze Roma camps.And as talks were under way to form the new government, he posted a photo of himself standing next to a bulldozer on Twitter with the message: \u0027We\u0027re working for you.\u0027 Since taking over the League, Salvini has forged alliances with other far-right Europeans like France\u0027s National Front and Dutch anti-Muslim politician Geert Wilders.Despite positive words for Russian President Vladimir Putin, Salvini in 2013 called the EU a \u0027gulag\u0027 like the \u0027Soviet Union\u0027 saying he would work to try and leave it.He has kept immigration high on the agenda, and has pointed the finger at \u0027an invasion\u0027 as responsible for the racist gun rampage in February in central Italy in which a self-proclaimed fascist shot six Africans.A savvy social media user, he has managed to successfully push his agenda online, updating his followers daily with constant updates, live videos, photos and even pictures of what he eats.Although happy to talk about his two children - 14-year-old Federico and Mirta, five - he is less happy to discuss his complicated love life.Currently living with glamorous model and TV presenter Elisa Isoardi, his children are from two previous relationships, one with ex-wife Fabrizia Ieluzzi, a political journalist, and the other with former girlfriend Giulia Martinelli.                                                      In light of the populists\u0027 successful talks, Cottarelli announced on Thursday that he was giving up his mandate to form a technocrat government.\u0027The formation of a political government is by far the best solution for the country, because it avoids the uncertainty that would arise with new elections,\u0027 said Cottarelli after meeting with Mattarella. The programme proposed by the populists promises to revive Italy\u0027s sluggish economy by rejecting austerity and increasing spending.Their ambitious economic proposals - which include a universal basic income for Italy\u0027s poorest, rolling back pension reform and a two tier flat tax - have worried Brussels and financial markets given the country\u0027s sizeable debt.  Italy\u0027s 2.3 trillion euros of debt is 132 percent of its gross domestic product (GDP), the highest ratio in Europe apart from Greece and more than double the bloc\u0027s 60-percent ceiling.The government programme includes plans to speed up expulsions of illegal immigrants and crack down on trafficking. The eurosceptic coalition also promises a series of measures to reign in the EU including renegotiation of EU treaties and a review of the bloc\u0027s economic governance on issues such as the single currency.  But on Thursday EU chief Jean-Claude Juncker warned against blaming the EU for all of Italy\u0027s problems.\u0027I\u0027m in deep love with Italy, Bella Italia. But I no longer accept that everything which is going wrong in South of Italy, in Mezzogiorno, is explained by the fact that the EU or the European Commission would not do enough,\u0027 he said after leaving a meeting in Brussels.\u0027Italians have to take care of the poor regions of Italy. That means more work, less corruption, seriousness.\u0027He urged Italy not to \u0027play this game\u0027 of holding the EU responsible, adding \u0027Nations first, Europe second.\u0027 Political neophyte Conte skipped teaching a class at the University of Florence to return to Rome after he was summoned to meet Mattarella at the presidential palace on Thursday night.            In light of the populists\u0027 successful talks, Carlo Cottarelli (pictured) announced on Thursday that he was giving up his mandate to form a technocrat government"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/31/22/4CB5E4FD00000578-5793017-Roman_Abramovich_will_be_allowed_to_visit_Britain_for_up_to_six_-a-49_1527801834111.jpg","title":"MARK ALMOND Abramovichs decision drop 1bn Chelsea stadium isnt just hissy fit","story":"    Roman Abramovich will be allowed to visit Britain for up to six months at at time after gaining Israeli citizenship, Downing Street has confirmed - but he will be barred from working for Chelsea FC while in the UKIt is a warning shot, while in a fit of pique, from a man who feels he has been more than generous to Britain but who feels insulted in return by the British government.Also, it can be seen as an ominous hint that he is ready to end his links with Chelsea FC altogether and possibly sell the club rather than continue pouring money thanklessly into one of the kingpins in Britain’s national sport.But Abramovich’s move is far more complex – and menacing.This is not just a hissy-fit by a spoilt Russian oligarch. I am convinced that Abramovich made this decision with the approval and possibly the explicit instructions of Putin.As we all know, Putin is cold-blooded and cut-throat when dealing with those who have offended him.He came to power 18 years ago through his unswerving commitment to crush Chechnya’s separatists. He went on to seize Crimea from Ukraine, is held responsible for the 2014 downing of a Malaysia Airlines passenger jet carrying 298 people and his secret police goons have been accused of assassinating enemies such as tycoon Boris Berezovsky and former KGB agent Alexander Litvinenko.In other words, Putin does not take kindly to being snubbed.The same applies to Abramovich, who learned the ways of the world at Putin’s feet.The friendship between the two men goes back nearly a quarter of a century.One persistent, though unconfirmed, rumour, is that when the ailing Russian leader Boris Yeltsin was looking for a successor in 1999, Abramovich – then a young man with powerful business allies – suggested that Putin should be made prime minister. Yeltsin did just that.  Roman Abramovich (left with ex-wife Dasha Zhukova), who was last pictured at Chelsea with Guus Hiddink in December (right), is said to have personally pulled the plug on the £1billion stadium plan after his visa row Abramovich, who started life in Moscow as a mechanic, selling retreaded tyres as a sideline, acquired substantial stakes in the oil and gas industries as the Communist state broke apart.If mystery surrounds some of his early business deals, there is no mystery about how he hangs on to his wealth: he maintains a tungsten-strength friendship with Putin.Putin never lets old enmities die, and Abramovich is the same. When Abramovich fell out spectacularly with his business associate Berezovsky, the pair faced each other in court in 2012.Berezovsky claimed £3billion in damages from Abramovich for intimidating him into selling shares in Russian oil giant Sibneft.The Chelsea owner won the case, in which legal costs were estimated to be £100million. Asked if he felt Putin would be happy with the ruling, Berezovsky replied: ‘Sometimes I have the impression that Putin himself wrote this judgment.’Roman Abramovich\u0027s new Israeli passport WON\u0027T guarantee him...Roman Abramovich SCRAPS plans for Chelsea\u0027s new £1bn stadium...Share this articleOf course, Abramovich’s difficulties in obtaining a UK visa must be set in the context of the Salisbury poisonings and the subsequent major row between London and Moscow with the UK expelling 23 Russian diplomats.His decision to halt development plans at Chelsea fit a pattern and chime with Moscow’s bitterness over what it calls ‘insinuations’ from the British authorities around the Skripal case.While most of the Western world is convinced that Moscow orchestrated the attack on British soil, the Russian government refutes the allegations as groundless.All this strongly suggests that a message is being sent from Moscow to London – and that Abramovich is the messenger.Chelsea fans may be upset about not getting a bigger stadium but this is becoming a much wider and more dangerous game. That said, Putin understands how powerful a weapon sport can be.          Mr Abramovich is a known ally of Vladimir Putin and has found his visa application at the centre of a row between Theresa May and the Russian President over the Salisbury poisoningHe cynically turned the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, on the Black Sea coast, into a gigantic ego-trip for himself. He will do exactly the same with this month’s football World Cup which he is hosting in Russia.But he is offended by criticism of Russia’s human rights record and can’t be happy that Prince William and British politicians will not attend the tournament – a decision made following the Salisbury poisonings.To some extent, Abramovich’s behaviour is blatant retaliation on behalf of his buddy in the Kremlin.I believe this might be just the start of Abramovich’s cold-shouldering of Britain.If Britain doesn’t want him, he doesn’t want Britain.Asked once where he considered home, he said: ‘I live on a plane. I like to visit London. If I had to think where I could live if not Moscow, London would be my first choice and second would be New York. In Moscow, I feel most comfortable.’That love of London has died.Just before Christmas, amid claims that the Russian government had meddled in the Brexit referendum, Putin’s foreign minister Sergei Lavrov admitted: ‘It’s no secret that our relations are at a low point.’Without doubt, after the Salisbury poisonings and Abramovich’s eruption yesterday, it’s clear that relations have got much lower.Mark Almond is the director of the Crisis Research Institute, Oxford"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/31/23/4CCC5B3300000578-5793155-image-a-19_1527805570168.jpg","title":"George Osborne faces backlash cash editorial claims London Evening Standard","story":"     George Osborne was embroiled in a row over claims that London\u0027s Evening Standard promised \u0027money-can\u0027t-buy\u0027 coverage to big businesses for £3millionFormer Chancellor George Osborne was  embroiled in a row on Thursday over claims that London\u0027s Evening Standard promised \u0027money-can\u0027t-buy\u0027 coverage to big businesses for £3million.The newspaper faced accusations it had effectively sold positive news coverage to brands including Google and the controversial taxi app Uber, in return for sponsorship of a planned campaign.The two were among six firms to each pay £500,000 to be part of the paper\u0027s \u0027London 2020\u0027 project which will highlight issues including air pollution and housing.The Evening Standard said it had agreed partnerships to support its campaign but denied the deals threatened its editorial integrity and independence.

She talks the long game – and her timely new bestsellerThe Female Persuasion is Meg Wolitzer’s 12th novel and it is deft and funny, with the kind of sweep that one has come to expect from the author of The Wife and The Interestings, two of her career-defining novels, each ning decades of their heroines’ lives. In this case, the story is about a years-long relationship between a young woman and her mentor, a famous feminist. It is also a book that in the first instance might best be described via the things it is not: it is not a social history it is not a response to #MeToo or Time’s Up. It is not, Wolitzer says with a laugh, even “a penetrating look at our moment”. “These issues around female power, feminism and misogyny are things I’ve been thinking about not just for three years, but for my whole sentient adult life.”The 59-year-old has rushed to a cafe near her home on the Upper West Side of Manhattan from a book signing in Brooklyn before a month-long publicity tour. The Female Persuasion has recently entered the New York Times hardcover fiction bestseller list at No 2 and with good reason: the story of Greer Kadetsky, a first year college student when we meet her and when she meets Faith Frank, the famous feminist, is trenchant, clever, displaying a pitch-perfect recollection of the idealism of early adulthood and what life subsequently does to undo it. It is also full of drive-by descriptions that nail an experience so thoroughly one wonders why the rest of us don’t give up and go home. (The walls in Greer’s college room that are “the disturbing colour of hearing aids” the jittery behaviour of newly minted college kids, whose mismatched friendships have the unhappy character of “members of a jury or the survivors of a plane crash”.)The novel is dedicated to eight women, all of whom Wolitzer has considered mentors, among them Mary Gordon, Nora Ephron and the author’s mother, Hilma Wolitzer, a novelist herself and still going strong in her late 80s. It was thinking about these women, the way they “were very generous to me when I was young and not fully baked”, that laid the foundations for the novel, both its interest in the dynamics and limitations of female solidarity, and in the generational urge to pass down. “It’s not just a good feeling – a warm and fuzzy feeling,” says Wolitzer. “It can have advocacy attached to it. I find in my own life as a teacher and someone whom younger writers sometimes ask for advice, it’s not just that you want to make them feel good you want to do something. And I don’t know what that impulse is. It’s not karma and it’s not because I think I should because it’s a feminist thing to do. It feels very natural.”Its examination of how these informal networks deliver and at what cost, both personal and political, is where the book speaks most bluntly to current feminist debate, and it is here that those who read novels and watch TV shows as if they are political manifestos will find it wanting. (I saw one critique that upbraided Wolitzer for failing to address sexual harassment in the workplace.) If the novel has shortcomings they are to do with glitches in the fiction, places where the compression of the years feels too tight, or when the sheer quality of Wolitzer’s eloquence can draw attention to its own artifice. But these are minor quibbles and The Female Persuasion works, quite apart from the fact that it is at times very funny, because of the roundedness of the two central characters, neither of whom Wolitzer created to make political points. “All you are going for is what feels human, and it transcends a political moment, it predates a political moment, it’s like what happens between people, in this case between women.”Besides which, she says, “the idea of fashion and novels seems so strange anyway. The truth is that you really write what preoccupies you. And if you don’t do that, you’re missing an opportunity. Students will say, ‘What’s a good idea for a book? Is this a good idea?’ To which I would say: do you lie awake thinking about this, and if the answer is ‘yes’, I feel fairly hopeful that it can be fashioned into something that’s meaningful to the writer.”Part of what Wolitzer wanted to do was to look back and figure out how small acts of kindness – for example, “I had a teacher in grade school who would write down the stories I had told her, and she gave me this great gift, to start to take myself seriously” – played out over the years and took on new meaning. She did a similar thing with The Interestings, her bestselling novel of 2013 that chronicled a friendship between two women formed when they were children at summer camp.Last year at the Toronto film festival, Wolitzer attended the launch of The Wife, an adaptation of her 2003 novel about a woman who leaves her husband after 40 years, starring Glenn Close and Jonathan Pryce. It is the second of her books to be made into a movie the first, based on her 1988 novel This Is My Life, was Nora Ephron’s directorial debut and these days has something like cult status.For Wolitzer, the experience of watching a novel go from the page to the screen is pure fun, not least, she says smiling, because “the pressure wasn’t on me. If people don’t like it, I didn’t write or direct it.” She isn’t precious about changes. “It’s never going to be the book you wrote. The ‘faithful adaptation’ faithful isn’t an exciting word when describing art, is it? It’s an earnest one.”The hero of This Is My Life, Dottie Engels, is a standup comedian and Wolitzer writes so convincingly about jobs beyond writing – in the case of The Interestings, a failed actor turned therapist in The Female Persuasion, activists and campaigners – that I have wondered about her capabilities outside fiction. Can she, for example, organise a committee?Wolitzer, who is married to a science writer and has two adult sons, grew up in a liberal household on Long Island where her aspirations to write – she published her first novel, Sleepwalking, in 1981, shortly after graduating from Brown University – were encouraged, not least because they were shared by her mother. If Hilma taught her daughter anything, it was the value of the slow-burn: she wrote her first novel when she was 44, and was somewhat transformed by the political moment.“My mother was really affected by second wave feminism. I saw her get courage from that. Her parents didn’t think she should go to college, she just took a course here and there, and she became a novelist. And she was really encouraged by other women, which was a new thing that was happening in a formalised way at that time, and I watched it happen in my home.”She laughs apologetically at how dated some of this can seem, although so much of it is relevant again. “The truth is, here is this powerful moment, women of different ages are struggling to find their way to imagine equality and society changing in important ways. And I’m very moved by that, by young women and the ways in which they’re speaking out. I think it’s important.”After the election of Donald Trump, Wolitzer boarded a bus in New York full of NYU students, among them her 23-year-old son, on the way to the women’s march in Washington DC. Her son, she says, “is really becoming very politically interested, and we had a lot of conversations about this, and I feel like he has some innate feminism, which comes from this era, without a doubt”.Knowing how isive the debate around feminism is at the moment, I ask whether, while writing the novel, she was ever at risk of pandering to an audience.“I really hope not when I’m writing. Look, later, when you read reviews, if you choose to, you’ll hear all kinds of things, but I have rules for myself. If I were to hear the voices of what people want in a novel, if they’re basing it on what’s happening in the moment and their understanding of certain things in the non-fiction world, I’m not doing my job if I don’t keep the world I create protected from that. It is a novel. And I’m trying to use big characters who I get to know deeply to explore ideas, and it can’t do everything I’m sure there are things that, if I had three more years, I would think through differently.”As it is, she has written a book that asks one to consider the compromises that go along with trying to do the right thing the gap between what we’re doing and what we tell ourselves is going on, the self‑delusion at the heart of all drama. Wolitzer has been hooked, recently, on the Netflix series The Crown. “After a hard day – hard day, right? – kicking around a paragraph, I think we search out drama. It’s the story of things. I’m still very interested in this idea of humans being hard-wired for story. They showed children a video of amoebas, and asked them what they’d seen, and the children said, ‘Oh, that one’s the funny one, that one’s the mummy’, because they wanted to turn it into a story.”What’s the evolutionary value of that, Wolitzer wonders. “If you remember that you survived one day, maybe it makes you think you can survive another. You tell yourself the story of when you vanquished something bad. I think we’ve solved that now!”It’s not even, she says, a case of rationalisation. “I’m just very drawn to, not even making sense of what’s going on, it’s making a story of it. I want to know: what are the experiences for women who see themselves in different ways? And I want to quietly track and limn those different stories.”Key to this is a certain kindness, in life as in fiction. “The word generosity is something that, when I’m writing a novel, is tremendously important. It’s not about giving people the benefit of the doubt – you can be harsh on your characters, and that means sometimes allowing them to be tedious, and know that your readers will be annoyed with what they do. But when you think about what people mean to do it’s like women having a conference about ideas that they care about. Their intentions versus some of their blind spots, versus the influx of money and what that does, versus their real mistakes that they make. It still doesn’t take away a desire to do something, even if you really fuck it up.” She smiles. It’s the beginning of everything, in life as in fiction. “The desire to do something”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0d8544b8fe49019f1b9b591a428f2745c0b3cddd/170_17_2205_1323/master/2205.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a89cfc7d4214db25b3c24ceadabb1bcc","title":"drawn into tolkiens world exhibition","story":"A rare exhibition of the Hobbit author’s life and art reveals an imaginary realm that continues to inspire new generationsAs a fantasy lover, I can barely remember a time when I wasn’t aware of JRR Tolkien. I read The Hobbit until it fell apart as a child, and have always strived, in my own contributions to the genre, to take even a shred of the care in my world-building that Tolkien did in his. “It is written in my life-blood,” he said of The Lord of the Rings, “such as that is, thick or thin and I can no other.” A rallying cry for anyone who has known what it is to inhabit a world of one’s own.“Tolkien was a genius with a unique approach to literature,” says Richard Ovenden, Bodley’s Librarian at the University of Oxford. “His imagined world was created through a combination of his deep scholarship, his rich imagination and powerful creative talent, and informed by his own lived experiences. We are incredibly proud to hold the Tolkien archive and to be able to share so many previously unseen items in this once-in-a-generation exhibition.”An exhibition, Tolkien: Maker of Middle-earth, is at the Weston Library in Oxford until October. Visiting before it opens, with preparations still ongoing, I must rely a little on my imagination to colour between the lines. We pass the skeleton of what will be the main entrance to the exhibition I am told by its curator, Catherine McIlwaine, that the Doors of Durin will be projected into this dark passageway to welcome visitors.At the heart of the gallery is a model that will chart the routes taken by Tolkien’s characters through the landscape of Middle-earth. As McIlwaine talks me through the items, I find that seeing the exhibition in this liminal state lends an unexpected resonance to the experience. After all, never is a story more alive than when it is in progress. Though many authors have since found great success in his genre, Tolkien, born in 1892, is unrivalled in his reputation as a meticulous creator who knew his world down to the last blade of grass. Today, Tolkien might have come to represent the old guard of fantasy – the “locker room” that the late Ursula K LeGuin once derided. Yet fierce passion for his work endures, and even his harshest critics will concede that few creators have succeeded in building a paracosm that touches the depth of Middle-earth. Every so often, a new offering will stoke the coals of Tolkienmania – Beren and Lúthien was published in 2017, and this August The Fall of Gondolin will expand on another story from The Silmarillion. Meanwhile Amazon has signed a deal for an ambitious TV adaptation of The Lord of the Rings. Throughout my career as a writer, I have found Tolkien to be a source of both self-doubt and inspiration. On the one hand, it can be tempting to give up in the face of his brilliance. He began to invent his first Elvish language when he was a student at Oxford, and eventually built a “Tree of Tongues” – one of the items on display in the exhibition – that charted his constructed languages from source. McIlwaine tells me about a painting Tolkien did when he should have been studying for his finals, of the realm of Valinor. “In 1915, it was all there, already in his head,” she explains. Dwelling on this too deeply could induce an existential crisis. More often, however, the knowledge of how fully Tolkien inhabited his work is a catalyst and a beacon. It fuels me to build larger, to dream weirder and to push harder at the bounds of my imagination.Exhibitions of the Bodleian’s extensive Tolkien collection are rare. Kept in a strongroom with four papyrus scrolls from Herculaneum, the material is tested before and after display and shown in the same womb-like darkness that wraps the Book of Kells in Dublin. Given the importance of preserving the collection, there has been no major exhibition for 26 years. After finishing its run in October, it will travel to New York, then to the Bibliothèque nationale de France. This is the first time the latter will host an exhibition about a foreign author. It is all too easy to believe in the myth of the professor as the one true god of a world he knew in its entirety. The truth, however, is more complex. Tolkien was not always sure of himself. A notebook page reveals that Gandalf once had the Elvish name Bladorthin, meaning grey wanderer. Gandalf, it turns out, was the original name of Thorin Oakenshield. Tolkien flickers between names in the text, as if torn. “He spoke about sub-creation,” McIlwaine says, “and I think this tied into his religious beliefs that all talents and gifts come from God. God is the one creator, and what we do is in imitation of that. Tolkien was a very humble man.” There is abundant evidence of his humility. He was uncertain of his skill as an artist, responsive to criticism, and went out of his way to seek feedback from his friends and children. He could also make the most absent-minded of mistakes – for instance, when he forgot to write his own name on the manuscript title page of The Hobbit.More than 200 items will be on show at the Weston Library, many for the first time – including personal objects donated by the Tolkien family, such as a pipe and a briefcase. Among my favourites is a letter from a fan who has attempted to write a poem in Elvish, which Tolkien has translated and annotated. He was confident enough in his grasp of his world to know when its rules were broken. Rules, after all, are vital in the creation of what he called “secondary belief” in an invented setting – yet he would have been the first to admit that there were uncharted places in Middle-earth.“I don’t desire to go and have afternoons talking Elvish to chaps,” he once said. “Elvish is too complicated. I’ve never finished making it.”Although Tolkien: Maker of Middle-earth will be free to attend, this is the first exhibition at the Bodleian to be ticketed. “I think people are going to be surprised,” McIlwaine tells me. “We don’t know what they will bring with them, but I’d like them to leave with the impression of the whole man and his work – not just Tolkien as the maker of Middle-earth, but as a scholar, a young professor, a father of four children.” In this, I believe McIlwaine has succeeded. I am comforted to have glimpsed the man behind the myth, and I am more inspired than ever by the scope of his creation.The final item I admire is a gathering of patterns in black ink, on the back of a meeting agenda. Its title, written in Quenya, is Parma Mittarion, or “book of enterings”. It was probably intended to be a book cover, but what the book was to contain remains a mystery. Long after I leave the exhibition, my imagination runs wild. I ask myself what Tolkien intended for this book, whether he ever wrote it – either in his mind or on lost pages – and what he could have meant by the phrase “light in the eye”, which he tucked among the decoration. I realise I am beginning to write a story between the lines, and that anyone who looks at the page will perhaps do the same. In this way, Middle-earth will live for ever.• Tolkien: Maker of Middle-earth is at the Weston Library, Oxford, until 28 October. tolkien.bodleian.ox.ac.uk.

All public buildings will be required to display a “clearly visible” crucifix near the entrance. Crosses already hang in Bavarian class- and courtrooms and many town halls. Now ministries, jobcentres, municipal hospitals and police stations must follow suit. Fearing civil disobedience, universities and theatres have been granted an exemption from the executive order of Bavaria’s new first minister, Markus Söder, to underline “Bavaria’s cultural and historical heritage”.At first blush, this seems to put Söder in the same camp as Hungary’s prime minister, Viktor Orbàn, who promotes “Christian democracy”, a term he uses interchangeably with “illiberal democracy”: a nationalist, anti-immigrant, antisemitic, Eurosceptic and authoritarian brand of populism. Or with Jaroslav Kaczyński’s governing Law and Justice party in Poland, and similar populist outfits in eastern Europe.But Bavaria is different. Different from the rest of Germany, and from the ex-Communist countries to its east and south-east. It is the only German state to have been ruled by one party – the Christian Social Union (CSU) – since the Federal Republic was founded in 1949. The CSU has an agreement with the Christian Democrats (CDU) not to poach on one another’s turf. This has allowed the CSU to pander to Bavaria’s rural and conservative population in a way that the more inclusive CDU could never dare. At the same time, the business-friendly CSU has transformed Bavaria from an agricultural poorhouse into an industrial powerhouse – think BMW and Audi, Siemens and Bosch, biotech, AI and financial services. “Laptop and lederhosen” is how the Bavarians – who enjoy Germany’s lowest unemployment rate and highest incomes – describe the CSU’s mix of folksy populism and determined modernisation.It’s a difficult balancing act, and the rise of the rightwing AfD – Alternative für Deutschland, the true German exponents of the Orbàn-Kaczyński brand of populism – combined with Angela Merkel’s swerve to the left on immigration and energy policies has made it harder. To take one example: when Horst Seehofer, Merkel’s minister of the interior, was Söder’s predecessor as Bavaria’s leader, he constantly goaded the chancellor by calling for a reduction in the number of refugees entering Germany to 200,000 per year. A few years ago, that seemed bold. Now the government has adopted Seehofer’s “upper limit”, but the AfD is demanding closed borders and massive repatriation. There’s no way the CSU can go down that path, not least because industry wants more immigration, not less.In this situation, Söder has taken a leaf from the Zentrum: a pre-1933 party of political Catholicism. Although National Socialism originated in Bavaria, the Nazis were unsuccessful in Catholic areas until the future Pope Pius XII made a deal with Hitler in 1933 and agreed to disband the Zentrum in return for the protection of Catholic institutions. Söder, who is facing elections to the Bavarian parliament in October, seems to hope that religious feeling will prove an antidote to political radicalism, and that conservative Catholics will rally to the CSU as they once did to the Zentrum.He could be wrong. Under Pope Francis, the Vatican is no longer the conservative bastion it was under John Paul II and the Bavarian Benedict XVI. Cardinal Reinhard Marx, archbishop of Munich, who heads the Conference of German Bishops, has criticised Söder for trying to instrumentalise a religious symbol for political aims. More to the point, Bavaria’s modernisation has meant that the once backward and priest-ridden society is now better educated, and that Catholics, though still the majority, are more independent of the church. Few Catholic voters will be swayed by church leaders who condemn the AfD, still less politicians who hang up crosses in job centres.Meanwhile, Bavaria is becoming ever more multicultural. Almost a quarter of the population have what Germans call “a migration background”. And for the first time since the war, more people are leaving Bavaria for other parts of Germany than the other way around. The most popular destination for Bavarians is Berlin – the epitome of decadence and religious indifference, not to mention multiculturalism and everything Bavaria is not supposed to be. Trying to bridge the chasm between a globalist, liberal elite and the rising number of the disaffected and disenchanted, Söder is more to be pitied than censured for his crucifix gambit.• Alan Posener, a German blogger, writes for the papers Die Welt and Welt am Sonntag"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0fe739585865199faa135c3f9dfdc4c8ca8f5ebf/0_0_4000_2399/master/4000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f7992304ab2351ccfda3a28844677f6f","title":"revive british city channel 4 north south divide","story":"There is nothing more gauche than Whitehall “being nice” to the provinces. Its attempt to force Channel\u0026nbsp4 to move north from London has felt akin to the Victorian church sending missionaries overseas to civilise the heathen. As austerity descends over museums and theatres across the land, the culture department wants to dispatch a few television executives to live among the natives, to introduce them to kale, quinoa and turmeric lattes. That\u0026nbspshould cheer them up.Whitehall also seems to want to have some fun. No one has instructed Channel 4 where to go. Instead, the provincial cities are told they must line up like children in a workhouse and beg. London will decide who gets the smashed avocado. There will be two consolation “creative hubs” for the runners-up, wherever the judges\u0026nbspcan find something approximating Shoreditch High Street. Whitehall loves these beauty contests. Whether they’re for cities of culture, or the Commonwealth Games, or Michael Heseltine’s “city challenge” handouts, ministers like to bask in the gratitude of the winner, while the losers can slink away to lick their wounds. British regional policy is an\u0026nbspexercise in provincial humiliation.Channel 4 was adamant that it would not move, despite a Tory 2017 manifesto pledge to make it. Now the government has backed down, and less than a third of the staff, just 300, will up sticks. When I heard that Whitehall still wanted a competition, even for what cannot be more than a small office block, I assumed any self-respecting city would tell it to clear off. In the event, Manchester, Birmingham, Bristol, Liverpool, Leeds, Cardiff and Glasgow all formed the usual queue, preening and shouting: “Please, me, me, me.”On one point the government is right. Today’s urban\u0026nbsprenewal is not about manufacturing or traditional\u0026nbspservices but about “creative hubs”. The urbanist Richard\u0026nbspFlorida long ago pointed out that a broad spectrum of creative industries, from education to marketing and design, held the key to bright young people generating wealth in cities. The digital revolution, far from letting them disperse, seemed to require them to congregate, most markedly in older “bohemian” districts. They crammed into San Francisco’s Castro and New York’s Soho, as they gravitated to London’s Shoreditch and Silicon Roundabout. All they needed was\u0026nbspa warehouse, some craft beer and somewhere that day-life fused with nightlife, and every street corner was\u0026nbspa chance encounter. Florida was mocked at the time,\u0026nbspbut he was right.British provincial cities are starting to develop such places. You find them in Manchester’s Northern Quarter, Birmingham’s Gas Street Basin, Sheffield’s Kelham Island and Leeds’s canal-side. They have been underpinned by Britain’s biggest urban growth industry by far: higher education. Today, more people occupy Tyneside’s universities than ever worked in its shipbuilding industry. A graduate school is worth a dozen Channel 4s.Unfortunately, you can bring bright young people to a city, but you cannot make them stay, let alone “create”. Two-thirds of Birmingham’s student population plans to leave on graduation, compared with just a third of London’s. In 2014, economist Jim\u0026nbspO’Neill’s city commission even suggested that graduates who stayed working where they graduated should have their loans repaid. When I met a group of employers in Manchester, their biggest complaint was not a lack of Channel 4, but that all their brightest children wanted to leave for London as soon as possible.The government is right to want to direct some creative energy away from the capital. But Channel\u0026nbsp4 is small fry. Creative hubs are created not by fairy godmothers but by internal combustion. They need to be self-generated economic activity, emerging from a sense of buzz, from contacts creating opportunities. That is why the best thing Channel 4 offered Whitehall was not to move its headquarters but to double its commissioning spend in the provinces. It is not carpet-baggers but contracts that lubricate hubs.And ministers themselves should set an example. They should forget Channel 4 and take themselves out of London while the Palace of Westminster is refurbished. They can commandeer Birmingham city centre or Manchester town hall, bringing with them their aides and acolytes, researchers and journalists. And for the duration they might move the entire Treasury to Stoke-on-Trent. They would suddenly discover there is a Britain out there beyond their ken. I bet the regional imbalance would change overnight."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/88ec30010b5fac6aae6a698c1c9fb0120ce388ad/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5f945bb3b7ae34c77c7733ec9cd33b09","title":"schools broke class sizes teachers brexit","story":"Soaring class sizes, teaching hours cut, neglected repairs. Brexit has taken attention away from the cost of ideology-driven cutsOsborne primary has an urgent issue: a lack of money. Ofsted rates it as “a good school with outstanding leadership”, and since 2016 its numbers have been expanding: in September 2019 it will take on another new class, but Gay won’t have enough money to pay for a new teacher, so the teaching will be done by existing staff. She says she needs at least 13 classroom assistants to help\u0026nbspchildren who need extra support – not least those who need help with English – but only has 11. The school used to get about £100,000 a year from Birmingham city council and other agencies to pay three staff who work on child protection and supporting parents, as well as counselling children with mental health issues. That money now has to come from the school’s own budgets. So to save £1,500, swimming lessons have been cut back, along with £2,000 worth of music tuition. Gay has explained all this on ITV Evening News and in the pages of the Birmingham Mail, but to no avail.Last year came perhaps the most drastic step of all, when she took the decision to cut the school week by half a day, meaning that most children now go home at 1pm on Fridays. The move still leaves the school meeting its legal requirements for teaching time, but staff now do their planning and preparation work in the hours freed up by children leaving early – which means their classes don’t have to be taken care of and the school saves a precious £35,000 a year. Gay says she took the decision after talking to another headteacher who had done the same now “a couple of other schools in Erdington are doing it and it’s starting to spread across the city”.It says something about life in modern Britain that in response to the change, many parents’ main anxiety was the prospect of their children losing out on a hot meal so it was decided to close the school doors after lunch.In 2014, with his customary revolutionary zeal, the then education secretary, Michael Gove, said he wanted to “see state schools offer a school day nine or 10 hours long”, but that was obviously for the birds. Examples of schools cutting their hours began to surface about a year ago, and have now taken their place in the cacophony of noise about reduced budgets, shrinking staff numbers, and a mess of factors that make things even worse – not least the drive to push local councils out of education and increase the number of academies.At a time when the economy is changing fast and the world of work is being transformed, it would be nice to imagine state schools full of iPads, cutting-edge computer science lessons and coding clubs. But that is not the reality at all. Talking to headteachers over the last week, I have heard about insufficient staff numbers, rising class sizes, rusting minibuses, neglected repairs and curtailed extracurricular activity. It sounds depressingly similar to the experience of those of us unlucky enough to have been educated during the Thatcher years.As with so many things, Brexit has ensured that none of this has acquired nearly enough political traction, even as the picture has become inescapably clear. In late 2016 the National Audit Office said that schools in England would have to make savings of £3bn by 2019-20 in the interests of “financial sustainability”. After the 2017 election it was announced that schools would get an extra £1.3bn over the next two years, though much of the money was taken from their building and repairs budget. Besides, the extra cash only reduces the financial hole identified by the NAO, rather than filling it – and according to the National Education Union, it will leave a total national shortfall of £2.2bn in 2019-20 alone.Meanwhile, as the number of both primary and secondary schools that are running deficits increases, this year the government will take the first step towards a new national funding formula, which redistributes a pot of money – broadly speaking, moving it away from big metropolitan areas and towards smaller cities and shire counties. No one should be celebrating: for many of the schools who nominally benefit, their increases will neither make up for past cuts nor keep pace with rising costs while for those who clearly suffer, it will be another blow. At Osborne primary, it is another source of\u0026nbspuncertainty about the future: right now, all Michelle Gay knows is that in the last year basic per-pupil funding has fallen from £3,071 a year to £2,756.Austerity may have blitzed local authorities, but schools still under their control at least have some kind of financial safety net. However, if a school is one of the 1,600 or so standalone academies, or part of a small chain – or even one of the bigger multi-academy trusts that cannot cope with tight finances – its staff and parents might well find that much-vaunted “independence” actually leaves them in dire trouble. This is part of the reason why academies and free schools have started to hit the wall: an example of one Tory policy threatening to ruin another, which is some measure of the stupidity at work.From any rational perspective, all this looks like the kind of chaos that helps nobody. But, as with austerity in general, there is a clear sense of cuts serving a particular set of rightwing beliefs. What, after all, does an underfunded school system mean in practice?Children with special needs are being pushed out of state schools. The curriculum is being stripped back to its basics. And the stuff that desiccated minds would have you believe is unnecessary guff – art, music, drama – is the first to go. Yet grammar schools will reportedly benefit from a new £50m “expansion fund”.Look closely and you see yet another manifestation of something very familiar: a country with a hacked-back state, where the people in power cling on to a sepia-tinted vision that has nothing to do with the demands of the 21st century, but has a human cost so huge it is becoming almost impossible to measure."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b575aef5fa695e1ac39d8d652b48506e14c588dd/0_0_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2a60451081da3b7f8589b7d8bae81da2","title":"tories northern powerhouse transport system cities george osborne","story":"It was easy to scoff when in 2014 George Osborne unveiled his vision for a “northern powerhouse”. When the government was simultaneously shredding local services in the region, many here suspected it might turn out to be a false dawn.Yet the principle that underpinned his thinking was sound. The north desperately needed a functioning infrastructure, as well as someone to knock heads together in Whitehall to get it moving. For the Conservatives it made sense, too: perhaps this could finally detoxify their northern brand.Yet as we approach the fourth anniversary of his flagship policy’s announcement, Osborne is now safely ensconced back in the capital. In his northern promised land, thousands upon thousands of people are unable to get trains in or out of Manchester, Liverpool, and myriad other towns and cities that were supposed to fire his powerhouse. The train operator Northern rail has been cancelling so many trains each day that an app, Northern Fail, has enterprisingly sprung up to help out northerners unable to make the most basic of journeys.The meltdown being experienced by passengers seems, in comparison to the chaos experienced by Southern or Thameslink commuters, to have gone largely unnoticed by opinion-formers in London.But for journalists here, the fiasco is impossible to ignore. Our Twitter feeds are as packed as a Manchester Piccadilly platform with desperate cries of fury from people trying to travel even the shortest of distances.Like the man who literally moved jobs a few weeks ago because he couldn’t reliably get to work on the train any more, even before things spiralled into further chaos. Or the woman who expressed disbelief this morning on finding every commuter train for nearly three hours from Gatley to Manchester – just an eight-mile journey – had been cancelled. Or the friend of mine who tried to do his usual trip to see his partner last Friday evening and found timetable changes had scrapped his normal train, then, after hanging around Manchester Piccadilly station for a couple of hours, discovered every other train had been cancelled too and so gave up and went home.It’s probably safe to say most people here are not all that bothered where the specific fault lies for the current chaos. While transport secretary Chris Grayling points the finger at Network Rail for its delayed electrification programme, local politicians are more inclined to believe the fault lies with the operator.Ultimately, however, the buck stops with a government that just four years ago made great, sweeping promises to the north of a historic economic rebalance in language that frequently evoked the industrial heritage of the rail network’s golden Victorian age. “Here are the hard economic facts,” said Osborne in his northern powerhouse speech at Manchester’s Museum of Science and Industry in June 2014. “In the 19th and 20th centuries, a factory would be located where you could find raw materials, power, and cheap labour. Today, in a services-based economy, what investors are looking for is not a river to dam, but access to a deep pool of human capital.”Much of that human capital is currently stuck on a platform.But if that “hard economic fact” can’t be felt in Westminster, here’s a hard political one: the Conservatives did not win a majority last summer. They did not, for example, win Bolton North East, where Theresa May launched her campaign a year ago, and commuters are now even more crippled by rail delays than they were then.A significant proportion of the northern powerhouse’s population are spending their time staring at a cancellation board.And while they may not be able to catch a train, they have plenty of time to think about how they might vote.• Jennifer Williams is social affairs editor of the Manchester Evening News"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e9923926909ef5ea756bf66a28a0ba5512c51b5d/0_11_3000_1801/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ea1d309df9ae09f710b0df71353147d6","title":"what to see this week in the uk","story":"From My Friend Dahmer to Beyoncé and Jay-Z, here’s our pick of the best films, concerts, exhibitions, theatre and dance over the next seven daysby  Steve Rose,  Harriet Gibsone,  John Fordham,  Andrew Clements,  Jonathan Jones,  Lyn Gardner and  Judith MackrellA serial-killer origin story? It certainly makes for a different kind of teen movie. Disney graduate Ross Lynch fits the bill in a story that suggests the signs – family troubles, repressed sexuality, interest in dead things –were already there in high school. However, a brush with social acceptance hints that things might have turned out differently.Set on the fringes of Spain’s south American empire, this singular film casts a strange spell but also serves as a sharp critique of colonialism. Our subject is a bored, embittered 18th-century official (Daniel Giménez Cacho) with little to do beyond dally and scheme, until he unwisely decides to hunt down a local bandit. This modern French drama generates immense sympathy for its troubled heroine: broke, heartbroken, scatty and barely qualified to do anything, she wavers between sunny ebullience and animated despair – or is it something closer to mental illness? Laetitia Dosch’s spirited, nuanced performance carries the day.Assembled from rediscovered footage, this is as close as you can get to a prequel to the documentary Grey Gardens, even if it’s really more a fascinating collage of cultural ephemera. We see another side to Big and Little Edie, as well as the Hamptons set who surrounded them, including Andy Warhol, Mick and Bianca Jagger, Truman Capote and, especially, Jackie Kennedy’s sister Lee Radziwill and photographer Peter Beard.Despite production troubles and story predictability, this prequel turns out to be better than anyone expected. For one thing, there’s a succession of chases, heists, fights and space battles to keep things moving along. Alden Ehrenreich (pictured, right) fits the bill as a younger, less jaded incarnation of the lovable rogue. Two years after Beyoncé aired her husband’s dirty laundry via Lemonade, and a year on from his 4:44 album affirming that, yes, their marriage had been in a pickle, fans are finally able to analyse the minutiae of this pair’s love life on stage. As well as Crazy in Love, Deja Vu and Drunk in Love, expect loaded looks and spectacle from this megastar experience. Principality Stadium, Cardiff, Wednesday 6 touring to 16 JuneIt is nice to know that even Grammy-nominated artists can hate themselves. Take Crippling Self Doubt and a General Lack of Confidence, a scrappy, sniping track on the Aussie songwriter’s lauded new record. Expect I’ve Got a Weird Rash on My Armpit But Nobody Will Look at It some time in 2020. Glasgow, Saturday 2 London, Sunday 3 Manchester, Monday 4 Bristol, Tuesday 5 London, Wednesday 6 JuneHouse DJ Ralph Lawson has curated this new festival in Leeds, enlisting the neo-jazz expansiveness of Floating Points, warped techno artist Avalon Emerson, the poppy deep house stylings of Peggy Gou, Andrew Weatherall, Crazy P and more. It also takes place in venues around the city, which means relatively decent toilets, access to chairs and a mattress at the end of the night. Various venues, Leeds, Saturday 2 JuneThe Radiohead frontman has been tweeting oblique messages of late (sample: “i’m in a room full of robots”). Is another solo album on the horizon or is he just expressing himself like the abstract, tech-fearing riddler we know and, in many circles, love? Fans will find out at his upcoming shows, which are sure to be filled with glitching noises, ominous samples and lots of trippy lasers. Roundhouse, NW1, Friday 8 touring to 10 JuneNobody writes jazz-fuelled world music quite like Loz Speyer, the trumpeter who has lived in both the UK and Cuba, and joins Latin jazz, US postbop and European improv with vivacity and edge. This tour features his pieces with input from a fine band including saxophonists Chris Biscoe and Rachel Musson. London, Saturday 2 Birmingham, Tuesday 5 Sheffield, Wednesday 6 Manchester, Thursday 7 Wakefield, Friday 8 touring to 9 JuneMark Elder began the Hallé Ring nine years ago with the last work in the tetralogy, Götterdämmerung. Now he’s ending it with a concert performance of the work preceding it, Siegfried, with Simon O’Neill in the title role. Unfortunately, it’s spread across two evenings, but the Hallé are playing it in full at the Edinburgh festival in August. Bridgewater Hall, Manchester, Saturday 2 \u0026amp Sunday 3 JuneThe two composers juxtaposed in the Sixteen’s latest tour are Benjamin Britten and William Cornysh. However, in the 15th century there were two composers called William Cornysh, perhaps father and son, and who wrote what is hard to establish. Conductor Harry Christophers has thankfully opted to ignore the distinction. Bridgewater Hall, Manchester, Thursday 7 June touring to 9 NovemberIt is 41 years since the last new staging at Covent Garden of what was arguably Wagner’s first great opera. The new Lohengrin is directed by David Alden and conducted by Andris Nelsons, with Klaus Florian Vogt as Lohengrin and Jennifer Davis as Elsa. Royal Opera House, WC2, Thursday 7 JuneIn recent years, Aldeburgh has opened with an opera. That tradition is preserved this time with the premiere of Emily Howard’s To See the Invisible. But before that there’s an orchestral concert, with the BBC Scottish Symphony conducted by John Wilson in Bernstein, Copland and, inevitably, Britten. Snape Maltings Concert Hall, Friday 8 to 24 JuneLocal artists Tracey Emin and JMW Turner show their softer sides in this survey of our relationship with animals. Emin’s encounter with a fox and Turner’s studies of dogs and donkeys share a respect for nature that also shines from medieval bestiaries, pet portraits by Warhol and Freud, and Shimabuku’s experiment in octopus art. Turner Contemporary, Margate, to 30 SeptemberThis year, the south coast art festival takes its title and theme of global journeying and the elusiveness of home from Deborah Levy’s novel Swimming Home. There are performances and screenings all over town by the likes of Rebecca Lennon, Phoebe Cunningham and Sophie Lee. No sand sculptures, then. Various venues, Saturday 2 to 10 JuneThis tinkering inventor-artist’s mobiles are among the modern world’s most joyous artistic creations all the more marvellous given how little joy there was in the age he lived through. Calder was a politicised artist who showed at the 1937 Paris Universal Exhibition alongside Picasso’s Guernica. His mobiles translate surrealism into abstract endless motion. His art is a gesture of freedom. Hauser and Wirth Somerset, nr Bruton, to 9 SeptemberIt is a simple but eye-opening insight that everything looks different from above. Even before the invention of flight, Leonardo da Vinci drew stunning imagined bird’s eye views. Tacita Dean, Wolfgang Tillmans and Cornelia Parker are among the artists following Leonardo skyward here. Was flight the true motor of modernism? Within a few years of the Wright brothers’ first flight in 1903, art had changed for ever. Towner Art Gallery, Eastbourne, Saturday 3 June to 30 SeptemberArte povera was one of the most inspiring episodes in postwar European art. In the 1960s, Italian society was modernising fast. Surely, nostalgia for a rural past inspired Penone – along with Mario Merz and Jannis Kounellis – to use simple, natural materials. He has been celebrating trees for five decades and continues his exploration of their magic in this fittingly rustic setting. Yorkshire Sculpture Park, nr Wakefield, to 28 April 2019Dries Verhoeven’s show has the feel of a ghost train, but what exactly is it that we should be scared of? The bears that haunt the tracks? Or the politicians such as Donald Trump who use rhetoric to make us afraid? If you enjoyed Punchdrunk’s It Felt Like a Kiss, you’ll love this multi-layered show about how prejudice makes us vulnerable to manipulation. West Handyside Canopy, N1 Friday 8 to 18 JuneAs part of LIFT 2018, Mammalian Diving Reflex, the company that brought us Haircuts By Children (in which a child cut and restyled your hair), now puts audiences in the hands of teenagers. Upending the traditional relationship between adults and adolescents, it gives agency to the latter during this ramble in the dark. Secret location, E8, to Sunday 3 JuneThe trauma of the past can echo down through the years. It does in this remarkable collaboration between two Irish companies: ANU and CoisCéim Dance Theatre. Originally seen in Dublin in 2016, it raises ghosts as it offers up some of the events of the final days of the 1916 Easter Rising, seen largely through the eyes of women. A play that reminds that, even if the history books teach otherwise, we can only ever know part of the story – and maybe not the most important one. Shoreditch Town Hall, EC1, Monday 4 to 22 JuneEmpathy, class, language, marriage, rape and whether the law is an ass are just a few of the subjects covered in Nina Raine’s play. Following a rape case that turns on the issue of consent (the victim says she didn’t the man in question believes she did), Raine’s niftily crafted drama focuses on the private lives of the lawyers involved. Sharply observed, neatly written and one to remind us that life is messy, complex and hard to reduce to binaries. The Harold Pinter Theatre, SW1, to 11 AugustYou may not walk 500 miles to see it, but James Brining’s revival of the Proclaimers musical is fresh as a daisy and a thing of joy. Telling the story of two soldiers returning to their home town of Edinburgh, and finding themselves unsure what home really means, this one comes straight from the heart. His Majesty’s Theatre, Aberdeen, Saturday 2 Belgrade Theatre, Coventry, Tuesday 5 to 9 touring to 30 JuneA rare chance to see the excellent Carlos Acosta leading his new Cuban dance company. Heading this mixed programme of contemporary and neo-classical work is Mermaid, Sidi Larbi Cherkaoui’s witty and wonderful take on the Andersen fairytale. Other pieces come from Marianela Boán, Jorge Crecis, Goyo Montero and Justin Peck. Wales Millennium Centre, Cardiff, Monday 4 JuneThere is some fine casting for ENB’s revival of Kenneth MacMillan’s opulent 1987 production of the Petipa-Tchaikovsky classic, including Alina Cojocaru and former Bolshoi ballerina Maria Alexandrova. Gavin Sutherland conducts. London Coliseum, WC2, Wednesday 6 to 16 JuneChoreographer Wayne McGregor and Royal Ballet principal Edward Watson are joint programmers for the Grange festival’s first ever dance event.

Avoiding consumption of animal products delivers far better environmental benefits than trying to purchase sustainable meat and dairy.”The analysis also revealed a huge variability between different ways of producing the same food. For example, beef cattle raised on deforested land result in 12 times more greenhouse gases and use 50 times more land than those grazing rich natural pasture. But the comparison of beef with plant protein such as peas is stark, with even the lowest impact beef responsible for six times more greenhouse gases and 36 times more land. The large variability in environmental impact from different farms does present an opportunity for reducing the harm, Poore said, without needing the global population to become vegan. If the most harmful half of meat and dairy production was replaced by plant-based food, this still delivers about two-thirds of the benefits of getting rid of all meat and dairy production.Labels that reveal the impact of products would be a good start, so consumers could choose the least damaging options, he said, but subsidies for sustainable and healthy foods and taxes on meat and dairy will probably also be necessary. The new research has received strong praise from other food experts. Prof Gidon Eshel, at Bard College, US, said: “I was awestruck. It is really important, sound, ambitious, revealing and beautifully done.” He said previous work on quantifying farming’s impacts, including his own, had taken a top-down approach using national level data, but the new work used a bottom-up approach, with farm-by-farm data. “It is very reassuring to see they yield essentially the same results. But the new work has very many important details that are profoundly revealing.”Prof Tim Benton, at the University of Leeds, UK, said: “This is an immensely useful study. It brings together a huge amount of data and that makes its conclusions much more robust. The way we produce food, consume and waste food is unsustainable from a planetary perspective. Given the global obesity crisis, changing diets – eating less livestock produce and more vegetables and fruit – has the potential to make both us and the planet healthier.”Poore said: “The reason I started this project was to understand if there were sustainable animal producers out there. But I have stopped consuming animal products over the last four years of this project. These impacts are not necessary to sustain our current way of life. The question is how much can we reduce them and the answer is a lot.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/936ff2c32291263935d784420e37253a82d3c146/90_863_2085_1251/master/2085.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b5df1f78adc62c6caaa5af5d8c8dad7f","title":"the new york pigeon in pictures andrew garn","story":"Andrew Garn is a native New Yorker who grew up surrounded by the city’s ubiquitous pigeons.

Everett plays the lead role and makes his directing debut (as well as writing the script). Here is your chance to ask him questions about this – and anything else – in our webchat with him, which takes place at 1300 BST on Monday 4 June.The Happy Prince focuses on the last few years of Wilde’s life. He was released from Reading prison in 1897 and afterwards led a transient existence in European exile, reuniting briefly with Lord Alfred Douglas. He died of meningitis in 1900 while living alone in a Parisian hotel. Colin Firth plays his longtime friend Reggie Turner, and Merlin’s Colin Morgan plays Douglas. The film has already attracted good reviews at the Toronto and BFI Flare film festivals. Our own Peter Bradshaw called it “a deeply felt, tremendously acted tribute to courage”.Everett’s earlier films include Brit period dramas such as Another Country and Dance With a Stranger and, from his mid-90s Hollywood period, My Best Friend’s Wedding and Dunston Checks In. His memoirs, Red Carpets and Other Banana Skins and Vanished Years, were much praised.

Word-of-mouth buzz and a marketing campaign led by the tagline “Prepare to Die” saw Dark Souls become an unlikely hit in 2011. Seven years on, the price is still being paid. There have been two sequels, an endless array of merchandise, an army of writers and video-makers dedicated to dissecting the game’s mysteries and now Remaster.The game is famous for the wrong things. Dark Souls is an inversion of the kind of stories games usually tell. It constructs a meticulous dark fantasy world in which almost everything is trying to kill you. The challenge lies not in conquering it but in surviving it and trying to understand it. It is opaque, even mystical true comprehension always feels just out of reach.For those familiar with the game, playing through again is a stark reminder of just how flabby Dark Souls’ imitators, and even its own sequels, have become. The world of Dark Souls is almost one landmass, with few loading screens, and the way it intricately twists around itself is an architectural feat. The spaces are cramped, the enemies placed like chess pieces. No video game world feels quite so solid, so marvellous to unravel and so plausible as Lordran. A major part of this is the weird and unsettling aesthetic. Lordran is a ruin, an abandoned remnant of what was once the gods’ playground. The bosses can be inscrutable monsters, but more often they are mighty wrecks of eras long gone: a giant wolf guarding her master’s grave two knights standing guard in the throne room of a desiccated reign. Eventually, you’ll meet the greatest minds, the shapers of this world’s history, all mad and feral.Dark Souls’ famed difficulty is improved by the online system, unique to the series, that creates transient connections. You can “summon” fellow adventurers to help you by finding their signs on the ground. When the hurdles seem too much, these companions can heave you over them – and once they have helped you fell a once-terrifying enemy, they too dissipate, wavering in and out. That’s the nice side of online play. On the other, there’s invasions. Most games have multiplayer menus where you choose to pit yourself against others. In Dark Souls, the first you know of an enemy in your world is when they’ve arrived. It is a revolutionary affront. Such enforced fights are the pinnacle of Dark Souls, as other players throw low cunning and every exploitable trick in your face. I’ve stared at someone across a bridge for full five minutes before making a move. I’ve been slaughtered by gangs and I’ve been in that gang. I’ve been invaded by a player called Mr Troll who disguised themselves as a statue and waited by doorway to the boss’ lair for 10 minutes, then instantly killed me and a companion with a spear.This remaster has been handled by Polish studio QLOC rather than the original developer, FromSoftware. It fixes technical issues (the infamous Blighttown seems like a new place), but retains what few gameplay flaws were there in the original. Minor changes to the online system allow more people to play together, and invaders to heal themselves. QLOC has worked assiduously on the sound and visual effects: the audio mix is much clearer than the original, with the ambient noise in Dark Souls’ environments bringing the muttering, encroaching atmosphere to new life. For me, however, the improved visual effects lose some of the ethereal qualities of the originals.Remastered is the version of Dark Souls to get, mainly because it is so active online. This is one of the few video games that saw the medium’s future and tried new things. If you want to visit Lordran and enjoy a straight-up bash-the-baddies quest, then you’ll find no better collection of bosses than this. If a new kind of adventure appeals, however, one in which quick fingers matter less than brains and human cunning, there’s still nothing like Dark Souls. After seven years its mystery has diminished, but it’s still among the best of the best."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9e45fb8ccb3a22ae7e23c0cc3626cabd752a3f0d/0_53_3459_2074/master/3459.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6d15d1123e0fd09d50eef395ea4aedf5","title":"roam further vodafone daily fee","story":"I was on holiday in Thailand and have a mobile contract with Vodafone.

The Protestant fraternity, which is vehemently opposed to Scottish independence, is a familiar sight during the summer marching season, which will culminate this year with two parades of pipe and drum bands wearing full regalia on 7 July one in Glasgow and the other in Shotts, North Lanarkshire.Dave Scott, the director of Scotland’s anti-sectarian charity Nil by Mouth, said Foster was entitled to attend, address or lead any legal gathering, but this move was “pretty unprecedented” and would be seen as significant “by both friend and foe of the Orange Order” in Scotland. “For its supporters, this visit will be seen as providing validation to the legitimacy of the order to play a part in public life,” Scott said. “To its many opponents, it will be seen as a politician who is becoming increasingly marginalised in Northern Ireland trying to remain visible and crudely playing to her political base by pitching up in Nicola Sturgeon’s patch.”“Arlene Foster has shared power with Republicans over most of the last decade so it will be interesting to hear if she chooses to reflect on that experience in any public statements she might make in Scotland and how that is received by her audience. Northern Irish politics has always been dominated by symbolism so there can be little doubt that Ms Foster wants to make some sort of point with this trip.”The DUP has most recently been in the spotlight after the vote to liberalise Irish abortion law prompted calls for a similar vote on Northern Irish legislation. Theresa May signalled she would not risk alienating DUP allies, who currently prop up her minority government, by letting MPs settle the matter with a parliamentary vote."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b6aaa40453971a568f1eb5b0a6f8bb1a4a44b631/677_48_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ca53c016ae2db9c86cbe53a94e66857e","title":"jonathan bartley sian berry green party co leaders caroline lucas","story":"Current co-leader and former mayoral candidate join forces as Caroline Lucas steps downJonathan Bartley, the co-leader of the Green party, is to stand again for the post on a joint ticket with London assembly member Siân Berry after his current co-leader, Caroline Lucas, said this week she was stepping down.The announcement by Bartley and Berry has made them frontrunners for the role, which is voted on by Green members every two years. Bartley and Lucas were elected as joint leaders in 2016.Lucas, by far the party’s best-known figure and its only MP since she was elected to represent Brighton Pavilion in 2010, said on Wednesday “making space for other people” was the right thing to do.“We have a wonderful array of talent in the party and I would love the opportunity for more of that to be showcased,” Lucas said.Bartley, who was not well known before he stood with Lucas, is the leader of the Green opposition on Lambeth council in south London. Berry has a slightly higher profile, albeit largely in the capital. She is a Camden councillor and stood twice as the Greens’ candidate for London mayor.Lucas became the Greens’ first leader in 2008 after the party dropped its system of two “principal speakers”. She was replaced as leader by Natalie Bennett in 2012. Bennett endured a difficult 2015 general election, after which Lucas and Bartley took over.When Lucas and Bartley were elected joint leaders there was some scepticism as to how such an arrangement might work, but the pair say it has proved a success.Nominations for the leadership remain open this month and the winner will be announced at the party conference in October.Bartley said the Greens were “firmly established as England’s fourth party”. He said: “I want to continue that work with Siân as we build towards the next vital set of elections. “Our ambition is to have a Green on every council and together we believe the time is right for the party to step up to a whole new level.”Berry said that although Lucas was a hard act to follow, she was committed to growing the party’s support."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6b85eb23de5f7e7f1d3e467ff31bb2765004d895/0_62_4538_2723/master/4538.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=751ceb3961961dfd90d11677bbc46bb8","title":"inferred wasnt british tory members tell islamophobia","story":"Muslims in the party say their complaints over the issue have been brushed under the carpetWhen Ahmed (not his real name) joined the Conservative party six years ago, he thought it was a natural fit. “A lot of Muslims share conservative values,” he says. “I stood to be a councillor and there was talk of me going on to the party lists to become an MP.”He says he worked hard during election time, increasing the south Asian vote in his ward in Yorkshire. But a simple question about postal votes to the MP suddenly made him feel like he did not belong in the party. “I just asked a question,” he says. “In no way did I insinuate that I was going to do anything silly or illegal regarding postal votes. But his response was ‘This is the UK, sunshine’. It was really patronising – would he have said that to someone not of colour? He was inferring that I wasn’t British.”He then overheard other members talking disparagingly about another candidate of Pakistani heritage in a different ward. Not long after, he heard another party member say “the only good Muslims are Ahmadiyya Muslims”. “That’s like saying the only good Christians are the Coptics,” he says. “It’s insulting to all the others.”While he was not directly racially abused by other party members, seeing Islamophobic comments on local party Facebook groups was common, he says. “It wasn’t a nice experience in the party. Those in the right of the party you felt a sense of being looked down upon, they were patronising you. The whispers weren’t nice at all. But now those same members are very Islamophobic on their Facebook posts, now you see it quite openly.” A party member in the West Midlands says he made a complaint to the Conservatives’ regional headquarters, after an older councillor made a racist remark during a meeting. “It was totally brushed under the carpet they didn’t want to know,” he says. “They just said ‘don’t worry about it, he’s an old man’.”He contacted the Muslim Council of Britain after seeing other complaints about Islamophobia in the party. “When I saw the letter, I thought how refreshing – this is something that all Muslim Conservatives are feeling,” he says. “Only Muslims can feel Islamophobia and only black and ethnic people can feel racism – if you are not black or Asian you are not going to feel it. But they say to you ‘it’s nothing, it’s you, you’re reading too much into it’. But I can feel it, it’s how people look at you when you go to pray, or when you are fasting. It’s in how people talk to you.”When no action was taken over the member who used racist terminology, it made him feel like he was “on the outside”, he says. “My dad has been here for 60 years, but it makes me feel like we are back in the days of Enoch Powell it makes me feel like we haven’t moved on at all.”“It’s a problem throughout the party. It’s rampant because people don’t understand Islam. They think it’s a religion based on terrorism. We don’t think Isis are Muslims. They are a bunch of idiots, we believe they are terrorists like everyone else.”Another councillor did not want to be named because he believed it would be political suicide. “They’d put me under a bus for speaking about it,” he says. He feels his progress in the party has been blocked because of his religion. “It was fine in the local party until I showed some ambition,” he says.After he pushed to advance in the party, barriers suddenly appeared and he was made to feel like his face did not fit, he says. “They use terms like ‘the right sort of candidate’,” he says. “I sometimes wear a skull cap and people came to me and said that the local party leader had said that I looked too Muslim and I wouldn’t be accepted.”He says he has complained about the issue, but feels he cannot push it any further. “You mention Islamophobia and they run for the hills. The problem is too many people have too many friends in high places, so nothing is ever done about it.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/89efad33a922c70db9802881874dda6e20a82797/631_217_3630_2178/master/3630.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f8c67dcb83adb872af3d53730a287dc4","title":"sports quiz week zinedine zidane mo salah football","story":"Who hurt himself?

Won here in October and also at Goodwood last year, so undulating tracks hold no fears for him, and both those wins came on rain-softened ground, which he gets again. “Never nearer” third in a trial here in April, then kept on into second in the Chester Vase. No great surprise if he keeps plugging away for a place once more but makes little appeal for the outright win.Won a Leopardstown maiden on his debut in July but beaten all four starts since, albeit while showing promise. Comfortably held by Saxon Warrior when two and a half lengths behind him at Naas in September. Second in two long-established Derby trials this spring, notably when “never nearer” behind Hazapour at Leopardstown last time. Hardly showed lightning acceleration that day but this son of Galileo ought to appreciate the extra quarter-mile here. One of five for Aidan O’Brien.Product of the Aga Khan breeding that has sometimes done well here, including two years ago with Harzand, whose half-sister is this one’s mother. Won a Galway maiden on soft from three starts last year. Odds of 16-1 suggested little was expected when he reappeared in the Leopardstown trial last month but he travelled well, led when asked to do so and held off Delano Roosevelt and The Pentagon. Could improve again and an obvious contender, especially with Dettori booked to guide him through the race.Perhaps the least likely of Aidan O’Brien’s five, although such talk is dangerous after the trainer’s 50-1 winner 12 months ago. Won a Killarney maiden and a Newmarket Listed race, beating Dee Ex Bee, last year but trailed Saxon Warrior by three lengths at Naas. Looks short of pace and vulnerable once more.Sprang into contention when landing the Lingfield trial by daylight last month, when he took a keen hold, was allowed to stride on from an early stage and was never reeled in by his rivals, headed by Kew Gardens. The stated plan is to settle him behind a lead this time, though he looks a strong stayer and aggressive tactics could actually play well once more. Bred to do the job and any improvement for his reappearance run would make him dangerous.Godolphin runner was not quite good enough for Saxon Warrior in the Guineas, coming up short by a length and three-quarters and hard to think he can improve much on that form. Last five starts came at a mile and it’s not clear that an extra half-mile will help him, though his pedigree offers some hope. Needs the ground to dry up.Came closer than anything else has done to beating Saxon Warrior when held by just a neck at Doncaster in October, when he quickened to take the lead before being outbattled. Was two and a half lengths behind that rival when only fifth in the Guineas but excuses could be made and he was much more impressive when storming home in the Dante a fortnight later. Blistering speed he showed off a steady pace that day suggests an extra quarter-mile may not play to his strengths, especially on rain-softened ground. Looks a hard ride and has trouble keeping straight in the closing stages. Bundles of ability and a worthy second-favourite if the ground proves drier than expected.Unbeaten in four and unquestionably the right favourite, he is the only Group One winner in this field, having won two such races. Outbattled Roaring Lion at Doncaster in the autumn. Was thought to be vulnerable on his first start back and was not favourite when winning the Guineas, travelling smoothly and scoring with some authority. Any improvement on that would make him very hard to beat, short of trouble in running. Must prove his stamina for the extra half-mile, which can’t be taken for granted on his pedigree or his run-style. Draw in stall one is often a problem over this course and distance but he has the tactical pace to minimise that. Four stablemates will surely not be getting in his way. An immensely valuable stallion prospect if he can win thisForm and pedigree give this one plenty to prove and Dettori, who could have ridden, has gone for Hazapour instead. Beaten in both starts as a juvenile but had a wind operation in the winter and better this year though the bare form isn’t good enough.Another of O’Brien’s five, this one is starting to look exposed as not good enough after six starts. Won a Curragh maiden and a Group Three at Leopardstown but the most recent of those was in July. Neither the rain nor the extra distance are necessarily a help. Finished strongly to win the Chester Vase last month, having been brave to take a gap between rivals at the crucial moment. On the face of it, a half-length defeat of Dee Ex Bee is not enough to scare fans of Saxon Warrior and this colt may have plenty of running to do from the home turn, as he looked a bit short of early speed that day. But his stamina is not in question, the recent rain helps and he will surely be there to make a challenge if more fancied rivals falter.One of the best bred in the field but yet to show that level of class on the track. Has more to offer and the recent rain gives him a chance to outrun his big odds. To be ridden by Padraig Beggy, who sprang such a surprise in this race last year but has hardly had a winner since.

They merely take three: at those points fielders must have some existential questions for themselves, wondering what on earth they’re doing with their lives, throwing themselves around like loons for the sake of a single. 20th over: Pakistan 42-2 (Haris 23, Shafiq 16) Woakes has an appeal of his own, otherwise a fairly uneventful over. Tom Bowtell has been at the stats again. “Lovely to see Broad getting it to spit past the edge like old times. He’s currently 31 years and 342 days. Since he was that age, Jimmy has taken 180 wickets at 21.42, so there could be life in those ludicrously long legs yet...”19th over: Pakistan 42-2 (Haris 23, Shafiq 16) For a cruel tiny moment, Curran thought he had snuck through Shafiq’s defences, but like a child having an ice cream whipped away from him, a pesky bat got in the way. Broad then comes over to offer some advice, and Curran does a decent enough job of looking respectful, but also like he wants to tell the old boy to eff off. Haris times a push rather nicely just in front of point for a couple, then Curran has a big lbw shout, but it looked high and they don’t review on that basis. Decent pace though. 18th over: Pakistan 39-2 (Haris 21, Shafiq 15) Woakes goes across Haris, and Bairstow - but only Bairstow - screams for a caught behind. There was a noise but it was probably a hint of thigh. Decent enough over. 17th over: Pakistan 38-2 (Haris 21, Shafiq 14) And here is Curran. My colleague Rob Smyth, who’ll be on after lunch, sends me this list of teenagers who’ve played for England: 16 Test wickets taken by the under-20s. Curran goes full to Haris, with a hint of swing, but by the third over the batsman seems to have got it sussed: he drives once through the covers for two, then for a second time for four, holding the pose and showing off his excellent form, like a gymnast sticking their arms out to display they’ve nailed the landing. 16th over: Pakistan 32-2 (Haris 15, Shafiq 14) It’s Chris Woakes first change rather than Curran, replacing Anderson. Woakes sends down the loosener’s loosener which Shafiq plays a slightly odd shot at, a cut off his tip-toes that goes over the covers and to the ropes. Next is a much more convincing shot, from a over-compensating half-volley, Shafiq driving splendidly to pretty much the same spot on the boundary. The rest of the over is better, beating the bat a couple of times, including a big flash that Shafiq misses. As they have a drink, here’s John Starbuck:“I just caught TMS discussing Broad’s run-up, but I noticed myself that it now seems to be a few stutters, then 16 full paces. This is much longer than he used to do, which is a bit odd, as you’d imagine an older bowler would shorten it. It probably means he won’t be able to bowl quite so many overs, but if it means he gets more wickets, as he’s doing so far, perhaps that won’t matter too much. I recall lots of fast bowlers (West Indies and Australia mainly) in the old days would start from somewhere near the boundary. Presumably it helps to steady their accuracy in some way, or maybe just to irritate the batters?”14th over: Pakistan 24-2 (Haris 15, Shafiq 6) Broad in again, sticks one down leg side then bowls the most perfect leg cutter, starting on middle-off and moving away. The sort of ball that Shafiq just had to stick his bat down, close his eyes and pray he didn’t nick it. After Shafiq gets away from strike, Broad repeats the trick to Haris. Great bowling. 13th over: Pakistan 23-2 (Haris 15, Shafiq 5) Anderson continues, which is a bit of a surprise. This over looks a bit tired: a couple of excellent balls, but too many too wide. That will surely be his last of the spell. 12th over: Pakistan 23-2 (Haris 15, Shafiq 5) Curran is loosening, so we might see him next up. Meanwhile, Broad beats Haris with an absolute peach that moves away. He has a little grin on his face at the top of his run - think Broad is having a lovely time out there. Another one nearly gets through but Haris gets a single, jabbed into the covers. 11th over: Pakistan 22-2 (Haris 14, Shafiq 5) Possibly Pakistan’s first really convincing shot of the day comes as Shafiq plays an absolutely perfect cover drive to the ropes. Honestly, you could frame that and hang it above the fireplace. Beautiful. 10th over: Pakistan 18-2 (Haris 14, Shafiq 1) Shafiq goes positive straight away, and gets off the mark with a leading edge through the covers. Azhar’s 40-minute nightmare comes to an end, as Broad gets one to dip in just enough to trap him in front. Brief suggestion of a review, but that looked stone dead. 9th over: Pakistan 17-1 (Azhar 2, Haris 14) Azhar still looks in some bother, beaten on the outside then the inside edge. Eventually he walks down the pitch to try smothering the swing, but the best he can manage from the over is a leg bye. 8th over: Pakistan 16-1 (Azhar 2, Haris 14) Azhar gets another single from an edge, that one an insider that saved him from a pretty certain lbw. Haris then drives without timing it that well through the covers, and they take two. Then four for Haris, a drive just in front of point that was in the air for a while, and was a bit outside-halfy. And then another four, with a proper edge that flew just - just - over the slips. Pakistan still haven’t really played a convincing shot, but Gary disagrees with me...7th over: Pakistan 5-1 (Azhar 1, Haris 4) Pakistan’s first boundary comes from a peach of a ball from Anderson, on off stump and shaping away that Haris gets a thick outside edge on, and it zips through the slips to the third man fence. Anderson beats the edge with another couple, and despite the naysayers I reckon England are bowling pretty well here. For those asking, here’s the TMS YouTube link for those readinglistening abroad. 6th over: Pakistan 1-1 (Azhar 1, Haris 0) Getting quite a few tweets and emails complaining about how England are bowling this morning, from who I think are England supporters. Sure, a few might have been a touch wide but these two batsman are just surviving at the moment. There are plenty of times to whinge about this England team, but I would say now isn’t one of them. Another maiden, Broad getting Azhar to play plenty. 5th over: Pakistan 1-1 (Azhar 1, Haris 0) A run! Azhar nudges into the leg side, and Pakistan are off the mark, to sarcastic cheers from what crowd can get in Headingley given that one end is being constructed. And no, I will not be letting this one go. Anderson’s last ball is very full from around the wicket and moves an outrageous amount, but started just to wide for the swing to hit Haris’s stumps. Not too far away though. 4th over: Pakistan 0-1 (Azhar 0, Haris 0) Broad sends a few far too wide, so tries coming round the wicket. Haris plays a big shot at the first one vaguely in his arc, lucky not to nick one that shifted significantly away. Another blank for the tourists. Not making them play enough though. 3rd over: Pakistan 0-1 (Azhar 0, Haris 0) Big hoop in from Anderson at Azhar, which he does well to keep out. The rest of the over is there or thereabouts, without Azhar being in much serious trouble, and is another maiden. “I disagree with the mindset that you can only have a single ‘keeper in the side,” writes Christian Seller. “If a specialist ‘keeper is good enough to get in the side for his batting, then he should get the nod. I seem to recall the Kiwis going in to a test against England at this ground a few years ago with 4 of them* and winning the match. Indeed, all four of them scored at least a 50 in that match, if Statsguru is to be believed (which it always is).”*Latham, McCullum, Watling and Ronchi, if you’re asking.2nd over: Pakistan 0-1 (Azhar 0, Haris 0) Broad was getting movement both ways in that over, but looking at the reply of the wicket it didn’t look like it went that far, if at all. The reprieve doesn’t last long. Broad throws one up, a lovely line and length for a drive but there may have been a touch of away movement and a thick edge goes high to Root at third slip. Good catch, good start for England. And it was too high! A good inch or two as well. Imam survives, an excellent review, but he might worry that he was so easily beaten by the in-dip.There was some talk that Broad might not get the new ball, but he does take it and traps Imam lbw first ball! The finger goes up, but it looks high enough to send it upstairs. 1st over: Pakistan 0-0 (Azhar 0, Imam 0) Bit of movement first up for Anderson, beating Azhar all ends with the opening and closing balls of the over. The rest of the over wasn’t quite pitched up enough, or too wide, but some encouragement at least for England’s bowlers. The players are out. Anderson will have the new pill, bowling to Azhar. Here’s a grumble of my own: how come we’re playing a Test at Headingley when it’s half a building site, when, say, Old Trafford doesn’t have a Test this summer? I guess there is a straightforward answer, but of course I couldn’t possibly comment on that...“Why is Curran in, rather than a bit of continuity for Wood?” asks Jenny Newcombe. “Already churning. I don’t get it.”I guess the theory is that Wood wasn’t much good at Lord’s so doesn’t necessarily deserve the continuity, plus Curran beefs up the batting a bit, plus it’s always handy to have a left-armer in there. “Is it me or is the shape of the England team looking weirder and weirder?” grumbles Peter Salmon. “I grew up in an era of six batsmen, a wicketkeeper, four bowlers. If the number six was an all rounder that was great, and hopefully one of the bowlers was a spinner. Now we have two wicketkeepers who should just be batsmen, fast bowlers at number 7 and all sorts of nonsense. In football, goalkeepers are much better at passing nowadays, but you don’t play three of them in a side. I realise things have changed, but the old template lasted well over a hundred years and it feels like at least referring to it occasionally might be helpful.”“If I remember right,” remembers Kevin Wilson, “in what will forever be known as the ‘Kerrigan Test’, Woakes batted at six. A demotion for the poor lad.”You are quite correct. Also worth noting that Kerrigan only actually bowled eight overs in that Test, enough to scar a man for life. Poor bloke. So the expected changes for England, and it’ll be very exciting to see how Curran does. Might he even take the new ball? Just one change for Pakistan, Babar Azam injured and Usman Salahuddin coming in. “Given that England’s tail pretty much starts with the openers,” writes Sam Kelly, “does it matter where Woakes bats?”SCurran has been given his cap (by Graham Thorpe), which means he’ll be the first left-arm quick to play for England in a Test since...Ryan Sidebottom? Am I forgetting anyone there?If Vish here is right - and he very often is - Stokes hasn’t made it, which means a debut for Sam Curran, plus Mark Wood is out in favour of Chris Woakes...who will...gulp...bat at 7. That’s...that’s a relatively lengthy tail. England are in a pickle. No wins in the last eight Tests, still to find an opening partner for Alastair Cook (who some people want dropped, as if it’s not hard enough to find one reliable opener, never mind two), still to really find a spinner, still to find a third fast bowler (or even a second, depending on what you think of Stuart Broad’s form), still a spot or two uncertain in the middle order, still to really work out what Trevor Bayliss does apart from peer out from under that hat at the end of a day’s play and run through exactly what went wrong. Still, let’s focus on some good news. Jimmy Anderson is bowling better than ever, having taken 68 wickets at 19.36 in the last year (15 Tests), Jonny Bairstow is fit to play and Jos Buttler is back in the team. Plus they’re playing Pakistan, which is always pretty joyful. Because, among other things, they have Mohammad Amir. I’ve never seen anything like him, at that age, when he showed up in England in 2010. It’s one of the great tragedies of sport that we missed five years of this generational talent, because while he’s good now, what on earth might he be like had he not been banned. He’ll be bowling to Keaton Jennings, one of possibly two changes to the England team, depending on Ben Stokes’s fitness. Could be on for another ripper. Stick around.Nick will be here shortly. In the meantime you can read Tim de Lisle’s thought-provoking piece about the difficulties of opening the batting alongside Alastair Cook …"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a7a0b1717e01e30c43c2e7e1f63d9c150523090a/27_184_3734_2241/master/3734.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7b232d5c9363fa7c838449a04acdbde7","title":"french open 2018 day six zverev wozniacki and djokovic in action live","story":"On Court 18 Kei Nishikori has made a storming start against Gilles Simon, but the Frenchman has just saved three break points to go from 0-40 down, win five successive points and his first game of the match.

They have played seven times, with Djokovic holding a 6-1 head-to-head advantage, including victory here two years ago, in four sets.Keys sets up a second match point with another winner, and this one is surrendered by Osaka with a double fault. And this is what Keys has to say about it:Naomi raised her level a lot in the second set and I really just had to hang in there. Clay is growing on me. It’s not my favourite still but being in the round of 16 for a second time definitely makes it a little bit better.From 1-4 down Keys draws level, hitting two fabulous winners, one down the line and the other crosscourt. It’s an oddly compelling spectacle, this, Keys’ racket like Forrest Gump’s box of chocolates – you never know what you’re going to get.Osaka has taken Keys to a second-set tie break, and has won the first two points. The American should already be back in the locker room resting up for round four, but is making life very difficult for herself. Osaka’s tactics are simply to keep the ball in play and wait for an error, and they’re working surprisingly frequently. On court seven Yulia Putintseva, who beat Johanna Konta in the first round, is playing Qiang Wang, who beat Venus Williams at the same stage. Wang won the first set 6-1, but it’s deadlocked at 4-4 in the second.Over on Philippe Chatrier Damir Dzumhur, who at 26 has never been beyond the third round of a Grand Slam, has levelled the match against Alexander Zverev, winning the second set 6-3.Keys from 15-30 down, has a match point, misses it and then surrenders the game, hitting a forehand well long on break point. This is a strange match, with Keys clearly the superior player but also making too many unnecessary errors. Osaka has hit seven winners in the entire match, to Keys’ 18, but is still hanging in there.Keys held her serve and has just broken, so is now serving for the match at 5-4 in the second set.So, an update on what has happened in the first hour of play:On Philippe Chatrier, Alexander Zverev is a set up against Damir Dzumhur, and 3-3 in the second. On Suzanne Lenglen, Madison Keys won the first set against Naomi Osaka 6-1 but is having to fight in the second, which is currently on serve with Osaka 4-3 up. On Court One, Grigor Dimitrov is in a battle against Fernando Verdasco, who is currently serving at 5-6 in the first.So here’s a Reuters preview of today’s action, with the order of play on the main courts:Second seed Alexander Zverev will resume his quest for a maiden Grand Slam title against Bosnian Damir Dzumhur in the third round of the French Open on Friday.The German has never reached the last 16 at Roland Garros and has lost his only other meeting with Dzumhur - in the quarter-finals of last year’s Shenzhen Open. Former champion Novak Djokovic faces a stern test against Spain’s Roberto Bautista Agut, the 13th seed, especially as the Serb has been far from his clinical best so far. Seventh seed Dominic Thiem, the only player to beat favourite Rafael Nadal on clay this season, plays Italian Matteo Berrettini in the Bullring in one of the day’s last matches. In the women’s draw, second seed Caroline Wozniacki of Denmark takes on France’s Pauline Parmentier for a place in the fourth round. Wozniacki demolished Spaniard Georgina Garcia Perez 6-1 6-0 to reach round three and while she has a 3-1 head-to-head lead over Parmentier, the Dane was beaten by the Frenchwoman in Istanbul on clay earlier this year. U.S. Open champion Sloane Stephens is also in action, the 10th seed taking on Italy’s Camila Giorgi, while fellow American Madison Keys meets talented Japanese youngster Naomi Osaka. Order of play on the main showcourts (all matches second round unless stated, prefix numbers denote seeding): Simon will be here shortly. In the meantime you can read Kevin Mitchell’s account of Maria Sharapova’s progress, in which he describes the Russian as “flowing through Roland Garros with the determined air of a queen not quite ready for the guillotine”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/78b7dc1cfbcd2969167c3c5f5e00255f45c72100/0_51_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=23518f5cf65e8f6f487d3a85fe31fe08","title":"matt leblanc exits top gear time to be sent to the scrapheap","story":"Now that Matt LeBlanc has joined the long list of ex-presenters on the show, the BBC has a big decision to make about its futureWell, here we are again. For the third time in four years, Top Gear has found itself without its lead host. If you’re feeling optimistic, at least you can say that Matt LeBlanc resigned in a largely professional way.At least it was delivered through the proper channels, and sounded grateful. Given the way the last two Top Gear hosts ducked out – Chris Evans tweeted his resignation under a swirl of low ratings and digs from the tabloids, and Jeremy Clarkson effectively punched his way to a sacking – LeBlanc’s exit is a Debrett’s level masterclass in etiquette.In fairness to LeBlanc, his stay was never likely to be a long one. His appointment had the ring of novelty, like the BBC was overstretching to show that it still has muscle. Here was a legitimately famous man – admittedly most famous for a 20-year-old television programme, but still – who lives in America and spends six months of every year earning $4m a season on his CBS sitcom, Man With a Plan. Was he ever going to give that up in order to interview Jason Manford in an abandoned paint factory in Dunsfold? Would you? Of course you wouldn’t. But let’s not focus too hard on the exit. Let’s focus on the hole that has been left behind. Losing so many hosts in such a short time is not ideal. The appeal of Top Gear was that it always looked more fun to make than to watch. So if the people who make it can’t be bothered any more, then why should we?As far as I can tell, the BBC now has four options. The first is to replace LeBlanc with another celebrity. Maybe it can lure in Adam Sandler or Vin Diesel or Jay Leno with the promise of driving around the Alps in a supercar a few times a year. Maybe it will. But I’d argue that it shouldn’t. Big American stars are flighty and expensive, and they wouldn’t necessarily enjoy the grunt-work of putting together a weekly magazine show for BBC Two. Or maybe Top Gear could introduce a rotating panel of big-name guest hosts. But, again, I wouldn’t recommend this option. This is partly because star quality is never what the show has been about. Some of the filmed segments might enjoy a bit of razzle-dazzle, but it is always juxtaposed with the slapdash make-do-and-mend nature of the studio segments. The heart of Top Gear isn’t the car reviews, it’s the knowledge that the everyone on camera has just been drinking crap tea from a polystyrene cup while hiding from drizzle in a caravan. Sacrificing that for a succession of tentpole names would be a mistake. Also, Have I Got News For You has guests hosts, and Have I Got News For You is terrible.Alternatively, they could just let the existing hosts get on with it. Over the past couple of years, Chris Harris and Rory Reid have developed a nice little chemistry of their own, with Harris as the bone-deep car nerd and Reid as the excitable child. Perhaps they have what it takes to shoulder the series alone? After all, don’t forget that it took a few years for Clarkson, Hammond and May to properly bed in. The BBC has always been much better at developing talent than shipping it in, so it would make sense to just hand Top Gear to them to see what happens. Sure, it might not initially be the ratings smash of old, but the pair could take their time and build it back into something that fits their respective skillsets. The result of this would be a newer, better, more authentic Top Gear that might well regain some of the show’s former glory.Or they could just ditch it altogether. Top Gear has become a liability, so they could just bin it and move on. In fact, yes, let’s just go with that one. Great. Decision made. Thanks Top Gear. The door’s that way."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c1b4b98fac5c6e3b41b3cbb717293cdf5cc59bc8/0_27_800_480/master/800.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=357ae72d346fd35007ffd41ca86c31bd","title":"bizzare lies moms told kids","story":"A compilation of white lies moms have told their kids around the world shows that while many fibs were uniquely crazy, there was plenty of common groundBeing a mom is a tough job, in large part because you just can’t reason with small children. What you can do, however, is lie to them. In honor of Mother’s Day, we asked readers to send us the most outlandish white lies their mothers ever told them. As it turns out, moms all over the world are telling some wonderfully inventive lies.We received over 500 responses, and as uniquely crazy as many of them were, there was also plenty of common ground. Many mothers still tell variations on the classics: if you make a funny face, it will stay that way if you eat before you swim, you’ll get cramps (or die) moms have eyes in the backs of their heads, and so on.But then there were the more esoteric fibs, such as the dangers of dragonflies sewing your lips together, that playing in puddles will give you polio, or that a little man lives in your eyes and signals your mom when you aren’t telling the truth.We couldn’t include all of the fantastic entries we received, but we’ve collected over a hundred of our favorites below. Check and see how many of your own mom’s fantastic tales you recognize. Oh, and watch out for the “Lie Man” …“If you lie to me, I will know because when I ask you to look into a bowl of water, I will be able to see your reflection.” – Patricia Petersen, Vancouver, British Columbia“In order to keep us kids from stealing pennies from water fountains, my mother told us the water was electrified and we would die.” – G Johnson, Georgia“That a little birdie followed me around and flew back and told my mother when I was doing something that wasn’t allowed, like cycling down 11th Avenue, or stealing more than my share of cookies.” – Sherrie, Fredericton, Canada“Mom always knew when I was fibbing. She said she could tell because I had a black mark on my forehead. My grandma used to say the same thing. I would run to the mirror to see it, but it was never there. They said I couldn’t see it because fibbers eventually go blind! I was scared to death.” – Batzion, Chicago, Illinois“That she could tell I was lying by looking at my tongue. I lived in fear of her telling me to stick out my tongue.” – Ann Chafin, Oak Hill, West Virginia“That my eyes would turn yellow if I lied.” – Terry Burd, San Juan Capistrano, California“I asked my mom about little bumps I would get on my tongue. She told me they were liars’ bumps.” – Donna, Cheyenne, Wyoming“That eating bread crusts would make my hair curly. It never worked on me, because I didn’t want curly hair!” – Emma, Oxford, United Kingdom“If I ate the crusts of my bread, my hair would get curly (I wanted curly hair)!” – Kate, Des Moines, Iowa“You won’t have curly hair if you don’t eat your crusts. I’m not sure I wanted curly hair but I must have eaten a lot of crusts.” – Martin, Stourbridge, United Kingdom“Eating burnt toast at breakfast would take the curls (very unmanly) out of my hair.” – Brent Parks, Radford, Virginia“When I was very tiny, my mother always told me my pin-straight hair would grow in curly if I ate my all bread crusts.” – Emily, Iowa“My mother told me that if I ate my sandwich crusts all the time, my hair would curl. I had very straight long black hair as a youth.” – Margie, Oregon“Eating the crusts of your bread will give you curly hair.” – Rosie, Farnham, United Kingdom“As a little boy, my husband hated his white blond hair, and although he also didn’t like bread crust, his mother said if he ate it he would get the brown hair he so wanted.” – Jeannie Havnen, Clive, Iowa“The claim was that my very straight hair would become lovely and curly if l ate all the crusts on bread, instead of just the soft middles. I ate mountains of crusty bread and my hair is still as straight as a yard of pump water!” – Pam Rankin, Boise, Idaho“She told me I would get curly hair if I ate the burnt toast. I don’t think I ever really believed her. I’m 81 years old now.” – Patricia King, Ocala, Florida“You had to eat your bread crusts if you wanted to learn how to whistle.” – Rose Bork, Appleton, Wisconsin“Mom convinced me to eat the crusts of bread by telling me that ‘that’s where all the vitamins are’, as though vitamins could somehow migrate outward during the baking process. I’m not entirely sure why she imagined that, at age 5 or 6, I’d even care about consuming vitamin-rich foods, but it worked.” – Nicole, Rochester, New York“Eating the end of a bread loaf will help to grow breasts.” – Elina, Latvia“We were told as children that eating the crust on bread makes your teeth whiter.” – Scott Cooper, North Tazewell, Virginia“So she wouldn’t have to cut the edges off of my sandwiches, when I was 8, my mom told me eating the bread crusts would make my boobs grow big.” – Sakana, Santa Fe, New Mexico“Growing up we always had a toaster that made the bread a little ‘toastier’ than would be desired. Mom told her three daughters that if we all ate burnt toast, we would become opera singers. As you would guess, none of us went into show business.” – Del, South Carolina“White bread is only for white people. We buy wheat bread, because we’re brown.” – Isa Flores, Austin, Texas“If you sprinkle salt on a bird’s tail, it will sit still and you can catch it.” – Frank Hartigan, Springfield, Oregon“I wanted a pet very badly and my mother told me that if I could put salt on the tail of a bird, I’d be able to catch it. Hours were spent outside with the salt shaker and various homemade traps.” – Anne Falbowski, Colchester, Connecticut“To catch a bird, sprinkle salt on its tail, and it can’t fly away.” – Pat Benard, Spruce Pine, North Carolina“She would bring salt shakers to the beach and told us if we were able to get salt on a seagull’s tail feathers it would become our pet. Her way of keeping four kids occupied.” – Charlie, Florida“If you put salt on a bird’s tail, it will freeze and you can catch it. She would send me out to the backyard with a salt shaker. I would spend hours ‘catching birds’.” – Sharon Arthur, New York, New York“My mother and my friend’s mother told us that the the inside of our ears would turn black if we were naughty.” – Úlfhildur, Iceland“If I didn’t stop crying my head would fall off and laugh at me.” – Amy Garnet, Harrisburg, Pennsylvania“You would get spots like a rotting banana if you didn’t go outside.” – Jay, Newfoundland“My intestines would rupture if I continued to use my belly as a bongo drum.” –Jen, Colorado“If you play with fire, you will pee in the bed.” – Sara Klinglesmith, Louisville, Kentucky“That if you play with fire, you will pee the bed. She also said that if you get a stye in your eye, you had taken a pee along the road. Obviously a urine-centric theme.” – Thomas Lhamon, Traverse City, Michigan“That when you drive by a field and smell the fertilizermanure, you should breathe in deeply, that it is good for your lungs.” – Katerina, Czech Republic“Not to play in rain puddles. Will get polio.” – Maryann Kelly, Boston, Massachusetts“My mom told my sister this, but she said that if you keep scratching your booboos and drink water that all the water would start pouring out of your cuts and scrapes.” – Carrie Engerrand, Texas“She told me that my head would turn around if I would leave the house with my hair wet.” – Luka Bak, Croatia“Potty training: Mom always reminded my sister and I that if we didn’t wipe front to back we wouldn’t have friends.” – Christy, Georgia“My mother used to convince me that I was tired by telling me that I had ‘twirlies’ in my eyes that she could see.

Always sent me running straight to bed.” – Sarah Khalil, Beirut, Lebanon“Freckles are erased by rubbing cucumbers on them.” – Caitrin McCormick, Minnesota“My mom told me that if I didn’t wear socks with my tennis shoes, my toes would rot off.” – Taryn Sparacio, Bellevue, Washington“If you water houseplants while you are menstruating the plants will die.” – Susan, Mesa, Arizona“I’m gonna unscrew your belly button and your legs will fall off!” – Deborah Riehl, North Creek, Washington“When you lose a baby tooth, if you don’t put your tongue in the hole where the tooth was, you’ll grow a new gold tooth in that spot.

I was never a seamstress of any kind, but saw no reason to tempt fate, even when I took up embroidery.” – Kathleen, Indianapolis, Indiana“If you have your clothes sewn while wearing them, to suck on a piece of thread to avoid losing your mind.” – Eny Steinberg, Mexico City, Mexico“If you sew on a Sunday, you’ll spend eternity in hell picking out the stitches with your nose.” – Cara, Washington DC“If you sat on the cement, you would catch a cold.” – Maria Martinez, Napa, California“Going out with wet hair, wearing fashionable cropped clothing that didn’t come right down to your bum and sitting down on cold concrete all cause a mysterious illness known as ‘a chill on your kidneys’. When questioned on the symptoms when I was an adult, mum still said: ‘Well you’ll know all about it when you catch one.’ It seems to also be caused by inadequate vegetable consumption and staying out late without your good coat.” – Sarah, Manchester, United Kingdom“If you sit on a cold, concrete wall you’ll get a urinary tract infection.” – Anne, Maryland“That there was a man that traveled around town and he would chop off your middle finger if you used it to make crude hand gestures.” – G Johnson, Georgia“If I don’t behave the chimney sweep will come and take me away.” – Bernie Harshman, Arizona“It is something that I used to tell my boys when they were little: I used to tell them that there was a tiny Lie Man that lived in their eyes, and if they ever told a lie, that little man would show up in their eyes, and I would see him. From that time on, if they ever tried to tell a lie, they would close their eyes, so I couldn’t see the ‘Lie Man’.” – Heidi Harrison, Beacon, New York“In the pre-internet era, she told me that the mailman could read everything I mailed, and that I should never write anything that I wouldn’t want him to read.” – CLK, Vero Beach, Florida“If my brother and I didn’t behave, she was going to call Joe Schmoe, the baby cop, who would take us to baby jail.” – Bruce S Bevitz, Orlando, Florida“She said that the dust under my bed (if not kept clean) would turn into a man. And I thought about that every night before turning off the light.” – Betty Skalski, Winnetka, Illinois“House elves exist, and that if I follow them to the fairy ring in the yard then I have to stay with them forever.” – Alexandra Green, Ashland City, Tennessee“This story isn’t about my mother but rather my grandmother who used to watch my sister and I during the summer time when my parents had to work. She had a pocket door off of her kitchen, and for some reason, I was always playing with the brass latch, probably because of the sound it made. That used to annoy her, so she used to tell me that an evil fairy lived within the latch and if I kept playing with her home, she’d come take me in my sleep.” – Owen McCafferty, Cleveland, Ohio“If I wore my clothes backwards, the fairies would take me away.” – Beth, Ottawa, Canada“She told me that my freckles were ‘fairy kisses’ from fairies kissing me while I was asleep. Fortunately, I didn’t think it was a scary thing to have happen.” – Kathryn Adams, Toronto, Canada“My mom would always tell me that under the little silver drain covers in bathrooms, lived a small city of tiny people. She would mention how they survived by drinking the drain water, and would wait for humans who knew to feed them. I would often feed them my leftover bread, tear my food into small pieces to give to them, and put pennies or dimes down the drains where they would fit.” – Elise B, Pico Rivera, California“She told me that the sudden appearance of dandelions in the yard was because when a leprechaun drops gold coins they turn into flowers in the sunlight.” – James Mitcham, Baltimore, Maryland“Every Easter my mom would take me to a quiet room away from the kitchen. She would sit me down on a comfortable cushion and very seriously tell me that if I sat quietly and concentrated very hard that I could lay an egg. I would sit there, checking behind me occasionally. Sure enough, after close to an hour, an egg would magically appear. Elated, I would run to my mom and triumphantly hand her my magic egg!” – SLan123, California“The brand names on Christmas toys were the names of the elf who made it.” – Thipu, New York“If I swallowed orange seeds, trees would grow out of my ears.” – Sharon O’Connor, Texas“To deter my brother and me from eating my mom’s delicious homemade chocolate chip cookies she told us the extra crunch to them were frogs legs. Really they were walnuts.” – Jen, California“If you don’t eat your green vegetables, you will get yellow jaundice.” – Joel H, New York City, New York“My eyes would turn blue if I ate lots of carrots!” – Dominique, Mexico City“If you don’t eat beans you will suffer from something she called ‘lack-a-beany’.” – Joyce Ford, Seattle, Washington“Never go swimming in the poolocean after eating watermelon (common parental lie in Israel).” – Sharon, Israel“You will grow horns when you have a snack while lying in bed. I was quite intrigued as to where the horns will grow and what they will look like (like a cow or like a reindeer or like a wild buck) so I kept on asking irritating questions, until mom gave up and tried to explain the crumbs will change into rocks, which led to more questions…” – Tessa De Villiers, South Africa“That the peach pits I found outside were ‘hoppy toad’ eggs.” – Kristine, California“My mom told me that sugary foods had little bugs on them, and the bugs liked to eat teeth, but if I brushed, then it would take them off.” – Adam Drew, Calgary, Canada“Rich people eat shrimp for breakfast.” – Teresa, Chicago, Illinois“Eating any seeds (watermelon and apple) would cause that fruit to grow in my belly.” – Andrea, Massachusetts“That if I stretch my arms above my head when I’m eating, the food goes to a ‘donkey stomach’ instead of my own.” – Pia, Houston, Texas“If you leave your glass of orange juice sitting out too long, all of the vitamins will evaporate from it.” – Mark Schaeffer, Oakland, California“Coffee turns your knees black.” – Ryan Maloney, San Diego, California“Drinking coffee will make hair grow on your toes.” – Lesley, North Carolina“As a small child I always wanted to drink coffee like the adults. In order to deter this urge, mother told me that if I drank coffee I would break out in freckles the color of coffee. Not wanting freckles of any kind, I believed her, neglecting to question why none of the adults in the family that drank coffee had freckles!” – Debbie Bruce King, Franklin, Tennessee“That if I drank coffee I would grow hair on my chest!” – Terra Salazar, California“My hair would turn red if I would drink coffee (hers was red).” – Suzanne, Netherlands“For our first pet, my mom agreed to let my brother and I get a parakeet. Though I have no recollection of it, we picked out a green and yellow one. The next morning, my mom found the bird lying dead on the bottom of the cage, so she brought it back to the store to get another one. But there were no more green-and-yellow birds left – only blue ones. My mom begrudgingly exchanged our now-deceased choice for a light blue bird, and when she got home, she told her three- and five-year-olds that the parakeet had simply taken a bath. We must have accepted it right away, because I can’t ever remember a time when our parakeet was yellow and green.” – Madeline Bilis, Boston, Massachusetts“I was a pre-schooler when my pet turtle died. Mom had been sick and the turtle was neglected. When mom was better, she told me the turtle was hibernating. I was unaware she replaced the turtle, but one day she had me come to see how my turtle had resumed an active life. She told me the truth when I was an adult in my 40s. Not only had the turtle been replaced once, but many times.” – Janet, Ontario, Canada“When I was three years old I was told the family dog, Inky, died because he fell in the soap bubbles.” – Joe Milici, Mount Joy, Pennsylvania“My pet chickens and rabbits had gone ‘to the farm’ when in fact my former farmer Dad had turned them into dinner.” – Pat, Arlington Heights, Illinois“She told us that if you kissed your elbow you would turn into a boy.” – Tara Bryan, Flatrock, Newfoundland“Because of something my younger sister got to do that I was not allowed to do I told my mother I wanted to be a girl. So she told me if I could kiss the tip of my elbow I would turn into a girl.” – Mark Moore, Knoxville, Tennessee“If you kiss your elbow, you’ll turn into a princess.” – Peggy Sanchez, St Paul, Minnesota“That if I could put my elbow in my ear, I would turn into a boy. I thought that changing sexes could be a super power disguise, so I spent hours trying.” – Jill, Seattle, Washington“If a snapping turtle bit you, it would not let loose until it heard thunder.” – J Bonamour, Louisiana“For as long as I can remember when we would drive to Rhode Island, she would tell me that the forest rangers used giraffes to prune the trees. I would always be looking in just the wrong direction and miss seeing one as we went by.” – Edward P Steele, Connecticut“If you continue to stare into a mirror, a monkey will pop out.” – Joan Henehan, Los Angeles, California“If you whistle at night, snakes will hear it and come into your bed.” – Vito Delsante, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania“My mother told me the winter sand barrels at the sides of steep parts of mountain highways were for the convenience of traveling cats. I was mad and sad for the cats.” – Thomas Tigaboj, Denver, Colorado“I was told that dragonflies will sew your eyelids shut if you were not careful.” – Joe Becker, San Francisco, California“Playing with my belly button would make my butt fall off. And dragonflies (called darning needles then) would sew the lips together of children who misbehaved.” – Michael Hewins, Washington DC“Dragonflies would sew my mouth shut.” – Meredith Roy, New Jersey“Eating chocolate chip cookie dough would give you worms.” – John, Assonet, Massachusetts“The bubbles in the icicles hanging from the roof were worm eggs.” – Pete Haerden, Carver, Minnesota“My mother used to tell us not to eat paper, crayons or glue, because if we did it would give us worms, and then worms would grow in our bellies. That was enough to deter me from ever eating any of that stuff.” – Amanda Stanley, Oregon“If you eat raw cookie dough you’ll get worms.” – Gwen Demombynes, Seattle, Washington“Sometimes when our house settled it would make little creaking noises that seemed to come from under our home, only accessible by a hatch into the crawl space. When my brother and I asked her what was making the noises under the house she told us that’s where our misbehaving siblings lived and if we didn’t behave that’s where he and I would end up.” – Jen, California“There was a gravel factory near the town where we lived, and my mother told us it was kids jail and that if we were naughty we would have to go there and bust rocks all day and only eat bread and water. Every time we drove past that place my sisters and I would be absolutely silent in the car so she wouldn’t have a reason to drop us off at the kids jail.” – Whittney Bishop, Phnom Penh, Cambodia“She told me that the grease spots in the street in front of our house were stains that were left from children being hit by cars who had ventured out into the street.” –Jerrilee, Poseyville, Indiana“My mom told me that the gum spots on the sidewalk were actually blood from the kids who didn’t look before crossing the road.” – Ava Moody, Fort Worth, TexasEric Grundhauser is a staff writer for Atlas Obscura and lives in Brooklyn.

Where, a century earlier, the deluxe Rector’s restaurant once prepared lobster “sixteen different ways at a dollar apiece”, Bubba Gump Shrimp Co now serves its seafood to New York’s visitors with a “boat size bucket of fries” on the side.The Great White Way – nicknamed in the early 1900s for its dazzling electric lights – feels dispiriting here at its epicentre in the raw light of day. Fran Leadon, the author of a new history of the street that tells the story of modern America, almost visibly recoils from a fancy dress Batman as we pick through the aimless herd.Broadway is still global shorthand for bright lights, big city – and even though modern Times Square is underwhelming by day, it is a garish explosion at night. Right now, global stars including Bruce Springsteen, Denzel Washington and Glenda Jackson compete with musical revivals of My Fair Lady, Carousel and Hello Dolly! as well as a newly-arrived Harry Potter extravaganza.The spectacle is gaudy, but sits well in the tradition of the theatre district, which Leadon writes in Broadway A History of New York City in Thirteen Miles always provided a “delirious exaggeration of American culture”. This is the street that drove America forward – the Path of Progress as it expanded north, powered by showmanship and illusion.“There is a mythology about Broadway that we take for granted,” Leadon says. “The Great White Way, the crossroads of the world, the theatres, ticker tape parades, all these public displays. I had always thought that mythology came from the street, from all the things that were there and the things that had happened there.“I think what I have concluded is that it was the opposite – which is much more interesting – this community, especially of business types, kind of invested in this mythology. They wanted the street in New York, in the country, to be powerful, to be magical, to be creative, and everything that followed was fulfilling that desire to have it be this mythical place.”Starting at the southern tip of Manhattan, like the island’s spine, Broadway has held the city together and sometimes been its fault line. It has witnessed riots, police beating crowds of protestors, the symbolic downfall of a colonial monarch and the rise of the first US president.Wild, brawling men and outrageous, over-inflated showmen have been venerated there, office workers have greeted presidents, war heroes, sports stars and astronauts with signature ticker tape parades.“From the beginning, it was the economic engine of the city, it was the thing that was pointing the way towards the city’s development,” Leadon said. “Broadway was always the place where things happened first: the first theatre the first really big hotel all the main churches. It was originally where all the big mansions were, downtown. It was always the big incubator for the city.”The 80-feet wide muddy, early 17th century route to drive livestock through the Dutch colony of New Amsterdam was named Brede Wegh – Broad Way – and when the British took over, it was Anglicised and conjoined to become Broadway.It remained a filthy mess, hogs foraging in the street, Caribbean pirates in the taverns. Less than a mile long, and, from an early stage, a physical expression of inequality – the east side developed by artisans and tradesmen was known as the shilling side, and the west, owned by Trinity Church, was the wealthy dollar side.“Since it was the main gathering place in the city, it was where everything came together, so the wealthiest people in the country, but also the poorest and the native born, old Dutch families, but also the newer immigrants, slave-owner and slave,” Leadon said. “It’s always been representative of this gap between wealth and destitution and as the city developed, it just got wider and wider and wider, but it was there from the very beginning.”The panic of 1837, a financial crisis which triggered recession, led to crowds of destitute men and women lining up for bread and firewood. Today, the midtown stretch is still a haven for homeless people, slumped on sidewalks and public squares.Broadway charts the American story. When General George Washington sailed into New York in 1776, he took over an almost abandoned city after British forces fled. After the first copies of the Declaration of Independence reached New York, on the night of 9 July, Washington read it aloud to his troops, who rushed down Broadway to Bowling Green. “Ropes were thrown around the gilded statue of George III and, following a series of hopeful cracking noises, king and horse hit the ground.” The statue was hacked up and its lead melted down to make bullets to use against the British redcoats.In 1790, as the first president of the United States, Washington briefly moved into 39-41 Broadway, but by the time Government House was finished, in 1791, New York had lost the capital to Philadelphia.Fears of inferiority drove progress and sent Broadway extending north, in spite of the hard-to-tame marshlands, eventually erted underneath modern day Canal Street. Leadon said the idea was: “ ‘If we spruce up the city a little bit, maybe we can look like Philadelphia … we need better architecture to start to compete with Philly and Boston and become the main American metropolis’.”Money and grand homes shifted north, fashionable stores followed, offices and hotels came in behind and pushed the theatres north, too.By the time AT Stewart \u0026amp Co opened a “marble palace” of a dry goods store in the 1840s, Broadway had seized commercial dominance as the place to get the first pick of Paris fashions arriving by ship from Europe. Shopping and promenading became a cultural phenomenon.The visiting Charles Dickens arrived on Broadway and was dazzled, writing: “We have seen more colours in ten minutes, than we should have elsewhere is as many days. What various parasols! What rainbow silks and satins!”The 1850s brought a hotel boom – the St Nicholas was celebrated as the largest and most elegant in the world – but the fashionable advance was also accompanied by prostitution, and violent gangs who fought epic battles. William Poole, immortalised as Bill the Butcher – champion boxer, butcher, rightwing anti-Catholic, anti-immigrant politician – died a lingering death after he was shot in a hotel bar brawl. Broadway drew crowds of 100,000 to see an open hearse drawn by four white horses, cloaked in black, with white plumes on their heads lead a procession of 4,000 people to his Brooklyn burial ground.By the 1870s Central Park was nearing completion – built as a haven from noise and overcrowding, an answer to the great green spaces of European cities, such as London’s Hyde Park. And Broadway took off north again – the sixth and seventh miles up to 106th Street becoming more like a wide European boulevard. “By then,” Leadon said of the expanding metropolis, “they are thinking, ‘we need to look like Paris, we need to compete with the European cities’... Philadelphia was long ago vanquished and they were trying to compete with London and Paris.”Electric light arrived in 1880, and the first electric billboard in 1892, at the site where the Flatiron would spring up a decade later. Probably the most audacious early ad was at 38th Street in 1910 – 72ft high and 90ft wide and “inspired by the long-running Broadway hit Ben-Hur, featured a moving chariot race complete with galloping horses and cracking whips, animated by an ingenious sequencing of 20,000 incandescent bulbs that flashed on and off 2,500 times a minute.”The most enduring, unique landmark to Broadway’s heyday, built in 1902, still stands today, like an ocean-going liner at the narrow point where Broadway meets Fifth Avenue at 23rd Street. The ‘freak building’ as it was described, better known as the Flatiron, was a futuristic skyscraper, built from steel, clad in limestone, brick and terracotta tiles. It was modelled after the giant American Imperialism structures of the Chicago World’s Fair, but madly compromised by its sharply triangular plot. It became known as hurricane corner as winds played havoc with hats and women’s hemlines. Cops arrested men who gathered to gawp, and a magistrate ruled in the case of a French tourist, that “two minutes is a reasonable time ... and you can use your eyes but at the end of that time you must move on”.By miles 12 and 13, Leadon says, “the past is a little closer to the surface”. Farmland was not really developed until the subway got there in the early 20th century Inwood Hill Park at the top of Manhattan still has overgrown foundations of old ‘Gilded Age” mansions in the woods. John F Seaman’s 19th century marble house had 25 rooms, an observatory and a swimming pool. The entry gatehouse was a scaled down Arc de Triomphe. “Today almost nothing is left,” he writes, but “tucked behind an auto body shop on the west side of the street between 215th and 218th streets, Seaman’s Arc de Triomphe still peers out at the street, covered with graffiti and gradually succumbing to the weight of time”.Today, the pattern of flatten and replace goes on. As he walked north from Flatiron, Leadon gasped as he reached 28th Street and saw another building being razed. “That’s the last vestige of the old Broadway of the 70s and 80s, marginal discount stores full of trinkets, wig stores buying and selling human hair. Weird, weird stuff.”He sounds regretful, almost as if a tiny part of his book is already out of date. But as he records, on Broadway it was always this way money drives everything forward. As journalist Junius Henri Brown put it in 1868: “Broadway is always being built, but it is never finished.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0c5ed69d5fe47e37dc08c500a41d5f097dafb024/0_77_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=65d4f8ac47580cb147620de9dcbcf9c8","title":"how chopping off their horns helps save rhinos from poachers","story":"Violent but bloodless, dehorning is considered a necessary evil by anti-poaching campaigners in South AfricaArmed with a dart gun in a helicopter hovering above Somkhanda game reserve in South Africa, the vet Dr Mike Toft has just shot a powerful cocktail of drugs into the massive white rhino below.The 2,000kg (315st) bull starts to stagger and sinks slowly to its knees as the drugs take effect. Though immobilised, the rhino is conscious. So, once it has been moved into the right position by a team on the ground, foam earmuffs and a blindfold are placed on its head to reduce stress levels.After marking the ideal cutting point to avoid damaging the living growth plates at the base of the horns, Toft fires up a chainsaw and slices both of them off.Those magnificent horns, which have helped to protect this species for millions of years, are the reason that more than 7,000 rhinos have been killed in South Africa in the past decade. A persistent human desire for rhino horn – for everything from traditional medicine to hangover cures or status symbols – drives the slaughter of more than 1,000 of the animals each year in the country that has the largest rhino population in the world.News doesn\u0027t always have to be bad – indeed, the relentless focus on confrontation, disaster, antagonism and blame risks convincing the public that the world is hopeless and there is nothing we can do.This series is an antidote, an attempt to show that there is plenty of hope, as our journalists scour the planet looking for pioneers, trailblazers, best practice, unsung heroes, ideas that work, ideas that might and innovations whose time might have come.Readers can recommend other projects, people and progress that we should report on by contacting us at theupside@theWorldwide, the situation is grave. The northern white rhino became functionally extinct after the death of Sudan, the last male, in March, while the black rhino population is down to about 5,200. The situation for Asian rhinos is equally bleak: there are just 3,200 surviving Indian rhinos, about 76 Sumatran rhinos and 60 Javan rhinos. There are fewer than 30,000 rhinos globally, with Africa’s southern white rhino the most populous species at about 20,000.These alarming figures have driven wildlife managers in several South African reserves to take the drastic step of sawing off hundreds of horns every year, before criminal syndicates can get their hands on them. With the poachers’ prize removed, the risk to the hornless animals is greatly reduced.Toft has removed close to 1,800 horns from 900 rhinos in the past three years in KwaZulu-Natal, which has been heavily targeted by poachers. Both Galliers and Toft acknowledge that dehorning is not a permanent or ideal solution to the crisis. “This is not something we want to do. It’s expensive and invasive but we believe it is a necessary evil,” says Galliers, noting that it costs about £580 to safely dehorn a rhino.The cost is based on the hiring of helicopters and skilled vets. Galliers, also head of the anti-poaching initiative Project Rhino, points out that dehorning must be repeated every 18-24 months as the horns regrow naturally.Even then, there have been cases of dehorned animals being shot for their stumps. Toft has developed a method of removing as much horn as possible without causing pain to the rhino or damage to its growth plates. The horn is removed to about three finger widths from the base, then the stump is further trimmed around the edges with an angle grinder, enabling the removal of an extra 2kg of horn on a large bull.The operation is noisy and violent, but there is no blood – and Toft insists it is no more painful than trimming your fingernails if done correctly.Galliers and Toft believe dehorning could help save rhinos under threat elsewhere in Africa and Asia. But the cost means that might only be possible in small and medium-sized reserves. Dehorning only selected bulls is not an option, as those without horns would be more vulnerable in territory fights. In parks where the entire rhino population is dehorned, all bulls are placed at equal disadvantage. But dehorned rhinos can still fend off lions by using their considerable bulk as a weapon, Toft says. For trophy hunters, the aim is to acquire both the head and the horns. Many other horned animals are hunted: elephants are slaughtered for their ivory, but Toft does not think detusking is a solution. Tusks are partially hollow and contain sensitive roots and nerves. Although it would be feasible to remove the solid portion, a large volume of tusk would have to remain intact, which could still attract the attention of poachers. Tusks are also essential tools for elephants to strip tree bark or dig up succulent roots and tubers.For now, dehorning appears to be achieving success as an emergency measure, buying time while the decades-old debate continues about how to end the demand for rhino horn.This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems.

The relatively unknown law professor met Mattarella late on Thursday night to put forward a list of ministers, which the president has accepted.“All the conditions have been fulfilled for a political, Five Star and League government,” said Luigi Di Maio, the Five Star chief, and Matteo Salvini, the League leader, in a joint statement after a day of talks in Rome.The deal will bring at least temporary calm to a political crisis that has embroiled Italy for weeks. The tumult raised questions – in Brussels and among investors around the world – about whether the rise in Italian populism and the collapse of traditional parties posed a fundamental threat to the country’s future in the eurozone.The formation of the new government will at least temporarily allay those concerns, because it will remove for now the threat that snap elections will be called later this summer, a prospect which worried investors because it could have bolstered support for anti-EU parties.The populist leaders stepped back from their insistence that Paolo Savona, an 81-year-old Eurosceptic, should serve as finance minister. The choice had been vetoed by Mattarella, prompting the M5S and the League to call off their deal. Savona will now serve as EU minister instead.But there are still many unknowns about how the new administration – an uneasy alliance between two former political opponents, both jockeying for power – will govern Italy.Salvini, the bombastic and xenophobic leader of the League , who rose in recent years on the back of incendiary and racist statements about migrants and Roma, will take on the role of interior minister. Salvini has campaigned on the promise of mass deportations of migrants and said a new government would build detention centres around Italy. He is also a fierce critic of Brussels and has called for closer ties to Russia.Di Maio will take on a powerful new post that will combine labour and industry portfolios in a move that could mark big changes to labour and environmental policies, given the M5S’s stated opposition to big industry.Giovanni Tria, a little known economics professor, was named to lead the finance ministry. While Tria has been critical of the EU, he is not been seen as an advocate for an exit from the eurozone.The new deal was blessed by Mattarella, who earlier this week nominated a technocrat, Carlo Cottarelli, to serve as prime minister. Those plans were put on hold after Mattarella opted to give the populists more time to reach a new agreement.The new government is expected to take a far more antagonistic stance against Brussels than the previous government, headed by the centre-left Democratic party. But the alliance between the M5S and the League will have only a relatively narrow majority in the Italian senate, easing concerns among investors and officials in Brussels over the new government’s decision-making. While both parties are populist in nature, and have railed against Brussels and Italian “elites”, they have long been natural opponents in politics.Wolfango Piccoli, the co-president of Teneo Intelligence in London, said: “They are both led by young and ambitious leaders who share prime-ministerial ambitions. Due to mutual distrust, it has taken both parties over 70 days to reach a deal and choose an unknown third figure as prime minister.”Their shared agenda includes plans to cut taxes, scrap a previously agreed pension plan and institute a “universal basic income”.While many officials in Brussels sought to ease tensions with Rome this week, and backed Mattarella after the president took a political risk by defending Italy’s role in the EU, Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European commission, issued a tough critique of Italy on Thursday. He said Italians needed to work harder, be less corrupt and stop looking to the EU to rescue the country’s poor regions.“Italians have to take care of the poor regions of Italy. That means more work, less corruption, seriousness,” Juncker said. “We will help them as we always did. But don’t play this game of loading with responsibility the EU. A country is a country, a nation is a nation. Countries first, Europe second.”Additional reporting by Daniel Boffey in Brussels"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"\u0026lsquoThe boys played a great style of rugby.

Photograph: Nick BradshawIt took 35 years to build a landslide.Repealing the Eighth Amendment to the Constitution was neither quick nor easy, despite what the margin of difference might say.Sixty-six per cent said “Yes”. Makes it look simple.But that two-thirds majority conceals hard history and hard-fought battles behind a stunning final result.Woman by woman, story by story, year upon year, day after day. The rocks and pebbles of countless unjust ordeals and small personal tragedies piled up after each furtive trip to Liverpool and beyond.Brave campaigners for basic abortion rights did everything they could to increase the pressure, their efforts ignored and condemned by priests and politicians and that tiresome class of pious people who live in terror of the slippery slope.They thought they could hold back a landslide. On Friday, gravity kicked in. The slippery slope did for them in the end.The Eighth Amendment, which guaranteed a foetus the same right to life as the woman carrying it, is gone from the Constitution. Good riddance to it. It brought nothing but difficulty and despair to Irish women in times when they desperately needed proper care and compassion at home.It was a wonderful morning on Saturday in the RDS when the boxes were opened and the votes counted. It was a wonderful afternoon in Dublin Castle when crowds filled the courtyard to hear the official declaration. It was a wonderful day for Irish women.A day made even better in the happy knowledge that the vast majority of Irish men are looking out for them and want only the best for them. By voting in their droves to repeal, they placed the concerns of women far above the fears of ideologically-motivated crusaders who prize saving souls above having a heart.With repeal looking the likely outcome, there were calls from some quarters for a muted and dignified response. Perhaps it was the reason why there was neither screen nor public address system for the huge crowd at the castle.But no. For all the decades of all the women who suffered, and for all the women who fought and agitated for change, we had to celebrate this historic turning-point in modern Irish society.Some never thought they would live to see the day. Some, like Monica Barnes and Mary Holland and Nuala Fennell and many more, didn’t. The celebration was for them too.It was for Ailbhe Smyth, who never stopped fighting. It was for senator Ivana Bacik, Catherine Murphy, Joan Burton, Catherine McGuinness and many more who were there from the start.Political rivalries were cast aside for the day. “Oh, c’mere to me,” said socialist Bríd Smith, giving Fianna Fáil’s Timmy Dooley a hug.Obstetrician Peter Boylan, looking very cool in his shades turned up and it was like George Clooney had just rambled in, such was the clamour which greeted his entrance. The three co-directors of Together4Yes – Ailbhe Smyth, Orla O’Connor and Gráinne Griffin – arrived to rapturous welcome.Senators Lynne Ruane and Alice Mary Higgins were in floods. Ruth Coppinger was hugging for Ireland. Katherine Zappone, who demanded the referendum as her price for supporting the Government, was ecstatic.“Oh God, I told my husband I’d give up the fags if there was a repeal,” said Fine Gael’s Kate O’Connell, one of the party’s most active campaigners, as she ran out for a smoke.Brendan Howlin arrived in just after Mary Lou McDonald’s big entrance. The Labour party was fighting the cause when all the others didn’t want to know. “We never get the credit,” said Howlin, shrugging. “We carry the flag, but then in comes the fresh faced Leo to take all the glory.”Maybe not. Health Minister Simon Harris pretended to be embarrassed by the “I fancy Simon Harris” poster, but he was secretly thrilled. Wherever he went he was mobbed. No wonder Leo stuck close by him.Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin maintained a low-key presence, but his early intervention and support for repeal and the proposed legislation was a pivotal point in the campaign.It was a courageous move which now sees him on the right side of history and one half of his parliamentary party stranded on the other.As Micheál walked through the crowd, tearful young women hugged him. A man and woman approached. “We’re one of those couples who had a fatal foetal abnormality,” the women said to him. “Thank you. Just, thank you,” she sobbed.Meanwhile, back in the RDS, the Attorney General was chatting to former Supreme Court Judge Catherine McGuinness.She had had eye surgery the day before but the doctor gave her a special dispensation to attend the count. “Theoretically I should have a patch over my eye today.”At Dublin Castle, Frank Crummy (81), who set up Ireland’s first family planning clinic, was resplendent in his repeal jumper, alongside his wife Evelyn.There was a lot of discussion about why so many politicians and pundits called the campaign so wrong. The Together4Yes team remains amused by the old school, outmoded metric used by some of them to evaluate their very effective efforts. It was as if they were affronted at the idea that people outside the Kildare Street bubble might actually know more than they do about what the electorate really wants these days.Independent TD Clare Daly, a politician hugely deserving of credit for the part she played, decided to stay away from the castle bunfight. Instead, a number of Johnny Come Lately politicians with a weakness for self-publicity preened and waved from the platform.It’s always the same.A third of the electorate voted No. “I feel like I’ve lost my country,” a woman told us amid the celebrations in the RDS. She was very sad. She couldn’t be consoled.Cheers and tears and champagne greeted the announcement. The sky fell in briefly when a few drops of rain fell. Everyone danced.Because it was a monumental day. The day when the intelligent, compassionate citizens of Ireland turned to the Catholic Church and the retreating fundamentalists and firmly said: “Thanks, but no thanks.

Photograph: Getty Britain’s Brexit secretary David Davis is creating a Brexit plan that would give Northern Ireland joint UK and European Union status so it could trade freely with both, as well as a buffer zone to eliminate the need for border checkpoints with Ireland, The Sun newspaper reported on Thursday.Mr Davis is drawing a proposed 16km-wide trade buffer zone along the border that would be in effect for local traders, like dairy farmers, after Britain leaves the bloc, the newspaper said. The Department of Foreign Affairs offered no comment on the specific proposal in a statement released in response to the plan the UK’s Brexit secretary is reportedly creating. Instead it urged Britain to engage with the EU “in a more detailed way” on the parts of the draft Brexit treaty relating to Ireland and Northern Ireland, including the “backstop” option that would keep Northern Ireland in the EU’s customs union and single market if no other solution was found to avoid a hard border.“At this stage in the process, the UK must engage in a more detailed way on the draft text of the protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland, including the backstop,” said a spokesman for the department.“The engagement must be through the formal negotiation with the Task Force, led by Michel Barnier. The Tánaiste and Irish officials are in ongoing contact with the EU Task Force team.”Mr Davis’s plan is a revision of the “max fac” or “maximum facilitation” plan, the report said, citing a source.British prime minister Theresa May previously pledged to take the UK out of the EU customs union by considering two options.One would be “max fac” in which the UK and EU would be entirely separate customs areas but would try to use technology to reduce friction and costs at the border.The other option being considered is a “customs partnership”, according to which the UK would co-operate with the EU more closely and collect tariffs on its behalf with no requirement of declarations of goods crossing the border.The European Union previously criticized Ms May for not setting out how the UK would achieve a frictionless border with the EU without erecting a land border to control goods between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.Britain suggested earlier this month that it would be willing to extend the use of EU tariffs as a backstop if there were delays in ratification of a Brexit deal to avoid a return to a hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland, adding the government did not want to use that option. - ReutersNegotiations move to phase II after agreement reached on protecting the rights of citizens in both UK \u0026amp EU, Northern Ireland and the financial settlement of the orce"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3515398.1527790007!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"britain s great greyhound racing advocate faces brexit bind","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tGone to the dogs: greyhound racing faces Brexit challengesThe English Greyhound Derby at Towcester on Saturday will, despite its name, be a thoroughly Irish affair, with Droopy’s Verve the 64 favourite taking on five other Irish dogs in greyhound racing’s premier annual fixture. Eighty-five per cent of the dogs running on British greyhound tracks every year are Irish, with British trainers typically sending bitches to Ireland for breeding.The free movement of dogs between the two islands has flourished since at least the late 1860s, when Master McGrath won the Waterloo Cup three times to become the most celebrated dog in the world. Master McGrath was commemorated with a statue in Lurgan and a monument in his home town of Dungarvan, and inspired a ballad that framed his race against an English competitor in terms of British-Irish rivalry:As Rose and the Master they both ran along, ‘Now I wonder,’ says Rose, ‘what took you from your home You should have stayed there in your Irish domain, And not come to gain laurels on Albion’s plain.’ ‘Well, I know,’ says McGrath, ‘we have wild heather bogs But you’ll find in old Ireland there’s good men and dogs. Lead on, bold Britannia, give none of your jaw, Stuff that up your nostrils,’ says Master McGrath.Greyhound racing in Britain has been in decline since the 1950s, with the number of tracks falling from more than 100 to fewer than 30. Unlike horse racing, which benefits from a levy on betting, greyhound racing receives no subsidy from the bookmakers.Live hare coursing, the sport in which Master McGrath won his laurels, is banned in Britain, but accusations of cruelty continue to pursue dog racing, which has also been damaged by scandals around doping after dogs were given cocaine to run faster. At the English Greyhound Derby lunch in London this week, its chairman, Alexander Hesketh, identified animal welfare as the greatest challenge facing the sport.Hesketh, a hereditary peer whose seat in the House of Lords was abolished in 1999, owns Towcester race course and is on a mission to modernise greyhound racing in Britain and around the world. The owners of every dog that runs at his course must pay a fee of £200, which is matched by Towcester to create what he calls a “canine pension fund” to rehome greyhounds when their racing days are over.Greyhound races now publish injury statistics, which show that injuries and deaths are lower than in horse racing, and Hesketh will soon launch a “Towcester standard” guaranteeing high welfare standards for animals.Hesketh was chief whip in the Lords under John Major, but left the Conservatives in 2011 to join Ukip and has been an enthusiastic advocate for Britain’s withdrawal from the European Union. One of his passions is now in conflict with another, however, as Brexit threatens to complicate the free movement of dogs between Ireland and Britain.Liam Dowling, who breeds greyhounds at Ballymac Kennels in\u0026nbspBallymacelligott, Co Kerry, has already seen his business suffer from the 14 per cent depreciation in sterling since the Brexit vote two years ago.“Our kennels are only 10 minutes from Farranfore, Kerry Airport. In that sense we are 90 minutes from London. We’re closer to London than Dublin for many interested buyers. But since the depreciation in Sterling, a lot less buyers are flying in to consider buying a greyhound. After the recession in 2008, our family business thought we were past all of that but the prospect of Brexit means more uncertainty,” he said.Currently, dogs travelling to Britain require a pet passport, a rabies vaccination and a health check by a vet 48 hours prior to travel with a registered transporter.\u0026nbspThat process could become more complicated and time-consuming if Britain leaves the EU without a deal or if the greyhound industry is not protected in a future trade agreement.Gerard Dollard, chief executive of Bord na gCon, is anxious about the impact of Brexit on an industry that involves 12,000 people and generates €300 million in economic activity.“Brexit is a game-changer for the greyhound sector,” he said. “There are thousands of jobs across rural Ireland dependent on a vibrant industry. There are no alternative export markets. As the semi-State body responsible for the commercial development of the sector, engagement has been ongoing between Bord na gCon and the Department of Agriculture. Their officials recognise the economic and social risk that potentially arises from Brexit. Like other sectors we need in as far as possible a frictionless border.”"},{"url":null,"title":"valerie jarrett hopes for teaching moment from roseanne barr s tweet","story":"  May 29, 2018Roseanne Barr compared a former Obama official to an ape in remarks on Twitter   May 30, 2018Actor\u0026rsquos racist Valerie Jarrett tweet came as little surprise to her social media followers   May 30, 2018Shortly after the Roseanne show was cancelled, right-wing commentators were engaged in \u0026lsquomental gymnastics\u0026rsquo "},{"url":null,"title":"hawaiis erupting kilauea volcano pictures","story":"Kilauea volcano has created nearly two dozen lava-shooting fissures on Hawaii\u0027s Big Island since the eruption began, spewing lava and emitting toxic gases.Thousands have been forced to evacuate their homes and experts remain unsure of where more of the hazardous cracks might open up, or when the volcanic activity might stop.The eruption of Kilauea volcano in Hawaii sparked new safety warnings about toxic gas on the Big Island\u0027s southern coastline after lava began flowing into the ocean and setting off a chemical reaction.Meet Nubia: the only baby ever to have survived EbolaChristine Lampard hid from stalker in bedroom when Twitter obsessive turned up at their houseTwo lions, two tigers and a jaguar escape from German zooNew glove could help in the fight against hospital superbugs     UK weather: Thunderstorms, heavy rain and flood warnings on first day of summer - with more on wayItaly\u0026#39s new populist government reacts furiously to Juncker suggesting southern Italy is corrupt and lazyZombie knife road rage attack: cyclist attacks driver with weapon after accidental collisionSpanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy forced out of job after losing no-confidence voteFirefighters carry commuters out of flooded Didcot Parkway stationWho could replace Matt LeBlanc as Top Gear host?\u0026#39British\u0026#39 royal expert \u0026#39exposed as Tommy from New York\u0026#39Love Island 2018: The complete beginner\u0026#39s guide as the new series starts on ITVWhat next for Iraq?

Today, some 1.1 billion people - 20 per cent of the population over the age of 15 - smoke.  Yet, although most countries have seen a fall in smoking rates, only a minority of countries look set to meet global and national commitments to cut tobacco use in over 15s by 30 per cent by 2025. The UK is one of a handful of countries on track to meet this goal.Which countries are on track to meet global tobacco reduction targets?The UK, where the first voluntary warnings appeared on cigarette packets in the 1970s and a smoking ban in public places has been in force since 2007, is one of a number of mostly wealthy countries that has led the way in tobacco control. Today just 16 per cent of the British population smokes, compared to 46 per cent in 1974.Across the rest of Europe smoking is also fast falling out of fashion. Last week, a new study revealed that smoking is starting to lose its allure in France as one million daily smokers kicked the habit in the last year thanks to the recent introduction of anti-smoking measures including higher taxes on cigarettes and plain packaging.Even Greece -  the European country where the biggest proportion of the population lights up - has seen a fall in smoking rates by almost two percentage points a year.Where are people stubbing out their cigarettes?The report reveals, however, that there are stark disparities between countries and regions. While 62 million smokers  in high-income countries stubbed out their cigarettes between 2000 and 2015, the number of smokers in low and middle income countries actually increased by 33 million.Less wealthy countries will see an increase in smokersThe report said that efforts to reduce tobacco use in low and middle income countries has likely been impeded by the tobacco industry whose relentless lobbying has stopped governments from introducing stronger policies.Dr Vinayak Prasad, co-lead author of the report and programme manager of  WHO\u0027s Tobacco Control, Prevention of Non Communicable Diseases team said: “It’s easier to get the political will and to explain the problem of tobacco but the tobacco industry is taking strong measures - they use all kinds of arguments such as the argument that controlling tobacco harms people\u0027s livelihoods.  The data however, disproves that controlling tobacco affects livelihoods.”The WHO’s Eastern Mediterranean region - which covers much of the Middle East and North Africa - is one region where overall smoking rates have barely fallen. The actual number of people smoking is expected to rise from 47 million in 2000 to 103 million in 2025 - a more than two-fold increase.Smoking rate are falling in most of the world- except the Middle East and AfricaDr Prasad said that multiple reasons lie behind high smoking rates in the region. “It’s culturally and socially acceptable to use the water pipe in many countries in the Eastern Mediterranean region, there’s been no strong leadership to push tobacco reduction at the highest level and countries have been hesitant to tax,” he said.Some GCC countries such as the UAE which introduced a \u0027sin tax\u0027 on cigarettes last October are starting to take measures but these have so far not been sufficient, according to Dr. Prasad.Some countries are bucking global trends as more people light upWhile the picture in many low and middle income countries is less sanguine, one group that is bucking the trend is women.Globally, women are kicking the habit faster in all regions of the world except Europe. “European women are an outlier globally,” said Dr Prasad. He said that factors including more liberal gender attitudes are contributing to a slower fall in smoking among women.Every year tobacco kills seven million people around the world – more than AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria combined.Tobacco use and second-hand smoke exposure are key causes of cardiovascular diseases such as heart attacks and stroke. Cardiovascular diseases kill 18 million people each year - with smoking responsible for some three million of these deaths.“The single biggest killer in the world is cardiovascular disease,” said Dr Prasad. “They are responsible for almost 44 percent of non-communicable disease deaths. If you fix the heart problem, you fix a big proportion of NCDs,” he said. According to the WHO few people are aware of the link between heart disease and tobacco as there is evidence of a serious lack of knowledge of the multiple health risks associated with tobacco.“Most people know that using tobacco causes cancer and lung disease, but many people aren’t aware that tobacco also causes heart disease and stroke – the world’s leading killers,” said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General.In recent years, more countries have adopted tobacco control policies such as plain packaging, taxation and banning smoking in public places.More people are now covered by tobacco control measuresAlthough Dr Prasad acknowledges that the tobacco industry and the continual development of novel products to continue to lure smokers remains an obstacle, he said that tobacco control policies have had a marked impact in many countries - including in low and middle income countries.“Taxation for sure is definitely an instrument - the additional revenue has been used to help the government fund universal health care in places like the Philippines,” said Dr Prasad. “Smoke free policies also cost very little as do warning labels and plain packaging,” he added.   Although the WHO’s current projection shows few countries will meet the 30 per cent target, Dr Prasad pointed to the example of France as evidence of what a country can achieve with political will. “France wasn’t doing anything until 2016 then woke up and introduced plain packaging. Things change.”Protect yourself and your family by learning more about Global Health Security Please review our commenting policyMeet Nubia: the only baby ever to have survived EbolaChristine Lampard hid from stalker in bedroom when Twitter obsessive turned up at their houseTwo lions, two tigers and a jaguar escape from German zooNew glove could help in the fight against hospital superbugs     UK weather: Thunderstorms, heavy rain and flood warnings on first day of summer - with more on wayItaly\u0026#39s new populist government reacts furiously to Juncker suggesting southern Italy is corrupt and lazyZombie knife road rage attack: cyclist attacks driver with weapon after accidental collisionSpanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy forced out of job after losing no-confidence voteFirefighters carry commuters out of flooded Didcot Parkway stationWho could replace Matt LeBlanc as Top Gear host?\u0026#39British\u0026#39 royal expert \u0026#39exposed as Tommy from New York\u0026#39Love Island 2018: The complete beginner\u0026#39s guide as the new series starts on ITVWhat next for Iraq?

Producers seemingly thought they were commissioning a bona fide upper-crust British man.His website lists scores of broadcasters who have enlisted his views on royal matters including many BBC radio stations, as well as many from around the globe.He told a US channel from a five-star hotel that the Duchess of Sussex should not upstage existing members of the royal family “especially when you’re coming in the way you are”.The royal enthusiast also told a Norwegian broadcaster that the marriage should be about keeping integrity, keeping formality and making sure that the traditions and heritage that we have as British people remain at the forefront.He said of Ms Markle in a video recorded outside Buckingham Palace: “She is loud, she is American, she fights for her cause. We don’t do that here.“We do things quietly with dignity.“Ms Markle is going to be a little bit challenged when it comes to that because she’s so used to doing things the American way, which is not the British way.”The royal expert was so widely-interviewed that one piece described him as the most interviewed man on the subject of the royal wedding. He retweeted this message to his followers.The Wall Street Journal reported the alleged true background of the 38-year-old Italian-American, who told the newspaper that he identifies more as British than American, and that he had been obsessed with the UK as a child.He said he made his surname using the “names of friends and distant relations” and that he has an agreement with two unrelated elderly British people who let him call them his grandparents.However, he later responded to the claims in the WSJ, saying: The Wall Street Journal breached journalistic trust, omitted truths and mis-sold what the initial interview was for, he said.Many of the facts in the article are inaccurate and the Wall Street Journal itself was given many opportunities to ensure that the article was published with the most accurate information available.

Is the adoption of other people\u0027s customs and cultures fair game or has political correctness gone mad?\u0026nbspDavid Barnett treads warily\u0026nbspLet’s get this out of the way: I am a straight, white, middle-aged man, so what follows you may take with a pinch of salt or disregard completely. But we’re going to talk, you and I, about the thorny issue of cultural appropriation.It was only a year ago that Oxford Dictionaries put the phrase into their official lexicons, with the definition, “the unacknowledged or inappropriate adoption of the customs, practices, ideas, etc. of one people or society by members of another and typically more dominant people or society.”Cultural appropriation is sometimes so blatant it smacks us in the face. The Black and White Minstrel Show ran on British television for – what seems now to us, looking back at it – and astonishing 20 years, from 1958.Even halfway through its run the show, in which white entertainers “blacked up” to sing songs in a Deep South of America style, was the subject of petitions calling for it to be taken off the air because of its in-your-face racism. It can hardly be seen now without an overwhelming feeling of embarrassment. How did we ever think that was acceptable?The show was harking back to the minstrel shows in 19th-century America, and blackface was a popular form of entertainment until the enlightenment of the 1960s, coupled with rising racial tensions across the US, finally put paid to it. Even Al Jolson, dubbed “the world’s greatest entertainer”, was renowned for performing in blackface. Jolson was Jewish, and while there can never be any excuses made today for blacking up, it’s interesting that in their 2008 book the Encyclopedia of American Jewish History, authors Stephen Harlan Norwood and Eunice G Pollack talk of Jolson’s 1927 movie The Jazz Singer in terms which suggest some kind of what we would today call intersectionality. For example: “Is there any incongruity in this Jewish boy with his face painted like a Southern Negro singing in the Negro dialect? No, there is not…The son of a line of rabbis well knows how to sing the songs of the most cruelly wronged people in the world\u0027s history.”Can a Jewish man really pretend to be a black man without racism? Is this cultural appropriation of the very worst kind or solidarity that only two historically subjugated peoples can appreciate? And what, then, of a Jewish woman who dresses up as a Japanese woman for entertainment?The cries of “cultural appropriation” were resounding around social media even before Netta Barzilai had finished her (ultimately competition-winning) performance of Toys, the Israeli entry in this month’s Eurovision song contest held in Lisbon.Netta wore a stylised kimono and was surrounded by dozens of maneki neko waving lucky cat statues. Twitter in particular was rather exercised by the thought of the cultural appropriation taking place before its very eyes. Or, I should say, mainly white Western Twitter. It seems the only people not too fussed were the Japanese themselves.According to the website soranews24, which repackages and discusses Japanese news stories for an English speaking audience, the overwhelming response on the ground seems to be a mildly nonplussed reaction.The site quoted from Japanese social media accounts which included the responses, “Culture is meant to be stolen. If it’s not worth stealing, then it isn’t culture”, “If people keep claiming ‘cultural appropriation’ then people will not touch our culture. Then, people will not understand our culture and it will be easier to become our enemy”, and, perhaps crucially, “Westerners care too much about silly things”.Is that the problem? Are we, Westerners, liberal Westerners, too over-sensitive of the feelings of others brought on by white guilt? Or are we right to call out what we think is wrong when we see it? Should we wait before speaking, to see what the actual people affected think? Or is it our duty to step in first?Perhaps it’s now we should go back to the Oxford Dictionaries definition of cultural appropriation, particularly the bit that talks about the “more dominant people or society”. Is Israel a more dominant culture than Japan? Or vice-versa? What do we think? What do they think?A couple of weeks before Eurovision, Eastern dress was setting Twitter alight again, this time when a Utah teenager posted online pictures of her wearing her prom dress which was actually a qipao, traditional Chinese dress. The 18-year-old was accused of cultural appropriation and casual racism. People of Chinese heritage chimed in with arguments on both sides of the debate, with some pointing out that the outfit was originally worn by women carrying out domestic duties, and thus not something to be really celebrated, and another writing, “I’m Asian and Chinese, you looked beautiful in that dress, I’m sorry you got bashed for it.”Cyprus\u0027 singer Eleni Foureira performs the song FuegoIsrael\u0027s singer Netta performs the song Toy Belgium\u0027s singer Sennek performs the song A Matter Of Time Estonia\u0027s singer Elina Nechayeva performs the song La ForzaCroatia\u0027s singer Franka performs the song Crazy Albania\u0027s singer Eugent Bushpepa performs the song MallCzech Republic\u0027s singer Mikolas Josef performs the song Lie To MeIreland\u0027s singer Ryan O\u0027Shaughnessy performs the song TogetherSwiss duo ZIBBZ\u0027s singer Corinne Gfeller performs the song StonesBulgarian group Equinox\u0027 singer Zhana Bergendorff (R) performs the song BonesLithuania\u0027s singer Ieva Zasimauskaite performs the song When We\u0027re OldFinland\u0027s singer Saara Aalto performs the song MonstersGreece\u0027s singer Yianna Terzi performs the song Oniro MouAustria\u0027s singer Cesar Sampson performs the song Nobody But YouAzerbaijan\u0027s singer Aisel performs the song X My HeartIceland\u0027s singer Ari Olafsson performs the song Our ChoiceArmenia\u0027s singer Sevak Khanagyan performs the song QamiMacedonian duo Eye Cue\u0027s lead vocalist Marija Ivanovska (R) and guitarist Bojan Trajkovski perform the song Lost And FoundBelarus\u0027 singer Alekseev performs the song ForeverNorway\u0027s singer Alexander Rybak performs the song That\u0027s How You Write A SongRomanian band The Humans perform the song GoodbyeSerbia\u0027s band Sanja Ilic \u0026amp Balkanika perform the song Nova DecaSan Marino\u0027s Jessika featuring Jenifer Brening perform the song Who We AreDenmark\u0027s singer Rasmussen performs the song Higher GroundPoland\u0027s singer Gromee feat.

The fashion shows routinely feature collections riffing off a range of global cultures. For the coming autumn, Gucci recently unveiled a series of headwear inspired by Sikh turbans. Vogue ran a photoshoot in its “Diversity Issue” last year with a model in full Japanese geisha outfit. Not unusual, and perhaps nothing wrong with it… save for in both cases (and in the Victoria’s Secret show last year in which a model flaunted a Native American-style headdress) all the models were white.Here’s where cultural appropriation smacks up against representation. Maybe if Victoria’s Secret had employed a Native American model, if Vogue had used a Japanese model, if Gucci had – as the Sikh Coalition suggested in the aftermath – used Sikh models who would have properly observed the correct way to wear what is, after all, a sacred clothing item, then the later dissemination of these items on to the high street might not be quite so problematic.There’s a difference, too, between fashion and performance. When I was very young, on a holiday at a Pontin’s camp on the North-West coast, I was wrapped in a blanket, had two stripes of lipstick put across my face, and a feather from a passing seagull taped to my head. I was entered into the fancy dress contest (I didn’t win). I was of course, a Red Indian, as Native Americans were called in those less-enlightened times.As bad as the Black and White Minstrels? Possibly. But “Red Indians” back then were almost a fictional, fairytale group of people, the image drawn from Monday matinee westerns not renowned for historical accuracy, from Peter Pan, from Hiawatha and Little Plum. Would I have dressed my children like that when they were the same age? Undoubtedly not. Times change. Sensitivities alter.Utah teenager, Keziah Daum, sparked a huge debate on Twitter about cultural appropriation after posting photos of her traditional Chinese prom dressAnd I look down at what I’m wearing right now as I type this. A T-shirt, which has its origins as an undergarment in 19th-century America. A pair of jeans, which were originally developed in Italy (Genoa, which gave rise to “jeans”) and France (the fabric of Nimes, or de Nimes, from which is derived “denim”). A pair of flip-flops (don’t judge me), evolved from the Japanese zōri which servicemen took back to America post-Second World War (though early flip-flops have been discovered in ancient Egyptian burial sites).I am a melange of styles borrowed, begged and stolen from around the world. Is this cultural appropriation, several generations down the line? Should I be wearing what my grandfathers wore? Polyester slacks and an Oxford shirt, a cardigan, brogues? Where is the line, and on which side of it are we?Music is another cultural appropriation battleground. Every time Katy Perry or Taylor Swift goes “ghetto” for another video, or Lana Del Ray puts on a Native American headdress, it’s there to see. White folks stole rock’n’roll from African rhythms filtered through the American South, we stole electronic dance music from the predominantly-black post-disco clubs of Chicago and Detroit, and Italy. Take away the cultural appropriation, and what’s left? A couple of rousing choruses of Knees Up, Mother Brown or The Lambeth Walk, perhaps.Should we talk about food? Those great British traditions such as pizza, or chow mein, or curry? A few miles from me, Bradford is awash with curry houses. The clientele is largely white. Is that cultural appropriation? Well, no, because most of the restaurants are owned and worked in by people of South Asian heritage. But what was deemed cultural appropriation was when, earlier this year, a restaurant called Fanny’s announced it was opening a venue for the purveying of “posh kebabs” in London’s Stoke Newington.The move was lambasted on Twitter because, for one, Stoke Newington is a hub for Turkish restaurants and takeaways… the people who, you know, invented the kebab. For another, because the people behind Fanny’s weren’t Turkish (one of the founders is called Claude Compton, for your information), and the tag-line “posh kebabs” intimated that these “lads from Fulham” were basically going to beat the Turks at their own game (as a side note, Fanny’s subsequently dropped the “posh” bit from their marketing and logo).Fanny\u0027s Kebabs finally dropped the \u0027posh\u0027 bit from their marketing (fannyskebabsInstagram)If you’ve made it this far, you might be wondering where I’m heading with all this. And the honest answer is, I just don’t know. Cultural appropriation seems, on the face of it, like it should be something that all of us should fight against, but the flip-side of that is knowing exactly just what it is and when we should call it out.As I said at the top of this piece, take what I say with a pinch of salt, given that I am a middle-aged white man. But where does that leave me, if we remove years of embedded cultural appropriation? Dressed in my grandad’s clothes, listening to a 78 of George Formby classics, and clutching a chip butty? And on that score, should I be calling cultural appropriation on the New York magazine The Insider’s awestruck piece last month on a Turkish restaurant that was selling this remarkable new thing, a sandwich stuffed with fries?The answer’s no, of course, because cultural appropriation will never affect me in the way it does other, marginalised people. I have working-class roots but I’m still pretty close to the top of the privilege chain all I can realistically get away with is some faux outrage at posh kids slumming it at Wetherspoons and Greggs for Instagram likes.But maybe those who identify as white, liberal allies should hit the pause button before calling out cultural appropriation, and just take a moment to think. The obvious stuff, the outright horror of the Black and White Minstrels and the more subtle but by no means any less problematic racism, yes, by all means, dig in. Dog-piling on teenagers for wearing a prom dress, maybe hold off a bit.Cultural appropriation is a big desert, and one on which we might have to draw our own personal lines in the sand as to what we know in our guts is wrong, and what we think might be, possibly, a little bit off.And with that, I bid you sayonara.Black and White minstralsor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

We have been focusing on what\u0027s close to us, but there\u0027s a wealth of information in the distant reaches of the solar system too, she added.The research was led by scientists from the University of Plymouth, University of Cologne in\u0026nbspGermany,\u0026nbspand Brigham Young University in\u0026nbspthe US.It was published in the journal Science.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Thanks for a great drive.LeBlanc, 50, will present his fourth and final series of the car programme later this year.The American actor was a surprise addition to the Top Gear presenting line-up along with Chris Evans two years ago, following the departure of previous hosts Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May.He then continued hosting the show after Evans threw in the towel after just one series.Evans said at the time that LeBlanc was the captain and backed him staying on the programme, and viewers praised his efforts when he returned without the BBC Radio 2 DJ.In recent series, LeBlanc, who is also known for his role in sitcom Episodes, has been joined by co-hosts Chris Harris and Rory Reid.Patrick Holland, controller for BBC Two, said: I want to thank the fabulous Matt LeBlanc for being a brilliant co-host on Top Gear.Matt has thrown himself into the show with real passion, revealing his extraordinary car knowledge and a willingness to get down and dirty.We were always going to be borrowing him from his day job as one of the top comic actors in Hollywood so I wish him all the very best.The next series of Top Gear (Matt\u0027s last) promises to be something very special and we have great plans to welcome a new co-host to join the team for 2019 and beyond.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

The trade partners are all expected to retaliate in what is becoming a fast-developing global trade war.A White House official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to describe the back and forth between both countries, said Mr Trudeau spoke to Mr Trump last Friday, and then Mr Trudeau called Mr Pence on Monday to follow up. Mr Pence called Mr Trudeau back on Tuesday “to discuss ongoing negotiations.”The sunset issue was one of several that the White House wanted “clarity” on before any meeting took place, the White House official said.These tensions are only expected to intensify. Mr Trump, Mr Trudeau, and several other world leaders are scheduled to meet next week in Canada at the G7 meeting.President Trump has said the tariffs were necessary in order to protect US\u0026nbspnational security, but they were widely criticised by foreign leaders, US business groups, and even some labour groups as being ill-designed and potentially damaging to the US\u0026nbspeconomy.The White House has sought to include a “sunset” provision in the Nafta renegotiation for months, but Canada and Mexico have long been cool to the idea, saying it would remove any economic security and certainty for businesses trying to comply with trade rules.Mr Trudeau on Thursday said he felt the US, Mexico and Canada were on the verge of a renegotiated Nafta that he described as a “win, win, win” before the talks stalled after the Pence phone call.Mr Trump has threatened to take steps to withdraw from Nafta for more than a year, but during his first year in office he was coaxed out of taking dramatic steps by advisers like National Economic Council President Gary Cohn and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson.Now, both of those men have left the White House, and Mr Trump has gravitated instead towards seeking the counsel of trade hard-liners like Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, senior adviser Peter Navarro, and US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer.Mr Trump had taken a slightly less adversarial public approach with Canada and Mexico during the initial stages of the negotiations, but that ended several months ago.In March, Mr Trump told a group during a St. Louis fundraiser that he simply made up statements during private trade discussions with Mr Trudeau even though he didn\u0027t have the facts in front of him.And on Tuesday, Mr Trump said during a rally that he was going to make Mexico pay for a wall along the US border. That immediately elicited a terse response from Mexico\u0027s leader.“President @realDonaldTrump: NO. Mexico will NEVER pay for a wall. Not now, not ever. Sincerely, Mexico (all of us),” he tweeted on Tuesday.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Human rights organisations criticised the move.\u0026nbspMPs\u0026nbspin the Scandinavian country approved the bill after it was introduced by the\u0026nbspcentre-right\u0026nbspgoverning coalition, by a majority of 75 to 30, although 74 abstained.\u0026nbspThe government said\u0026nbspthat the new law, which does not ban\u0026nbspheadscarves, turbans or the traditional Jewish skull cap, was not\u0026nbspaimed at any religion.\u0026nbspHowever, many see it as\u0026nbspdirected at the dress worn by some conservative\u0026nbspMuslim\u0026nbspwomen, although full face veils are uncommon in the Scandinavian country.\u0026nbsp Gauri van Gulik, Amnesty International’s Europe director, criticised the move.\u0026nbsp“All women should be free to dress as they please and to wear clothing that expresses their identity or beliefs,” she said. “This ban will have a particularly negative impact on Muslim women who choose to wear the niqab or burqa.\u0026nbsp“Whilst some specific restrictions on the wearing of full-face veils for the purposes of public safety may be legitimate, this blanket ban is neither necessary nor proportionate and violates the rights to freedom of expression and religion.“If the intention of this law was to protect women’s rights, it fails abjectly. Instead, the law criminalises women for their choice of clothing and in so doing flies in the face of those freedoms Denmark purports to uphold.”However, Denmark’s justice minister Soren Pape Poulsen said that it will be up to police officers to use their “common sense” when they see people violating the law after it goes into force on 1 August. The law allows people to cover their face when there is a “recognisable purpose” such as in the event of cold weather or in compliance with other legal requirements, such as wearing motorcycle helmets.First-time offenders risk a fine of 1,000 kroner (£118). Repeat offences could trigger fines of up to 10,000\u0026nbspkroner or a jail sentence of up to six months. Anyone forcing a person to wear garments covering the face by using force or threats can be fined or face up to two years in prison. Austria, France and Belgium have similar laws. The justice ministry and the police now will write more detailed guidelines. Those “should be very concrete” as to what will be banned, said Bjoern Elmquist, a lawyer who has been a prominent opponent of the law. Louise\u0026nbspHolck\u0026nbspof the\u0026nbspDanish Institute for Human Rights told\u0026nbspTV2\u0026nbsptelevision\u0026nbspthat if the law only focused on\u0026nbspwomen in the niqab or burqa\u0026nbspit could amount to discrimination against a minority group and hence be against the law.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

But most people won’t actually be able to take advantage of the service.The high quality streams will be limited to a small number of people. They will be allocated on a first-come, first-served basis, and only to people with the right TVs.“We are pleased to announce a new cutting-edge trial which will see all 29 of BBC One’s World Cup matches available in Ultra HD and High Dynamic Range (HDR) on BBC iPlayer – but fans should grab their seats early as there is a limited number of spaces available (tens of thousands) for each game,” the BBC’s website reads.As well as the fact that the number will be kept to a minimum by only allowing a limited number of streams, a range of popular video players are not being given access to the high quality video. A full list of compatible devices can be found on the BBC’s website.The move will ensure that the bandwidth used by the ultra high definition streams – which are viewed over the internet\u0026nbsp– will be limited. 4K streams use up considerably more data than high definition ones, making them more intensive for the BBC and other broadcasters to support.The BBC’s Ultra HD offering is still being tested out – having so far been rolled out on lower profile broadcasts – and so restricting the data needed by limiting the number of people able to watch them will ensure that the streams can run properly.“The combination of the BBC and the World Cup can drive massive audiences, and right now there is limited bandwidth available to deliver live Ultra HD content to such large audiences over the open internet,” a BBC spokesperson said. “We’re making our Ultra HD trial available to as many people as possible within those limitations, while testing our systems on the largest scale yet.“The experience and data we gather from performing these trials will help us to optimise and scale up UHD delivery in the future.”For the same reason, the BBC recommends that anyone using the 4K streams make sure that their TVs or set-top boxes are plugged into the internet rather than connected over WiFi.The World Cup will also be broadcast over a special VR app, which will allow people to watch the game inside a virtual room on a huge, virtual television, the BBC announced.“The BBC has brought major live broadcasting breakthroughs to UK audiences throughout the history of the World Cup,” said\u0026nbspMatthew Postgate, BBC chief\u0026nbsptechnology and product officer.“From the very first tournament on TV in 1954 and England’s finest hour in 1966, to the first colour World Cup in 1970 and full HD in 2006. Now, with these trials we’re giving audiences yet another taste of the future.”In the UK, the rights to broadcast games are split between ITV and the BBC and the final is shown on both channels. All 33 of the BBC’s matches will be part of the 4K and VR trials.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

The Government has no credible policy and the whole world knows it.“Whitehall’s real preparations are for the continuation of EU law and the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice.“The State has made no preparations to leave and plans to make no preparations to leave — even after leaving.”Barring a last-minute change of tune, Mrs May is walking into an ambush which will sour relations with Brussels and condemn Britain to a generation of rancorous civil discord.A botched deal will be dressed up in Brussels newspeak as a triumph for all sides.In fact it will almost certainly betray 17.4million British people who explicitly voted OUT in the biggest democratic mandate ever seen in this country.Voters who hoped for clear and unequivocal freedom from EU laws and regulations are unlikely to stay silent for long.They expected Brexit ministers to carve out a prosperous and independent future.Instead, they have watched defeated Remainers mount a ruthless and successful counter-attack.From a position of strength as a major trading nation, Britain has surrendered on all fronts, caved in to Brussels bullies — and handed over a £39BILLION ransom for the privilege.We are likely to remain bound by a version of the EU customs union, the single market and the European Court of Justice for years to come. Meanwhile, mass immigration runs out of control.Perhaps to his own amazement, EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier has succeeded in his aim to make Britain worse off outside.We will not be allowed to flourish as a free-trading sovereign state.Nobody can be more vividly aware of this than Mrs May as she prepares for her looming summit.Yet she has only herself to blame, starting with the catastrophic snap election which destroyed her Commons majority.She needlessly coughed up that £39billion with nothing in return from Brussels and allowed herself to be derailed by phantom threats of IRA violence if the UK establishes any sort of border with Ireland.The sad truth is that Mrs May is not up to the job as Prime Minister at a momentous point in our history.In an age when words really count, we are lumbered with an ultra-cautious leader who cannot think on her feet or speak without notes.At a time when we should all be doing our best to make Brexit work, we have a Prime Minister who would much prefer to Remain.For the moment, Leavers such as Iain Duncan Smith and Jacob Rees-Mogg are pledging their loyalty.But a bad deal would provoke die-hard Tories into the only honourable action they feel they can take — and put her premiership on the line.They already have the votes needed to trigger a leadership contest.They will not support key Commons votes to dilute Brexit, risking Government defeat by an unholy alliance of Labour opportunists, Lib Dem and SNP wreckers and Tory Remainers.A disastrous combination of weak leadership, cack-handed communication and dismal diplomacy has plunged Britain into a needless constitutional crisis.It says something about Mrs May’s position as leader that her strongest card is the prospect of yet another general election — the third in three years.And the nightmare of political throwback Jeremy Corbyn storming the barricades and leading his Marxist extremists to power.[boxout featured-image=6392734]AS PM, Tony Blair insisted 50 per cent of school leavers must go to university.The result was grade inflation across the board and “Ology” graduates struggling to find a decent job.Now his sensible son Euan, 34, is arguing for tailor-made apprenticeships, giving kids a chance to earn while they learn.His views coincide with new Tory policy – T-levels, technical and trade qualifications which fit pupils to the work they want.They can range from plumbers and computer wizards to City bankers.Many will be driving their own car and buying a home by the time pals leave university with mountains of debt.It is the way forward in skill-hungry Britain.[/boxout] Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Some is also done to shut down anything other than the argument that says “It needs more money”, while other bits are there just because TV executives have noticed it’s the NHS’s 70th birthday and think they’d better do something to look caring.Like, for instance, ITV’s A\u0026ampE Live, “from the frontline”, at Leeds General Infirmary.A self-defeating three-day experiment which, on the one hand gleefully promised us all sorts of carnage: “It’s hotting up here.” But on the other was swift to assure viewers they were operating on a time delay in case patients refused filming consent, thereby ruling out most of the drunks and any possibility of a bloke being wheeled into reception with a Hoover attachment up his fundament.I’d avoid describing LGI as the most sedate-looking A\u0026ampE unit in Britain, though, because ITV had attempted to redress the noise balance by having it hosted by human Tannoy system Davina McCall, who lost little time in telling us: “I had to get hypnotised to do this job, can you believe it?”Yeah, I can, actually.“I saw my granny sever her toes with a lawnmower,” she went on to explain, “and it made me squeamish.” If you thought for one minute, however, it sedated her, you either overestimate the powers of hypnotherapy or you haven’t been watching Davina’s career closely enough.The woman was in full Street Mates mode from the moment she clocked a young couple in the waiting room. “Are you going out?” said Davina, without so much as checking their vital signs.“We were on a date . . . our first date.”“AH-MAY-ZING! THIS IS GREAT. And it’s something to talk about when you have children . . . ”Silence. “I took it too far, didn’t I?”You did rather, Davina, though I get the squeamishness thing and actually flinched when she then told us: “A 23-year-old man, Tommy, is being brought in by ambulance after being rear-ended at high speed.”You’d hope Tommy got some of Davina’s meds as well, ’cos a weird thing happened on Wednesday and Thursday’s broadcasts.She actually calmed down a bit. To the extent I finally noticed the staff, who turned out to be naturals in front of a camera, which really shouldn’t have been a surprise given TV’s insatiable appetite for this sort of show.Among other recent TV offerings, we have: A\u0026ampE Live, A\u0026ampE, 24 Hours In A\u0026ampE, The Real A\u0026ampE, Sun Sea \u0026amp A\u0026ampE, A\u0026ampE On The Road.And that’s just the ones with A\u0026ampE in the title.There’s a whole load more with the words ambulance and emergency, which you may also have watched but entirely forgotten.Why?’Cos an actual visit to A\u0026ampE is a real, vivid, frightening, frustrating, disturbing, impressive and unforgettable experience that can leave you weeping with gratitude for the NHS.TV, by contrast, generally offers a dumb, censored, antiseptic, grovelling, uncritical, cult-like, agenda-ridden version, with this sort of dialogue.Davina (to ambulanceman Gavin): “How important is it you get there early.”“The sooner we get there the more chance the patient has of surviving.”“And that’s so important, isn’t it?”Thank you, live TV. Where would we all be without you?Good Morning Britain’s Piers Morgan: “I leave a lot of phones in my bedroom, ’cos you never know when you’re going to get THE call when your manager says, ‘Got it.

Column returns in a fortnight.BBC1’s version of the Jeremy Thorpe murder plot saga, A Very English Scandal, is nuts.It’s very entertaining as well, but it is nuts, with CGI badgers running around in episode one and a couple of Yucca plants shoved in some sand dunes to try and make us think North Devon is actually “California,” on Sunday night.The main issue, however, is that A Very English Scandal can’t quite decide if it’s a comedy or not. So it’s deadly serious whenever Thorpe’s commenting on Europe, immigration or gay rights, but pure Carry On when his ex-lover Norman Scott starts having it off in a caravan with the bird out of Torchwood.It’s more than saved, though, by the incredible storyline and performances of the brilliant Alex Jennings, who totally vanishes into the part of Thorpe’s sidekick, Peter Bessell, Patricia Hodge as Ursula Thorpe, and Ben Whishaw, who’s got the most difficult role of all as the insanely irritating Scott, but does it well enough to make me wish he’d been shot on Exmoor rather than his dog.In that sort of company, of course, it was also incredibly brave to give the lead role to Hugh Grant, who never quite convinces me he’s anyone other than Hugh Grant, yet I will say this for a performance that stands out from anything he’s ever done before.He’s wearing a hat.Courtesy of ITV’s Lee Dixon on England’s World Cup goalies: “You’d be down to one goalkeeper and a nervous one.”“You’d be down to one goalkeeper and a Neville Swan.”INCIDENTALLY, who claimed the following, last week: “People always get excited about cockchafers.”EASIEST gig on the soaps?EastEnders’ Big Mo, who’s just set herself up as Walford’s resident psychic and fortune teller.A job with my name on it, frankly, as I wouldn’t need a crystal ball, money or much encouragement to tell the locals: “This old craphole will be locked in an ever more depressing cycle of baby abductions, love triangles, disrupted weddings, head transplants and escaped animals from now until kingdom come. Get the hell out, while you still can.”Walford CID might also want to put me on a profiling retainer as well, given they’re the only people who haven’t noticed that every single street crime, including – surprise, surprise – last week’s stabbings of Keanu and Shakil, has been carried out by a white, working-class male with a bad stage school Cockney accent.I guess Big Mo’s probably safe in the position for the moment, though, as she seems to have foretold the re-appearance of Shane “Alfie” Richie in The Vic, earlier this month.However, at roughly the same time, she also predicted: “Jean (Slater) will get a job with teeth.”This Morning, “Earth Angel” Sarah Rebecca Vine: “I am a spiritual life coach and healer and, I feel, a messenger to wake people up.” Zzzzz.And First Time Mum, Ferne McCann: “The hypnotherapist session definitely calmed me down and emptied my mind.” Of what?The Chase, Bradley Walsh: “On the flag of South Sudan blue represents the waters of what major river?”Bradley Walsh: “What UK Prime Minister read geography at an all- women’s Oxford college?”Jackie: “Tony Blair.”Bradley Walsh: “In a hospital, the H\u0026ampN unit refers to the head and what other part of the body?”Jackie: “Nose.”And Ben Shephard: “In Australia and New Zealand a ‘long black’ is a variety of which hot beverage?”Teri: “Beer.”The BBC’s Friday night schedule offering us two left-wing panel shows (HIGNFY and New World Order), featuring ’s Mona Chalabi, when one was far too many.The A\u0026ampE Live caption writer responsible for the spelling of “interupt”. Channel 4’s Goggleboxers and all the other people who seem to think The Handmaid’s Tale is a documentary.Car Share lacking either the brains or the balls to make a preview copy of its finale available.And Good Morning Britain without that oaf Piers Morgan, on Thursdays and Fridays. An experience which really is as pointless and empty as Tight Fit performing The Lion Sleeps Tonight, without Steve Grant on lead vocals.Brilliant performances from Alex Jennings, Patricia Hodge and Ben Whishaw, as Peter Bessell, Jeremy Thorpe’s mum and Norman Scott, on A Very English Scandal.BBC1’s Motty: The Man Behind The Sheepskin, revealing an even odder character than I was expecting. Dave’s How The Young Ones Changed Comedy (not entirely for the better).And The Chase offering up my favourite quiz show moment of the year, so far.Bradley Walsh: “Which astrologer published a colouring book called The Art Of Astrology?” John: “Galileo.” Bradley: “Russell Grant.”Gareth Bale: “I haven’t seen the goal back yet, I’ve only watched it again now.”Steve McManaman: “It’s a surprise that Bale’s not playing, but it’s not a surprise that he’s on the bench.”And Rio Ferdinand: “Win the Champions League and it’s chance to be forever mortalised.”(Compiled by Graham Wray)THIS week’s winner is Britain’s Best Home Cook’s Mary Berry and Gary Oldman as Dracula.

In the US — officially the world’s fattest nation — that figure is 18.5 per cent.UK stores now stock plus-size clothes for under-tens, with H\u0026ampM becoming the latest chain to sell a “generous fit” range for kids as young as eight.Obesity is predicted to double in the next 25 years — while tens of millions of pounds of taxpayers’ money has already been thrown at the problem.But a simple — and cheap — solution can already be found on the playgrounds and fields of around 6,000 primary schools where more than a million children take part in the Daily Mile.The exercise regime means that at some point in every school day, pupils leave their classroom, still in their uniform, to run, jog or walk for up to 15 minutes.Youngsters can set their own pace and talk to their friends while they go round.Most of the children complete a mile or more in the quarter of an hour.Teachers all over the country have reported how pupils return to the classroom invigorated and eager to learn after doing what is being called “jography”.Last week, Prime Minister Theresa May praised the Daily Mile and called on schools to take it up — but stopped short of saying it should be compulsory.Now, for all our kids’ sakes, The Sun is calling on Education Secretary Damian Hinds to make the Daily Mile mandatory in all primary schools.The idea began six years ago and has been growing steadily. But only now have scientists been able to prove it really does have an effect.Over the course of an academic year, a team of experts from Stirling University compared nearly 400 children, aged four to 11, from two primaries, with one group doing the Daily Mile and the other not.The Daily Mile kids were put through a series of tests to calculate whether they became fitter and whether they lost fat.IF you are a teacher or parent who would like to get your school doing the Daily Mile check out thedailymile or go to @_thedailymile or on Facebook. There is lots of information showing how easy it is to incorporate the Daily Mile and to support schools who want to get involved. You can also register your interest.The findings, which have just been released, show how they lost an average of four per cent body fat.They were also fitter and more active during the day, while time spent sitting around dropped by an average 18 per cent.Another investigation, conducted at an inner city school in London, found Daily Mile youngsters did much better than expected in SATS tests.Other tests have shown how children also feel less stressed and more confident.Retired head Elaine Wyllie, 62, came up with the idea of the Daily Mile almost by accident when pupils at her St Ninians school in Stirling wanted to get fitter.After just six weeks, not one of the 57 children in her first year was overweight.But to persuade the Government to introduce the Daily Mile into all Britain’s 20,000 primary schools, scientific proof was needed.After reading the latest results from Stirling University, Elaine said: “I knew this research would be the game-changer which would prove what I had believed all along — that the Daily Mile makes children fitter, happier, more active and a healthier weight.“I am delighted and relieved that we now have objective proof.”But education chiefs appear reluctant to make the Daily Mile compulsory for fear of upsetting head teachers, who might see it as an extra burden on their staff.However, Jim Cleaver, head of Westgate Community Primary in Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, says: “The beauty of the Daily Mile is its simplicity.“It takes 15 minutes out of the day and for staff it is as easy as opening a door.”At Woodlands, a school for children with special needs in Leatherhead, Surrey, lead nurse Emma Packham has seen children lose weight as a result of the Daily Mile.She says: “We had five children who were clinically obese whose weight was just going up, up, up.“Since we started 18 months ago nobody in the target group has gained weight. Some have lost weight.No other factors in their lives have changed.”It is not just the children’s weight that is changing. Teachers are reporting that behaviour in classroom is improving. And many parents say their children sleep better at night.Former MP Andy Burnham, now the Mayor of Manchester, is a fan and wants his city to become the first where every primary school does the Daily Mile.Unlike some schemes, there would be no costs with introducing it into schools. All associated expenses are currently being paid by Britain’s richest man, Jim Ratcliffe, who has also used some of his £21billion fortune to advertise it during Ant \u0026amp Dec’s Saturday Night Takeaway.Sports commentator Jake Humphrey, who runs the Daily Mile with youngsters at Trowse primary school in Norwich, says: “I honestly don’t think parents are aware of how unfit their children are. Why weren’t we doing this 20 years ago?”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

That readiness is absolutely vital to securing a genuinely beneficial deal.We know that Civil Service mandarins want Brexit to fail.They’ve set up roadblock after roadblock in the hope we’ll be forced to cave in and change our minds on the whole exercise.That cannot be allowed to happen.Jacob Rees-Mogg is spot on when he says the PM needs to show some iron, and that Brussels won’t get the money they desperately need unless they play ball with Britain. It’s the only way we’ll focus minds across Europe.Without a plan, we’re only planning to fail.THE calls for abortion reform in Northern Ireland are entirely understandable.It looks increasingly odd that its laws are so out of step with both the rest of the UK and now with their southern neighbour.But Ulster’s abortion laws have always been a matter for the people of Northern Ireland.For devolution to work, Westminster needs to acknowledge the right of the Scots, the Welsh and the Northern Irish to set their own rules.It’s not a pick ’n’ mix depending whether or not MPs agree with them.And the way some Labour politicians have suddenly become dedicated activists to drive a wedge between the PM and the DUP is shameless.The Government’s priority in Northern Ireland must be to restore a functioning Assembly, which has been missing for more than 500 days. Then the province can have an abortion debate.But it is for Ulster, not Westminster, to make any decisions.KYLIE Minogue has had us Spinning Around for decades. We wish the Red Blooded Woman a very happy birthday.If only we could all be So Lucky to look that good at 50.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Some Italians told me unelected bankers and institutions in Brussels were being put first. They have a point.The EU and Italy’s President now need to tread incredibly carefully. The 5-Star Movement is already mobilising voters through street protests. The League party is calling on them to vent their frustration at the banks and financial markets.Yesterday, one EU official suggested the financial markets would teach Italian voters a lesson by withdrawing investment from the country. This will only pour gasoline on the populist fire.So, what happens next? The populists will almost certainly sweep to another victory at fresh elections, possibly triggering a new financial crisis and creating another major headache in Brussels. One of the parties might also propose a referendum on Italy’s euro membership.It seems very likely this chaos is not going anywhere anytime soon and the EU will soon be presented with yet another crisis.The events in Italy have clear implications for the Brexit debate. The EU has struggled to make sense of why Leavers opted for Brexit, just as today they are struggling to make sense of the mood in Italy.Many Leavers voted for Brexit because they felt the EU was not able to manage its own affairs, and they will see Italy as further evidence of that.But also many Leavers were anxious that the European Union allows very little room for other political views and they will see that as well in the Italy crisis.While the president was acting in the remit of his constitutional office, the problem is that many Italians and Europeans feel this is an example of Europe’s inability to accept any opposition to the euro single currency.It seems difficult to see how this crisis can be resolved without a more openly Eurosceptic Italy — and without a populist government at the head of the eurozone’s third largest economy.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Its lavishly-funded Remainer stooges aim to do the same with Brexit.How does Brussels think this all ends?If Brexit is negated there will be a collapse of faith in democracy and probable civil unrest beyond anyone’s experience.In Italy, eurosceptic parties will now have an even bigger mandate. What then?The EU meets any dissent not with wise compromise but with brute force.It is the enemy of democracy. Its contempt for voters will prove its epitaph.WE like Theresa May’s tougher tone towards the EU.

It will mean that I wont be able to go to school, go to work or go out with my family.But I wont take my niqab off so I have to find another solution.Pape Poulsen, who leads the conservative party in the coalition, has described keeping ones face hidden in public as incompatible with the values of Danish society or respect for the community.But Ibn Hssain rejected suggestions that wearing the veil symbolised the rejection of Danish values or oppression of women.She said: It has nothing to do with integration or that were oppressed. For me it is a war on Islam.Human rights group Amnesty International called the ban a discriminatory violation of womens rights ... All women should be free to dress as they please and to wear clothing that expresses their identity or beliefs.Ibn Hssain, who says she has been yelled at and spat at in public for wearing the niqab, will stay for now in Denmark despite the ban.She said: If I leave Denmark the politicians win.

It is remarkable in its length.Clearly it is something that dives in and out of the surface with water splashes and reflections.But wider interest wasnt sparked until 1933 after a road was built along the loch, making it far less isolated.Within months, several people came forward claiming to have seen a giant beast lurking near the water.Theories reached fever pitch a year later when the infamous surgeon’s photograph - probably the best-known image of the creature - emerged.But in 1975 the famous shot was exposed as a hoax, made using a toy submarine with a carved monster’s head.There have now been over 1,000 reported sightings.In 2017, the story of the Loch Ness monster topped a poll of the UKs greatest unexplained mysteries.The object would be no larger than 20ft.”It follows nine sightings of the elusive beast in the last year alone.Just last week, eight-year-old Laria Annand and her gran Marie claimed to have caught Nessie on camera while going for a paddle in the iconic lake."},{"url":null,"title":"inverness primary school ends boy girl only races sports day","story":"Students at Merkinch Primary School in Inverness can now only compete in mixed races.The decision comes just weeks after new guidelines to improve inclusion for pupils who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender or intersex was sent out by the Highland Council.But some parents have raised concerns children could face more bullying by the move - while others said it was a clumsy attempt at addressing the matter of inclusion.Mother-of-two Melissa Watson said: “It was a big talking point for me and my mates.There was a race between five girls and one boy and he came last and all the boys were like ‘Ha ha,, you got beaten by a girl’.In my eyes this opens the kids up to being bullied.“Why doesn’t the school just let the LGBTI children race with the sex that they feel they belong to, instead of making all the kids run mixed races?”Another mum, who did not want to be named, added: The world has gone mad.

That’s not how the world is set up at the moment.”Morgan Cowley, former chairman of the Highland LGBTI forum which campaigns for the fair treatment of all LGBTI people, said: “I think introducing non-gender specific sports days into schools is rather a clumsy way of trying to address the crux of the matter within our schools, which is promoting respect for one another and celebrating difference.“There are undoubtedly more astute ways of doing this and what Merkinch Primary is doing seems to be increasing conflict rather than reducing it.“Trying to promote nongender specific sports into schools at this point in our society’s development, when the whole world celebrates and enjoys gender-specific sport at the highest levels, seems a hard sell.”"},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000005058965-e1527844664660.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"netflix menu kate middleton escorts film menu","story":"The gaffe saw the Duchess of Cambridge kissing Prince William on the top half but the bottom half of the image was spliced with a tattooed girl in racy stockings and lace underwear.The snap, posted on Reddit by Big_Miss_Steak_, was meant to advertise documentary The Royals, which features interviews with those close to the family.But it somehow got mixed up with racy film Escorts, which is billed as provocative and steamy by Netflix.The shows synopsis reads: Get an unflinching look at two high-priced call girls who rely on the internet to find clients, and the effects of their lifestyle on their families.The shot was posted on Reddit with the caption: The risqué side of Netflix.

Trying to figure out the best way of making use of all the additional family time? We hear you! Whether it’s camping or picnics in the park, there are plenty of activities you can enjoy with little ones that cost next to nothing. Here are some ideas that we think they’ll love – and some tips on how to really make the most of your half term. Get close to nature    One really great way to engage with your kids for a couple of days is to go foraging and cooking in the wild. Some things you can pick are perfectly safe - like apples, blackberries, certain plants and even some flowers. But for the main course you might want to bring along some supermarket staples! Always be careful when using stoves. You can use them anywhere and The Woodland Trust prefer campers to use them over a campfire as they\u0027re much safer.  Fire up this camping stove for a fantastic grill - be it on the road or in your back garden for an at home adventure - which is just \u0026pound8 (save \u0026pound12) at Halfords. Mix up cooking things you\u0027ve brought from home with bits you\u0027ve sourced locally for a great combo. And don’t forget to pack the Halfords Rainbow Plastic Plates which are now half price at just \u0026pound3 (was \u0026pound3) to dine out in style.      If you’ve got a couple of days then you could take everyone out for a long cycle ride, broken up by either nights in a hotel or camping. If you don’t want to stay the night there are plenty of UK cycle routes – check Sustrans for those in your area – which you can drive to during the day.  Check out Halfords’ options for bike racks if you need to load your bikes onto a car – the Thule ProRide 591 is \u0026pound85 (save \u0026pound25), but also on buy one, get one free. That\u0027s ideal if you\u0027re looking to take a couple of bikes with you on your adventure as each rack holds one bike. And right now at Halfords you can get free fitting too.  If you have very little children then it’s also worth considering an alternative way to transport them. Halfords has a range of bike seats for juniors as well as an amazing Double Buggy Bike Trailer for \u0026pound110 (save \u0026pound110, 50lbs weight limit per child, not for use with a child under 12 months old).  Little kids have an absolute blast being towed around, and you’ll hear a lot of delighted giggles and yells when you’re doing it. Make sure you also get bike helmets that fit securely for both you and your little ones. Halfords has a wide range to choose from and can help you to find the right fit. And before heading off why not get a Free Bike Check from Halfords? You can either book online or just pop in to your local store for a 32-point check. Everything from the frame to the saddle and the wheels to the gears are given a thorough check by an in-store expert. Getting the check means you can relax, knowing your bike is in great shape for your trip. Let the games begin      There are all sorts of major sporting events on this year, so why not hold some of your own competitions. You can then arrange lots of little events for your wannabe stars of tomorrow, from football and running to swimming and cycling. If you’re in need of a new bike for your young ones Halfords has a great range, including the Apollo Gridlok kids mountain bike, which has been reduced by \u0026pound31 and is now only \u0026pound124. There is 20 per cent off a whole range of kids bikes too, so there’s bound to be something that suits your little athletes.  If the kids have bikes but you don’t, perhaps it’s time to take advantage of 20 per cent off a range of adult bikes – the Carrera Vengeance is now \u0026pound264 (save \u0026pound66). Make exercise rewarding If you’ve got older kids that love nothing more than heading out on two wheels to explore with friends, then there are lots of options. Come up with a number of miles to cycle in a day, week or even month and get them a cycle computer from Halfords (starting at \u0026pound8.50). You can fit it together then dispatch them on chores! For every mile you could reward them, either with extra pocket money or just their choice of movie to watch with you later.

The government has considered proposing a 10-mile (16-km)- wide trade buffer zone along the border for local traders like dairy farmers after the UK leaves the bloc. The plan is one of several ideas being discussed and may not be proposed to the EU, according to a government official. But the plans are likely to be given short shrift by the DUP who are propping up the Tory government as they oppose any plan that sees the province operate under different regulations to the rest of the United Kingdom. Both the UK and the EU are committed to keeping a free flow of people and goods over the Irish border without returning to checkpoints - symbols of the three decades of violence in the region largely ended by the Good Friday Agreement of 1998.  However, finding a practical solution for any customs checks needed after Brexit is proving elusive. The government is considering a special economic zone that will mean traders, who constitute 90 percent of cross-border traffic, can operate under the same rules as those south of the border, according to The Sun newspaper, which first reported that the idea was being considered. May previously pledged to take the UK out of the EU customs union by considering two options. One would be max fac in which the UK and EU would be entirely separate customs areas but would try to use technology to reduce friction and costs at the border.  The other option being considered is a customs partnership, according to which the UK would collect tariffs on the EU\u0027s behalf with no requirement of declarations of goods crossing the border. EU officials are warning time is running out to seal a Brexit deal this year because there has been not enough progress in negotiations. And they blame Theresa May for failing to come up with a solution to the Irish border problem. They have already rejected both of the Tories\u0027 solutions - and there is no sign they would accept the latest proposal.

Right-winger Mariano Rajoy was dramatically toppled today and replaced by socialist Pedro Sanchez. Rajoy was forced out after seven years in power following a wave of financial scandals involving his Popular Party. He announced his departure ahead of a vote of confidence in the Spanish Parliament. The motion, called by Sanchez, won 180 votes for, 169 against and 1 abstention.  Sanchez will become the seventh prime minister since the Franco dictatorship when he takes office.  He suggested on Thursday he would try to govern until the scheduled end of the parliamentary term in mid-2020.  But it is unclear how long his administration, with only 84 Socialist deputies in the 350-member legislative assembly, can last. He has already committed to respecting a budget passed by Rajoy, and the fragmented parliament means Sanchez will find it hard to row back on structural reforms passed by his predecessor, including new labour laws and cuts in healthcare and education. Leftist Podemos, which will offer parliamentary support to Sanchez\u0027s government, is unlikely to gain big influence over the new Prime Minister, who is keen to differentiate his Socialist party from its anti-austerity ally and win back centrist voters.

On the very day Mrs May was firmly pointing a finger at Vladimir Putin over the Salisbury murder bid, a former Kremlin aide’s wife ploughed the cash into the Tory party’s coffers.

Lubov’s husband Vladimir is Putin’s former deputy finance minister. Lib Dem leader Sir Vince Cable branded the payment “sheer hypocrisy”. He said: “The Conservatives should have returned the money straightaway.  The very least they can do is return this now.”  Labour Party chairman Ian Lavery added: “It smacks of hypocrisy for Theresa May to accept tens of \u0026shythousands of pounds from a donor with links to Putin’s regime on the same day she denounced the Kremlin over the Salisbury attack. “The Tories need to come clean with the public about what checks they have made on the wealth amassed by their super-rich donors.” It comes after we revealed two Tory peers – Lord Hague and Lord Barker – are both earning thousands of pounds a year from firms slammed by MPs over links to the Kremlin.  Lubov’s gift was on March 12, according to official records seen by the Mirror.

Martha Dolak was trapped after her controlling partner Michael Goodwin locked the doors to his flat before beating her to a pulp - causing her to suffer facial and skull fractures as well as permanent damage to her optical nerves. But in a clever escape bid, the 31-year-old snapped a selfie of her horrific injuries and sent it to a friend, who immediately alerted Martha\u0027s parents and the police. The brutal attack, which took place in October last year whilst Michael\u0027s two young children were in the next room, escalated after the manipulative builder checked through Martha\u0027s phone.   Multiple casualties after car hits crowd in Greater Manchester hit and run as \u0027people flung everywhere\u0027  He saw a text from a friend she\u0027d confided in about his controlling ways, urging her to leave him. She said: When Michael saw the message he was livid. I was terrified so I tried to get my things and go. He told me I couldn\u0027t leave and both the doors were locked. I went to the window to see if I could jump out safely - but suddenly I felt an excruciating pain and remember nothing else.  I woke up in bed. I knew he must have put me there but I couldn\u0027t move. I couldn\u0027t feel my legs and I had the most painful headache, I couldn\u0027t lift my head up at all. My eye wouldn\u0027t open and my face felt thick with dry blood. I took a selfie - I wanted to see what was wrong with me. I was horrified at what I saw. I sent the picture to my friend so that she would get help. It was only afterwards that I realised he had kicked me in the head.  My friend told my parents straight away, and my dad, who doesn\u0027t speak very good English, went to the police station with the text. The police went to an old address for Michael first and spoke to his sister.  She told the police I had fallen down the stairs, and then came to Michael\u0027s  new house to warn him they were on to him.  After she came they reluctantly decided to take me to the hospital. I could have died if I was left without medical attention for much longer.  After the attack Martha left Michael, 30, for good and took out an injunction against him. Martha, from London and who had been in a relationship for 18 months, added: After the attack people would say to me he\u0027s an animal - but he is not, he is a monster. I want to raise awareness and show to people that no matter how educated you are no matter how strong you look it can happen to anyone. I never expected this to happen to someone like me, I thought because I\u0027m smart, have a degree, am independent and see myself as a feminist that I would be able to see it happening.  But domestic violence does not choose someone based on those things. It\u0027s been the most horrific experience of my life but it made me stronger. I am not looking for sympathy, I just want to raise awareness of him so that other girls know what he is like. I have left Michael for good and I will never get into a another violent relationship ever again.

However he has now been \u0027unmasked\u0027 as Thomas Tommy Muscatello - an Italian-American, who grew up in New York. But the 38-year-old has slammed the claims in the Wall Street Journal, saying his interview with them omitted truths. In an interview on the day of the nuptials he told a Norwegian broadcaster that the former Suits actress should be aware that marriage in the royal family must be about keeping integrity, keeping formality and making sure that the traditions and heritage that we have as British people remain at the forefront.  And as the couple approached St. George’s Chapel on May 19, he tells France’s TF1 television in a posh British accent: “We’re making world history.”  Mace-Archer-Mills Tommy told the Wall Street Journal he loved England as a boy and had an innate feeling for British pronunciation growing up, picking up his accent in a variety of ways, primarily from visiting the UK.  His transformation into Mr Mace-Archer-Mills, he said, came from a growing realisation that he identified more as British than American. He said growing up he would end conversations by saying God save the Queen - despite living in Bolton Landing, New York. “I found where I’m supposed to be and who I am supposed to be, he said.  However, he declined to talk about his nationality, only saying that his surname was created by putting together names of friends and distant relations. And he said he had an agreement with two unrelated, elderly British people to call them his grandfather and grandmother.

Dashcam video captured the terrifying incident as it unfolded in a busy south London street. Dramatic footage shows a a blue Volkswagen pulling out from a queue of traffic and appearing to almost hit the cyclist.  The Volkswagen hits an oncoming vehicle and the cyclist pulls out a massive blade, using it to try and smash the car\u0027s front window, the Croydon Advertiser reports.  The driver runs off and ditches his car after the cyclist tries to open a locked door.  Police were alerted and are now trying to trace the man who was wielding the knife. Stunned rush hour commuters looked on as the cyclist attacked the car in London Road in Croydon at about 5pm on Wednesday. In the footage a man on a bicycle can be seen to stop next to the stationary Volkswagen.  The car pulls out from a queue of traffic and appears to almost hit the cyclist, forcing him to jump out of the way. The Volkswagen then hits an oncoming vehicle. The man on the bicycle then pulls out a huge knife and uses it to try and smash the driver\u0027s front window.  He then attempts to get into the vehicle via one of the passenger doors, but finds it is locked. The knife-wielding man then makes his way over to the other side of the car. At this point the driver gets out of the car and makes off on foot.  A Met Police spokeswoman said no one has been arrested in connection with the incident. The spokeswoman said: “We were called at around 5pm to London Road, in Croydon, after someone approached a vehicle brandishing a weapon. “With that in mind, the driver of the car has collided with another vehicle.

Natalie and William Goodacre, both 30, are taking their two daughters, aged seven and eight, on a incredible adventure around the globe in order to give them an education like no other.  The couple don\u0027t follow a curriculum while teaching their children, instead basing it on whatever piques their daughters\u0027 interests at the time, reports LincolnshireLive .  But they now plan to take the unusual step of taking their children travelling and plan to visit 20 countries across five continents from January of next year.  Speaking about the decision on their website, the couple said: “We are tired of living to work, we are tired of the routine, and we are tired of earning enough to survive each month without the time nor money left over to enjoy all that life has to offer. “We feel like we are stuck on a monotonous hamster wheel, growing greyer and wrinklier with each turn. “Growing old and dying doesn’t scare us, as that is inevitable. But the thought of growing old and not living is terrifying. We do not, and we cannot continue to live our lives dreaming of the future we want. We have to make it happen - and that’s just what we are doing. “We want to show our girls the world, and teach them that you can carve out the life you want. We want to show others that you don’t have to settle, and that you don’t have to be millionaires to travel the world.”   Natalie - who runs a home education magazine called Life Without School Collective - and William share their strong beliefs on parenting online and told their followers how they allowed their children to sleep in the bed with them until recently.  They will blog about their travels and hope to never return to a nine-to-five job.

As she ended her life, her partner of 33 years James Howley was at her side. On his return to Britain, 57-year-old James suffered the trauma of being investigated by police for six months on suspicion of assisting a suicide. He said: “The stress and worry was unbearable at times. I was at rock bottom. There were times when I thought I wouldn’t get through it.  “I was exhausted, fearing I would end up in jail – all for doing the right thing by the person I loved most in the world, so that she did not have to die an undignified and agonising death.” College lecturer Helen, who died aged 59, was diagnosed with the lung disorder in 2004. She was forced to retire in 2009 due to ill health, and as the condition began to slowly suffocate her she made the decision to contact Zurich-based society Dignitas in 2015. James, who also was a lecturer, said: “Helen had reached a helpless situation. She was in pain and suffering every day...  “She said, ‘I’m not frightened of dying, but I am frightened about the way I die’. “It became very clear to her there was only going to be one course of action... “She was conscious of doing it on her own, all the research, the contact [with Dignitas], the pay\u0026shyments. “She had my support at every stage but said if I was uncomfortable with going she would consider going alone. “We knew there could be a legal issue but there was no way I was ever going to let [her] be waved off at the door.”  By the time they travelled to Switzerland, Helen’s lung capacity was just 15%. The couple boarded Le Shuttle train in their adapted car carrying Helen’s oxygen tanks and nebulisers keeping her alive. They booked into a hotel to spend their final hours together before going to Dignitas. James said: “It was a serene place... Each doctor and nurse who saw Helen asked her whether she was sure she was making the right decision. “She was fitted with a cannula to administer the life-ending drugs... When the time came we said our goodbyes and she passed away incredibly peacefully.” In a cruel twist, as Helen died in November 2016, thieves ransacked the couple’s home in West Bromwich, West Midlands. Jewellery and Helen’s computer containing cherished photos were taken by the burglars who wrapped their haul in “the last bed sheet she slept in”. A neighbour, not thinking of the implications, told police the couple had gone to Switzerland for Helen – who had lung disorder alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency – to end her life. Within hours of arriving home James was quizzed by officers. He said: “Initially they were fine... The detectives said I had nothing to worry about. I told them I had a letter written by Helen outlining her decision and we had copies of all of her medical notes and letters between her GP and consultant. They just said they would be in touch.”  Two months later he was summoned to be interviewed under caution. Assisting a suicide is punishable by up to 14 years in jail. It took detectives six months to get Helen’s medical records. In June 2017, West Midlands police finally wrote to James to say the case was being dropped. A force spokesman said: “The investigation was delayed because, despite West Midlands police requests for medical records, they were not made [available] until June last year. “That month, it was decided that it did not meet the evidential threshold for prosecution and the investigation was discontinued.” James is now campaigning alongside charity Dignity in Dying to overturn the UK’s ban on assisted dying. He is also backing 68-year-old Noel Conway, a retired college lecturer from Shrewsbury, who has motor neurone disease and whose fight to legalise assisted suicide will be heard at the Court of Appeal this week.  James, who has spoken to others probed by officers, said: “A woman had her door kicked in by police who seized all her possessions when they found her husband went to Dignitas.” He has also been in touch with Julie Smith, 48, also from West Bromwich, whose husband Paul was 57 when he died from cancer at home in September 2016. Despite attending the same GP surgery as Helen, former engineer Paul was denied his medical notes by his doctor who said he could not provide the details for him to send to Dignitas on “ethical and legal grounds”. Julie said: “Paul died in agony and without dignity weeks before Helen. “My last memories of him were of him being frightened, in pain and heartbroken. No one should have to go through that, which is why we need a change in the law.”  The campaign is boosted today by Labour’s deputy leader Tom Watson, MP for West Bromwich East, who is backing a law change after hearing of the plight of the two couples. In 2015, MPs voted against an assisted dying bill by 330 votes to 118. Polls have shown a majority of the public and doctors are in favour of a restricted assisted dying law. It costs on average \u0026pound10,000 for a British patient to go to Dignitas. Sarah Wootton, of Dignity in Dying, said it is wrong the patients’ loved ones can face long police probes. She added: “Their compassionate act is treated as a crime, mementoes are kept as evidence and suspicion hangs over them at a desperately sad time.” Labour\u0027s Deputy Leader Tom Watson backs change - here\u0027s what he says  Everyone deserves a dignified death. That means a lot of different things to a lot of different people. For more and more Brits it has meant a peaceful death at the time of their choosing at Dignitas in Switzerland. Last year one Brit went there every eight days. I recently met two of my constituents whose partners were suffering from terminal illnesses and wished to end their lives at Dignitas. Their experiences couldn’t have been more different. James Howley’s partner Helen was able to get the medical documents she needed to allow her the peaceful death she wanted. But Julie Smith’s husband Paul could not access the medical letter required by the Swiss authorities because his doctor was concerned about falling foul of the law. No doctor should be put in that position: having to choose between granting their dying patient’s wish or facing possible investigation. What makes this story so strange is that Helen and Paul both attended the same GP surgery in West Bromwich. Two people, facing similar challenges at the end of their lives, had totally different deaths – one dignified, one undignified and painful. All because the law regarding helping patients go to Dignitas is a grey area. It’s not often you have such a clear demonstration of a situation that is not working, unfair and devastating for those involved.

Fans have been counting down the minutes and this series is expected to make an even bigger splash than last year. The finale on ITV2 was watched by 3.1 million people but, as this series takes place around the football World Cup, many more could check it out this time. It sounds like an unlikely TV smash, watching singletons looking for love in the sun while you sit in your PJs on the couch, but bosses are pouring money into it. “It is easily our number one show,” controller of ITV digital channels Paul Mortimer says, “so we are investing in it a bit more heavily.” With versions launched in other countries, and fans including Liam Gallagher and Stormzy, here’s what all the fuss is about...  Love Island starts with a 95-minute special at 9pm on Monday on ITV2.   The presenters Caroline Flack will welcome a new generation of islanders and speak to the evicted contestants packing their suitcases and heading home. But Caroline, below, flies in and out of the island throughout the series and arguably the biggest star of the show isn’t even seen on screen. Comedian Iain Stirling is the commentator – think the voice of Big Brother with sass and humour if you’ve not watched before – and he tells us what is going on in each episode with his tongue in his cheek. Iain only sees the footage for each episode at around 2pm and then has just a few hours to write a script filled with trademark gags – and then record it. He’s rightly become a huge star since he started to voice the show. “I’ve tried to see as little as possible,” he said, when asked what he thought of the line-up. “I try and watch as a viewer.”  How it works Every few days the islanders have to couple up, with those not in a couple at risk of being dumped from the island. But it is not just a case of 11 contestants going in and a winning couple at the end – that would be far too simple. Bosses say the path to true love is “littered with surprise bombshell arrivals” meaning by the end of the eight-week run there will have been more than 20 contestants. There will also be unexpected twists and turns like shock evictions, games, dates and bosses meddling. Most of this news is delivered to contestants via text message on one of their phones, often leading to screams of: “I’ve got a text!” And if two people fancy the same person? Bring on battles for affection and lots of gossiping in the garden.  Sex on TV Parents of contestants will want to look away and invest in ear plugs when their precious ones are doing the deed. While the footage of sex is not graphic – most couples go under a duvet - what you hear is often worse. Couples are also given the chance to spend a night in The Hideaway, a private bedroom where they can have some alone time... with the cameras still on. Bosses insist they don’t show anything graphic. “For the record, we don’t show sex on television” said ITV Studios MD Angela Jain. “We show the reaction to sex happening in the villa. “The way we cut it and treat it is part of a normal relationship. We don’t do it for any kind of salacious outcome.”  The contestants A total of 11 contestants will enter the show to begin with, all single and looking to mingle. They will then “couple up”, leaving one person the odd one out. The line-up includes a West End performer, personal trainer Adam Collard, model Hayley Hughes, an A\u0026ampE doctor and the daughter of EastEnders hardman Danny Dyer. The majority of the five women entering have had their hearts broken in the past 12 months and all of them hope they will finally find “the one” on the TV show where they have up to eight weeks to date. More than 100,000 people applied to go on the show this year but many of the contestants are offered up by agents or scouted from their social media profiles.  Bosses started with a “shortlist” of 1,000 and execs saw most of these themselves after casting agents narrowed it down. Love Island 2017 was won by Amber Davies and Kem Cetinay, although the couple split months after winning a \u0026pound50,000 prize. Kem and his co-star Chris Hughes, who came third with Olivia Attwood, went on to land a spin-off series and released a top 20 single, earning big money off the back of the success of last summer’s show.  The villa The villa is less than an hour’s drive from Palma airport in Majorca. It is the same one used last year. Camera runs in the garden are hidden in huts either side of an infinity pool and LEDs which can change colour are all around the garden floor. Executive producer Tom Gould said: “The sun deck is different and has changed in a new re-imagined space and there is a swing seat. “It makes it more attractive for them and it’s better for us to film. The hideaway has had its annual makeover. And the bedroom. “There is an inside-out theme, too. We have grass on the walls inside. And that new design has been picked up in the bedroom and lounge, to tie the whole thing as one. “On the walls and by the beds there are phrases and stuff that have been said before like ‘You OK, Hun?’ and now have a life of their own...” A smoking area has also had to be created after there were complaints last year.  Paul Mortimer says: “Because they’re a very sexy cast in a  sexy environment on a sexy channel then it made smoking look glamorous.  “Ofcom took a view that it was unacceptable. It’s not against the law to smoke cigarettes but this year we have in plan a place for the smoking area to be outside the villa rather than inside.”   The lingo  The show is well known for introducing a range of words into the nation’s vocabulary, including...  Grafting Focusing your attention on the boy/girl you want and working to woo them.   Muggy If you are doing something bad or disrespectful.   Melt Acting soppy.   Pied off When you are shot down or basically rejected.   Stick it on Make a move on a boy/girl.   My type on paper A perfect match.

Rangers right-back James Tavernier has been criticised by animal welfare advocates for pictures of ear-cropped dogs posted on his breeding business\u0027 Instagram page.  The defender recently unveiled his new enterprise, Designer Bullies UK, which breeds beefed-up American bullies for the market, the Daily Record reported .  Some dogs can fetch prices of up to \u0026pound5,000. Despite ear-cropping being banned in the EU and UK, the 26-year-old proudly poses on his social media account with dogs whose ears have been cut off with scalpels to make them fit in with the fierce image of the breed.  Tavernier’s agents were asked if the ear-cropping was done in the UK or abroad but did not respond on Thursday night.   The same day, the Scottish SPCA released a warning that ear-cropping is getting out of control, with “a worrying increase” in the number of the dogs coming into their care after tip-offs. The charity’s chief superintendent Mike Flynn stressed role models like Tavernier who post photos of “mutilated” dogs on social media should think again. He said: “Role models promoting these dogs across social media need to give serious thought about the impact of their actions. Encouraging this illegal mutilation of dogs purely for ‘status’ is incredibly damaging and quite frankly irresponsible.” He added: “Ear-cropping is cruel and unnecessary. It’s a vanity procedure that brings no benefit to the dogs involved and increases the risk of on-going health problems and infections.”   The charity’s red alert came as the Record revealed an explosion in illegal backstreet operations on American bullies, which were originally bred from American pit bulls and Staffordshire terriers.  Procedures are carried out by dog owners in their homes with makeshift scalpel, suture and anaesthetic kits bought on the internet. An undercover special investigations unit chief inspector from the charity said: “Two years ago, we didn’t have a single American bully in our care. “However, we’re now seeing a worrying increase in the number of these dogs seized as a result of our investigations. The recent increase is entirely down to the current trend to own these dogs as a status pet. “In the UK, any surgical procedure carried out for purely aesthetic purposes is illegal. Ear-cropping is one of these procedures. A common misconception is these dogs are bred for fighting but that is not the case.”  Tavernier, who signed for Rangers from Wigan in 2015, has spoken about his dog-breeding business, which is registered in Scotland with his co-director Jake Chapman. The defender claims to have loved dogs since childhood, when he had two family pets called Rio and David after Man United star Rio Ferdinand and Dutch superstar Edgar Davids. He told a press conference, where the issue of mutilated ears was never brought up: “This is something I have started with a friend who I have known since I was three. “We decided to start a business about these dogs and it is going really well at the minute. I’m enjoying it and enjoying being around the dogs. “None of my team-mates have bought one yet but I know Josh (Windass) is looking for a dog so I might try to persuade him.” Tavernier has had to look after up to six dogs at a time as the breeding cycle gets into full throttle. He said: “It runs like any other business. You have to make calls and do the rest. But it’s enjoyable.” "},{"url":null,"title":"i couldnt see hear father","story":"News\u0027I couldn\u0027t see or hear\u0027: Father describes terrifying lightning strike that threw him across his bedroom and burnt down his houseRomford father Paul Robinson, 51, was sitting at his desk when lightning struck through the window and threw him across the room\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByTommy Wathen09:23, 1 JUN 2018NewsThe lightning strike set Paul Robinson\u0027s house on fire (Image: Essex Live)\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA father has described the terrifying moment a bolt of lightning struck his house, setting it on fire and destroying all his possessions. Paul Robinson, 51, said he was sitting at a desk in his bedroom around 1am Sunday when lightning struck his window. The impact was so overwhelming he temporarily lost his eye-sight and hearing.  He told Essex Live : I just heard the loudest sound that I’d ever heard in my life.  “I didn’t know what had happened, but I did realise that I was no longer sitting at my desk and was now over near the doorway to the landing.  I don’t remember if I was blown across or stumbled across but I just don’t remember getting there. “I do remember thinking that I couldn’t see and that I couldn’t hear either. Paul had been renting two rooms at a property in Romford. One of the rooms he occupied was the attic room, which he shared with his 32-year-old wife Anna, while his two-year-old daughter Jasmine’s room was on the first floor. Dozens of fire-fighters rushed to the property and reported the entire second floor loft room and half the first floor of the property were damaged.  Paul, Anna and Jasmine, along with their landlord Dave, had already fled the house. Miraculously, neither Paul or Anna were in their bed, which is immediately adjacent to the window that was struck. Paul was at his desk and Anna was downstairs with their daughter. Paul continued: “I then realised that I hadn’t lost all my senses because I could smell and the first thing I could smell was burning. I didn’t know where it was coming from because I couldn’t see anything. “I staggered around the room wondering what I was going to do, which was when my sight started slowly coming back to me and I noticed a fire at the end of my bed. “My first thought was to go downstairs and check out my daughter’s room. I went to go and put the light on and the light switch had been blown off the wall and it was just hanging by the wiring. “I told my wife to grab the baby and get out the house. I didn’t leave straight away as I wanted to make sure they got out first and then Dave started coming up the stairs as he must have heard me calling for water, but I told him not to bother and to just get out the house. Paul says that he then started to feel light-headed because the house filled up with smoke.  He said: This is when I knew it was time to get myself out quickly. “There was quite a crowd gathered outside, as everyone had been woken by our neighbour’s houses shaking and car alarms were going off. “I also had a collection of snakes that we were trying to breed rarer colour forms. We were then going to sell them as a business to create the deposit for our own home. “They all died in the fire but I wasn’t really thinking of them as if I had, I probably wouldn’t have had time to get out myself. “It is good that your emotions kick in during times like that and you realise what actually means a lot to you because we couldn’t save everything and I’m glad we didn’t. But it is not the only time Paul and Anna have been caught up in a disaster zone. He said: Five years ago when I got married, we were in the Philippines when they had the worst typhoon in recorded history and we survived that. “In England, you live in homes built of bricks that are meant to survive any weather, but you then find that you are wrong.” The only things that Paul and his family now own is his car and some clothes and cuddly toys donated to him by members from his local church and friends.  “I don’t know what our options are now because we don’t have the money to go out and pay a market rent, he said. “The council will not home us because my wife is not a UK national having only been here for four years and needing to have been here for six, so it limits our options. “Our friends were going on holiday the day after the fire and had been let down by a house sitter, so luckily we were able to stay there. They are back on Monday though so I don’t know what we’ll do from there. “We knew that our room was 100 per cent fire damaged, but we held on to the hopes that some our stuff in the room below may have been salvageable but when we went back to the house, everything was 100 per cent water damaged. “The bishop put aside some money for us to go out and replace some clothes that we’d lost and they had passed round a calendar to mark down days to provide meals. “It is strange how a disaster brings the best out of people. Like in journalism and when I was in the police force, you often see the absolute worst in some people that are out there, so it is nice to see the other side of human nature. “We have nice neighbours and friends within our church community that have really helped to restore our faith in humanity.

Aureus School in Didcot, Oxon, has come under fire from parents for its strict stance on its food policy. Packed lunches are banned, and pupils and staff sit down to eat in the canteen together with an emphasis on eating healthily and socially. Students and staff get to choose from eating a hot halal meat meal, hot gluten-free vegetarian meal, a jacket potato, a salad, a pasta pot or a baguette. The school insists that only water may be drunk on site because “hydrated brains learn better”.  Executive headteacher Hannah Wilson told the Oxford Mail : Food education closes the poverty gap and delicious, nutritious should be a universal entitlement.  With all of the headlines about food banks and obesity, we are preparing our students for healthy lifestyles in the future. But a father who spoke on the condition of anonymity said the rules were “draconian”. He added: We are thinking of taking her out of the school - it\u0027s getting silly and more like a dictatorship. Their views are quite extreme. It\u0027s about choice. It\u0027s supposed to be an inclusive school but they are only catering for one particular religion.

Lewis Massie, 20, was giving evidence at the trial of Dean Reynolds, who is accused of killing Michael “Mikey” McLean, 17, at Denholm MacNamee, Aberdeenshire. Lewis had been working with Mikey and Reynolds, 23, in the paint tent on August 14, 2015, but left before the incident. He told the High Court in Aberdeen Mikey had gone inside a giant spooler drum - – a large machine used to lower cables into the sea from oil platforms - they were refurbishing to start painting it. Reynolds is alleged to have operated the machine at while Michael was inside the drum of the spooler. Richard Goddard, prosecuting, asked Lewis, of Keith, Banffshire, if there were any plans to “carry out pranks for Mikey on his last day”. Lewis said he wasn’t aware of any, adding: “Dean isn’t really a practical joker.”  On the first day of the trial on Wednesday, a witness told of the moment he came across the injured schoolboy. Brian Ritchie, managing director of Denholm MacNamee, said he rushed to the scene after a staff member told him Michael McLean, 17, was “unconscious”. Brian, 49, said: “I thought he was dead. He was blueish-white and bleeding from the ear.” Earlier, Dean Reynolds, who denies the culpable homicide of Michael, told the court that the teenager might have “choked on his chewing gum”. Michael died in hospital six days after sustaining “severe” injuries in the drum of the massive cable spooling machine at the oil industry services firm. The first day of Reynolds’s trial on Wednesday heard that Michael was working at the firm – where his dad was a procurement manager – and was on his last day on Friday August 14, 2015, before he was due to return to school. But at 12.20pm that day, bosses were alerted to an “emergency” in a paint shed at the yard in Inverurie Business Park, Aberdeenshire.

Katrina Holmes, 34, was sexually abused by her babysitter, Deborah Evans, in the late 1990s after the woman became close with her family and gained her father\u0027s trust. In secret diaries, the then 15-year-old kept detailed how Evans, 27, groomed her and forced her to perform repulsive acts. Two decades later the entries helped convict Evans, now in her 40s, who has been sentenced to seven years jail. The pair first met when Katrina was seven years old and Evans was aged 19. Evans would babysit Katrina while her father was at the pub.  Katrina, from Cardiff, told Wales Online: “I really liked her – she always had a can of lager in her hand and would get pretty tipsy. “But she was mischievous and fun. My own mum lived hundreds of miles away so I really looked up to Deborah and felt safe with her.” Evans became a family friend, but her attitude towards Katrina changed after the girl turned 15, leading to the woman making a pass at the teenager during a sleepover. Katrina said: “She stayed over our house in my bedroom – with two single beds.  “She said ‘kiss me’. I remember her opening her mouth as her lips tried to close onto mine. “I froze and pulled away from her. ‘What are you doing?’ I said, trying to laugh it off. “She was 27 and I was 15. I wanted her to care about me but I felt more afraid than safe when she was around. “I wanted us to be close – more like a parental figure – not in this way.”  Evans became “controlling and bossy” and even called Katrina’s school to say if there were any problems they were to call her. But things escalated even further when Evans began forcing the girl to take part in sex games at her flat. Katrina said: “One evening when she stayed over at dad’s house she tried to make me perform a sex act on her. It was repulsive. “I said ‘I don’t want to’. But she carried on and ignored me. I felt powerless and afraid. Maybe I wasn’t a tiny child but she had so much control over me.  “Inside I was crying – this woman who I looked up to and loved was now abusing me. She seemed to get a thrill out of the fantasy of being caught. “One morning I was ironing my school uniform and Deborah walked into the room. She said to me ‘You are gay’. But I answered ‘I’m not gay’. “She gripped me hard. ‘You are gay and you will always be gay’, she said aggressively.” The abuse, which went on for five months, was eventually reported to police 12 years later, with Katrina using diary entries she made as a girl as evidence.  Evans, who at the time owned catering firm Cardiff Cuisine Catering with her girlfriend, was charged with 11 counts of indecent assault. She denied the attacks ever took place during a trial at Cardiff Crown Court in February this year but was eventually found guilty and jailed for seven years. Katrina, who gave evidence in court and has bravely waived her legal right to anonymity, said: “I looked over at her to gauge her reaction but there was none. She showed no emotion. “It took me 12 years to speak because I blamed myself for so many years. But when I got to 27 myself I realised what she had done was very wrong.

A shocking video emerged of two women known as \u0027Black Juicy\u0027 and Lizzie in a physical fight, with kicks and punches being thrown around. One of them was pushed to the floor as they screamed at each other and threw around names such as s**t. A coffee cup, which reportedly contained Jim Beam whisky, was also hurled. It was unclear what caused the bizarre altercation in Shildon, County Durham on Sunday afternoon.  But according to the Daily Mail , the women are actually good friends who had a fall out after an all-day drinking session for bank holiday.   The pair were named as Lyndsey Stewart, 27, and Joanne Heckles, 41, who is a grandmother nicknamed \u0027Black Juicy\u0027. Reports said they\u0027d been drinking whiskey before the fight, which was captured on camera by John Canty. But apparently the violence didn\u0027t come between them and they\u0027re still friends. They said they\u0027d never fought before and blamed the booze. A neighbour said the pair were embarrassed about what happened.   A spokeswoman from Durham Police told  a 41-year-old woman was arrested but released without charge.  She said: Police were called to Albion Avenue, Shildon, following reports of two women fighting in the street on Sunday, May 27. One woman was arrested on suspicion of assault however no further action has been taken. Footage of the incident was viewed more than 1.5 million times in 24 hours after it was published on social media.  In the video, the brunette woman, Black Juicy, stands at the door of her house shouting at the blonde female, Lizzie. Lizzie then lifts up her pink strapless playsuit to show her bottom to Black Juicy and mockingly twerks in front of her. In response to this, Black Juicy shouts at Lizzie and calls her a s**t, an utter s**t before picking up her mug of tea. Lizzie then hurls inaudible abuse at Black Juicy and pushes her with both of her hands into her house.  Black Juicy retaliates and throws her mug of tea at Lizzie\u0027s face, who manages to kung-fu punch the cup away from her face. This astonishing feat is shown in slow motion again in the video. The two women then return to physically fighting each other and slap each other in the face. Black Juicy then grabs Lizzie by her pig-tails, putting her in a headlock whilst the two continue punching each other. As the drama continues, Lizzie falls onto the street and as she does this, Black Juicy briefly forgets about her and starts shouting at a neighbour, saying: I\u0027m sick of you.

Adam Gonzales has baffled doctors after forgetting wife Raquel and their three children - before incredibly regaining a few years worth of memories three months later. Adam, 40, and Raquel met in December of 2012. They fell in love and blended their families, getting married July 7, 2015 in Gilbert, Arizona. But early one morning in September 2016 Raquel walked into their living room to find her husband looking perplexed and seemed to have no idea who she was. I asked him: \u0027Do you know where you are? Do you know what year this is? Do you know what my name is?\u0027 And he said \u0027No\u0027 to all these things, Raquel said.  As she tried to reassure him and told him she was his wife and they had three children together he burst into tears. Raquel told him to get dressed and told him they needed to go to hospital immediately. As he went to get his clothes he questioned where his suits were - Raquel explained that he didn\u0027t have any suits and that he was a personal trainer. Adam reluctantly followed a woman he believed was a complete stranger to hospital where he began a a long journey of tests - MRIs, CAT scans, echocardiograms - but they could not work out what had happened.  Incredibly three months later in December 2016 - Adam woke up and remembered who Raquel was again before apologising for something that had happened three years earlier, when they were still dating. But his memories had seemed to return from much earlier in their relationship - and when their children were younger, Raquel said. She said at one point he went see if his daughter was ready for school and she was much older than he remembered. He had to be directed to his children\u0027s school before he asked his daughter to put their home address into the GPS so he wouldn\u0027t get lost. He is slowly recovering memories but three years are still missing, including some important milestones, such as his wedding to Raquel. On their GoFundMe page they wrote: Adam is now home, with his wife and family, but has no recollection of 2012 - 2016. This includes his wedding day, daddy-daughter dances, vacations, baptisms, and other key events, along with his career as a personal trainer.  Adam and Raquel are beginning to date and rebuild their “new” lives together but the road ahead will be long and full of challenges for the whole family, which includes 3 amazing teenagers. But this wasn\u0027t the first time Adam had lost several years of his life. After the break-up of his first marriage, he started a new relationship, but it became abusive and ended when she strangled him with an electric cord and left him dead in his garage. As he was rushed to hospital his heart stopped threes times and then spent four months in a coma.  At the time of the incident in 2011 he had been a branch manager for telecoms giant AT\u0026ampT and a devoted church leader in Lubbock, Texas. But he didn\u0027t remember any of that. Adam told The BBC he didn\u0027t remember who his two children were from his previous marriage and had no idea he had even been married and then divorced. He spent a year in hospital learning to walk and talk again and it was a few months before he was introduced to his son and daughter again. How could a father, a dad, forget his biological children? he said.  He decided not to go back to his old job over fear of not being able to live up to this person that he didn\u0027t even know. So he moved moved to Phoenix, Arizona, with his children, and became a personal trainer. That was where he met Raquel in 2012 and after a few months of dating Raquel and her daughter and Adam and his son and daughter moved in together. But their lives dramatically changed in September two years ago when he forgot who Raquel and their kids were. Abby was 12, Lulu was 15 and Elijah was 17 when Adam\u0027s second memory loss occurred in 2016.

Kaylee Muthart said she took a hit of laced methamphetamine without knowing in February which left her in a drug-induced psychosis. Under a state of hallucination she found herself in, she gouged her own eyes out using her hands and permanently blinded herself. The incident happened outside a church in Anderson, South Carolina, US and was just days before she intended to go to a drug rehabilitation unit, according to reports.  Kaylee had to have emergency surgery to clean her empty sockets and spent weeks recovering, which included time at a psychiatric unit.  But since the beginning of March she has been allowed back to her mum\u0027s house and is on the road to recovery.  She has stayed clean of illicit drugs and is beginning to adapt to her life without her sight. Kaylee said she felt like she was back to herself, and revealed she likes sleeping because dreaming gives her the illusion that she can see something.  She told People : “My dreams are colorful, and it’s like being able to see again - I like sleeping a lot because it’s like I can see.”   Kaylee has bravely taken part in mobility and orientation training and is trying to be optimistic. But she admitted there are times when she feels frustrated and sad about the new reality of her life. She uses Netflix by selecting its audio description option and has spent time playing the guitar and the piano. In July, she is set to have an operation to her orbital cavities that will prepare her to be able to get prosthetic eyes in the future.

Hospital clerical worker Eoin O’Faodhagain from Donegal took a ten minute video from the Loch Ness webcam. The creature moves from right to left and as it swims towards Urquhart Bay - a favourite haunt of Nessie - and is seen diving and surfacing with water splashes. The sighting - the second record accepted this year by the Official Loch Ness Monster Sightings Register - comes only days before DNA sampling is to be used to discover previously unrecorded organisms in Loch Ness. Eoin, 53, from Drumdoit Castlefin has wached the Nessie webcam for many years. “I just click in now and then for 20 minutes - it’s better than watching Coronation Street,” he said. “I seen a couple of things over the years but they have been explained as a boat or something else.” But on April 30, Eoin had “a terrific shock.”  “I couldn’t believe my eyes,” he said. I just started recording it on my phone. I just followed it.  It was very unusual, it was certainly something big - it dived down and up again and dived and disappeared. It was not a boat and not a log. I would say it was Nessie. “I believe in Nessie but not as a plesiosaur - but as something that has evolved in Loch Ness over thousands of years.” Mr O’Faodhagain has been to Loch Ness four times as part of Highland holidays. Gary Campbell, Keeper of the Official Register of Sightings at Loch Ness, said: As far as Nessie footage goes this is a feature film.  Normally you only get videos of one of two seconds. It is remarkable in its length and again shows the increased sightings of Nessie from the internet. “Clearly it is something that dives in and out of the surface with water splashes and reflections. It is unexplained. The object would be no larger than 20ft. There is something there on the video that is clearly moving.”  Sightings of the Loch Ness Monster set new global records last year. Nessie’s 11 accepted sightings in 2017 were the highest this century. Irish missionary St Columba is first said to have encountered a beast in the River Ness in 565AD. Since then there have been 1080 officially logged sightings. This month a team of scientists will collect tiny fragments of skin and scales from the loch. Prof Neil Gemmell, a New Zealand scientist leading the project, said he did not believe in Nessie, but was confident of finding genetic codes for other creatures. He said a “biological explanation” might be found to explain some of the stories about the Loch Ness Monster. Maybe there’s a biological explanation for some of the stories,” he said.

Shay Moloney and Jack Kenneally are believed to have gone for a swim in a lake with friends after a study period. One of the boys got into difficulty while swimming from one bank to the other at the quarry in Knockanean, Co Clare, Ireland, it is understood.  The other teen then swam out to help him but also got into trouble, and both disappeared under the surface, the Irish Mirror reports.   Onlookers on the shore raised the alarm at around 3.30pm on Thursday and a major rescue operation was launched to rescue the Junior Cert students. One local man said: “When I heard the sirens and saw the helicopter my heart just sank. “I knew it was the quarry. I just knew it wasn’t good. “The helicopter was on the ground for a good hour and took off towards Limerick. It’s awful altogether.”  A number of signs are posted at the quarry warning people not to go swimming in the lake. Three units of the fire brigade from Ennis, including members of their swift water rescue unit, responded along with a number of Garda teams. The Shannon-based Irish Coast Guard helicopter, Rescue 115, was quickly scrambled along with the Kilkee unit of the Coast Guard. Clare Civil Defence also responded to the incident.  Fire crews quickly located the first casualty lying on rocks below the surface. The second boy was found just a few metres away. A former firefighter tried to dive down and reach one of the casualties but was unable to grab hold of him. Despite several desperate attempts to reach the boy, he was left exhausted.  A local man raced to the scene with his diving equipment and recovered both boys to the surface. Fire personnel assisted the diver with recovering the casualties from the water and helped ambulance paramedics with CPR. A young man arrived at the scene in an agitated state wanting to enter the area. He shouted: “I want to find my cousin.” The distressed teenager was calmed and comforted by gardai and persuaded to leave the area while emergency services carried out their duties.  Gardai, fire service and Civil Defence personnel attended the scene while officers travelled to the homes of the young men to advise their families of what had happened. A Garda crime scene investigation unit technician also attended and recovered several bags of personal belongings. A Garda spokesman said: “We believe there were a number of young people swimming in the area during the afternoon. Two got into difficulty and the alarm was raised. All the services responded and two casualties were recovered from the water.” A number of signs are visible in the area all warning people not to swim in the quarry.

Melissa Matos would get high locked away in her blood-spattered bedroom while her eight-year-old daughter, Katherine, helped her younger sister with her homework before getting her ready for school. Katherine would then go upstairs to bring her \u0027sick\u0027 mum food and drink and rub her head to make her feel better, unbeknown that her mum had been ravaged by opiate abuse for almost a decade. At times Melissa, with scabbed spots covering her face, and black circles under her eyes, would spend days and nights in a self induced coma on the toilet floor. Melissa\u0027s harrowing Facebook post, that she shared with the world in a bid to help others escape from the throes of drug addiction, showed haunting pictures of herself looking like a \u0027dead girl\u0027. Now for the first time Melissa, 40, has given an honest and brave account of how she was brought back from the brink of death by the love of her two children.  Katherine had been forced to become the mummy of the house since the age of six when her mum\u0027s life spiralled out of control after Melissa became hooked on Xanax and heroin after doctors gave her prescription drugs to help with postnatal depression and pregnancy complications. My youngest never really talks about it, Melissa told . She doesn\u0027t really remember anything and it didn\u0027t effect her. She\u0027s just proud of my recovery. But my oldest will talk about how it hurt her because I was always locked away in my room and I ignored her. How it was scary seeing me high. I spent most of my days either high or dopesick. My eldest daughter would bring me food and drinks, rub my head, stay by my side like a mother would when her child was sick. She would watch her little sister, help her with homework, help get her ready for school. All the things a mum would do, that at the time, I was not capable of doing. RELATED: Kids film horrifying moment they find their parents overdosing on drugs     My children were always in my care. They were in the house, playing or sleeping. I always used privately, in my room or bathroom. What I recall the most was my bedroom. My walls had blood splatters from trying to unclog needles. My bed sheets always had blood, and cigarette burn holes from falling asleep after using heroin or xanax. As her addiction took hold, Melissa, from Parkersburg, West Virginia, found herself lying, robbing and stealing to support her habit. Melissa, said: The mixture of all of these drugs would turn me into a zombie. I was careless, irresponsible and cold. I was absent as a mother, a wife, a daughter, a friend. I began to lose everything and everyone. This was just the beginning. My opiate addiction quickly escalated into complete chaos. The pills I was taking were not enough anymore so I started doctor shopping. Eventually, that caught up with me, I was blacklisted...and sick. Withdrawing off of the medications had me ready to kill myself.  Somehow Melissa managed to keep her children from coming into contact with any needles as they would either play alone in the house or sleeping - while she was shooting up in her room. They never found her injecting and the needles were always immediately put in a lock box by my ex, she said. The family home was a shambles - never dirty as she \u0027cannot stand filth\u0027 and the girls - now nine and 11 - constantly missed school and she admits she could barely feed them. I spent every day locked up in my room, shooting heroin and snorting xanax, said Melissa. If crack was around, I smoked it. If pills were around, I snorted them. It didn\u0027t matter. I hated myself, hated my life.  In 2015 Melissa overdosed on her bedroom floor as her children played next door. She was saved by paramedics but when she returned home her children went to stay with her parents as her life continued to spin out of control. The (paramedics) told them mummy had passed out from her anemia, said Melissa. It was one of the lowest moments of my life. Still, I was so sick in my addiction, that didn\u0027t stop me. I got home and shot up the same fentanyl that had just almost taken my life. In the next few months I lost two apartments, and just about all of my possessions.  I had started going to an Intensive Outpatient Program but was still actively using. I used to cheat my urine tests, but one day I went in so high that I didn\u0027t even think about what I was doing. I failed my test. Child Protective Services were called. I was going to lose the only things I had left, the only things I loved. That was the day I found sobriety.  Melissa has now been clean since March 1, 2016, and has turned her life around, now working with Alcoholics Anonymous and as a writer and a public speaker raising awareness of drug addiction. She is setting up her own charity RecoverME and works as a behavioural health technician with mothers who have addiction problems to get on the road to recovery. I work with women still sick and suffering, as well as women in recovery. I advocate for their rights as mothers as well. The system we have, unfortunately is much better at taking children away and shaming addicts than providing the necessary help and support to keep families together.

CCTV footage shows the gang taking Nong Gift, 21, out of the bar where she had been watching the Champions League final with friends last Saturday in Chanthaburi, Thailand. The cosmetics seller passed out inside the pub - with relatives claiming she had been drugged - and was carried out at 2am and put in the back of a pick-up truck by four men who it\u0027s said claimed they would take her home. But the men - including one who is said to have known her - drove her to a secluded orchard where she was \u0027repeatedly raped\u0027 before being beaten to death.  The gang - Nattaphong Saenkraud, 24, Patti Boonthal, 23, Panya Chan Somdee, 18, and Surasit Jaechim, 24 - are reported to have confessed their involvement to police. On Wednesday they were taken on a crime re-enactment. CCTV shows them - with the help of a female friend of Nong who is said to be the one who thought the group would take her home - carrying her out of the Orbit Pub and putting her into the back of a truck. Police Major General Charn Jitjunjun said: The victim was found dead on the same night. Four men have been arrested and confessed to their part in the crime. The victim was raped by four people and we believe beaten until she died. Her body was found with foam around her mouth, a nose bleed and part of her clothes on the floor.\u0027  A devastated friend who had been with Nong earlier in the evening said she had left her with the group of men because she thought they were her friends. There were also women in the group when she left including the woman who helped to carry Nong into the truck. Airziz Opachat, who left at 1.40am some 30 minutes before her friend passed out, said: I\u0027m sorry. If we knew that last night was the last time we were together. I will take care of you better. I\u0027m sorry I did not take care of you better. Nong had been with three other women while watching the football match but only knew one of them, Airziz Opachat, well, according to local media. They had been on holiday together in the past and socialised regularly, it was reported. The other girls all left earlier in the evening and Airziz said that Nong didn\u0027t seem very drunk. She added: Nong already knew one of the men. She was friendly with everyone. It was normal for her to be out chatting with people.  I thought that she had arrived with these men and was friends with them. Between us we had all drank about half a bottle of whiskey. I woke up in the morning and didn\u0027t see any message from Nong. The only message was from a man that said \u0027your friend is dead\u0027. Nong\u0027s body was found in the fruit processing area. The four men were arrested later on Sunday, May 27, afternoon after police viewed CCTV and tracked them down. During the crime re-enactment the four men were taken to the bar, shown loading a woman into their truck and taken to warehouse at the orchard where the attack happened. One of the group, Surasit Jaechim, the man who knew her, claims he only drove her and the other men to the area where she was killed. All men have been held in custody. Police are now carrying out post mortem examinations on Nong\u0027s body to discover whether she was drugged and the exact cause of her death.

That was a major factor in coming here,” is how the left-back put it.And he was convinced that will be the case after a chat with United assistant boss Laurie Ellis.The pair know each other, having been team-mates at Raith Rovers during the 2013-14 campaign.“I knew Laurie pretty well from my time at Raith. We got speaking about the prospect (of joining United). Since then it has gone pretty quickly.“Coming to a club like Dundee United is really a pretty simple choice.”Ironically, with new Morton boss Ray McKinnon considering a move for his old work-mate Ellis, it could be the pair don’t end up working together again next season.If United can persuade their highly regarded coach to stay, McKinnon could team up with another of his former Tannadice backroom staff, Darren Taylor.Returning to Booth, after a year spent vainly scrapping to avoid the drop, the ex-Hibs, Arbroath and Brechin man is looking forward to a challenge at the right end of a table.“Last season was tough and we just couldn’t get away from that drop zone,” he added.“This will be a different type of pressure, being expected to win most weeks and one which I will relish.”Booth will battle for the left-back slot with youngster Jamie Robson, who himself last week signed up for another two years at Tannadice.Manager Csaba Laszlo is pleased to have that kind of competition in the squad and to get a man of Booth’s quality and experience.“I’m delighted to bring Callum to Dundee United,” he said.“He is an experienced left-back who has played in the Premiership. Callum will create competition on the left side of our defence and improves the squad. He is a defender who likes to get up the park and helps create attacking situations.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/03/5abe00fa671c1-848x564.jpg ","title":"confirmed dundee rename dens park","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee FC have completed a historic deal to rename Dens Park in a sponsorship deal.As the Tele exclusively revealed last week, the ground will now be officially known as Kilmac Stadium at Dens Park for the next two years, when the Dark Blues hope to have moved into a new stadium beside Camperdown Park.Managing Director John Nelms said: “We are always looking for new unique revenue streams and this is a fantastic opportunity for the club and it makes it even better that it is with Richard and Kilmac who are and have been lifelong supporters of the club.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/04/5ae33a987e4ee.jpg ","title":"creative dundee launches latest edition of 99 things to see and do in the city","story":"\t\t\t\t\tCreative Dundee has launched its latest edition of 99 Things to See and Do in Dundee.The book, the fourth of its kind, features must-see spots in the city, selected by residents, for residents and those visiting the City of Discovery.The guide is split into sections of bites, drinks and sounds, restaurants, bars, live music, indie spots and shops, as well as a take it in section which includes places like The McManus and the DCA.Also included are places to have a stroll and admire the view including, the Law and the Riverside Nature Park.You can also check out the various statues placed throughout the city including Oor Wullie, the penguins and the lemmings.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"dundee council to adopt charter for fairness and equality in workplace","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA fair work charter to oversee fairness and inequality in the workplace is set to be adopted by Dundee City Council.Members of the local authority’s policy and resources committee will be asked to adopt the charter on Monday.Councillors will also be asked to give chief executive David Martin powers to discuss and agree the development of further similar charters with the trade unions.They also want Mr Martin to be given the go-ahead “to advocate and influence the development of similar charters by other employers in line with the council’s commitment to fairness and tackling inequalities”.In his report to the committee, Mr Martin said: “The trade unions have worked with and supported adoption by Dundee City Council of a fair work charter.“Dundee City Council believes that fair work is work that offers employees an effective voice, opportunity, security, fulfilment and respect, and that fairly balances the rights and responsibilities of employers and workers.“We believe that fair work provides benefits for individuals, organisations and society as a whole.”Mr Martin added: “Our people strategy and people charter recognise that our people are our most valuable asset.“It is through having an engaged, skilled, motivated and diverse workforce that we will realise our ambitions to provide excellent services and achieve positive outcomes for the city.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/05/5b0fc16ae4c02.jpg ","title":"dundee cyclists get free maintenance work","story":"\t\t\t\t\tCyclists were given a helping hand when an expert carried out free maintenance work on their bikes.Mike Wood, of the Bike Station, was in the city centre fixing and servicing bikes free of charge.The service is funded by Dundee City Council to encourage green commuting.The Bike Station is a registered charity which also recycles donated bikes, sells them at affordable prices and then uses the proceeds to help people across Scotland get in the saddle.Based in Perth and Edinburgh, pop-up events are held in Dundee regularly.

Drivers are required to tell the DVLA of such events and Frank Sheach, Xplore’s engineering manager, liaised with the agency regarding Ms Paterson’s ability to work.He then met her on June 23 last year and informed her she wouldn’t be able to drive until he received a letter from her GP stating that she was fit to be behind the wheel.Ms Paterson’s GP said she was fit for work, but refused to sanction her driving public transport.The DVLA confirmed her licence had been revoked in July, recommending 12 months off driving and inviting her to reapply for it if there were no reoccurrences.Ms Paterson’s GP then contacted the DVLA to inform them that she had “no risk factors for seizure”.However, Mr Sheach decided the claimant was “unable to fulfil the requirements” of the role due to the DVLA suspension and sacked her.She lodged an appeal with Xplore, but the company’s managing director at the time, Elsie Turbyne, upheld Mr Sheach’s original decision. However, on October 5, the DVLA informed Ms Paterson it had reviewed the case and she satisfied medical standards for safe driving.The bus driver then launched proceedings to get her job back — with Judge Chris Lucas ruling in her favour.He said: “The claimant’s claim that she had been unfairly dismissed by the respondent has succeeded and the respondent should be ordered to reinstate her.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/05/5b0e84ff96098-519x564.jpg ","title":"jim mcalister issues come and get me plea to dundee after blackpool exit","story":"\t\t\t\t\tFormer fans’ favourite Jim McAlister could be set for a return to his favourite Scottish stomping ground – Dens Park.That’s because the 32-year-old has issed a ‘come-and-get-me’ plea to Scottish clubs after leaving Blackpool at the end of the season.And he’s namechecked Dundee as his favoured destination.He said: “I would love one more crack at the Scottish Premiership.“My wife and kids moved home from Blackpool in February because of her work so they’re based at Ralston in Paisley.“At the end of the day her career is going to be longer and more important than mine so I think it’s better to set up base back home in Scotland and look for something here.”A bad leg break has kept the midfielder out of action for over a year, however, so a difficulty might be proving to a manager up here he is fit and ready to go.“The worry is I’ve not played for 14 months – and that’s why I was angry at Blackpool,” he added.“I was promised game time coming up to the last four games of the season to prove to managers that I’m fit and ready to go for pre-season. But they never gave me those minutes on the pitch so I was a bit annoyed at how it ended down there.“It’s just about finding a manager that will put that trust in me.

I’m a great believer that if you’re good enough, you’re old enough.“I broke into the side at 17, 18. Back then it was almost sink or swim.“You have to have the right mentality and drive about you to survive in the first-team environment because I demand a lot from the boys.“The ones we accelerated into the first team first of all need to be thrown in to understand what it’s like to train at that level and what is expected to hit that first-team pitch.“I’ll find out very quickly if they can cope.

It’s not like ‘you’re only 16 or 17 and you’ve not really cracked it yet’, there’s nothing like that.“Come in for the four weeks of pre-season and blow the webs off it.”There might be no barrier but the level required from these young players and what the manager expects from every player, no matter the age, is extremely high.And it won’t take long for the youngsters to find that out.A prime example is 19-year-old Scott, a prolific goalscorer in the Development League, who featured for the Dark Blues in the final three matches of the last campaign.He came on against Partick Thistle in the last game of the season, replacing Craig Wighton after an hour, but failed to impress his manager.Neil said: “I’ll not tell you what I told Cedwyn after the Partick game but it was pretty stark.“If he is coming into my first team I expect him to score goals, create chances, to run after centre-backs, close down full-backs – he doesn’t get let off because he’s 18 years old.“He’s coming in during the summer and he’s got a short space of time to get in my face and say ‘I’m better than what you’re going to bring in. If you’ve not got anybody in yet, gaffer, I’m your man’.“All the boys that have made an impact in the first team have a real chance but they need to come back and be better than what I’ve got.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"ray mckinnon aims to lure dundee united assistant laurie ellis to morton","story":"\t\t\t\t\tRay McKinnon’s first act as Morton manager could be to raid former employers Dundee United for the services of assistant boss Laurie Ellis.Out of work since being sacked by the Tangerines in October, McKinnon has beaten off stiff competition from an impressive list of candidates to be named as Ton boss on Wednesday.And it’s understood he wants to team up with Ellis for a third time.The pair worked together at Raith Rovers for a season and then moved to Tannadice in 2016.Although McKinnon was dismissed with United five points off the top of the Championship, Ellis’s services were retained and he was appointed caretaker manager.During that period he actually led them back to the top of the league and was approached by several senior member of the team who urged him to apply for the manager’s job on a permanent basis.He declined because at this stage of his coaching career he felt he lacked the experience to be in charge of a club the size of United and resumed his duties as No 2 when Csaba Laszlo was appointed in November.Despite big changes to both the playing squad and backroom staff at Tannadice being planned this summer, including the expected appointment of Csaba’s long-time assistant Werner Burger, it’s understood Ellis has been told he’ll continue to have an important role working with the first team.He may, though, find the chance to team up again with his close friend McKinnon very difficult to turn down.United, meanwhile, have appointed a new head of finance in the shape of chartered accountant Iain Ross.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2017/11/59fc45c3606dd-846x564.jpg ","title":"ray mckinnon has no regrets over his spell at dundee united","story":"\t\t\t\t\tRay McKinnon insists he does not have a point to prove to former club Dundee United after taking over at Greenock Morton.The 47-year-old was axed as Tannadice boss back in October with his side five points adrift of eventual Ladbrokes Championship winners St Mirren.But the man who replaced him, Csaba Laszlo, was unable to inspire the Tangerines to better, with his side crashing out of the promotion battle in the play-off semi-finals.But McKinnon insists his only motivation for taking up his new role at Cappielow is to guide Ton to the Premiership.McKinnon \u0026#8211 who has been handed a one-year rolling deal by chairman Crawford Rae \u0026#8211 said: \u0026#8220After six months out I was getting extremely bored \u0026#8211 there is only so much you can do in the house.\u0026#8220But I\u0026#8217m delighted to be back.

Public consultation followed with 328 nearby addresses contacted, prompting 104 formal responses.The report to the committee stressed that the brief \"does not seek to create competition between the two locations\".Stratton, it stated, \"has opportunity for larger footprint retail and community buildings whereas Ashton provides opportunity for education, park and higher density residential development\".The focus of development would be \"east Ashton\". The owners of the adjacent western part of Ashton Farm do not intend selling for development but to continue farming the land.Opportunities have been identified for improving public transport links, particularly for Inverness Campus users. Transport agency HiTrans will consider the provision of a new rail station at Seafield, the campus or Stratton.Discussions are underway with the college and Highlands and Islands Enterprise on the \"early delivery\" of sports facilities at the campus. A least one pitch plus associated buildings could cost \u0026pound4.7 million.The expansion also promises to include an upgrade to the busy Inshes roundabout layout.Planning officials are discussing road widening proposals with landowners. Council representatives will attend community council meetings in the coming months to assess local requirements.A 500-space park-and-ride facility was consented as part of the Stratton scheme.The report references a landowner who argued that the brief contradicts an existing development plan and \"fails to recognise Stratton and only refers to potential future development at Ashton Farm\".They also complained that the \"vision map does not reflect the original permission\u0027 town centre at Stratton or the development plan support for it\".Another considers \"Ashton centre\" to be \"an unreasonable competitor location to Stratton\" that \"undermines\" Stratton.It is unclear from the report what long-term employment would be created in the area \u0026ndash an issue raised historically by numerous city councillors who questioned council officials\u0026rsquo aspirations for growth.The report stated: \"Analysis identified that the optimum location for a new centre is at east Ashton.\"This location is, therefore, identified as the core area for new and existing communities to visit as a destination that has footfall generating uses including a new district park, high school and mixed-use centre that includes high-density residential uses.\"It emphasised that the Stratton site does not include provision for a district park or high school with community facilities like those at Inverness Royal Academy.The brief \"does not seek to create competition between Stratton and Ashton\", according to the development planning team.Public feedback has already established an aversion to more development in the area with calls for the focus to instead be on the city centre and brownfield sites, and concern that the recent demand for new homes could stall, leaving a surplus of residential properties.Other responses included a plea that \"pubs should not be allowed\".Smithton and Culloden Community Council chairman David McGrath welcomed the document, with a caveat that it improves access to the nearby Inverness Shopping Park with a short cut for existing residents.A spokesman for the Stratton developer Hazledene said: \"We don\u0026rsquot think it\u0027 appropriate that a competitor town centre should be introduced, as this would add uncertainty and confusion.\"These [Ashton] proposals are early stage proposals and we believe should not be given the same weight as the Stratton permissions already granted.

I find NHS finance statements to be completely opaque.\"We need something much clearer based upon what we need to know each month.\"The council is to write to the health board about the issue.A report to councillors by Bill Alexander, the council\u0027 director care and learning, pointed to poor links between \"financial challenges and service planning processes, particularly regarding adult social care\".He said one of the key motivations behind integrating services had been \"the recognition that the resources of both organisations would become increasingly constrained,\" and that \"major change\" was now required to the way services are planned and delivered.Speaking after the debate, Councillor Davidson said: \"It can improve a lot.

I think it will help support people\u0027 fond relationship with the river.\"While the final detail has still to be completed, a group of fishermen from Inverness Angling Club seemed relaxed as they studied the computer generated images.Club president Graham MacKenzie said: \"Around the hut is already a gathering place.

Anthony O’Connor’s contract with the Dons expired yesterday and midfielder Greg Tansey has two years left on his Dons deal but has been told he is free to move on this summer.The Reds made a bid to sign Hibs’ out-of-contract midfielder Dylan McGeouch, currently with Scotland in Mexico.Aberdeen offered to make McGeough the highest paid player at the club but Hibs also pitched in with an improved new contract.McGeouch is also being tracked by Fulham, QPR, Blackburn and Brentford. New Rangers boss Steven Gerrard is also reportedly weighing up a move for McGeouch.McInnes has already landed 18-year-old Hamilton midfielder Lewis Ferguson on a pre-contract agreement.The Dons boss is also keen on securing Ross County full-back Jason Naismith. Burton Albion and Plymouth Argyle are also interested in Naismith, 23, who has two years left on his Staggies deal and would require a fee.McInnes said: “I’m excited we have good young ones coming through to add to the good players we already have.“But I do think we need more tried and tested players with that level of experience in key positions.”Meanwhile, Dons skipper Graeme Shinnie is in line to start for Scotland against Mexico on Sunday (1am).The Scots will face the World Cup-bound Mexicans at the 87,000 sell-out Azteca Stadium.Shinnie earned a debut cap as a substitute in Wednesday’s 2-0 defeat to Peru in Lima.Scotland boss Alex McLeish said: “We will need to make changes as there is no way the other guys can recover in time. You could see we were flagging.“We have to be hard to beat but we’d like to have a bigger threat at the other end.“It’s not an easy task to bring in guys who people might argue you wouldn’t normally see play for Scotland.“I am so proud of them and am looking forward to seeing the new ones coming in for the Mexico game.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2018/06/18479695-1-846x564.jpg ","title":"film review book club 12a","story":"\t\t\t\t\tLet\u0026#8217s talk about sexagenarians.Writer-director Bill Holderman\u0026#8217s frothy romantic comedy stars Diane Keaton, Jane Fonda, Candice Bergen and Mary Steenburgen in underwritten roles as life-long friends, who have forgotten what it means to grow old disgracefully.One leaf through the pages of E.

It was padlocked with a security lock.What a disappointment and what a waste of something worth sharing.I thought of how blessed we are in Argyll to be able to leave doors unlocked.Most of our churches are open day and night to extend a welcome to visitors.Jesus once said that he was \u0026#8216the door\u0026#8217 \u0026#8211 the door to life.The way to Jesus is never locked or barricaded.In his company, when we are stressed or worried, we can find that oasis of calm to refresh and renew our flagging souls.There is no key to this door, for it is always open, always welcoming.It\u0026#8217s a door that leads to a journey – the journey of a lifetime.It was a journey begun long, long ago and continues now and into the future.There will be companions on the way and it will never be dull.Different people will bring different talents and sing different songs, but we will all have the same destination.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column 24","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 17/05/18, 11:31 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.We heartily agree with the decision of the Lord Lieutenant to nominate Betty Rhodick to attend the royal wedding.As far as we are aware, no one works harder for Lochgilphead  \u0026#8211 and once Betty puts her mind to something\u0026#8230Betty and Geordie have been the figureheads for the Lochgilphead Armed Forces Day commemorations since they started, but she deserves this recognition not just for this one annual event, but for all she does on our behalf.Enjoy yourself, Betty and Kelly.The renovated Kilmartin Museum is now almost within reach.This is sure to be of great economic benefit to the region when it opens in two years and it is an exciting prospect that will enable the unique heritage of Mid Argyll to be properly showcased.Just what was last weekend\u0026#8217s Scapa festival at Ardkinglas?The answer is probably unique to every individual who attended.

At times when the builders are working the gulls understandably leave the site but then return during the evenings and at weekends. Several birds were again sitting on apparent nests as recently as May 4, however it looks like many others may have moved elsewhere.Measures have since been taken by the builders to encourage the birds to leave the area prior to laying their eggs and to give them a chance of nesting elsewhere soon. Recently I had a meeting with SNH (Scottish Natural Heritage) and the RSPB and both were sympathetic and understanding of the situation.I also plan to meet with the Scottish Canals environmental scientist soon in the hope that perhaps provision can be made, within the scope of the hub project, to allow for a nesting area for the Common Gulls in future years at the site.This could give rise to an exciting opportunity enabling the public and visitors to the new heritage centre to view these gulls raise their chicks, for which is effectively the rarest colony of nesting birds in the Crinan Canal corridor.Jim Dickson, Argyll Bird Recorder, CairnbaanSir,This week Allt Dearg Wind Farm distributed over £135,000 to the Ardrishaig Community Trust, which holds the village\u0026#8217s share in this locally owned wind farm.Combined with the recent payments to the Tighnabruaich and Tarbert Trusts which hold similar shares in the neighbouring Sròndoire Wind Farm, together with the wind farms\u0026#8217 contributions to the local educational trust, this brings the total direct community benefit payments from these projects to well over £ 1 million.This is a significant milestone for the projects, and highlights the socio-economic advantages of local ownership in wind power. Despite its relatively small capacity Allt Dearg is the single largest contributor of community benefit payments in Argyll.This week the UK Government published the results of its latest tracking survey of public attitudes to energy and climate change. This shows continued growth in support for on-shore wind, and eight in ten agreed that renewable energy developments should provide direct benefits to the communities in which they are located.Some objections to wind farms remain, and our turbines remain visible in the distance. We hope that the views of Allt Dearg and Sròndoire might remind such objectors that we are economically dependent on what we can produce from the limited options available to us in remote rural areas. That our particular wind farms are able to make a significant contribution to local employment and deliver funding direct to our neighbouring communities, whilst supplying around 20 per cent of Argyll and Bute’s annual domestic electricity requirements from a clean renewable resource, is very satisfying.We would like to thank all those who have made these projects the successes they are, and in particular thank those local community councillors and trust members who have given so much of their time in recent years to make this all happen. For our part, we will continue our efforts to grow the industry and economic activity that provides secure employment and opportunity for our local community.We look forward to our community partners being able to invest the fruits of these wind farms into exciting local projects.Mary Broadfoot of Stronachullin and James F Lithgow of OrmsarySir,Loneliness is a major issue in society and affects everyone from all walks of life, regardless of age or ability.That’s why we’re pleased the Scottish Government is looking at the development of a new approach to tackling the issues of loneliness and social isolation – something we have first-hand experience of and how it affects many of the people we support in Scotland.Following a recent survey of over 150 service users of our homecare services in Stirling, Falkirk, Perth and Kinross, and Angus which focused solely on loneliness and social isolation, it was revealed that loneliest people receive far fewer visitors each week. While this is hardly surprising, we did find that those who either lived with family or had family close by were less at risk of loneliness and the negative health impacts associated. Our research also highlighted that respondents, in most cases, simply wanted a chat over a cuppa with someone their own age.Social interactions are something the vast majority of us take for granted as we all lead such busy lives, but for someone who is alone, watching time go by very slowly, it’s incredibly painful for them to sit at home day after day with no communication from the outside world.Charities such as Sue Ryder regularly arrange social events for our service users and their families.But if, as a nation, we’re serious about tackling loneliness as a public health issue then we need to be resourcing our local authorities to put in place services or to commission them from the third sector to ensure that no one feels alone and isolated in Scotland.Pamela Mackenzie, director of neurological services and Scotland, Sue Ryder, StirlingSir,This spring we hope your readers will celebrate the royal wedding with their very own Right Royal Tea Party in aid of Meningitis Now.Putting on a spread fit for a royal wedding is a piece of cake with our free fundraising pack and, as Prince Harry and Meghan Markle have requested charity donations rather than wedding presents, you can fulfil their wishes whilst helping families affected by this devastating disease.A royal-themed Time4Tea can be held anytime, not just on Saturday May 19, the date of the Royal Wedding. And it can take place anywhere – at home, at work, at school.Just pop the kettle on, slice up a cake or two, homemade or bought (you have to have cake at a wedding) and invite friends, relatives and colleagues to enjoy a cuppa or perhaps even a glass of champagne.The serious point is that you’ll be helping to fight meningitis and move us one step closer to our vision of a future where no one in the UK dies from meningitis \u0026#8211 and everyone affected gets the support they need to rebuild their life.Sadly, despite developments in vaccines, meningitis and septicaemia continue to affect thousands every year and kill more under-fives than any other infectious disease. Help us fight back on all fronts by funding research to eradicate the disease, raising awareness and supporting survivors.That would be the perfect wedding present.Find out more at www.MeningitisNow.org and search for Time 4 Tea.Elaine Close, community fundraiser, Meningitis NowSir,Please would the parents of the young girl who may have witnessed a recent incident with a man and dog in Inveraray Main Street be kind enough to contact my husband and I through this newspaper?We saw a man who, we believe, mistreated a dog in the street at 8.30pm on Sunday April 29, and his movements in the immediate aftermath.We are both keen to know that this young person is alright as she appeared to be terribly frightened, running off at speed with her two dogs as he headed straight for her.Knowing she was now fine would put our minds at rest.

Moore took the free-kick, but his curling effort from 27 yards lacked power.Moore, however, was not to be denied his hat-trick and 60 seconds later  steered a good low finish past Scott Urquhart\u0026#8217s left hand.The early first-half jitters returned to the League defence just after the hour mark when hesitation in the box allowed Nikki MacDougall, of host club Tarbert, to nip in and force the ball past Urquhart from nine yards to add a fifth goal for Argyll.A flurry of changes from both sides with 16 minutes remaining saw Scott Soudan and Lewis MacNaughton replace MacDougall and McCallum for Argyll.The league adjusted quicker to the changes and Kyle Reid and Robbie Martin combined well for Martin to pull a goal back in the 77th minute.With five minutes remaining, Soudan\u0026#8217s tenacity in the box robbed Daniel Smith on the six yard line and left him one-on-one with Urquhart.Soudan\u0026#8217s stabbed effort was stopped by Urquhart\u0026#8217s outstretched right foot but, typical of his luck on the day, the rebound fell kindly for the Campbeltown Pupils\u0026#8217 striker who rounded the prostrate Urquhart and walked the ball into the empty net.The full-time whistle ended an entertaining encounter with the players and officials retiring to the Islay Frigate Hotel for the presentation ceremony.The Duncan MacDougall man of the match award was given to Red Star\u0026#8217s Kieran Moore.\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"sun brings out the best in lochgilphead golfers","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 17/05/18, 2:24 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowOn a lovely sunny Sunday the gents competed to gain a place to play in this year\u0026#8217s match and knockout competition.Jim Hunter was excited to return a nett score of 58, six strokes below par.

It was a gamble \u0026#8211 but one that paid off, with the business now turning over millions each year.He left the business \u0026#8216at least 10 years ago\u0026#8217, but was a very interested visitor at last week\u0026#8217s \u0026#8216Fyne at 40\u0026#8217 celebrations \u0026#8211 more on pages 16 and 17 \u0026#8211 to mark the company\u0026#8217s four decades in business.\u0026#8216Looking back, I feel quite astonished really,\u0026#8217 he told the Advertiser.\u0026#8216I mean, away back we had a wooden hut, but before that there was a fish box and an umbrella. We were growing shellfish, cooking prawns and smoking a bit of fish.\u0026#8216The restaurant as we see it today was an old farm steading \u0026#8211 well, it was a midden, really. But we slowly evolved within it.\u0026#8216It was open to the slates and the wind used to go straight up the length of the oyster bar. We had a hessian sack to keep down the draught, and it used to stand out at about 45 degrees a lot of the time. It was very primitive for many years, because we were skint.\u0026#8216People sat in their overcoats, but they liked the style. All of a sudden they could get local shellfish, and it just developed from there.\u0026#8217He continued: \u0026#8216Since my time the whole place has had a re-make and it is really, really nice.\u0026#8216It\u0026#8217s been driven by the volume of people wanting to dine here. I mean, you couldn\u0026#8217t keep up that slightly rustic look. It\u0026#8217s a cracking place now. Just superb.\u0026#8217Johnny Noble sadly died in 2002, aged just 66.\u0026#8216He was an inspiring, lovely man, said Mr Lane. \u0026#8216No matter what disaster befell us no matter what cock-up happened, he was ever-optimistic and just kept us going.\u0026#8216We would have our business meetings in the billiard room at [Johnny\u0026#8217s home] Ardkinglas House, and there would be a bottle of something. That just keeps the morale going.\u0026#8216He was a great man, and wonderful entertainment.\u0026#8217The stories of Johnny Noble are legion, and most are true.Andy Lane recalled: \u0026#8216In the days of the Oyster Bar in our old draughty building, everyone had to muck in. Johnny would go round being the wine waiter for a while. Until, that is, someone would choose an inappropriate wine. At that point he\u0026#8217d start a sort of genial argument with them. In the end he\u0026#8217d sit down with them and you\u0026#8217d never see him again for the rest of the evening.\u0026#8216I don\u0026#8217t think we realised just how important he was for the business until he was gone.\u0026#8217Now living a quieter life in Cornwall with his Dexters, Mr Lane concluded: \u0026#8216My wife and I changed tack in life, really, and it keeps us busy.

Therefore, we support separating pedestrians, cyclists and motorists through an expansion of the network of walking and cycling paths across Scotland.We would like to stress, however, that measures like these will not single-handedly lead to safer roads. The road mentality in Scotland still favours the motorist over more vulnerable road users, which presents a huge barrier to more people taking up active lifestyles.More needs to be done to change our road culture for people in Scotland to feel safer regardless of their means of transportation, ultimately empowering them to lead healthier and more active lifestyles.Perhaps it is time we started to beat the ‘presumed liability’ drum once again?Brenda Mitchell, Road Traffic Accident Law (Scotland) LLP, Edinburgh.Sir,Some people have difficulty getting up and down the steps on the Glasgow bus. We asked West Coast Motors about this and they gave us the answer we wanted.All Citylink buses are fitted with an access ramp, worked by the driver. A platform comes out on to the pavement, with a holding bar, and is then raised up to floor level. This is designed as a wheelchair lift, where two seats at the front have to be arranged to be taken out, to give plenty of room.It was agreed, however, that if someone felt nervous about climbing up or down the stairs, they could also use the access platform. Once they have paid their ticket, they can walk to a seat.West Coast Motors asks anyone wanting this service to please remember two things.Firstly, book your single or return tickets by phone or on the Citylink website.Then, 48 hours before your journey, phone Citylink and tell them the times and details of the booking you have made and let them know you will be using the access ramp. The telephone number is 08712 663333.Kirsty McCuaig and Patricia Crawford, Mid Argyll Buddies.Sir,The ongoing effects of weather, bureaucracy and concern for the future continue to put our countryside under pressure, with few avenues to turn to for support.This can have dramatic consequences for the rural economy and the people who live and work there.The Prince’s Countryside Fund is committed to supporting community-led projects that will re-invigorate and sustain farming networks and the countryside by providing services and amenities through its grant programme.Open for applications until June 14, grants are available for up to £50,000. If you are involved in a community-run or farming support project and think your organisation may benefit – or if you know someone who might –  visit  www.princescountrysidefund. org.uk/grants.The fund has supported a diverse range of projects, including a community transport app in Argyll and projects on Barra, Orkney and Shetland. We are proud to have distributed more than £9 million since 2010 to more than 250 projects led by these grassroots organisations.It is crucial we help rural areas during these times of change to retain a thriving countryside and encourage a sustainable farming sector in the UK and would encourage people to apply for our funding.Claire Saunders, director, The Prince’s Countryside Fund.Sir,At first sight, it seems odd that the controversy over the reported disturbance to common gulls, oystercatchers and black guillemots at the old oil depot in Ardrishaig is focused on a breeding colony of common gulls.I’m no bird expert and hadn’t realised common gulls are less common than the bigger varieties or that they’re a declining species.But among the reasons given for this are predation by mink and the loss of open rubbish dumps and both might be contributing factors in Mid Argyll.It’s surely hardly surprising that the only breeding colony along the canal is at the Ardrishaig end, where the urbanisation around the tidal flats of Loch Gilp and the Lingerton dump offer prime scavenging opportunities.I don’t know whether they lose out to the bigger gull species when it comes to local island nesting sites, or whether the old Gleaner site might offer other advantages, for example, maybe less vulnerable to mink predation – but could it be the gulls are there primarily because of man-made feeding opportunities and that they’ll find an alternative site that’s similarly convenient?Likewise, the smaller populations of oystercatchers and black guillemots, however, although they’re also both amber listed they don’t scavenge and seem to be more dependent on the sea and shore for their livelihoods.Their decline might be of more concern but they’re hopefully less swayed towards easy pickings around Loch Gilp and more evenly distributed to Loch Crinan.Perhaps Jim Dickson and Andrew Tongue can enlighten us further on just how endangered the populations of these three species are in Mid Argyll.Robert Wakeham, Lochgilphead.Sir,Please would the parents of the young girl who may have witnessed a recent incident with a man and dog in Inveraray Main Street contact my husband and I through this newspaper?We saw a man who, we believe, mistreated a dog in the street at 8.30pm on Sunday April 29.We are both keen to know this young person is alright as she appeared to be frightened, running off at speed with her two dogs.Knowing she was fine would put our minds at rest.

Beyond our concerns for public safety, this systematic under-investment is slowing our economy and costing local councils a fortune in compensation for car owners.We recognise the importance of well-maintained roads and we are willing to invest in it.The SNP has consistently neglected Scotland’s roads and the results are obvious for everyone to see.Councillor Alastair Redman, Islay.On Monday May 14, I spotted six swallows over the rear of Meadows Place, hopefully heralding a decent summer.First seen this year.Mike Power, Lochgilphead.Sir,During this week\u0026#8217s Holyrood vote on the UK Government’s Withdrawal Bill, Labour, the Greens and LibDems joined the SNP in an overwhelming rejection of the UK Government’s currently-drafted Brexit plans, voting 93 to 30 against the bill.While the Scottish Government agrees in the need for UK-wide frameworks, it has described the retention of the overall control of agriculture, fisheries, food labelling and public procurement as a power grab.The Scottish Parliament has spoken loudly and clearly, and if the UK Government wants us to believe they value Scotland and devolution, they must respect the vote and remove the proposed power grab.Any constraints placed on the existing powers of the Scottish Parliament without consent would be a democratic outrage.During Prime Minister\u0026#8217s Questions, Theresa May failed to reassure us she will respect the decision of the Scottish Parliament. If she does choose to ignore the vote and force through this legislation, she will be breaking the conventions of the 20-year-old devolution settlement and imposing a power grab upon Scotland against our will.Brendan O\u0026#8217Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"science matters natures patterns","story":"\t\tDorothy H CrawfordUpdated: 20/05/18, 11:47 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe natural world abounds in beautiful patterns, each evolved to enhance survival of a species \u0026#8211 the extravagant, iridescent peacock’s tail, which serves to attract a mate, while intricate orchid flowers entice pollinators and tigers’ stripes provide camouflage.But not all nature’s patterns are quite as showy it is the mathematical symmetries that I find most intriguing.Italian mathematician Leonardo Fibonacci lived in 12th century Algeria when Indian numerals were introduced to the West via the Middle East.  In his book, Liber Abaci (published in 1202), he describes a numerical sequence, now called the Fibonacci sequence, in which each number is the sum of the previous two digits: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 ad infinitum. He formulated this recurrence in relation to rabbit breeding, but it turns out to be exceedingly wide-spread in nature, from tree branching to mollusc shell growth to bee reproduction.Plant leaves are like solar panels, absorbing sunlight to power energy-providing photosynthesis.  Thus, leaves appear in a spiral around the stem, each positioned to optimise sunlight capture.  The ratio of leaves to turns is always a ration of Fibonacci numbers 3 leaves to 1 turn for hazel, 8/3 for pear and 13/5 for almond trees.  The angle between consecutive leaves is always close to 137.5o, called ‘the golden angle’ – perfect for maximising energy production.The number of petals in most flowers also follows the Fibonacci sequence: lilies have 3, buttercups 5, delphinium 8, common marigolds 13, asters 21.  But even more striking are the complex spirals of seed-heads of sunflowers, fir cones and pineapples.  In each case new seeds forming in the centre of the flower push older seeds out into mesmerising patterns of interlocking, clockwise and anticlockwise spirals.The numbers of spirals in both directions are consecutive Fibonacci numbers with 5 and 8 or 8 and 13 in pineapples, 8 and 13 in fir cones, and numbers as high as 144 and 233 recorded in sunflower heads.Why? Because these configurations pack in the most seeds.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column 25","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 21/05/18, 3:33 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Some would argue it has been an eyesore that should have been knocked down long before now and replaced with a more modern building.But it\u0026#8217s sad to see the old Inveraray Community Hall crumble and rot with neglect.What makes the building\u0026#8217s current predicament all the more galling is that there was the chance, according to Inspire Inveraray, to make the building safe six years ago.

Entitled ‘Looking for Noah’ they stand, incongruously with a licence plate wedged in antlers.The walk takes the visitor past thought-provoking sculptures, including Lesley Burr’s beautifully-painted birdcages that could house fairies, to an opening at The Mill with its own maze and poetry carved into rock.The Artmap Argyll group brings together artists of different specialities to make for an intrigung walk through the woods.A highlight for many will be Melanie Chimelewska’s limestone seal pup, lying gleefully on the shore, but Andy McClintock’s dancing mermaids undoubtedly captured a feeling of eerie magic, as though having stepped into a Grimm brothers\u0026#8217 fairytale. The wire and cloth faceless mermaids dance on the surface of a pond but hide, too, under a running waterfall, washing the seaweed stuck to their scaled tails.Andy McClintock said: ‘I imagine water sprites dancing in the lagoon and disporting themselves in waterfalls.’Within The Mill itself, paintings are hung showing the allure of algae.Artist Lottie Goodlet said: ‘As a snorkeller and swimmer in the Sound of Jura, I am fascinated by seaweed beneath me.

As with other gull species which are opportunist in diet, junk food and bits of plastic provided by us humans can be inadvertently consumed.Over many years the Gleaner oil depot, which has a concrete bund in case of oil spillage, has provided a safe nesting site for around 20 pairs. The suggestion that this colony could easily find an alternative site is perhaps wishful thinking as suitable sites nearby in Mid Argyll are already occupied by other gull species or don’t have the required habitat features.Thankfully, however, this should not prove necessary. Following a productive on-site meeting last week with the Scottish Canals\u0026#8217 environmental scientist, the project architect and TSL contractors we noted 10-15 birds sitting on eggs and unaffected by the work going on around them.Planned works over the coming weeks should not affect these gulls, Oystercatchers or Black Guillemots from nesting and will also not impede the building work which is scheduled to be completed by next spring.The Mid Argyll hub project and new canal museum will largely reflect the social and cultural heritage of the Crinan Canal, but should also encompass the important and often decreasing natural history of the Crinan Canal corridor. These breeding birds are also a part of this and should not just be something to ‘chase off’ to somewhere else.Excellent viewing and educational opportunities from the new build will be possible to watch this colony raise their chicks as well as providing a point to lookout for other wildlife on the loch.Nearby, the tidal estuary of Loch Gilp provides us with an often highly under-valued unofficial nature reserve that links Ardrishaig with Lochgilphead, which in winter hosts important numbers of duck and waders, in summer includes breeding Eider ducks and Common Terns and during migration is a vital stopping off point during adverse weather for passage Whooper swans, Brent geese and Black-tailed Godwits to name a few.Increasingly good work is being undertaken by locals and the Phoenix Trust to help clear up some of the increasing amounts of shoreline rubbish.Keep up the good work!Jim Dickson, Argyll Bird Recorder, CairnbaanSir,I have been out and about Islay the past week speaking to my constituents, visiting local businesses and monitoring the roads department\u0026#8217s progress with road repairs.Unfortunately CalMac management\u0026#8217s shocking handling of our local ferry service is really taking it\u0026#8217s toll on many local businesses that depend heavily of Islay\u0026#8217s growing tourist trade. We simply cannot allow CalMac to continue to make the same errors every year without consequences.On another subject, I have been unimpressed with our local roads department management\u0026#8217s sluggish response to a large number of complaints from local residents and myself about the plague of potholes scattered across Islay.There are many roads across Islay that have some potholes marked to be filled while others remain unmarked despite them in many cases being side by side. This scattershot approach to pothole repairs is as random as it is ineffective.In the future we will need to see a more long term resurfacing solution to our local roads with less short term, random and piecemeal patchwork.Cllr Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,In the run up to National Volunteering Week (June 1- 7), Cats Protection would like to extend our thanks to the many thousands of volunteers throughout the country who offer their time and expertise to help cats and kittens across the UK.In 2017, our 10,200-strong volunteer network contributed an incredible 5.5 million hours, each volunteer gifting a wealth of expertise and immeasurable passion to the charity. Their dedication enabled Cats Protection to help around 200,000 cats and kittens nationwide.Cats Protection is always on the lookout for new volunteers to join the UK’s biggest cat community. Though a large part of our work is helping cats, through fostering and rehoming, our volunteers have the opportunity to become involved with a range of interesting activities such as organising fundraising events, helping with publicity or managing funds and resources to benefit the greatest amount of cats.Volunteering can offer the chance to develop skills such as time management, interpersonal skills and teamwork, making CVs much more attractive and, of course, helping cats.Anyone who is interested in becoming a volunteer can go to our website www.cats.org.uk/get- involved/volunteering  to find out more.Julie Meredith, head of volunteering development, Cats Protection,Sir,I really love being active, especially the feeling after and that’s why I’m supporting Bowel Cancer UK and Beating Bowel Cancer’s latest fundraising campaign to get sponsored to do 30 minutes of physical activity for 30 days in June.Step up for 30 is a fantastic way for you to be more physically active to reduce your risk of bowel cancer – the UK’s second biggest cancer killer.

The Simmentals are hot on their heels with 103 entries, a 10-year record  and an increase from 85 in 2017. And the Charolais are also seeing a resurgence, with a jump to 76, from 61 last year.The numbers in the dairy section total 109 entries, with the largest class being the Ayrshire with 38, up from 29 in 2017. Holsteins total 29 entries, and the Dairy Shorthorn class has seen numbers more than double from 12 to 25. This year\u0026#8217s Queen\u0026#8217s Cup will be in the dairy class.Sheep entries once again command the Royal Highland Show with 2,029 animals making this the second largest number of entries in more than a decade.Leading the way is the Texel section with 182 entries, with the Beltex close behind with 177. Elsewhere in the sheep classes, the Suffolks have their highest number in 10 years with 110 entries (90 in 2017). The Ryelands and the Rouges also see record numbers for the last decade, with 82 and 39 entries respectively (up from 65 and 34 in 2017). Commercial sheep entries are also seeing increased interest with 104 entries, up from 85 in 2017.  The North of England Mule class was introduced to the Show in 2011 and sees its highest ever entries, with 69 in the class.The Young Handler competition has 56 entries, illustrating the continued interest from the next generation particularly in this the Year of Young People.An exciting development is the interest in the goat classes with a ten-year high of 39 entries and the Boer breed, increasing from 16 to 27.  Six goat young handlers will also compete for the title.1,665 entries have been received in the light horse section, with the HOYS qualifying Mountain and Moorland Under Saddle section again dominating with 197 entries, up from 192 in 2017.The Heavy Horse section continues to have a strong presence, with 392 entries. Highland females lead the way with 94, with Shetland females closely behind with 84.In 2009 the show separated the Welsh C and Welsh D classes due to increasing demand, and that has proved to be winning formula with record entries again this year, with 43 and 59 respectively.Royal Highland Show Manager David Jackson, said: \u0026#8216The Highland continues to be the leading event for showcasing the very best the livestock industry has to offer, and it extremely rewarding that the industry continues to recognise its importance as a platform for the sector.\u0026#8216We continue to see very strong entries, with increasing numbers in many sections, especially in the commercial classes, and I know we will see some fierce competition for a winning place.\u0026#8216As an event, we grow year on year and attract new audiences as we widen the appeal for visitors from town and country. Yet we remain true to our roots as an agricultural show and work hard to be truly relevant to all aspects of farming and rural life.\u0026#8216The Grand Parade always proves to be a high point of the show and gives us a chance to celebrate the commitment and dedication of all our cattle and heavy horse exhibitors. I recommend everyone to make time to observe this truly spectacular display.\u0026#8216The team look forward to welcoming all our exhibitors, from the Scottish islands to South West England to Northern Ireland. They are dedicated to their craft, and I am extremely grateful for their continued support and wish them all the best of luck.\u0026#8217Supported by Royal Bank of Scotland, the 178th Royal Highland Show will take place at the Royal Highland Centre, Ingliston, Edinburgh, on June 21-24.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"ayr roundabout named among uks","story":"NewsAyr roundabout named among UK\u0027s worstWhitletts has landed an unenviable spot in the country’s top 10 road tests to avoid.\u0026nbspShareByStuart Wilson16:14, 28 MAY 2018NewsWhitletts roundabout is one of the most dangerous in the UK (Image: IAIN BROWN)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA roundabout branded ‘Witless’ for striking fear into drivers has been named among the UK’s worst. Whitletts has landed an unenviable spot in the country’s top 10 road tests to avoid. The list, published by recovery firm 24/7 Vehicle Rescue, claims the “nerve-jangling lottery” has put Ayr on the map for all the wrong reasons. It follows a \u0026pound3.5m scheme to increase lanes and install traffic lights on the roundabout in 2006, which has sparked trouble for many trying to negotiate its contours ever since. Transport Scotland held a safety review in 2015 after stats showed Whitletts was more dangerous than the giant M8 roundabout at Hermiston Gait near Edinburgh.  Ranjen Gohri, spokesman for 24/7 Vehicle Rescue, said: “Britain is famed for its roundabouts, and being able to safely negotiate them is a major part of driving in this country. “Unfortunately, many motorists are terrified of them. “This is not helped by some of the cases we’ve gathered that have a fearsome reputation and seem to almost unnerve drivers before they even get to them. “With the volume of traffic and unavoidable problems such as breakdowns, driving in the UK is difficult enough without having to attempt some of these roundabouts from hell.” Also making the top ten is Sheriffhall, which sits on Edinburgh’s city bypass, and Haudagain in Aberdeen, which is due for a \u0026pound30m redesign later this year.

Groom Stuart wore an Arran Mist kilt and plaid with matching navy jacket and gold tie. And the groomsmen wore Arran Mist tartan kilts with charcoal jackets and gold ties - exclusive to MacGregor \u0026amp MacDuff in Prestwick. The bridal party consisted of chief bridesmaid Eilidh McKenzie and bridesmaids Lynsey Ross, Raina Purba and Kirsteen Havlin. Making up the rest of the wedding party were best man Craig Marshall, ushers Les Lawrie, Dean Wear and Torin McKenzie, mother of the bride Una McKenzie and parents of the groom Yvonne and Fraser Murray. The couple celebrated being newlyweds with a trip to the sunshine. Erin said: “We squeezed in 10 nights in at the Centara Ras Fushi resort in the Maldives before Stuart went offshore again. “It was paradise! Our villa was right on the beach so it was perfect for watching the sunset.  Thistle \u0026amp Blink Photography from Kilmarnock captured the couple’s big day, leaving them with fond memories to relive. Emma Lawson of Betty Bluebell, based in East Kilbride, pieced together the bouquets with Ashley Nimmo, Ellis Dewhurst and Jett Paterson of Allure in Kilmarnock creating the hair and beauty looks for the day. As for their cake, the couple opted for four-tiers with all their favourite flavours, including red velvet. A local lady called Gianna made the cake, completed with a handmade topper by friend Rachel Currie. Erin added: “We would like to say a huge thank you to our families, bridesmaids and groomsmen for their help in the planning and execution of our dream wedding- it couldn’t have gone better! “Thank you to everyone who shared in our special day, your generosity and well wishes have been overwhelming. We had the best day ever!” Have you been married recently and would love to feature your big day?

Neighbours have slammed fast motorists in the Heathfield area and also in Whitletts Road. One resident claims an existing speed camera on Whitletts Road currently isn’t in operation and insist vehicles are zooming past her home at speeds of up to 50mph. She is calling for a speed camera further along the road to curb fast drivers. The concerned woman has called for the camera between Whitletts Road and Mainholm Road. Speaking at this month’s North Ayr Community Council, she said: “I am convinced the speed camera in Whitletts Road is not switched on. “I can hear cars at 6am or 7am travelling at more than 30mph coming into the town and the same going out.  “We need a speed camera.” Councillor Ian David said: “I am waiting for a response from the Partnership Panel as speeding in Whitletts Road was mentioned and it will be taken up with the police.” Speeding was also a hot topic discussed at last month’s Newton and Heathfield Community Council held in Newton Pavilion. Community councillors highlighted problems with speeding cars in Alderston Avenue and Northfield Avenue, and the problem of these streets being used by drivers as rat run to avoid the traffic lights in Prestwick Road. One woman said: “(There is) speeding in Alderston Avenue and there are a few children who stay in that street at the corner and the cars are turning right on to Northfield Avenue.” Police attending the meeting said they would do their best to monitor the situation. A council spokesman said Police Scotland/Safety Cameras Scotland administer speed cameras: “Safety cameras in Scotland are operated under the rules and guidelines of the Scottish Safety Camera Programme.”  A Police Scotland spokesman said: “The speed detection cameras are rotated around camera housing sites and have the ability to be used at any time. “You can find more information on the Scottish Safety Camera Programme and the location of camera sites by visiting www.safetycameras.gov.scot” In March, the Post reported that more than 13,000 speed offences have been captured on Ayrshire’s roads over the past three years Fast drivers were caught 13,103 times racing through the streets at breakneck speeds across the county from 2015 to 2017. And the highest clocked by a speed camera during that period was in 2016 at 140mph. Over last three years, a total of 715 speeding offences were detected in Ayr, 227 in Troon, 116 Prestwick, 32 in Maybole, 105 in Girvan and 88 in Cumnock.

Calls are mounting for civic head, Helen Moonie, to hold a bash at County Buildings, following Ayr’s first league title in 21 years. But the request could be snubbed in favour of a joint sporting celebration, the Post understands. A request for the engagement, lodged in the aftermath of Ayr’s success, is being considered by officials. Former cop Alasdair Malcolm, now a volunteer at Somerset Park, has called for the recognition. He said: “Every effort should be made to mark this fantastic achievement. “Ayr United are an integral part of the local community and, particularly through their Academy programme, have close working relationships throughout local schools and community groups. “The club, which has been a feature of the town since 1910, have had an outstanding season.” Ayr became the first club in the UK to score 100 goals in domestic competition en route to their title.  And their championship was the first to be clinched on home soil for 90 years. Mr Malcolm, secretary of the Ayrshire Golf Association, said: “It would be fitting if the local authority, by way of a civic reception or similar event, would mark the achievement of the management, players, officials and staff.” South Ayrshire Tory leader, Martin Dowey, added: “It is a wonderful achievement and one that is worthy of a civic reception. “A prosperous Ayr United is good for the town and we will be calling on all councillors to recognise the title win.” However, it’s believed there may be other invites on the guest list of any civic celebration. Carrick Rugby Club, three-time winners of the BT National Shield, and Commonwealth gold medallist Paul Foster, are among those in their thoughts. A council spokesman said: “A request has been received and will be considered in line with our civic hospitality guidelines.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"win a summer shopping spree","story":"NewsWin a summer shopping spreeTo help you get fashion and beauty- ready for summer, Debenhams at Ayr Central are hosting a fabulous VIP shopping event on Thursday June 7.\u0026nbspShareByAyrshire Post10:35, 30 MAY 2018Updated10:36, 30 MAY 2018NewsGet ready for summer and be in with a chance of winning a shopping spree\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailWIN A SUMMER SHOPPING SPREE!

Wren Kitchens will move into a 10,000sq ft unit at Heathfield this September, the Post can reveal. The firm, based in Lincolnshire, will make its first foray into Ayrshire when the store opens its doors. Its nearest outlet is currently more than 40 miles away at Abbotsinch, near Paisley. The addition comes as a welcome boost for park bosses, who are set to lose three retailers this year. Homebase will bow out on June 24, joining Carpetright and Maplin on the casualty list. The departures will see 50,000sq ft of trading space lost. However, Alastair Dickie, director at Heathfield’s developers Ediston Properties, said: “This is a positive piece of business. “Wren are an expanding company and this represents their first store in Ayrshire.  “They clearly view Ayr as a place to be and we are happy to have them on board. “It will mean jobs, not only in store but indirectly for fitters.” Wren will move into the unit vacated by the former PC World. The firm, which was founded in 2009, employs more than 4000 staff. It comes as park bosses prepare to seal a deal with another new name on site. Mr Dickie added: “Since acquiring the park we’ve let out ten units and don’t anticipate stopping there.” Ediston bought Heathfield in 2011 in a deal worth \u0026pound31.8 million. Retail giants such as M\u0026ampS, DFS and Costa have all moved in as part of the park’s overhaul in the intervening years.
