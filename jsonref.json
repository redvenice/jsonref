I\u0027m so happy to be joining the natural immunity club. Going to have a nap.\u0027 There has been much debate about the effectiveness of ivermectin during the pandemic after it was hailed as vaccine sceptics as a miracle cure. The hype started early in the pandemic when ivermectin was shown to destroy the virus in lab studies. Several dozen trials have also indicated that the pills may have some value in the pandemic - either by using them on patients with Covid, or as a preventative.But, according to a BBC investigation last year, around a third of studies advocating ivermectin\u0027s use were seriously flawed or biased in some way, making the results unreliable. Reviews by health authorities in the US, UK and EU have found there is insufficient evidence for using the drug against Covid.The first double-blind, gold-standard clinical trial into ivermectin is currently being carried out in Oxford, as part of the PRINCIPLE trial.Definitive results on the drug are expected this year.  Currently in the UK, health watchdogs do not recommend any clinicians prescribe the drug but, as a safe and approved medicine, it can be obtained privately. Fox recently got engaged to prep school teacher Arabella Fleetwood Neagle, 28.Miss Fleetwood Neagle apparently supports his political campaigning as she was pictured alongside him on the top deck of his Reclaim Party\u0027s battle bus during his unsuccessful bid to become London Mayor last year.Fox – whose acting dynasty includes his father James and cousin Emilia – was dropped by his agent in 2020 after a string of social media comments.Last year he said he could remove his children from school over his opposition to the Covid vaccination programme.He said he would educate them at home rather than let them be vaccinated without his consent.Fox shares custody of his boys with Miss Piper, whom he orced in 2016.  "},{"url":null,"title":"Biden plans sanctions against Putins inner circle DC Moscow prepare face UN","story":"Share this articleSubscribe to read | Financial TimesUS has identified Russian elites who will be sanctioned if Putin invades Ukraine - CNNPolitics"},{"url":null,"title":"Justin Trudeau says hes isolation COVID days skipping Ottawa secret location","story":"Share this articleIn this 2011 clip Whoopi says Judaism is part of her \u0027heritage\u0027Shocking moment man punches toddler in NYC restaurantWild moment driver shoots at man during road rage incidentMiss USA \u002719 Cheslie Kryst talks through her different hair looksIll-sounding Laurence Fox compares ibuprofen to Covid vaccineJoe Rogan Responds to Podcast Controversy, will \u0026quotBalance Things Out\u0026quotTrudeau says he won\u0027t meet Freedom Convoy because of hateful rhetoricDocumentary on radical Islam exposes diner with cubicles for womenUsman Bhatti stops smash \u0026amp grab gang with his gun at Maaz JewelersRoyal College of Nursing director supports vaccine mandate u-turnProtesting truckers and supporters converge on Parliament Hill | Toronto SunThousands opposed to COVID-19 rules converge on Parliament Hill, with more en route | CBC NewsOttawa Police on Twitter: \u0026quotDemonstration Update: Police resources are in place and will remain until crowds are dispersed.

The harsh reality is that some people simply cannot be deplatformed or cancelled and Joe Rogan is at the very top of that list.Ultimately, I don\u0027t know where Spotify will land but given the gargantuan financial investment they have made into Joe Rogan\u0027s show, I find it unlikely they will kick him off their platform because a bunch of irrelevant boomer musicians are demanding it.What I am certain of is that - no matter what happens - Joe Rogan and his loyal audience are not going anywhere, and instances like this where the media elite try to tell his fanbase what they can and can\u0027t listen to, only makes him more powerful."},{"url":null,"title":"college","story":"Options to consider \u0026ndash and reasons to be cheerful \u0026ndash when selecting your move after the examYou need to register now to apply for college through the CAO, but you have until July 1st to make a final decision on your course choiceCAO 2022: Most applicants get an outcome which enables them to successfully progress to the next stage of their educational journeyFrom nursing to engineering and environmental studies, there\u0026rsquos plenty of choiceThe Higher Education Access Route and Disability Access Route to Education schemes offer equitable access to higher education.Languages, health and engineering among areas likely to be needed by 2026Many arts graduates now entering marketing, advertising, journalism, technology and lawInstead of taking the traditional route, Denisa Zima chose an accounting apprenticeshipSubject area profiles: Law and Business"},{"url":null,"title":"dublin city council seeks to turn back the clock on build to rents","story":"Just one large scale BTR scheme has been granted in the docklands, 702 apartments at Castleforbes off Sherriff Street.Put forward as a niche concept seven years ago to solve a need for rental homes in specific areas of Dublin, the build-to-rent (BTR) sector has mushroomed to the point where it edged out most standard apartment development in the city and it is spreading its spores to the suburbs and beyond.

Photograph: Tom Honan The Government is to fund a €25 million investment to create a deep-water quay facility in Ros an Mhíl, Co Galway.Cabinet is to be briefed on the plans, which will be funded by the fishery harbour and coastal infrastructure programme, by Minister for Agriculture Charlie McConalogue on Tuesday. The intention is to bring facilities at the State-owned fishery harbour centre up to par with major fisheries hubs such as Killybegs, Co Donegal, and Castletownbere, Co Cork. Around €7 million worth of fish was landed at Ros a Mhíl in 2020, primarily from Irish vessels. However, it is anticipated that the deep-water quay will attract larger fishing vessels, including non-Irish trawlers. It will build out an additional 200m of quayside and add 70 per cent greater depth. It is believed that the new facilities could also allow for the development of other industries, including servicing offshore wind farms. The development of offshore wind off the west coast is seen as a key part of increasing the amount of wind power on the Irish electricity system. The wider capital investment programme will see €38.3 million invested in the State’s six fishery harbour centre. The aim is to underpin wider development of the sector, as well as dozens of local authority-owned piers and harbours. Under the scheme the department funds up to 75 per cent of the balance of approved projects, with local authorities coming up with the remainder.

Photograph: Alan Betson A draft Government plan to give the Personal Injuries Assessment Board (PIAB) a mediation role in insurance disputes has met resistance from insurance campaigners even before the measures go to Cabinet for approval.The proposal from Minister of State for Enterprise Robert Troy has led to claims that involving the PIAB in mediation would prolong disputes and increase costs, conflicting with the aim of quickly resolving cases at low cost. “People are voicing that issue,” said one Coalition figure with direct knowledge of Mr Troy’s proposal, referring to concern that mediation would lead to increased PIAB settlement costs. “A lot of Oireachtas members started getting emails just before the weekend. A lot of TDs are getting contacted.” The PIAB is a statutory body set up in 2003 with the objective of resolving insurance disputes “without the need for many associated litigation costs” the aim being to reduce the cost of claims. However, premiums have continued to rise and campaigners have long pressed for deeper and more far-reaching reforms in the market to drive insurance costs down. Mr Troy circulated outline plans to overhaul the PIAB to government departments in recent days, seeking observations before a final proposal is prepared for the Cabinet. The move quickly led to complaints to Ministers from TDs as details about the mediation plan leaked out. Owner of Supermac’s fast-food chain Pat McDonagh, a prominent advocate for insurance reform, said PIAB mediation could be self-defeating as it would keep lawyers at the table and help maintain the “unique exorbitant cost of claims resolution” in the Irish market. “Any attempt to have mediation included as a new step in the legislation to reform PIAB will weaken PIAB, not strengthen it. It will prolong matters, increase costs and it is impossible to see how it will assist if liability for a claim is not accepted by a defendant,” he said. “As the economy eventually recovers from this Covid catastrophe, without legislative change done now, many citizens and SMEs may not be able to afford insurance as the country reopens.”There was no specific comment from Mr Troy’s office on the mediation proposal or the objections raised against it.“Proposals have not yet been put to Government for consideration. Minister Troy intends to publish the proposals once Government approval is received,” said a spokeswoman in response to questions from The .Mr Troy’s “ambition” for PIAB was to increase the number of personal injury claims it processed and ensure the procedure was cost-effective and concluded in a timely manner, she added.“He has met with SMEs, representative bodies, and PIAB regularly to inform the development of proposals to enhance its role. A public consultation was launched in March last year seeking views from all interested parties and these were carefully considered.”She said Mr Troy had “exhausted all avenues” to ensure any new proposals were robust and fit for purpose to achieve his aims. “This work to reform and enhance PIAB is just one part of the Government’s reform agenda to tackle the high cost of insurance.”Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"tolka river plans among last of btr schemes","story":"The Richmond Road complex would have 104 one-bedroom and 79 two-bedroom apartments.Plans for 10-storey build-to-rent scheme of 183 apartments beside the Tolka River in Drumcondra, have been presented to Dublin City Council. The system, under which applications were made to An Bord Pleanála, will lapse from February 25th and be replaced by the large scale residential development (LRD) process, where applications are made to city and county councils.Transitional arrangements will be in place for developers who had already begun the pre-application stage of SHD process before December 17th last. Local Fianna Fail councillor Deirdre Heney asked that the council write to An Bord Pleanála asking it to take the council’s proposed build-to-rent (BTR) changes into account when assessing the Richmond Road scheme.Proposed policy changeThe council plans to restrict the number of rental-only apartments in BTR developments and to limit the number small apartments. The Richmond Road complex would have 104 one-bedroom and 79 two-bedroom apartments.DCC planner Shane Healy said the council could note the proposed policy change in its submission to the board, but could “not compel a development to reduce the number of build to rent”.Mr Healy said he shared councillors’ concerns in relation to the height and lack of three-bedroom apartments in the complex but this application would have to assessed under current “national guidelines on height and unit mix”.Another build-to-rent application, of 162 apartments up to 13 storeys on Prussia Street beside Grangegorman in Dublin 7, will be presented to councillors on Tuesday.Meanwhile, opposition is mounting to a recent BTR application in south east Dublin, with more than 800 residents signing a petition against the Glenageary Gate SHD of 147 apartments in blocks up to nine storeys tall.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"whistleblower channels to be mandatory for firms employing more than 50","story":"Minister for Public Expenditure Michael McGrath:  will seek approval to publish the Protected Disclosures (Amendment) Bill 2021, which the Coalition hopes will be passed into law by summer.  Photograph:  Gareth ChaneyCollins Companies with more than 50 workers will have to establish formal channels for whistleblowers to come forward, under new laws set to be approved by Cabinet on Tuesday. Minister for Public Expenditure Michael McGrath will seek approval to publish the Protected Disclosures (Amendment) Bill 2021, which the Coalition hopes will be passed into law by the summer. The Bill, to be considered by Cabinet when it meets at Dublin Castle on Tuesday morning, requires private sector organisations with 50 or more employees to establish formal channels and procedures for their employees to make protected disclosures, as is the case currently in the public sector. It also reverses the “burden of proof” when a worker takes a case alleging penalisation for making a protected disclosure to the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC) or to the courts. Under the Bill, the presumption will be that an alleged act of penalisation occurred because the worker made a protected disclosure, unless the employer can prove otherwise. Protected disclosureProtections will be expanded beyond traditional employment relationships to include volunteers, unpaid trainees, board members, shareholders, suppliers and job applicants. These categories of people will be able to take a case to the WRC if they feel they have been harmed because they made a protected disclosure. The Bill will create new obligations for employers and others who receive protected disclosures, including a requirement to provide feedback to the reporting person on the actions taken within three months. They will also have to acknowledge receipt of the disclosure within seven days and follow up on the information it contains. Elsewhere, a new right to a “social identity” for people whose adoptions were incorrectly or illegally registered is to be created, under plans going to Cabinet.The approach is designed to rectify the current situation whereby a person incorrectly adopted does not have a legal right to be recognised by the name and identity they were raised under. Digital strategyThey will also be able to claim inheritance rights to the estates of both their birth parents and their adoptive parents. The new succession rights will only apply to deaths which occur from when the legislation is enacted. Meanwhile, the national digital strategy will also be approved by Cabinet today.Under the plan which is being brought by the Department of Business and Tánaiste Leo Varadkar, all populated areas will be covered by 5G no later than 2030. Sources have said that the plan will also commit to having 90 per cent of public services consumed online by the same date in 2030.The plan will also have an emphasis on education and will commit to making sure at least 80 per cent of adults will have the most basic of digital literacy skills by the same date.The Government will state that the digital world will become an increasing part of the fabric of everyday life and that preparations are needed for this. Ministers are due to discuss the rapid changes in the use of technology that have been brought about by the pandemic. Sources said that there would be risks that need to be managed and that a memo would deal with plans to invest in cybersecurity, regarded as particularly important given last year’s cyberattack on the health service.Minister for Children Roderic O’Gorman will also seek Government approval to submit annual reports to the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.

File photograph: John ThysAFP via Getty ImagesThe European Union ombudsman accused the European Commission of maladministration on Friday for not disclosing text messages that the head of the EU executive, Ursula von der Leyen, exchanged with Pfizer chief Albert Bourla to seal a Covid-19 vaccine deal.In an interview in April, Ms Von der Leyen revealed she had exchanged texts with Mr Bourla for a month when they were negotiating a vaccine contract for the bloc. But in response to a public access request by a journalist, the commission later said no record had been kept of such messages.“The narrow way in which this public access request was treated meant that no attempt was made to identify if any text messages existed,” said ombudsman Emily O’Reilly.“The ombudsman found that this amounted to maladministration,” the watchdog said in a statement, asking the commission to check again for the relevant messages and to reply to the recommendation by April 26th.“If text messages concern EU policies and decisions, they should be treated as EU documents,” the ombudsman added.A spokesman for the commission later on Friday declined to comment about whether the texts had been cancelled and whether they were exchanged with a private or a professional telephone.He told journalists the EU executive would reply to the ombudsman by the deadline and noted EU rules required the commission to register documents, with no specific requirement to store text messages as long as they were not treated as documents.The ombudsman’s recommendations are not binding, but usually trigger heightened scrutiny from the European Parliament. “The European Commission has become less transparent, less accountable to the European Parliament and frankly more unhinged from European democracy,” said liberal Dutch MEP Sophia In ‘t Veld.The deal negotiated via text messages and calls, according to what Ms Von der Leyen herself said in an interview with the New York Times, was the biggest contract ever sealed for Covid-19 vaccines, with the EU committing to buy 900 million Pfizer-BioNTech shots, with an option to buy another 900 million.When the deal was formally announced in May, the EU had already secured hundreds of millions of vaccines from several drug-makers, including another 600 million doses from Pfizer and BioNTech under two previous contracts with the two companies. – ReutersEverything you need to know about the Covid-19

scheming","story":"Anne Boleyn’s childhood home is launching a new exhibition to shed a “feminist” light on the queen and dispel the myth of her as a “scheming” mistress.She was accused of adultery and executed for treason in 1536, and experts have argued that the charges laid against her by men five centuries ago have lumbered her with an unfair reputation as a wily seductress ever since.A new exhibition at her childhood home at Hever Castle in Kent will seek to portray her in a more “feminist” light as an educated woman who made history in her own right, and not simply a “headless queen”.Featuring a miniature portrait of Anne that has never been displayed before, the show will mark the 500th anniversary of her debut in the court of Henry VIII, and use personal possessions to offer a humanising history of her early life before her fatal marriage.Dr Owen Emmerson, the curator of the exhibition, said: “We\u0027re really trying to challenge the idea that she and her family were scheming, grasping courtiers on the rise. We’re trying to dispel these myths.“It’s very difficult to try and claim Anne herself was a feminist, the concept hadn’t been invented yet.“But there has been a move to see her life and struggles in a feminist light. She was transgressive, she did break the rules of the time, she supported education for women.”He added: “Her life is so often told backwards, starting with her execution for treason, and then seen through that lens - but her execution was a stitch-up and it doesn\u0027t tell the whole story.“She was not just the scandalous wife, but played an active part, she played her role in history, and, actually, she changed history“It’s about time that we recognise that, and not just see as this headless Queen.”Becoming Anne: Connections, Culture, Court open on 4 March - 500 years to the day she entered English court life - and will use contemporary portraits and letters written at the time to explain her family’s rise from country gentry to royalty.Miniature portraits of Anne and the political players active during the 16th century, including Anne’s uncle Thomas Howard and King Francis I of France, will go on display alongside a recreation of the dress she wore to her first pageant at the English court in 1522.More from NewsTalking about death better than ‘giving aggressive treatments to prolong life’Liz Truss and Nadhim Zahawi test positive for Covid-19 just hours apartBoris Johnson puts Vladimir Putin on hold, allowing France to seize diplomatic initiativeBoris Johnson launches bid to win over MPs as government minister resignsBoris Johnson to ask Sue Gray for new ‘partygate’ reportHangover EU rules for television have a ‘chilling effect’ on free speech, warns governmentMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"boris isnt hook yet","story":"Just a few hours ago, the operation to rescue Boris Johnson appeared to be going according to plan. The interim Sue Gray report – or, as she called it, update – was unable to give a complete assessment into the partying ways of No 10. There was no clinching condemnatory phrase in the 12-page document. In the Commons, Johnson started off well enough, expressing what seemed like genuine remorse about the things that had gone wrong in Downing Street. But after being needled by Keir Starmer, a strain of impetuosity emerged that visibly concerned some backbenchers who had been minded to help him tough things out.A below-the-belt, barked-out comment about Starmer failing to prosecute Jimmy Savile may have been no more than retaliation for the deeply personal condemnation levelled at Johnson, that throughout his life, he has damaged everything and everyone along the way”. But this was supposed to be Johnson’s day of contrition and yet he could not bring himself to take an extended pasting with prime ministerial dignity and without firing back.After Starmer’s attack there followed wounding interventions from Theresa May and Andrew Mitchell on his own side – the latter sitting next to last week’s would-be assassin David Davis – and suddenly the supportive body language on the Tory benches was much reduced. The “partygate” furore is now back on the boil and all those who claimed that the PM can’t change his nature or his ways have seen their arguments strengthened.He can still tough it out and succeed in rallying his Commons troops and the wider Tory tribe behind him. But to do so he must first properly internalise the criticisms contained within the Gray report instead of acting like a spoiled child who will not be scolded. A meeting with all Tory MPs due this evening will be another crucial event in this, the first of at least two “Gray Days” he must go through before he can move clear of the tentacles of this whole affair.The most crucial phase of the scandal will surely come when the work of the politan Police is done. The fact that they are investigating a dozen gatherings – several of which the Prime Minister andor his wife attended – is chastening.After Johnson’s comprehensive victory at last week’s PMQs, Starmer won this round in the Commons. A Labour leader who tried to rat on the EU referendum verdict had quite a nerve to accuse the Prime Minister of “fraying the bonds of trust between the Government and the public, eroding our democracy”. But from Starmer’s point of view the needling worked. The pressure told. Instead of gently mocking him for his Brexit shenanigans, the Prime Minister snapped back wildly when he was meant to be playing rope-a-dope. He is not yet free of this quagmire.More from NewsTalking about death better than ‘giving aggressive treatments to prolong life’Liz Truss and Nadhim Zahawi test positive for Covid-19 just hours apartBoris Johnson puts Vladimir Putin on hold, allowing France to seize diplomatic initiativeBoris Johnson launches bid to win over MPs as government minister resignsBoris Johnson to ask Sue Gray for new ‘partygate’ reportHangover EU rules for television have a ‘chilling effect’ on free speech, warns governmentMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"female banker shouted male colleagues catchphrase not now stacey","story":"A female banker who was shouted down by male colleagues with the catchphrase “not now Stacey” has won more than £2 million in compensation for sexual discrimination. Stacey Macken sued French bank BNP Paribas after being belittled by her boss, who used the phrase so often that colleagues copied it.The finance specialist, who earned £120,000 a year, claimed that over a four-year period, she received hundreds of thousands of pounds less than her male peers in salary and bonuses, adding that once she complained, managers targeted her with unfair treatment. Now, Miss Macken has won £2,081,449 in one of the largest awards ever made by a British tribunal.The London Central tribunal heard Miss Macken, 50, was hired by BNP Paribas in 2013. Unbeknown to her, a male recruit hired with the same job title and responsibilities was being paid £160,000.Within months of joining, she claimed that she was exposed to sexist behaviour involving one of her bosses in the prime brokerage team, Matt Pinnock. Georgina Chapman, his former PA, told a tribunal that a “large Halloween-style black witch’s hat” was left on Miss Macken’s desk after some of the team, including Mr Pinnock, had gone to the pub towards the end of the day. Ms Chapman said “they were visibly drunk” when they returned to the office that evening.The next morning, upon discovering the hat, Miss Macken asked Ms Chapman if she knew who had put it there.“I told her that I did not know, but I suspected it was one of the drunk team members, because they were the only people in that area of the office the evening before, which, combined with their drunkenness, made them most likely to have done it,” Ms Chapman said. “Stacey was visibly upset and confided in me that she felt really uncomfortable working with those male colleagues, knowing that one of them had purposefully gone out of their way to leave a witch’s hat on her desk.”Denis Pihan, another boss, was accused of routinely demeaning her by replying “not now, Stacey” when she tried to talk to him. Miss Macken made repeated internal complaints about her treatment, in particular relating to her pay and bonuses.Eventually, she took the bank to a tribunal, claiming more than £4 million in compensation and back pay.The tribunal heard that in her first four years, her male peer was paid more than £167,000 in bonuses compared to the £33,000 she received. The bank claimed it had hired her as a junior and that her male colleague deserved his higher salary because he was her senior.Miss Macken, from Fulham, south-west London, was successful in her claims of sex discrimination, victimisation, and unequal pay.The tribunal ruled that leaving a witch’s hat on her desk was an “inherently sexist act” and the regular use of “not now, Stacey” was branded a “demeaning comment”.At Miss Macken’s compensation hearing, Emma Burns, the employment judge, said that “Mr Pinnock and Mr Pihan behaved spitefully and vindictively” because she had raised concerns about her pay, and that they had a “discriminatory motive”.Mr Pihan “apologised for causing distress” at the tribunal, but “did not acknowledge that he personally discriminated against Miss Macken, nor did he apologise for discriminating against her”. The bank claimed it has now adopted a “detailed Gender Strategy and Gender Action Plan” in response to its poor gender pay gap and is “trying to increase the number of women at senior management level”.Miss Macken’s claims of harassment were dismissed and she lost a claim for damages over the “stigma” she suffered in this case. As part of her £2 million compensation fee, she received £51,400 to cover “pain and suffering” caused, £35,000 to cover injury to feelings, and £15,000 in “aggravated damages”. “We are pleased that the Tribunal recognised the seriousness with which we have taken its findings and the major steps forward we have made to try to ensure that nothing like this happens again.”More from NewsTalking about death better than ‘giving aggressive treatments to prolong life’Liz Truss and Nadhim Zahawi test positive for Covid-19 just hours apartBoris Johnson puts Vladimir Putin on hold, allowing France to seize diplomatic initiativeBoris Johnson launches bid to win over MPs as government minister resignsBoris Johnson to ask Sue Gray for new ‘partygate’ reportHangover EU rules for television have a ‘chilling effect’ on free speech, warns governmentMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"see men objects","story":"Do you see presidents in peppers, houses that look like Hitler and the son of God in your sourdough?

According to new research, the brain is more likely to spot young male faces in objects than the physiognomy of older women – but is that down to social conditioning, hardwiring, or are our eyes not-so-secretly sexist?Susan Wardle, research fellow at the Laboratory of Brain and Cognition at the National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, and the paper’s lead author, charted the responses of almost 4,000 people to everyday objects and found that illusory faces in inanimate objects are readily perceived to have a specific emotional expression, age, and gender. Participants were asked to state whether each item had a gender – and male faces were found four times as often as female ones. ‘This male bias could not be explained by pre-existing semantic or visual gender associations with the objects, or by visual features in the images,’ the paper found. ‘Cognitive bias’ was definitely at play, they added, but they are yet to discern how this occurs. One theory is that we more often see chaps in our chips as a result of ‘threat perception’ – where, historically speaking, assuming that a quickly-glimpsed face is male and a threat functions as a defence mechanism, alerting the viewer to the possibility of conflict. Then, there is the case that humans were exposed to more male faces during the earliest stages of development, further upping our likelihood of seeing them in lieu of female ones. ‘The origin of the bias – whether from social conditioning or from perceptual factors such as our visual diet of faces during development – remains an open question,’ according to researchers.Emotions were also frequently attached to the images participants were shown – leading to judgments of potatoes as listless, and handbags as sad. Dabblers in internet culture will know that finding faces in everyday objects – which research previously assumed was an early sign of psychosis – is nowadays grounds for going viral, with a smattering of social media accounts dedicated to sharing the best (one of which had several hundreds of thousands of followers until being suspended). From screaming plug sockets to sleepy pies, angry car bumpers and doleful bath taps, even the most vague approximation of facial features in unlikely places is enough to send online users into a tailspin. Primates do it too (though are probably less inclined to share their finds on the internet) a 2017 study found that animals such as the rhesus monkey experienced face pareidolia, poring over photos of illusory faces far longer than those without. “Face recognition is very important,” says Professor David Alais, psychology professor at the University of Sydney, adding that they are “detected incredibly fast. The brain seems to do this… using a kind of template-matching procedure, so if it sees an object that appears to have two eyes above a nose above a mouth, then it goes, ‘Oh, I’m seeing a face.’There seem to be certain faces we see more often – including that of Richard Nixon, whose resemblance to a range of vegetables, from peppers to aubergines, has proven catnip for the armchair pareidoliac. Jesus also has (typically food-based) form, showing up on toast and in the dregs of Marmite jars in crisps and banana skins, pancakes and potatoes. Elvis Presley is another common spot, making his presence known via cloud formations and ketchup-covered chips. Distinct features – such as pronounced jaws, a la the King and Nixon, or the messiah’s flowing locks - could be why certain faces seem to appear so frequently, though researchers have yet to investigate.As elsewhere in life (albeit a touch less importantly here) women are less likely to take centre stage. That’s not to say they’re completely absent from the ardent face pareidoliac’s findings, however: Whoopi Goldberg’s resemblance to a red onion has been documented, ditto an approximation of Mother Theresa and fellow nuns in cinnamon buns one jelly bean resembling the Duchess of Cambridge was listed on eBay at a starting bid of £596, while a toasted cheese sandwich ‘depicting’ the Virgin Mary sold on the same site for over £20,000. It’s a lot of dough for what was, at the point of purchase, a decade-old lunch – but the internet casino that bought it remained confident that this integral “part of pop culture” was worthy of the sum, and a subsequent world tour. Manna(chego) from heaven, perhaps, or plain madness more like.Still, there are more upsides to conjuring facial features where they may not be than not seeing them at all, Prof Alais suggests. “From an evolutionary perspective, it seems that the benefit of never missing a face far outweighs the errors where inanimate objects are seen as faces… when objects look compellingly face-like, it is more than an interpretation: they really are driving your brain’s face detection network.” Calculating the expressions of those faces is key, he adds, to determining whether “they are a friend or a foe.” Seeing the Cookie Monster in a loo-roll-hauling lorry or Donald Trump in a butter tub is central to survival: you heard it here first.More from NewsTalking about death better than ‘giving aggressive treatments to prolong life’Liz Truss and Nadhim Zahawi test positive for Covid-19 just hours apartBoris Johnson puts Vladimir Putin on hold, allowing France to seize diplomatic initiativeBoris Johnson launches bid to win over MPs as government minister resignsBoris Johnson to ask Sue Gray for new ‘partygate’ reportHangover EU rules for television have a ‘chilling effect’ on free speech, warns governmentMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"sir david amess seat deserves proper by election","story":"By-elections to the House of Commons are important affairs, especially when held in the middle of a parliamentary term. They can shake governments, give rise to novel protests and reflect local quirks. They can embody all the vitality and magic of democracy, with previously nailed-on winners defeated, and new, unlikely voices given a national platform. That is unless your MP was recently murdered in office. Then, by new consensus, the normal business of democracy is suspended.This week, my constituency of Southend West will hold a by-election to elect a successor to Sir David Amess, who was killed while conducting a constituency surgery in October last year. I normally love elections and enjoy casting my ballot. But this time, I won\u0027t be voting.Before his murder, Sir David was my MP for all but a few months of my life. I’d volunteered in his office as a schoolboy. I saw him around every so often. He was a constituency MP to his core, and as many of his colleagues and caseworkers attested after his death, he frequently refused to rein in his independence in Parliament in exchange for promotion.I’ve surveyed the campaign literature of Anna Firth, his designated replacement. A smooth-talking barrister, Firth was a parliamentary candidate in London’s Erith and Thamesmead in the 2015 general election, and a candidate for Canterbury in 2019, which she lost with a swing to Labour against the national average. She was for much of the last decade a district councillor in Sevenoaks, in Kent. A loyal party worker then, willing to travel. Good candidates from major parties might have been able to prompt her to say a little more during the campaign. But here’s the problem – none of them are standing. Due to the circumstances of Sir Amess\u0027 death, the election is being vacated to the Tories by other major Westminster parties. It’s going to be a coronation.The parties are treading on eggshells after the murder of one of their own. They did the same after Jo Cox’s murder in 2016. But an uncontested election after the killing of an MP seems less like the dignified suspension of normal politics – and more like deciding arbitrarily that the public won’t bear a contest. Oddballs are normally drawn to by-elections, and this one is no different. My constituency will soon briefly accommodate the electoral tourists Jayda Fransen, formerly of Britain First, and Catherine Blaiklock, the founding leader of the Brexit Party (now Reform UK). You can have some debate between the consensus and the fringe, certainly. But with one candidate anointed by the mainstream, and the rest a bunch of oddities not even expecting to win, how much value can this campaign truly have?There seems no reason why major parties should leave a by-election, even in as safe a seat as Southend West, uncontested – even for sentimental reasons.By-elections are sometimes upsets, and they are often bellwethers of public dissent against the government of the day. It is disappointing to allow so synthetic an election to follow the death of such an independent-minded MP as Sir David.More from NewsTalking about death better than ‘giving aggressive treatments to prolong life’Liz Truss and Nadhim Zahawi test positive for Covid-19 just hours apartBoris Johnson puts Vladimir Putin on hold, allowing France to seize diplomatic initiativeBoris Johnson launches bid to win over MPs as government minister resignsBoris Johnson to ask Sue Gray for new ‘partygate’ reportHangover EU rules for television have a ‘chilling effect’ on free speech, warns governmentMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"tiktok phenomenon sees book sales skyrocket","story":"The rise of “BookTok” is driving teenagers and young adults into bookshops in numbers not seen since the Harry Potter years, according to the head of Waterstones.Sales of new books are booming after being recommended by influencers on TikTok, the social media app - but some classics are also becoming unlikely viral sensations.“These last three or four weeks in the United States, James Joyce’s Ulysses has been a significant seller because on TikTok the kids are getting excited about it,” said James Daunt, managing director of Waterstones and chief executive of the US chain Barnes \u0026amp Noble.The #BookTok hashtag has had 37.4 billion views and popular influencers tend to be young women, mostly recommending books by female authors.Mr Daunt said they were helping to make bookshops popular with young people, reminding him of the decade from 1997-2007 which saw publication of JK Rowling’s Harry Potter series.“It is back to that kind of energy in our stores. Our challenge now is that we absolutely have to keep those customers, as we did with the Harry Potter generation. It stepped booksellers up and it stepped book sales up,” Mr Daunt told a bookselling conference in Italy, reported in The Bookseller.Waterstones runs its own TikTok account as a marketing tool and Mr Daunt explained: “It’s about fun and enjoyment and enthusiasm and the people who do it brilliantly are of the same generation - it’s our young booksellers and we let them get on with it.”He joked: “We have generally found that the people with blue hair do better than the people with sensible haircuts.”Barnes \u0026amp Noble has dedicated a section of its website to books recommended on TikTok. Even WH Smith groups some of its books under the tag “TikTok made me buy it!”Books that have benefited from the TikTok effect include The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo by Taylor Jenkins Read, It Ends With Us by Colleen Hoover and The Song of Achilles by Madeline Miller.Hoover’s book sold 21,000 copies on its release in 2016, but sales were reignited at the end of 2020 when TikTokers began posting about it. By summer 2021, according to Publishers Weekly, it had sold 450,000 copies.Sally Rooney’s Normal People and the Hanya Yanagihara novel A Little Life are also frequently recommended. The Barnes \u0026amp Noble list features classic titles The Great Gatsby, Pride and Prejudice and Wuthering Heights.The New York Times reported on the phenomenon with the headline “How Crying on TikTok Sells Books”, noting that tear-jerking novels were particularly popular. One of the most popular British “BookTok” stars is 22-year-old Abby Parker, who has amassed 428,000 followers.Often, Parker’s videos consist of her brandishing a book while a caption runs on screen and a soundtrack plays over it. Her recommendation for The Secret History, Donna Tartt’s 1992 bestseller, said simply: “No because never has an opening line hooked me faster. I’ve never been so excited to start a book.”Parker told Amazon last year: “I’ve always dreamed of sharing my love for books with the world and TikTok has finally been my gateway into doing just that. Getting completely involved with the book community this past year has been truly one of the greatest things I’ve ever done in my life.”The popularity of Ulysses, which many readers find to be impenetrable, is more difficult to explain. However, several TikTokers have introduced Joyce and his novels to a wider audience by discussing the racy letters he wrote to his wife, Nora.Joyce features in a video by Esme Louise James, an Australian PhD candidate who runs an irreverent account called Kinky History.More from NewsTalking about death better than ‘giving aggressive treatments to prolong life’Liz Truss and Nadhim Zahawi test positive for Covid-19 just hours apartBoris Johnson puts Vladimir Putin on hold, allowing France to seize diplomatic initiativeBoris Johnson launches bid to win over MPs as government minister resignsBoris Johnson to ask Sue Gray for new ‘partygate’ reportHangover EU rules for television have a ‘chilling effect’ on free speech, warns governmentMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"16 parties investigated sue gray","story":"All  parties investigated by Sue Gray - including  probed by policeSenior civil servant Sue Gray found failures of leadership and judgement over the Downing Street lockdown parties, including one allegedly held just hours before the Queen buried Prince Philip aloneBoris Johnson is under pressure after Sue Gray found failures of leadership and judgement over the parties Image: AFP via Getty ImagesByMatthew DreschNews Reporter:,  Jan |commentsSue Grayaposs report investigated  Downing Street parties, including  being probed by police.

On Tuesday, January , over a dozen Tory MPs are thought to have met to conspire over Boris Johnson’s future in a gathering dubbed as the ‘pork pie plot.’ While some MPs have publicly urged Johnson to quit over the Downing Street parties held during the  lockdown, several MPs have reportedly already submitted their no confidence letters to the  Committee chaired by Sir Graham Brady.Here’s what you need to know about a no confidence vote and what will happen next now that the Sue Gray report has been published.

For instance, veteran backbencher Sir Roger Gale and Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross both confirmed that they had submitted their letters. If the  letters are sent to the  Committee, then a vote is held with a secret ballot of Tory MPs taking place.

What would happenBoris Johnson is ousted from his position  If majority votes against Johnson, a leadership contest to choose the countryaposs next leader would get underway immediately in the Conservative Party.Any leader who loses a confidence vote is not allowed to take part in the next leadership contest, so Johnson would not be able to compete.

I lost hope when I walked half a mile to find the nearest police station, only to discover it was closed. Eventually you just give up and get on with it. The aggravation, the bureaucracy, the deep sighs when you call up to get an update, the waiting on hold, the going through it all for the umpteenth time because the person dealing with it is on leave, the feeling that once they hang up they’ll forget they’d ever spoken to you. It all stops being worth it.It is easy, then, to see why, out of , burglaries between April  and April last year, just , were solved while – wait for it – , cases were abandoned, according to official statistics.Easy, too, to understand why police solved just % of burglaries last year compared with nearly .% six years ago. While Home Secretary Priti Patel is playing to her rabid gallery, enforcing her hostile environment and pinching ­metaphorical le rafts away from human beings in the English Channel, criminals are being allowed a free pass. Hyperbole  Not really. Home Office ­statistics suggest the number of crimes solved across the board has plunged to a record low with just one in  resulting in a charge.

Ludicrously seeking to pin blame for Jimmy Savile on Keir Starmer, the Labour leader’s devastating takedown of Johnson clearly stinging, should’ve had doctors in white coats shepherding the PM to safety.  Johnson undoubtedly lost friends and alienated people yet the great unknown remains how many mutineers will add their signatures to the estimated  or  Conservative MPs already demanding a ballot to oust the PM. The magic number is  to trigger a contest then  to guarantee Johnson’s head on a silver platter to end the Partygate nightmare. Damning evidence in civil servant Sue Gray’s censored report is merely the end of the beginning rather than the beginning of the end in a totemic scandal displaying why Johnson’s unfit for high office.  With the cops criminally investigating him, studying more than  photographs and  pieces of paper linked to a dirty dozen potentially illegal parties, including one in the Downing Street flat and another with a birthday cake plus a pair featuring a DJ and suitcase of booze on the eve of the Duke of Edinburgh’s funeral, it’s going to get worse, not better. Johnson initially refusing a past pledge to guarantee eventual publication of Gray’s full report smacks of panic. Tory grandees Theresa May and Andrew Mitchell put the boot in viciously.

Theof his term may now depend on Sue Grays Partygate report findings, which were released this afternoonA bad result for the PM could spell the end of his time in Britains highest office Image: Getty ImagesByBenjamin LynchTrends Writer:,  Jan Updated:,  Jan |commentsBoris Johnson isnapost out of the woods yet as he faces the fallout from Sue Grayaposs eagerly anticipated Partygate report. The Prime Minister is under huge pressure to vacate his current post after controversy over parties that occurred at No  Downing Street during the height of lockdown. Before Sue Grayaposs findings were released on Monday January , he had already admitted attending one party after previously assuring the House of Commons that he was furious at such behaviour. Prior to the reportaposs publication, several Tory MPs had called for the PM to resign, including former Brexit minister David Davis.The report by Sue Gray into several alleged parties at No  during the coronavirus lockdown - which saw people locked away in their homes and unable to visit loved ones as they died in hospital - was finally published today.So what will this mean for the PM   Committee  If % of Tory MPs submit a letter of no-confidence in the Prime Minister, this will trigger a vote on his future. By the current number of Tory MPs that means  letters must be sent in. A majority of Tory MPs then have to vote onthey want him to stay on in the UKaposs highest office. If he wins that vote, he cannot be challenged for another year but will be removed as leader of the Conservativeshe loses.  Itaposs yet to be seen whether the Sue Gray report will result in a flurry of letters sent to committee chairman Sir Graham Brady this week, which could trigger the vote. The police and possible resignation  It is entirely possible that, should the findings of the report cause enough uproar, Boris Johnson will be forced to resign. This would most likely occurTory MPs deem there to be no other option other than to try and remove the former London mayor from office. Meanwhile, Paymaster General Michael Ellis previously said: If evidence emerges of what was potentially a criminal offence, the matter would be referred to the politan Police. Several members of the general public were fined for breaking lockdown rules during the height of the pandemic. Wait until the findings of the Sue Gray report  When allegations swirled of his attendance at multiple Downing Street parties, the PMaposs defence against any potential wrongdoing was to urge the public and angry MPs to wait until the findings of the Sue Gray report were published. Some were unsurethis was a plot to buy himself more time in the role, orthe PM was confident that the report would vindicate him. It may be one reason that, as the Conservatives face a huge slump in the polls, Tory MPs had decided not to get rid of Johnson just yet. However,the reportaposs findings are indeed damning for the PM, it is unlikely MPs will continue to back him. But as the nine-page report doesnapost go into detail about the parties the Met Police are looking into, Johnson may hang on in there for a few more months.The PM was a key factor behind the large majority won in the  general election, in which the Tories took a host of traditional aposred wallapos seats away from the Labour Party.MPs in those seats may not be keen to see the PM resign, as it is possible they see Johnson as important to their chances of re-election. If the findings do not implicate the PM, it could regain him the support of MPs teetering on the edge of writing a letter of no-confidence.One red wall MP, Christian Wakeford of Bury South, already defected to Labour this month. He has alleged that he was threatened with having funding for a new school in his constituency pulledhe didnapost toe the line on a government vote.What does Sue Grayaposs report say   Ms Grayaposs nine-page report sets out some of her findings - but as the Met Police is also launching an investigation, she hasnapost been able to look in detail at all the separate party allegations.Her update said at least some of the gatherings were a serious failure to observe not just the high standards expected of those working at the heart of Government, but also of the standards expected of the entire British population at the time. It also revealed Scotland Yard are probing  out of the  parties she investigated - including Boris Johnsonaposs birthday party. But the report was stripped of key details after the Met Police asked Ms Gray to make only minimal reference to  of the gatherings in her report. Ms Gray conceded: I am extremely limited in what I can say about those events. It is not possible at present to provide a meaningful report setting out and analysing the extensive factual information I have been able to gather. Downing Street police officers have been quizzed about the partygate allegations. According to previous reports, their statements have been described as aposextremely damningapos. One source said: Met officers have spoken to Sue Gray now, as you would expect, and have been able to provide a lot of information. Some MPs have criticised that the report is being conducted by Gray, supposedly known for her hard-line stance on ethics in the government. However, Gray is essentially in the position where she is reporting on her own bosses. She also has no power to recommend any punishment by way of resignations. MP Chris Bryant said on Twitter: To be clear, Sue Gray is not aposindependentapos. She may be independently minded. But she’s a civil servant reporting on her boss.

These include the bring your own booze party on May , Boris Johnson stuttered and struggled at ious points during his statement to the house after Sue Grays redacted reportopinionByAdam Wagner, Barrister at Doughty Street Chambers and visiting professor of law at Goldsmith and an expert in Covid laws:,  Jan |comments The long-awaited Sue Gray report contained some contradictions.A “report” which Gray called an “update”. A process which was meant to produce factual findings but not general conclusions and which ultimately did the opposite. Most importantly, this update did not provide the judgment day which both the public and MPs were eagerly awaiting for.The best way to think of this short document is that it was, to paraphrase the Prime Minister ’s favourite, Churchill, not the beginning of the end but the end of the beginning for Partygate.Despite it being just an update, Gray’s document did provide three important things.  First, Gray revealed which gatherings are being investigated by the police -  of the  Gray had looked at. These include the “bring your own booze” party on  May , which the Prime Minister attended, the Prime Minister’s birthday party on  June  and the leaving party which is alleged to have taken place in his own flat on  November . In Parliament he refused to say whether he was there, having previously insisted that it was not a party. This confirms for the first time that the Prime Minister is himself under direct criminal investigation potentially for multiple offences. Second, although Gray said it would be “inappropriate” to comment on whether gatherings breached rules, because of the police investigation, it was obvious enough that she thought they did. That is what she must have meant by “a number of these gatherings should not have been allowed to take place or to develop in the way that they did.” And it is obvious enough where she lays blame: “Failures of leadership and judgment by dferent parts of No.  and the Cabinet Office at dferent times.” Third, Gray’s position was always near impossible.  She is investigating her direct boss - Simon Case - who allegedly organised his own gathering which is being investigated by the police - and his boss – the Prime Minister himself. But she still has to complete her report and has decided to “ensure the secure storage and safekeeping” of the information she has received away from the government itself – a quite extraordinary development. And so Gray’s update was both tantalisingly vague and, on important points, interesting and specic. The Prime Minister repeatedly pleaded with Parliament to wait for the outcome of the “investigation”. With the police apparently being handed  photographs of gatherings by Gray, and the now complex police investigation rumbling on, he probably wishes today had been judgment day after all.

Perhaps it will be released as an opera, so it will cost £ for a ticket to see it. Then we’ll see a chorus of tenors singing “why do you leave us, do not forsake us ” Then the sopranos will reply “We go to Waitrose, to fetch more wine,” in red chfon dresses. Then a booming bass roars cheekily “It’s a workplace meeting”, all in Italian. It’s possible the report has become more complicated because it turns out Prince Andrew was at one of the parties.  Or maybe she can’t finish it because there was a -piece swing band playing in the No bathroom throughout lockdown, and  people re-enacting the Battle of El Alamein in the kitchen, so she has to interview all of them. But now the Met Police have been kind enough to make her job simpler. Because they insist her investigation should leave out anything about the parties. And an investigation is always easieryou don’t have to include anything that you were investigating. To keep the police and the Government happy, her report should go: “On Tuesday it was quite sunny. The end.” Then she can pad it out with  pages of dot-to-dot puzzles and a nice picture of farmyard animals, with suggestions for how to colour them in. The police can make their own lives simpler by applying the same rules to themselves. When they investigate a robbery, they can leave out everything about the robbery from their investigation and they’ll be able to complete their task much more quickly. When the police announced they were investigating the parties, we were told this meant the report might be delayed for several more weeks. That would be convenient. Maybe they’ll keep this going. So next time the report’s about to appear, it will be announced that the Vatican are investigating the parties to see whether they constituted a mortal sin. So the report can’t be published until there’s a pronouncement from the Pope. In any case, the Government’s supporters now say the whole business of parties against the rules is “trivia”. Why are we bothering with wine and cakes, when there’s inflation and a might-be-a-war with Russia   This would make sense,when Johnson was reading out the rules every single day for several months, he’d said: “But don’t bother sticking to any of this. “You can do whatever you like, I’d invite your mates round and spend all day naked mud-wrestlingI was you. Remember – Hands – Face – Cake – Bottle – Conga.” But they insisted we absolutely had to stay alone, while they did the opposite. Andyou were cynical, you might suspect thatthey lie so blatantly about that, maybe it’s possible that they lie about everything  as well.

She spent years being bombarded with messages from Hardy, who created several fake accounts in a bid to harass her. As a result, the mumaposs relationship broke down and she was even unable to enjoy the birth of her third child. Bizarrely, the harassment was triggered by an innocuous five-minute meeting between the pair, which barely registered with Sabrina at the time.Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here Sabrina, , says: He absolutely ruined my le and dominated my thoughts for five years. He set up accounts pretending to me and sent messages to my friends and family and even my children. He also set up accounts in my friendsapos names and messaged me pretending to be them. The level of research he carried out to discover small details about me was mind-blowing and it made me so afraid that he would hurt me or my family. I hated letting my children out of the house, even to go to school. I barely slept and I was forever checking for him in the street. My le was completely controlled by him. The pair first met in  when Sabrina called in to see a family friend of her late mum, and Hardy was at the house. Sabrina, from Mere, Cheshire, says: I was only at the house to drop something off, I said hello to Matthew and we left it at that. I didnapost think any more of it.But days later, he began messaging me on Facebook and accused me of having an affair with the family friend I had been to visit.I assured him he had got the wrong idea the man was much older than me and married to my mumaposs friend. I thought it was a bit odd and left it at that. But she then received a slew of messages, both from Hardy and from accounts of people Sabrina knew well. In one message, she was accused of having an affair with an ex-boyfriend of her late mum. In another, he suggested she was sleeping with her best friendaposs husband and also with a close male friend. She says: The messages were from accounts of people I was friendly with and at first there was lots of detail and they seemed genuine. Most of the time he would just make conversation before he started making really creepy suggestions. At first, I thought my friends were turning against me. It was really upsetting and confusing. One year on, Sabrina learned that Hardy had previously been convicted of harassment over social media and she became suspicious. Sabrina, who runs fitness and pole dancing classes, says: I went to the police, but I didnapost feel they took me seriously. They suggested I try blocking him but of course, he had so many fake accounts in dferent names, and I didnapost know which were my genuine friends and which were him. He was by this stage messaging my friends and work colleagues from a fake account he had set up in my name, so evenclosed my social media down he was still able to stalk me. I had no idea what he was saying to people about me and it was very embarrassing. The level of information he was able to gather about me was frightening. He was very clever and manipulative and messaged students from my fitness class, and even the studio owner. He delved into my past to find people Iaposd lost touch with. He seemed to know everything about me. I became scared for my safety and for my children, I was constantly checking the street before we went out. I was on high alert all the time. I was so desperate that I even contacted Hardy directly, and his mother, to ask to be left alone. I asked him why he was stalking me, but he couldnapost give me an answer. In February , Sabrina had a daughter, Nancy, but the birth was ruined by the constant harassment from Hardy. Sadly, her relationship broke down too under the strain. She says: I suffer with endometriosis and the stress caused by Hardy made it so much worse. He was affecting my health mentally and physically. I contacted the police on several occasions and finally last year the case was taken up by PC Kevin Anderson rom Northwich Local Policing Unit who was absolutely wonderful. I was horried to find out that Hardy had targeted many other women as well as me. Matthew Hardy appeared before Chester Crown Court earlier this month in relation with the harassment against Sabrina and other women, and was jailed for nine years. He had earlier pleaded guilty to three counts of stalking with intent to cause alarm or distress, two counts of stalking without intent to cause alarm and breaching a restraining order from , which banned him from using  details on social networking sites. He also admitted stalking a further four women, which was taken into consideration upon sentencing. Following the sentencing, Police Constable Kevin Anderson from Northwich Local Policing Unit, said: Having led on this case for more than  months I have seen the emotional distress and turmoil that Hardy has inflicted on his victims - he did all of this while hiding behind his computer screen. The impact on those affected by his actions has been immense, causing some of them to change some of their daily habits, and live in constant fear that they were being watched. On other occasions, it caused them to lose trust in their friends and family members, and even led to the breakdown of long-term relationships. Thankfully, Hardy has now been held accountable for his actions, and his online activity has finally been brought to a stop. I hope that the conclusion of this case will provide some closure for his victims and enable then to rebuild and move forward with their lives.

It also suggests kids who spend the most time on social media suffer % more negative emotions, such as anxiety and self-doubt, rising to % more for girls. And youngsters who spend the most time gaming are % more likely to have poor sleep or drop out of sports or exercise. Researchers found children whose parents are more aware of what their kids are up to online get more of the positives from technology. Youngsters at the other end of the scale are more likely to carry out destructive behaviour and be bullied or groomed online. Carolyn Bunting, chief executive of Internet Matters, the organisation which is behind the probe, said: “The pandemic has had a big effect on children’s experiences and it is good to know children whose parents are on the same page as their kids around digital concerns are benefitting most from the online world.”  It is the first time children and parents from the same household have been surveyed to find out how digital technology affects wellbeing. The study is based on work by Leicester University which included talking to , children aged nine to .

Covid iant Image: Getty ImagesBySurena ChandeSEO Editor:,  Jan Updated:,  Jan |comments On Saturday January , the UK recorded another , coronavirus cases within  hours, a decline from , a week prior. And, despite a range of Covid Plan B restrictions being relaxed on January , there are growing concerns surrounding the Omicron iant sub-strain that is believed to be more infectious than its predecessor.Omicron caused havoc across the UK as it led to a huge rise in positive Covid cases from November, , leaving fears of Christmas being cancelled due to a lockdown for a second year.As the wave continues to ease, a new Omicron aposstealth iantapos is emerging and is believed to have been identied at least  times in the UK since November. Hereaposs everything you need to know about the BA. iant, including what the UK Health Security Agencyhas said it is and what the symptoms may be. What is the BA. new Covid iant in the UK and is it more dangerous than Omicron  The BA. Covid strain is thought to be an Omicronsub-strain with a higher growth rate, which can potentially be more easily transmissible, according to the UKHSA. The new strain of Covid is currently also being referred to as the aposStealth Variantapos and has been identied in India, parts of Europe, South Africa, the US and the UK.  Despite it being dubbed a aposstealthapos iant thataposs supposedly not identiable on tests, this claim is  as it can be detected by lateral flowand PCR tests. Dr Susan Hopkins, chief medical adviser for UKHSA, explained: We now know that BA. has an increased growth rate which can be seen in all regions in England. We have also learnt that BA. has a slightly higher secondary attack rate than BA. in households. Although hospitalisations and deaths remain low, cases are still high in some areas and some age groups so it’s important that we continue to act cautiously as restrictions are lted.  While the majority of cases of the virus are believed to be in Denmark, experts in the country donapost see it as cause for concern. Anders Fomsgaard, chief physician and virus researcher at the Statens Serum Institut , told Danish media: We cannot see any dference in hospitalisation numbers, death rates with BA., so it is not something that worries us yet.” Adding: Right now we should just treat it as yet another iant until new data should eventually show other results.  Despite this highly transmissible iant stemming from Omicron, the World Health Organisation is yet to identy Omicron as a iant of concern. More information will be gathered over time, as researchers study the new strain. However, experts have advised for eligible people across the UK to get all three Covid vaccinations to increase protection against the virus. How long does Covid vaccine and booster jab immunity last for With the UK rapidly ramping up booster jab vaccinations as Omicron became a dominant Covid iant, many vaccinated Brits were able to avoid more severe coronavirus side effects. However, with cases still being reported and the new BA. strain emerging, many are concerned about how protected theyaposll be against the mutation. The UKHSA has stated that three doses of the vaccine are % effective at preventing symptomatic infections by the new Omicron BA. sub-strain, while the same number of doses are % effective against the original Omicron BA. strain.  However, experts have not officially stated how many days, weeks or months you are immune against Covid for per dose. What are the confirmed Omicron symtpoms  With BA. being a sub-strain of the original BA. Omicron iant, the symptoms are likely to be similar.While new Omicron symptoms may be identied over time, none have been outlined yet. In the meantime, you should continue to look out for the following Covid symptoms, according to the ZOE Covid Study and the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention :Congested or runny nose HeadacheFatigueNew or continuous coughShortness of breath or dficulty breathing Muscle or body aches New loss of taste or smell Sore throatNausea or vomitingDiarrheaIf you do find you have one or more of these symptoms, you should take a Covid test immediately and self-isolate to avoid spreading the virus to others around you.Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON CoronavirusOmicron iantCoronavirus vaccineMutant CoronavirusCoronavirus testing\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily coronavirus briefing with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

He wrote: Perhaps, I thought, they were wearing them against air pollution, which is bad at the moment. Or because it was a cold morning and they actively enjoyed the warmth of their foetid breath circulating inside the germy fabric  Or perhaps, I supposed, these masked ninnies were still so afraid of the now-harmless bug that they were prepared to endure the mild discomfort and inconvenience that comes with the illusion of security provided by a mask.  Or perhaps, in their post-pandemic health hysteria, they were hoping now to protect themselves against flu, measles, hepatitis ... even cancer  . While masks are no longer a legal requirement in England, there are still some settings where they are recommended. Londoners need to keep wearing them when using Transport for London services.  While London Mayor Sadiq Khanaposs demands are not enforceable by police and do not carry a fine, face masks will remain a condition of carriage on TfL services. That means you can be refused admission to a Tube or bus without one. Mr Khan urged the PM to rethink scrapping face masks altogether.He said: Wearing a face covering is one of the single most important and easiest things we can all do to prevent the spread of Covid- and the Government should rethink their plans.Some supermarkets will continue to either ask or suggest that shoppers wear a mask. Sainsbury’s and John Lewis said their customers will be asked to wear masks, though the latter acknowledged it will ultimately come down to “personal choice”.

Tillie Adams, , is one of an estimated , under-s suffering with the long-term effects of the virus in the UK - with , ill for more than a year. During her  month ordeal Tillie has spent weeks in hospital and is often too ill to go to school.Her weight plummeted dangerously as she struggled to eat after falling ill with coronavirus last January, and she still suffers from debilitating sickness a year later.After her condition baffled medics for months, the schoolgirl was eventually told she had Post Covid Infection Syndrome, and has had a NG tube, which provides vital nutrients, since last summer. Long Covid is thought to affect around one in  children under the age of , while . per cent of those aged  to  are believed to have it.  Tillie, who now struggles to walk up the stairs at her home in Hoxton, east London, and has fainted several times in recent months, said: Sometimes I get so angry, I want to go to school, but itaposs just so hard, some days I canapost because Iaposm just so tired and so washed out. When she was first diagnosed with Covid she suffered with a temperature, aches and pains and lost her smell and taste.Her mum Kelly was told that Tillie should start to feel better within a fortnight, but weeks later she was still suffering from headaches, stomach pains and dficulty eating.Tillie, who used to be full of energy and enjoyed playing outside before she became ill, said: I just felt confused, I was just so scared, I didnapost know what to do. At first Iaposd just stay in bed because I was scared to move.  She spent two weeks in hospital after losing a stone in a matter of weeks as medics desperately tried to work out what was wrong. The more weight she was losing, the weaker she became, said Kelly, . She went grey and her lips split open, it was awful. It took a month before her energy levels picked up. She couldnapost manage the stairs, she was sometimes falling up the stairs and when she got to the top she was so light headed she would almost faint. She still gets those effects now. Sheaposs like a totally dferent child. At first Tillie was unable to dress herself, and she still needs help washing her hair.  Tillie, who is now helping researchers at University College Hospital in London understand Long Covid in children, was initially told she would only require an NG tube for two weeks. But nine months later she is still using one as she makes a phasedto school, aiming to do a half day five days a week. Brave Tillie missed out on much of her final year at primary school, but is desperate not to fall behind during her y recovery. She wants to push herself and she wants to be at school, said Kelly. But theyaposve told her she wonapost be able to go back to school full time until at least Year . Since October sheaposs only managed three weeks where sheaposs managed five half days. The rest of the time sheaposs in bed, sheaposs so washed out.  Sheaposs really worried about falling behind, but she knows that this could go on for years.Determined to show that Covid isnapost just a virus that affects adults, and keen to show others going through a similar ordeal that they are not alone, Tillie last year set up an Instagram account documenting her journey.It has amassed thousands of followers and the family have been inundated with messages of goodwill. She said: Itaposs been amazing. I want to raise awareness for others so they knowthey have it theyaposre not alone. The night before speaking to The Mirror, Tillie had spoken to another girl who was having an NG tube fitted.  Kelly said: At first I was really nervous, but she said: aposI want to help people in the same position and show that kids are suffering tooapos. Children are often forgotten about, you donapost see anything about kids with Long Covid, but when we were in hospital I spoke to lots of other parents who were going through the same thing. Latest figures from the Office for National Statisticsestimates that , children with Long Covid had to limit their activity a little in December, while , were severely restricted. It is believed that around . million people of all ages had Long Covid at the end of last year - just under two per cent of the population. Sammie Mcfarland, founder of charity Long Covid Kids, said the organisation is supporting just under , families across the UK, with numbers rising steeply. Last week alone more than  registered for support, she said. Itaposs getting worse, Sammie told The Mirror, adding that she is aware of several children who require NG tubes after contracting Covid. There are a lot of children with issues like Tillieaposs. We urgently need GP training in recognising Long Covid and we need a strong awareness campaign that accepts children are experiening Covid harm. Weaposre not seeing large numbers of people saying theyaposre back to  per cent, many children arenapost getting any better at all. That for me is the largest concern.Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON British Medical JournalEducationHospitalsSchoolsCoronavirus\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily coronavirus briefing with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Her mum, Debbie , pushed for more answers, believing she had a food intolerance and eventually in November last year, Dulcie was given a scan. A biopsy the following month revealed she had stage  Neuroblastoma - an aggressive form of cancer which had spread to her pelvis, bone marrow, legs and spine. Dulcie is now going through intense chemotherapy in a bid to save her le. Mum of one, Debbie, said: The diagnosis was such a shock. Our entire world has crashed around us and never in a million years did we suspect it was cancer. We had never heard of Neuroblastoma. Dulcieaposs parents say doctors have not told them how likely Dulcie is to survive and the youngster is now on her fth round of chemotherapy. The mum from Telford, Shropshire, said: Doctors have told us that the cancer is treatable but I want parents to know the signs becausewe had known sooner what Dulcie was suffering with, it may not have spread so aggressively through her body. We were completely unaware that her symptoms could be something so le-threatening and all we can do now is pray doctors have still caught it in time. The scan found a cancerous mass measuring cm by cm in her stomach.  Debbie said: Neuroblastoma is the second most aggressive cancer in children. We need to stop the tumour in her stomach growing and spreading further around her body. Doctors are also looking at surgery to remove as much of the tumour as possible - after she has completed seven rounds of chemotherapy. Debbie added: The symptoms I want to make other parents aware of include a swollen tummy, constipation. It can cause children to walk quite unsteadily and have a weakness in their legs. A loss of energy, weight loss and loss of appetite are all signs too. I want to raise as much awareness as possible of this terrible disease because it was easily mistaken for something . The family have also launched a £, fundraising appeal to pay for lesaving treatment in the US.Debbie added: The treatment plan for Dulcie in the UK is for  to  months, itaposs a long road to recovery and could take two years to be in remission. There is the potential that she will never be cancer-free because of the type of cancer it is. If the treatment in the UK doesnapost work, the family could then need to take Dulcie to America. Debbie said: We have started to fundraise for this possibility now because we need to know we have enough funds for the treatment in the US. It would need to start  days after the end of the treatment here, so we canapost risk having to fundraise closer to the time and not having the money to take her. Whilst we hope going to America wonapost be necessary, we have to be prepared to do everything possible for our little girl. If in  months we are in the position that we wonapost require this lesaving trip then any funds raised will be either passed to another family who does need it or donated to several childhood cancer charities. For now, the family are taking each day as it comes and focusing on Dulcieaposs chemotherapy. Debbie said: Dulcie is a superstar, she smiles through it even when she is tired and she bounces back. She is very grown-up for her age, she knows she has cancer but she asks questions that I canapost answer, she wants to know why she has cancer.  It breaks my heart to see her going through this. I have my good and bad days, but her strength gives me strength and most days she is coping really well. Debbie added: When we got the diagnoses I cried in disbelief, how can my daughter have cancer  We have gone through every emotion possible, thinking why was it not spotted sooner. You donapost think it will ever happen to your child, it is a rare cancer but GPs and parents need to recognise the symptoms andyou have any concerns, push for more tests.

Maddie disappeared from the resort in  and hasnapost been seen since. Her family still hope she will be found alive. The German TV channel SAT. documentary claims that Brueckner, , was very familiar with Ocean Club, as well as surrounding parts of the Algarve. When Maddie disappeared from the hotel room where her parents had left her, the rapist was no more than five minutes away - phone data analyses by SAT. suggests. In letters reportedly from Brueckner, who is currently in prison for raping a pensioner, he admits to trafficking drugs in a battered hippy van around the time of the disappearance.  He denies claims that he abducted Maddie however, suggesting to do so would be absurd... as starting a nuclear war or slaughtering a chicken. He wrote: I was never caught by the police because I followed a few key principles. Where possible, only driving during the day so that my battered hippy bus didnapost attract attention, only driving on the roads I needed to and, most importantly never provoking the police. So that means not committing any crimes, certainly not abducting anyone. Brueckner was named as the prime suspect in the Maddie case in  by German prosecutors. They remain convinced he was responsible for the youngsteraposs disappearance, but have not brought any charges despite an intense investigation. Brueckner claims he is happy to sit back and relax and just wait for their findings.  His lover at the time, Nicole Fehlinger, , says he told her he liked the bodies of pre-pubescent girls. The documentary also makes claims that Brueckner swapped child abuse images and depraved online messages with an undertaker. The mortician gave “a full confession” when quizzed by German police and admitted he was a “regular customer” of the convicted paedophile. It is understood material he handed over to officers now forms part of evidence being used against Brueckner. The undertaker, also a convicted sex offender, cannot be named for legal reasons – but he has spoken to the makers of a new documentary about the case, being shown tomorrow night on German TV channel Sat.. The film’s lead investigator Jutta Rabe told the Sunday People: “I’m not sure what he paid but he confirmed they regularly swapped material, all of which he has handed over to detectives. We haven’t been able to confirmthey were business partners but he insisted he... has completely mended his ways.” The undertaker, who lives alone, said he was interviewed by the BKA – Germany’s FBI. Miss Rabe said: “He was given a choice, ‘You either admit it and help us then go into therapy or go to prison’. He chose co-operation.” The TV documentary also includes a reconstruction of the evening of the toddleraposs disappearance. It will be screened in Germany later today.

The tragedy led to his daughter Queen Elizabeth IIs ascent to the throneKing George VI died in  Image: Popperfoto via Getty ImagesByClaire OBoyleAssistant Features Editor Writer:,  Jan |comments He was the much-loved King who had helped Britain through the horrors of the Second World War. And when King George VI ’s le was cut short at just , the nation was plunged into sorrow. In our week-long series to mark the beginning of The Queen ’s historic Platinum Jubilee year, we look back on the tragedy that led to her ascent to the throne.For grief engulfed the country - even as they welcomed their vibrant new monarch. The announcement from Sandringham came at . on the morning of February , . “The King, who retired to rest last night in his usual health, passed peacefully away in his sleep early this morning.”  Within moments, the nation was plunged into mourning. The King’s eldest daughter, the new Queen Elizabeth, was halfway across the world in Kenya with her husband the Duke of Edinburgh, and by nightfall, they were in the air. Reports at the time said she burst immediately into tears at the news of her father’s death before quickly composing herself and making moves to get home. Her family, and her country, needed her. The royal airliner left Entebbe, Uganda at .pm that night and before .pm the following day Prime Minister Winston Churchill was on the runway at London Airport as he led a mournful party in welcoming home Britain’s new, grieving Queen.  Yet somehow, through her sorrow, the stoic young Elizabeth, just  at the time, managed a smile. The last time her father had been seen in public was less than a week before his death at that very same airport. He had come to say goodbye as the young married couple headed off on their Commonwealth Tour. George VI had been in ill health for some time, and just four months earlier he’d been under the surgeon’s kne for a lung operation - one lung was removed after a tumour was discovered. Yet when it came, his death was still a shock. Just a day earlier he had been out shooting with a neighbour on the Sandringham estate. But when James Macdonald, his personal valet for many years, called softly to the King as he took early morning tea to the Royal bedroom that historic day, no reply rang out. Court officials were called from their beds and the soon news was official. The King was dead. Within moments his we, soon to be known not as Queen but Queen Mother, and daughter Margaret had arrived. A sense of tragedy swept through Sandringham House and on to Marlborough House when the news was broken to the King’s heartbroken mother, Queen Mary. The feeling would soon spread right across the nation. Flags in the villages around Sandringham were lowered to half-mast, then lted again with the arrival of the new Queen. With theof Queen Elizabeth to Britain on February , the formalities could begin. Hours after she’d been greeted at the airport by the Prime Minister, Mr Churchill shared his sorrow with the country in a pm broadcast on the airwaves. “When the death of the King was announced to us yesterday morning there struck a deep and solemn note in our lives which, as it resounded far and wide, stilled the clatter and traffic of twentieth-century le in many lands, and made countless millions of human beings pause and look around them,” he said. “The King was greatly loved by all his peoples. He was respected as a man and as a prince far beyond the many realms over which he reigned.” He concluded his deeply solemn speech with a resounding message of support to the new monarch, saying: “ I, whose youth was passed in the august, unchallenged and tranquil glories of the Victorian era, may well feel a thrill in invoking once more the prayer and the anthem, “God save the Queen!”  The very next day came Proclamation Day where the new Queen, dressed in full mourning at St James’s Palace, told of the “heavy task” laid upon her. In a stately room in the Palace, before the assembled Accession Council, while thousands stood in silence outside, she said: “By the sudden death of my dear father, I am called to assume the duties and responsibility of sovereignty. At this time of deep sorrow it is a profound consolation to me to be assured of the sympathy which you, and all my peoples, feel toward me,” adding: “I pray that God will help me to discharge worthily this heavy task that has been laid upon me so early in my le.” The King’s coffin was taken from Sandringham to London, where it lay in Westminster Hall for three days. More than , came to pay their respects. Then in the early hours of February , the day of the King’s funeral, crowds began to gather in the capital for the procession through the streets, which were closed to traffic from am.  A little while after am the funeral party gathered before the cortege made its way through London at .am. Chimes rang out from Big Ben  times, each one representing a year of the late King’s le. The King’s coffin was draped in the Royal Standard of red, blue and gold, with the Imperial State Crown, the Gold Orb, the Sceptre, the insignia of the Order of the Garter and a white wreath from his we placed on top. From the windows of Marlborough House, high above The Mall, Queen Mary the King’s Mother, watched on. Thousands stood below as the procession passed, while many more watched at home on their televisions. The procession was the first of a British monarch to be broadcast on TV. After passing the Guildhall, where officials bowed their heads in respect, the funeral party arrived at Paddington to the refrain of Chopin’s Funeral March before the royal train left for the funeral in Windsor shortly after midday. By pm, the country fell silent.  The family, joined by dignitaries from around the world, gathered in St George’s Chapel at Windsor, where floral tributes to the King had been laid, while hundreds of thousands came to a standstill in the streets across Britain. Buses, cars and taxis pulled up by the pavements and turned their engines off with drivers and passengers getting out. Pedestrians stopped as they walked and bowed their heads. A hush fell over the country while for two minutes people held King George VI in their thoughts. Then at .pm the King was laid to rest. As his plain oak coffin was gently lowered into the family’s vault at St George’s Chapel his daughter, the Queen, sprinkled earth from a gilded bowl. A striking picture captured the solemnity of the day as three Queens, shrouded in their heavy mourning clothes that dreary February day were seen together - the new Queen Elizabeth, her mother and the late King’s widow as well as his mother Queen Mary, reflecting the pain of the nation behind their veils. The simple service, attended by the Archbishops of Canterbury and York and the Bishop of Winchester, drew to a close. The Queen, herself a mother of two and just  years old, would lead the country out of sadness.

She also alleges she was forced to have sex with the -year-old royal at Epsteinaposs home in New York and the US Virgin Islands. The mum-of-three is suing Andrew for unspecied damages, which US lawyers say could easily be in excess of £ millionshe is successful. Should he lose, he could have officers from the court arriving at the doors of his Royal Lodge home, it was reported. Lawyer Arick Fudali, who has worked closely with Epstein’s victims, told The Sun : There is a method and procedure for seizing assets, even overseas assets, in the event there is an award of damages and the defendant tries to avoid paying.This could include seizing bank accounts, physical property, etc. “Assuming for the sake of this question that there is an award of damages against Prince Andrew, he would be able to avoid the seizure of assets by posting a bond pending the inevitable appeal. “Assuming the appeal goes in favour of Ms. Giuffre, Prince Andrew would either have to pay the amount owed, settle the matter for another amount, or risk his assets being seized.” Andrew has continually denied all the allegations. Earlier this month it was revealed Andrew has found a buyer for his beloved Swiss retreat. Spencer Kuvin, a lawyer for Jeffrey Epsteinaposs victims, says it could have been to prevent his accuser from claiming the asset should she win the case. He said: “If Virginia gets a judgement against Andrew,this went all the way through to trial and she received a financial judgement in her favour, she could execute on any properties he has, the most likely being his ski chalet.  If Andrew had properties in any companion country that would abide by such jurisdiction of the US, she can execute on those properties. If the Queen has transferred any property to him, anywhere throughout the entire world, they could try and execute on that propertysuccessful in foreign courts. Last week the Duke attempted to distance himself from convicted sex offender Maxwell, insisting in court documents the pair were not close. He has been pictured several times since the s holidaying and partying with the disgraced socialite, who also attended several royal residences. In legal papers responding to accusations from Virginia Giuffre, the Queen’s second son dismissed any notion they were close friends. Royal insiders say Andrew has made the ultimate gamble by demanding trial by jury, saying it could cause irreparable damage to the monarchy and overshadow the Queen’s Platinum Jubilee celebrations.

Five female members of staff - three secretaries and at least two porters - have resigned from their post since he took the position in July last year, according to reports.Mr White, , is a key ceremonial figure and is seen walking in front of the Queen every year at the state opening of Parliament. He also advises the Government and Buckingham Palace about large state events, including the Queenaposs Platinum Jubilee Celebration which is set to take place in June.  His boss, the Duke of Norfolk, is responsible for organising state events.The duke told the Mail On Sunday he was aware of the allegations and said he summoned Mr White imminently for an initial discussion.He also said he takes his role extremely seriously and wouldnapost hesitate to take any action necessary.  Mr Whiteaposs upcoming appearances include presiding over the Duchess of Cornwall being sworn in as a Royal Lady of the Order of the Garter - the top slot among knighthood ranks. It will also fall on Mr White to pronounce the Queenaposs death from the balcony of St Jamesaposs Palace on the date of her passing. According to sources, the staff members had no issues with Mr Whiteaposs predecessor, Sir Thomas Woodcock, , who held the role for  years. Sir Thomasaposs former secretary Lydia Birch was the first to leave, just three months after Mr White took over.  Her replacement lasted a day, leaving the job behind after Mr White allegedly had a tantrum, it is claimed. The next secretary, Caroline Goldsack, stayed a month before handing her notice in. There were other resignations from two porters at the College of Arms, according to reports. One source claimed to the Mail: aposHe threw tantrums. There was a culture of bullying, undermining and making staff cry. Perhaps the pressure is getting to him. He started a new job and with the jubilee thereaposs a lot on.

The surrounding area of the house was cordoned off after the incident. Luckily, no injuries were reported as a result of the roof and its tiles falling onto the pavement below.On Saturday, the day the roof was ripped off, yellow and amber weather warnings for high winds had been issued across northern England, Scotland and Northern Ireland.  Tragically, three people died over the weekend as a result of Storm Malik’s gale-force winds. A nine-year-old boy, from Staffordshire, and a -year-old woman, from Aberdeen, were both killed by falling trees on Saturday. A -year-old man also died after a lorry overturned on the M. Around , homes across northern England and Scotland have been left without power in the wake of Storms Malik and Corrie over the weekend. Schools across Aberdeenshire were forced to close on Monday, as a result of power outages or storm damage. A -year-old hospitality worker, from Northumberland, has been without heating and electricity since Saturday morning. Clare Stirling-Turnbull said: “We have no electric, no heating or hot water - we do have a wood burner so can heat one room.Clare is unable to go to relatives’ houses, as one of the children in her family of six is currently isolating with Covid-.On Sunday night, gusts of mph were recorded at Stornoway in the Western Isles, which forecasters described as exceptionally strong. Met Office meteorologist, Alex Burkill, said: There is no wonder there were signicant impacts such as power outages and damage to buildings.It is very unfortunate that things were worse than that for some people.

Cherie Hitchens, , and Joanna Morrison, , have been living in temporary accommodation for a year.They both have multiple disabilities including multiple chemical sensitivity, making them extremely sensitive to any chemical-type smells, DorsetLive reports. Dorset Council said the only permanent accommodation it could offer them was a bungalow just one mile from the Lush soap factor. Cherie and Joanna said they had no choice but to turn it down, leaving them homeless. Cherie said: They evicted us because we said no to one permanent bungalow in Upton.  We said no to that because it was right next to the carriageway, there were lots of Lush smells, lots of people working for Lush - we are allergic to scented products, they make us very ill. Also the problem with the bungalow was they saidwe didnapost stay there for five years, we would have to pay for all the disabled adaptions. In , the pair had been living in Upton. They are part-time wheelchair users, with Joanna suffering from asthma and diabetes. Cherie also suffers from spinal stenosis, Graves Disease and has recently recovered from cancer. That year, when their council-funded home became unavailable they were moved into a hotel and from there they were moved to a temporary house for a year. They were then offered a new bungalow, but the two friends said it was unsuitable. for our daily newsletter to keep up to date with all the essential information atwww.mirror email.Cherie said: We had to do an assessment, of their opinion and our opinion of why we couldnapost take the bungalow in Upton. We did that. They [the council] said you should have taken it. We looked in Devon, Hampshire, Wiltshire, Cornwall, and Dorset obviously, to start with. Theyaposre throwing us out of Dorset. We canapost go to places that have very well-known scented product shops and factories - we canapost go near them, and they are all over the place. We did look at three properties out of a lot that I saw. Three of them we wanted, but one landlord said: aposno, housing benefitapos. They believe whataposs on the TV - that weaposre all scum and weaposre just milking the system. We are not. Itaposs not our fault we had these accidents - itaposs not our fault we have to rely on benefits. Weaposre relying on credit cards now - Iaposm almost maxed out. Cherie claims they went through the courts, but the council has stopped all forms of help. She says they were evicted from their temporary home on January . The pair are now staying in a hotel for as long as they can afford to, which they expect will be until Tuesday. Cherie said: Theyaposre expecting us to sofa-surf, theyaposre expecting us to have friends and family. But they use scented products! We used to use scented products - we used to have lovely incense sticks, you know  We couldnapost live there. [Joannaaposs] suffered enough. Sheaposs nearly  years old - she doesnapost deserve this, we donapost deserve this. No disabled person deserves this - the way we are being treated. When asked what she felt needed to be done, Cherie said: Weaposve looked for a three-bedroom, detached bungalow, with a wet room, with a garage, no wood burners, no VOC paint, not newly refurbished, no new carpets and not near carriageways, factories or industrial estates. Thataposs what we want. Itaposs not easy - of course, weaposre part-time wheelchair users, and Iaposm going to be paralysed in a few years because of my narrowing of the spinal cord. Cherie said: Jo has to see the specialist, sheaposs got another condition, and she has not been able to see them for six months. So we cannot move out of Dorset until she sees them. So weaposve got to stay here until February . There are other counties that offer three, four, five properties. We were only offered one. We didnapost know that! They never said to us,you donapost accept it, then you are going to be on the streets. She added that the situation has taken a toll on their mental health. A spokesman for Dorset Council said: “The council is unable to go into detail on inidual cases. “However, there is a very clear legal procedure the council has to follow in offering residents a suitable property. “The consequences of refusing to accept a property, which is deemed suitable, are clearly communicated in writing and verbally. “Decisions can also be reviewed and go through the court system. The council also has an obligation to use temporary accommodation in the best way possible for all residents.” Thecontacted Dorset Council for comment.

The Tig was Meghanaposs successful lestyle blog that she ran before marrying Prince Harry while an actress on the hit legal drama Suits. It also included interviews with her celebrity friends including Serena Williams and Priyanka Chopra.She shut down the site in  - just months before her engagement to Harry was announced. However, according to the Daily Mail, LA lawyer Marjorie Witter Norman filed a new application to trademark the blogaposs name in July last year, according to legal records.  It was filed under a Delaware-based holding company called Frim Fram Inc, linked to Meghanaposs business manager Andrew Meyer. Itaposs a move that has raised hopes that Meghan - who stepped down as a working royal along with Harry in March  - may one-day re-launch the blog. Here, we take a look back at some of Meghanaposs most candid posts on The Tig... Constant battle Love the royals for the Mirroraposs daily newsletter to get all the latest news on the Queen, Charles, Kate, Wills, Meghan, Harry and the rest of The Firm. Click here to sign up. In a post to mark her rd birthday in , Meghan opened up about her younger years - before she shot to international fame - giving an insight into her le. She called the post Birthday Suit and accompanying the post was a beautul image of Meghan - appearing to not be wearing a top.She wrote: My s were brutal – a constant battle with myself, judging my weight, my style, my desire to be as cool as hip as smart as aposwhateverapos as everyone . Meanwhile, Meghan also talked in the post about her teenage years and trying to fit in at school. She added: My teens were even worse – grappling with how to fit in, and what that even meant. My high school had cliques: the black girls and white girls, the Filipino and the Latina girls. Being biracial, I fell somewhere in between. She said every day at lunch she would keep herself busy with school societies like French club and a student body that took place between noon and pm so she wouldnapost have to eat on her own. But she recalled a breakthrough moment in her le when attending an audition in her mid-s. She explained: I must have been about  when a casting director looked at me during an audition and said aposYou need to know that you’re enough. Less makeup, more Meghanapos. Unladylike habits  In another candid post, Meghan made a confession about struggling to give up unladylike habits as part of her New Yearaposs resolutions - just months before she met Prince Harry. She wrote: Run a marathon. Stop biting my nails. Stop swearing. Re-learn French. These make my New Year’s resolution list nearlysingle year.The marathon hasnapost happened. The swearing comes in lulls triggered by being overworked or feeling mighty cheeky after a couple of drinks.Then thereaposs the French – a language I studied through high school and then lost as I immersed myself in speaking Spanish with the Argentinians during my stint in Buenos Aires.I have put my little Rosetta Stone headset in my eager ears every year, resolving to do interviews en français, but much to my chagrin, it hasnapost stuck.And when it comes to the biting of the nails – well, it still happens with a turbulent flight or a stressful day. Itaposs unladylike. But then again, so is the swearing. Dammit.Sweet tribute to dad  Meghanaposs relationship with her estranged father Thomas has been strained for many years.Itaposs thought the pair havenapost seen each other since she married Harry and he is yet to meet his grandchildren Archie and Lilibet.However, when Meghan was running her blog, it seemed she was close to her dad and wrote a gushing post about him revealing the heartwarming present he once bought her for Christmas.She explained how her hardworking daddy went to Toys R Us to buy a boxed set of Barbie dolls which she had been yearning for - at a time she was struggling with her biracial identity. However there was a problem - they either came as a black family or a white one. So when at Toys R Us faced with the boxes of Barbies in front of him, Thomas aposbroke the rulesapos and took them apart to make a custom family for his little girl. Meghan recalled: When I was about seven, I had been fawning over a boxed set of Barbie dolls.  It was called The Heart Family and included a mom doll, a dad doll, and two children. This perfect nuclear family was only sold in sets of white dolls or black dolls. I don’t remember coveting one over the other, I just wanted one. On Christmas morning, swathed in glitter-flecked wrapping paper, there I found my Heart Family: a black mom doll, a white dad doll, and a child in each color. My dad had taken the sets apart and customized my family. I picture him standing there in Toys R Us, moms glaring at him for taking the toys apart, perhaps an employee saying aposexcuse me sir, you can’t do thatapos — as my dad carefully separated the boxed sets to make one that echoed my reality. One that showed me that I shouldmake my own box. Post about Kate Middleton  In a twist of a fate, Meghan also blogged about the Duke and Duchess of Cambridgeaposs wedding - seven years before her own royal wedding.She wrote the pomp surrounding Kate and Williamaposs  wedding and how she grew up dreaming of becoming a princess.A section published by The Sun states: Little girls dream of being princesses. I, for one, was all about She-Ra, Princess of Power.For those of you unfamiliar with the aposs cartoon reference, She-Ra is the twin sister of He-Man and a sword-wielding royal rebel known for her strength.Weaposre definitely not talking about Cinderella here.Grown women seem to retain this childhood fantasy. Just look at the pomp and circumstance surrounding the royal wedding and endless conversation about Princess Kate.Juggling celebrity le  In one of Meghanaposs most popular posts, Meghan offered her candid thoughts on how to juggle celebrity le with giving back and doing her day job.The ,-word post was published in October , months after starting her relationship with Prince Harry.I’m consistently asked how I keep a foot in two contrasting worlds – one in the entertainment industry, predicated on wealth and indulgence, and the other in humanitarian work.To me, it’s less of a question of how can you do this, and more a question of how can you not, Meghan wrote.She also describes her upbringing in Los Angeles, Calornia, with her free-spirited clinical therapist mom and the most hardworking father you can imagine, and how, even at , she wanted to become an independent, strong woman.Meghan added: While my le shts from refugee camps to red carpets, I choose them both because these worlds can, in fact, coexist. And for me, they must. My eleven year old self would be proud, because while I may not have realized it at the time, I, in fact, have always had a foot in the world of entertainment as well as the world of public service my le now is simply a more heightened version of the very reality in which I grew up. And, truth be told, it’s the most beautul gt I never knew I always had.Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Prince HarryMeghan MarkleRoyal Family\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

She added that some head teachers would also be expected to retire within the transition period.#Job sizing will be criticalthe proposals are to be implemented,# Ms Connor said.Council documents explain that the process of job sizing takes into account the size of schools, leadership roles and teaching time when deciding on the salary scale for promoted posts in education.#Head teachers retiring would also form part of the modelling,# Ms Connor added. #If a school collective was agreed where there were, for example, seven head teachers then two might be retiring and that would form part of the model.#Until collectives are looked at in more detail we can#t have a clear idea of staff numbers.#As part of the consultation process, which started in November and is due to finish on March , the council has shared its proposals with parent groups and community councils.Feedback from the consultation is timetabled to be presented to Argyll and Bute Council in April.This will be followed by the proposals being voted on towards the end of  and,approved, interim processes to bring in the changes would begin in spring .At Tuesday#s meeting it was explained, however, that the consultation will continue throughout the process with pupils, parents and educators being included in the process throughout.In addition, dialogue is continuing with the Roman Catholic Diocese of Argyll and the Isles concerning the involvement of faith schools in school collectives.These discussions were described by council officers as #ongoing# and #collaborative#.Concerns were also raised about the timing of the proposed changes, coming when pupils# education and wellbeing had been impacted by the pandemic.Acting Head of Education Learning and Teaching Wendy Brownlie said: #Young people#s views have been gathered throughout and they have expressed really interesting points both for and against the changes.#The consultation paper addresses the issue of the pandemic by saying: #The last couple of years have been extraordinarily challenging for schools.

And now. after two years they have recruited over  participants from  sites across the UK.Prior to the launch of MND-SMART, only three of the sites had run clinical trials in MND in the last decade.MND-SMART is designed to test more than one drug at the same time and be adaptive so that researchers can mody their approach according to emerging results. The trial has so far been testing two active drugs and more drugs will be added, in due course, while medicines that prove ineffective will be dropped.Dr Suvankar Pal, Euan MacDonald Centre for MND Research, University of Edinburgh and Co-lead Investigator of MND-SMART, said, “Historically, you would have a two-armed trial that looks at one active drug against a placebo [dummy drug], but this trial design allows us to test many, many more active drugs simultaneously and therefore get a definitive answer [phase ] more quickly, which is a much more efficient way of doing things.”Doddie’s Foundation has a clear vision of a world free of motor neuron disease and was founded in response to his frustration at the lack of options given to MND patients – no effective treatment, no access to meaningful clinical trials and no hope.The aims of the Foundation are to raise funds to aid research into the causes of MND and investigate potential cures and to make grants to iniduals suffering from MND, to enable them to live as fulfilled a le as possible.Olivia Bird, Research and Grants Officer at My Name’ Doddie Foundation, said, “We are delighted to continue our involvement in this landmark trial in MND and it is brilliant to see what progress has been made, despite the challenges of working around a pandemic.“We are incredibly grateful to the trial teams across the UK who have shown commitment and enthusiasm to get the trial up and running, and to our supporters who have gone to extraordinary s to raise much needed funds.”.removeA £, grant was also awarded to Newcastle NHS Foundation Trust to facilitate recruitment of patients in the northeast of England."},{"url":null,"title":"highway-code-changes-make-roads-safer-says-cycling-scotland","story":"CHANGES to the Highway Code have been welcomed by Cycling Scotland, the nation’s cycling organisation.The changes come into effect today and will impact all road users but will have the overall goal of making roads safer for people on foot, bikes and horses.Around , people took part in a consultation, with the UK government saying that most people who responded were in favour of the proposed changes.The change in rules will see users who are most at risk moved to the top of the hierarchy and enforces the idea that motorists need to be more aware of cyclists, and cyclists need to be more aware of pedestrians.Among the many changes, cyclists are advised to ride in the centre of a lane on quieter roads, in slower-moving traffic, and when approaching junctions to make themselves as visible as possible.They can ride two abreast, as is already the case but must allow drivers behind them to overtakeit is safe to do so.Other key amendments include clearer guidance for drivers to leave a distance of at least . metres when overtaking cyclists, and there will also be a recommendation for car occupants to open doors using their hand on the opposite side to the door, making them turn their head to look over their shoulder behind them.This technique, known as the Dutch Reach, reduces the chances of doors being opening into the path of cyclists and motorcyclists.Drivers and motorcyclists should now give priority to cyclists on roundabouts. The guidance will say they should not attempt to overtake people cycling within that person’s lane and should allow people cycling to move across their path as they travel around the roundabout.Cyclists will still be able to remain in the left-hand lane when going across or around a roundabout. The new guidance is due that will tell motorists to pay extra attention to this, taking care not to cut off cyclists doing this.Christopher Johnson, Head of Education and Training, Cycling Scotland said: “We welcome the updates to the Highway Code as one of many actions needed to prevent people being seriously injured and killed on our roads in Scotland..remove“The new hierarchy of road users underpins the changes - those who can cause the greatest harm have the greatest responsibility to reduce the risk to others: people driving will be responsible for ensuring people cycling, walking and wheeling are safe, while people cycling will be responsible for looking out for those walking and wheeling.“Many of the changes to the Highway Code are not new but are clarying or explaining existing rules. We encourage everyone to read the new guidance and follow it, whether you’re walking or wheeling, riding a bike or horse or driving a vehicle.“While good progress has been on road safety overall in the last decade, sadly still too many people are killed or seriously injured while walking or cycling”All road users are urged to study the new rules."},{"url":null,"title":"peeblesshire-man-pays-tribute-borders-college-education","story":"A BORDERS man now living in America says his education helped kickstart a career that has seen him travel the globe.Craig Ferguson, who grew up in Walkerburn, resides in Houston, Texas with his we and two sons.The -year-old engineer’s career has also seen him call the Netherlands and Australia home, but he says he still misses the Borders.“I have been fortunate enough to travel the world and have worked in some interesting places but I miss the Scottish Borders,” said Craig.“I attended Walkerburn Primary School in , where I became friends with recent Borders College Honorary Fellow Ross Dickinson and we remain good friends to this day.“I developed a passion for the Borders landscape as a youngster and loved exploring the rolling hills.

officer for the National Trust, said: “Thousands of tonnes of tobacco were deposited at Formby each year for almost two decades, and while the waste itself isn’t toxic, the sheer quantity inevitably means it is going to have a dramatic impact on the ecology and the structure of any landscape.“Dunes should look like sandy hills, with rolling undulations – but this area is completely flat and covered in nettles and thistles.“It effectively creates a barrier that prevents toads and lizards from being able to move across the site.“The animals need areas of bare sand mixed with patches of vegetation, so they have places to hunt and bask as well as room to hibernate, and for lizards, somewhere to lay eggs.”With changing weather patterns driven by climate change, it is important that wildle can move freely to areas of habitat with better conditions, she said.vw,vw,px, px\"New breeding pool created as part of efforts to help natterjack toads The restoration project involves excavating two large V-shaped wedges from the dunes with diggers, which will allow sand blown from the beach to be pushed through the gaps and build up on top of the tobacco waste..removeThe sand will cover the nettles and create new, undulating dunes on the two-hectaresite, it is hoped.In addition,  breeding pools for natterjack toads will be created along theof Formby dunes to resemble the ponds that appear naturally for short periods, while invasive plants will be removed to create patches of bare sand for the amphibians to hide in and reptiles to find food.Natterjack toads – the loudest amphibian in Europe with a call that can be heard up to kmaway – have seen an estimated % of their breeding sites vanish since the start of the th century.They are increasingly under pressure due to loss of habitat as well as climate change and rising pollution, the National Trust said.vw,vw,px, px\"Tobacco in the sand at Formby with the “tobacco clfs” behind Formby, cared for by the conservation charity, is part of the kmSefton Coast dune system stretching from Liverpool to Southport, which is one of the largest of its kind in England and home to % of the UK’s natterjacks.Ms Spall said the area was one of the last strongholds for the toads, so it was crucial to link up habitats and boost their chances of survival, adding: “We hope this work will offer them a leline”.It is also hoped the work will help wildle including sand lizards, which bury their eggs in bare sand and the rare northern tiger beetle, which is only found in Merseyside and Cumbria.The work is part of the UK-wide £ million “Dynamic Dunescapes” project funded by National Lottery Heritage Fund and EU Le Programme, which is based on the idea that sand dunes that move and change are better for nature than stable, static ones.The public are also being urged to play their part by not paddling in the dune pools or letting dogs go in them, instead paddling in the sea and carrying water for pets..push,i[r].l*new

honour the traditional Scots dish with a rendition of one of Robert Burns’ most famous and oft-performed poems: Address To a Haggis.Usually recited by the dinners host, the tongue-in-cheek address has been a long-established focal point of the Burns Supper, a night which celebrates the birth date of the literary legend himself: January , .After the haggis is piped to the table , Burns’ words are recited over the dish as it is cut open and served to the guests.Some say it is wise to cut a small incision in the side of the haggis before it is properly \"cut open\" on the table - tales of guests being scalded by flying contents during enthusiastic recitals have been told.Others say this is part of the fun.What is the history of an Address to a Haggis The address was composed in the year  - not long after the poet arrived in Scotland’s capital city. There are two stories linked to the poem’s inception - one more romantic than the other.The first version alleges he’d been invited for dinner at the house of a merchant friend, Andrew Bruce, and composed the poem to amuse the wealthy host and his guests.The second, and slightly more charming version, is that he composed the poem off-the-cuff whilst visiting the house of his cabinetmaker friend, John Morrison, in a fit of inspiration brought on by the sight of the luxurious meat pudding.In the th century, haggis would not be a meal enjoyed very often – reserved as an item of extravagance and occasion. Based on Burns’ political persuasion, it’s been speculated that his tribute was ironic in its praise – poking fun at the upper classes who might revere it as an item of luxury.Though the true origin of the poem is debated, it was one of Burns’ first poems to be published in the Edinburgh periodical, The Caledonian Mercury, on December , ..removeA quick video search for an “Address to the Haggis” brings up hundreds of results, ranging from a “Haggis Address for Kids”, recitals at kitchen tables and in dingy restaurants - to a piper in full dress, piping the dish into the National Museum of Scotland in Edinburgh.  High-society lestyle magazine Tatler recently published an article titled “Where to head for the finest Burns Night supper in London” - it’s clear that the Address to the Haggis can and should be performed in places both high and low. As thousands of Addresses to the Haggis continue to be made the world over, it’s inevitable that each one will have a character of its own - something the Bard himself would surely have approved of. Address to a Haggis by Robert Burns, in FullFair fa your honest, sonsie face, Great chieftain o the pudding-race! Aboon them a ye tak your place, Painch, tripe, or thairm : Weel are ye wordy oa grace As langs my arm. The groaning trencher there ye fill, Your hurdies like a distant hill, Your pin wad help to mend a mill In time oneed, While thro your pores the dews distil Like amber bead. His kne see rustic Labourdight, An cut you up wi ready sleight, Trenching your gushing entrails bright, Like ony ditch And then, O what a glorious sight, Warm-reekin, rich! Then, horn for horn, they stretch an strive: Deil tak the hindmost!

However, seven councillors, including ward members Norman Hampshire and Sue Kempson, voted for the proposals to be refused.Mr Hampshire, who is leader of East Lothian Council, chairs its planning committee and was pleased the proposals had been turned down again.He said: “I’m absolutely delighted that the reporter has refused this. I do believe there is a way this building could be restored, along with parking on the land at the back.“It is really important that the owner of the building either takes this forward and develops it doing that or sells it. The parking within that area is really under pressure.“To put another development without additional parking at the back would have made it dangerous for the people living there.”: Subscribe to the East Lothian Courier for FREE... but offer ends on Monday!Pippa Swan, chairwoman of Dunbar Community Council, was keen to ensure the building had a future.She was “surprised” by the decision but added that the reasons for refusal were “well rehearsed”.She said: “Everybody is supportive of development and any development has got to be respectful of the shape of the Assembly Rooms.”"},{"url":null,"title":"sustaining-north-berwick-welcomes-new-members","story":"The community group looks at sustainable, ecological living on a local level, and is part of the nationwide Climate Cafe movement.Member Ruth Hunter-Pepper highlighted the group’s successful COP meet on the beach last November, and spoke of plans for a March event, which will feature businesses and organisations such as energy companies and environmental charities, and provide advice and guidance on ecological living to visitors.: Subscribe to the East Lothian Courier for FREE... but offer ends on Monday!Member Kathy Duncan also spoke about the group’s tree-planting programme and her work to help create a wildle garden ‘trail’ through the town.Ruth also expressed her gratitude to the Seabird Centre for the use of its cafe, and a hope that the two organisations could work together in future on local sustainability projects."},{"url":null,"title":"tuck-shop-plan-helps-pupils-yester-primary-win-election","story":"For on the same day that residents in the Preston Seton Gosford ward were going to the polls, youngsters at Yester Primary School were casting their own votes.The election was part of Ps’ democracy and discrimination topic, which saw pupils investigating how parliament and government works, and reading the main political parties’ manestos, before creating their own parties and manestos.Children across the school attended a polling station in the school’s sports hall last Thursday to vote for one of five political parties: Breaktime Buddies, Inclusioknights, Successful Plants, Yester’s Eco Fun and Yester’s Future.In the end, Breaktime Buddies were duly elected, having gathered  per cent of the whole school vote.They will now oversee their ideas being used for school improvement: a Friday tuck shop with healthy snacks, a slide and basketball net for the playground, and clubs for children to socialise.Alison Hamilton, P class teacher, said: “The children were self-motivated, enthusiastic and resilient.

Pugh’s monumental history of Dunbar is consulted, we read that there was a turnpike toll at Kirkhill near the town’s parish church another on the main road through Belhaven and a third known as Cleikimin Toll on the road from Dunbar to Spott.Kirkhill Toll stood near the parish church, near the former site of the Bellevue Hotel there is a house at the site today but this rather large two-story building does not look like a toll-house.Cleikimin Toll stood until Edwardian times but is today buried underneath the A road.Mr Pugh assures us that Belhaven Toll was known within living memory to bus drivers and conductors, but its situation has been open to debate.The Canmore database of Historic Environment Scotland contains the following reference to it: “Benston Cottage, in the angle between the Aand the south going cross road, is reported locally to have been a toll house, but it shows no features distinguishing as such apart, perhaps, from an outshot  foot square abutting its E end, with a small window facing the road. Visited  February .”Now who is right  The Belhaven locals or the Edinburgh architectural historian The earliest newspaper mention of Belhaven Toll is from July , when a certain James M’Dougal was on trial in Edinburgh for issuing counterfeit £ banknotes.The prisoner had asked several toll-keepers to issue change for his bogus banknotes, but when he came to Belhaven Toll and asked for a glass of whisky, the tollkeeper James Liddle did not at all like the look of the £ note he was handed.After the scoundrel M’Dougal had beaten a hasty retreat, Liddle gave the banknote to a Dunbar bank agent who pronounced it to be a forgery.M’Dougal was found guilty and sentenced to death issuing  banknotes was considered a heinous offence in those days.The property page of The Scotsman of March ,  contains the following important notice: “LAND AND HOUSES NEAR DUNBAR.It says: “The park adjoining the post-road on the west side of Belhaven Toll, consisting of  acres English measure or thereby, as presently possessed by Mr France, together with the dwelling-house, large garden, and offices thereon, called Rosebank.”It turns out that Rosebank House is still standing today, although a number of houses have been built in its extensive grounds, some of them along Edinburgh Road itself, including the former Belhaven police station.The next mention of Belhaven Toll is in the Edinburgh Evening Courant of October , , announcing the sale of “That PIECE of ENCLOSED GROUND, extending to   Acres imperial measure of thereby, situated to the South of Belhaven Toll-Bar, on the West Side of the road leading from Belhaven to Spott, and contiguous to the Line of the North British Railway Company”.These newspaper notices establish, without any doubt, that there was a toll-bar at Belhaven, constructed before  and still operational in  when the arrival of the railways meant that the old tollgates were under threat.William Forrest’s  map of Haddingtonshire tells us that the toll was there already by that time, at the junction of the post-road and a road going to the south-east.The newspapers provide some further valuable clues to its position.Back in , the grounds of Rosebank were on the south side of the post-road [today Edinburgh Road], just west of the junction with the road from Belhaven to Spott [today Beveridge Row].In , the farmland between Belhaven and the mainline railway was bordering what is today the west side of Beveridge Row and stated to be situated to the south of Belhaven Toll.This would indicate that the toll-house was situated at the corner of Edinburgh Road and Beveridge Row, and indeed this is the exact position of ‘Benston Cottage’ described in the Canmore survey by the doubting Edinburgh historian. I would not agree with the opinion of this inidual that the building looks unlike a toll-house.The Edinburgh toll-houses, of which specimens survive at Morningside and Merchiston, are single-storey buildings but have some quaint architectural features. The East Lothian toll-houses were even more primitive, even by the standards of the time: small and low cottages offering only the most basic amenities.Belhaven Toll – alias Benston Cottage – very much, in fact, resembles the Goatfield toll-house at what is today  Dunbar Road, Haddington, and the surviving toll-house in Haddington, Abbey and Aberlady.Thus it can be concluded that the locals were right, and that Belhaven Toll still stands today!On the morning of September , , the No.  bus between Dunbar and North Berwick took off without any incident.But on Edinburgh Road, Belhaven, it was involved in a collision with a Vauxhall Antara and veered off the road, crashing right into. . . Benston Cottage alias Belhaven Toll!Fortunately, the cottage was empty as it was undergoing renovation further remedial work would surely be needed since the bus hit it with considerable force, knocking down the front door and some of the wall.A number of police and firefighters were soon at the scene, successfully cutting the trapped bus driver free using hydraulic gear and making sure that the other victims of the crash were taken away in ambulances. A -year-old East Linton RAF veteran, who had been a passenger on the bus, hit a handrail hard and later died in hospital.A -year-old man, the driver of the Antara, was charged with causing the incident, being handed by the courts an order of  hours of community service and banned from driving for three years.As for the battered former toll-house, it was repaired and taken care of by a firm of property developers, and is today used as a holiday let for out-of-town sportsmen and visitors, ‘sleeping six’ in the restored cottage and offering extra storage for surf boards and golf clubs.It is curious that neither the newspaper accounts of the bus crash, nor the Benston Cottage homepage ‘fishing’ for customers, mention the interesting past of the former toll-house.History can be made, but it can equally easily be forgotten."},{"url":null,"title":"last-chance-subscribe-free-thirty-days","story":"The East Lothian Courier team want to bring you consistent exclusive coverage of our one-of-a-kind area.  In order to continuously deliver that, we need your support.

address has been a long-established focal point of the Burns Supper, a night which celebrates the birth date of the literary legend himself: January , .After the haggis is piped to the table , Burns’ words are recited over the dish as it is cut open and served to the guests.Some say it is wise to cut a small incision in the side of the haggis before it is properly \"cut open\" on the table - tales of guests being scalded by flying contents during enthusiastic recitals have been told.Others say this is part of the fun.The address was composed in the year  - not long after the poet arrived in Scotland’s capital city. There are two stories linked to the poem’s inception - one more romantic than the other.The first version alleges he’d been invited for dinner at the house of a merchant friend, Andrew Bruce, and composed the poem to amuse the wealthy host and his guests.The second, and slightly more charming version, is that he composed the poem off-the-cuff whilst visiting the house of his cabinetmaker friend, John Morrison, in a fit of inspiration brought on by the sight of the luxurious meat pudding.In the th century, haggis would not be a meal enjoyed very often – reserved as an item of extravagance and occasion. Based on Burns’ political persuasion, it’s been speculated that his tribute was ironic in its praise – poking fun at the upper classes who might revere it as an item of luxury.Though the true origin of the poem is debated, it was one of Burns’ first poems to be published in the Edinburgh periodical, The Caledonian Mercury, on December , .A quick video search for an “Address to the Haggis” brings up hundreds of results, ranging from a “Haggis Address for Kids”, recitals at kitchen tables and in dingy restaurants - to a piper in full dress, piping the dish into the National Museum of Scotland in Edinburgh.  High-society lestyle magazine Tatler recently published an article titled “Where to head for the finest Burns Night supper in London” - it’s clear that the Address to the Haggis can and should be performed in places both high and low. As thousands of Addresses to the Haggis continue to be made the world over, it’s inevitable that each one will have a character of its own - something the Bard himself would surely have approved of. Fair fa your honest, sonsie face, Great chieftain o the pudding-race! Aboon them a ye tak your place, Painch, tripe, or thairm : Weel are ye wordy oa grace As langs my arm. The groaning trencher there ye fill, Your hurdies like a distant hill, Your pin wad help to mend a mill In time oneed, While thro your pores the dews distil Like amber bead. His kne see rustic Labour dight, An cut you up wi ready sleight, Trenching your gushing entrails bright, Like ony ditch And then, O what a glorious sight, Warm-reekin, rich! Then, horn for horn, they stretch an strive: Deil tak the hindmost! on they drive, Till a their weel-swalld kytes belyve Are bent like drums Then auld Guidman, maist like to rive, Bethankit! hums. Is there that owre his French ragout Or olio that wad staw a sow, Or fricassee wad make her spew Wi perfect sconner, Looks down wi sneering, scornfu view On sic a dinner  Poor devil! see him owre his trash, As feckless as witherd rash, His spindle shank, a guid whip-lash His nieve a nit Thro bloody flood or field to dash, O how unfit! But mark the Rustic, haggis-fed, The trembling earth resounds his tread. Clap in his walie nieve a blade, Hell mak it whissle An legs an arms, an heads will sned, Like taps o thrissle. Ye Powrs, wha mak mankind your care, And dish them out their bill o fare, Auld Scotland wants nae skinking ware That jaups in luggies But,ye wish her gratefu prayer Gie her a haggis! "},{"url":null,"title":"new-highway-code-2022-test-new-rules-starting-today","story":"Major changes to the Highway Code requiring drivers to have more responsibility to look out for cyclists and pedestrians risk failing to boost safety due to not being widely promoted, campaigners have warned.Charity Cycling UK said that a “long-term and well-funded communications campaign” is needed to make people aware of the update.The Highway Code, which contains advice and rules for people on Britain’s roads, is being amended this weekend to introduce a risk-based hierarchy of road users.Here’s everything you need to know about what’s new as the rules of the roads receive an update.Hierarchy of road usersA new hierarchy means people in charge of vehicles that can cause the most harm in the event of a collision have the greatest responsibility to look out for other road users.Walking, cycling or riding in shared spacesCyclists should not overtake people walking or riding a horse in shared spaces closely or at high speed, while pedestrians should take care not to obstruct paths.Positioning of cyclistsCyclists should make themselves as visible as possible by riding in the centre of lanes on quiet roads, in slower-moving traffic and at the approach to junctions.Pedestrians crossing at junctionsTurning traffic should give way when people are crossing or waiting to cross at junctions.Traffic must give way to people on zebra crossings.Overtaking cyclistsDrivers travelling at speeds of up to mph should leave at least . metres when overtaking cyclists.They should give more space when overtaking at higher speeds.Opening car doorsCar occupants should open doors using their hand on the opposite side to the door, making them turn their head to look over their shoulder.This technique, known as the Dutch Reach, reduces the chances of doors being opened into the path of cyclists and motorcyclists.Overtaking cyclists at junctionsWhen cyclists are going straight ahead at a junction, they have priority over traffic waiting to turn into or out of a side road, unless road signs or markings indicate otherwise.Cycling in groupsPeople cycling can ride two abreast but should be considerate of the needs of other road users when in groups.RoundaboutsDrivers should take extra care when entering roundabouts to make sure they do not cut across cyclists.Electric vehicle chargingElectric car owners using a public chargepoint should park near the device and avoid creating a trip hazard from trailing cables."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/12800707.jpg?type=article-full","title":"runs-scotland-investigation-scotlands-corridors-power-full","story":"Our subscribers will get exclusive access to the people and organisations with signicant influence over so many aspects of our lives. From the hundreds of secret lobbying meetings to who really runs Scotlands wind farms, whisky and media -

Rural communities seethe with as much intrigue as city offices and staff-rooms, and landscape is as menacing as cityscape.This inconvenient truism is brought home to Hinchclfe’s unnamed narrator when she is “hurtling together in silence between the confines of the dykes” with the bus driver on her way home from the local town to the cottage she has rented on the Hare House estate in Dumfries and Galloway. The bus hits a hare on the road, mashing its hindquarters but failing to kill it. Too urban and prissy to put the animal out of its misery, our narrator watches it “take too long to die”. As the moribund hare eyeballs her back, the “peaceful months of dreamless nights and busy days” that she has hitherto enjoyed in her cottage evaporate, just as her youth had done in London.Also watching her is Janet, who lives in the next-door cottage. A study in be-anoraked Scottish dourness, with the obligatory impenetrable accent, Janet manages to be malicious even when offering helpful lts into town. But is the older woman a witch, somehow in league with the live hares in the landscape and the stuffed ones in glass cases at Hare House, as Cass, the disturbed flibbertigibbet daughter of the house, maintains, or is she just a joyless busybody Either way, it becomes clear that the dying hare on the road is a metaphor both for what is to come and what has been. Did our narrator control its fate, or was it controlling hers  This question of who’s the victim and who’s the perpetrator pertains to the two intertwined mysteries – one in the past and one in the present – that lie at heart of Hinchclfe’s dark and absorbing second novel.As we learn that our nameless narrator has fled London and her previous job at a private girls’ school in mysterious circumstances, we begin to wonder what made her sixth-form class of fresh, young girls fall down “like petals from a rose”. Who was the victim of this mass fainting  The seasoned teacher grown bitter as love turned sour, or the smirking teenage girl with a “high, light silver” laugh Cass has mockery in her armour too, and the present begins to mirror the past. “She was, after all, no more than a silly girl, and I was done with teenage girls,” the ex-teacher, who is now secretly churning out essays for coin, opines, after being dragged past a magic pool to the family graveyard by the too-chummy girl. But when Cass’s brother asks our narrator to tutor his sister through her Highers, she agrees.Consciously or otherwise, the flame-haired beauty, who has all the loveliness that our narrator believes she has lost, sees through the older woman. “People are always drawn to Maggie’s Pool,” she jokes – or does she  “Especially those with a dark past and a history to hide.” When the ex-teacher loses her rag with the fragile girl over a prank with the stuffed hares in the hallway, we begin seriously to question her reliability as a narrator.“Too late, I recalled myself,” she tells the increasingly sceptical reader. “A reaction, of course, was what she wanted, what they always wanted.”A compelling chiller redolent of Zoë Heller’s Notes on a Scandal, Hare House treads the treacherous line between the real and the supernatural with dexterity. It is also a beautul,sinister, evocation of the Dumfries and Galloway landscape, which is the only hero in a cast of self-absorbed manipulators and, as the author notes in her acknowledgements, deserves to be better known."},{"url":null,"title":"letters-glasgow-keep-buchanan-galleries-invest-sauchiehall-street-wasteland","story":"However, it seems Susan Aitken believes the Buchanan Galleries has to go and our city streets could be “endlessly adaptable” .

Beautul on a nice day, but occasionally savage when the wind, scudding cloud and rain came in. On the latter days, there was satisfaction in using the skills acquired over the years to maintain a vital leline service.Removing all air traffic personnel from these airfields wouldn’t make them unsafe, but it would certainly make them less safe. In this day and age, that isn’t a direction we should be heading in, and I congratulate the union Prospect for its campaign to prevent it, and HIAL for having the courage and sense to mody their plans.Dough Maughan, Dunblane.A DIFFERENT APPROACH TO MENTAL HEALTHWHEN I was in General Practice, a GP was a mix of clinician and social worker. It wasn’t satisfactory for doctors, but patients seemed content.A district nurse and health visitor attached to the practice was a huge improvement. They liked having the immediate support of a doctor and we benefited from their care of our patients and their reports at regular meetings. A nurse-run “Well Man\" clinic brought in patients who had not seen a doctor for many years and uncovered many problems, from hypertension to alcoholism, at an early and treatable stage.Now many practices employ part-time doctors. “I never see the same doctor twice” is the complaint I hear from patients. I started as a part-timer and found not being able to follow up the same patient totally unsatisfactory for me too. Telephone diagnoses with or without photos must be equally unsatisfactory in many cases. Getting it right first time matters.To satisfy patients’ needs, General Practice changed from a doctor with few treatments and little help to the specialised unit it is now. However, Covid’s lockdown has spawned an epidemic of mental problems, especially in the young. Some require medication. Many require what I would call community support.I remember a teenager with severe anorexia. She was continually in and out of psychiatric wards. Her single mother was distraught. However, her grandmother visited the girl in hospital, sat by her side and said how very sorry she was to see her like this because she and her husband had planned the trip of a letime to Australia and had been relying on their granddaughter to accompany them. The girl gained weight and was out of hospital in three weeks. They went to Australia when she came back the girl went straight to university, where she found supportive friends and work she enjoyed. Granny cured her, not me, not the psychiatrists.Is it time to discuss dferent ways of offering psychological care  Should we demand for our patients that psychiatrists set up and oversee groups who get together to work and talk and support each other  I have seen these used with benefit for early dementia where woodwork, knitting and crochet and chat reactivated failing brains. For depressed teenagers it could be extended to joining community choirs, walking groups, work in food banks, meals on wheels, anything that engenders self-worth. A cure without mind-bending medication is worth trying.Elizabeth Scott, Edinburgh.ISLANDS DESERVE TO BE SUBSIDISEDI NOTE an interesting article by Alan Simpson where he suggests that bridges rather than ferries should be employed to allow access to and from the Scottish islands .I would contend that bridges are simply not an option to the Western Isles, Shetland or Orkneywhere around  per cent of Scottish islanders permanently live. Think Boris Bridge to Northern Ireland that is the distance we are talking about. We are also not talking about connecting Denmark to Sweden and the traffic volumes that generates.Of the remainder, Bute, Raasay, Kerrera and Lismore might be feasible. Mull is already on the agenda.Scotland’s islands are amongst our greatest landscape and cultural assets and given their produce such as oil, renewables and whisky, they are also huge economic assets. They deserve taxpayer subsidy.More smaller ferries with more frequent sailings have been requested by a number of island groups let’s provide them.Willie Towers, Alford.A STORM IN A TEACUPHOLY mackerel, the ba’s on the slate, my gas at a peep, and my conversation up the creek without a paddle, on taking Fridays “Issue of the Day” on board .Hand on heart, I have aired some of those cited in recent weeks, and in the last dew days alone, “pearls before swine” on ceding access to a good friend on my way to “seeing a man about a dog”, aka “signing the visitors’ book”.Too long in the tooth, what to do Sweet Fanny Adams, I guess.R Russell Smith, Largs.CODE REDREGARDLESS of recent amendments to the Highway Code, all experienced car drivers will continue to observe the old unwritten rule about cyclists.

Now living and farming with her husband Ewan and two-year-old son Len on the Isle of Bute, Scots-born Emma first came under the media spotlight back in  as a -year-old shepherdess living and working solo at Fallowlees, a remote National Trust hill farm in rural Northumberland.Staying in a relic of the past that had no mains electricity, gas, water, or telephone line, she looked after  sheep, often supplementing her income shepherding for other farms, which at one point saw her caring for  sheep.Emma’s years in Northumberland are vividly brought to le in her two books: One Girl And Her Dogs: Le, Love and Lambing in the Middle of Nowhereand more recent My Farming Le .The eldest of three girls born and brought up on the family’s farm in Hawick, Emma’s books are compulsive reading and reveal the physical and emotional highs and lows as well as providing frank and fascinating insight into farming le.Books led to television appearances, which included The Alan Titchmarsh Show – after which she was dubbed Britain’s loneliest shepherdess – and Robson Green’s Tales from Northumberland.The remote farm was also used as a location for the TV detective series Vera, which gave Emma unexpected funds, used to buy her first cows, four cross-bred heers and an abandoned horse, later joined by an abandoned goat she named Mr Tumnus after the faun in the Narnia books. Farming leaves scant time for a social le and, living in the middle of nowhere, Emma’s chances of finding a le partner were as remote as the farm.Tinder provided the solution, matching her with Galashiels firefighter Ewan Irvine, who admits he bought a copy of her book and fell in love with her before they even met. Possibly Tinder’s best match to date, Ewan split his time between shts and the farm in Northumberland.Emma, meanwhile, was training dogs, winning recognition and trophies as a capable dog handler and serious trialist – training and trialling sheepdogs being her number one passion since she was given her first dog, Bess, at the age of . In , she won the All-England Nursery Final with her dog, Jamie, and the following year was part of the winning England team at the World Sheepdog Trials in Holland.Then she hit the jackpot, selling one of her dogs for , guineas only to go on and later smash her own record with another dog she had bred and trained for a world record sum of , guineas – which she was chuffed to see merited a mention on Have I Got News For You.Marriage in  followed by the birth of baby Len the following year, made le on the farm in Northumberland untenable. “We had to drive four miles down a very rough forestry track to even reach a road,” says Emma.“Through friends, we heard about a farm tenancy on the Isle of Bute and applied – a rigorous process involving business plans, spreadsheets, gross margins and more, but were unsuccessful.“However, shortly after, Mount Stuart Estate offered us a -year tenancy to Ardros Farm, which covers  acres on the west side of the island. We couldn’t believe our luck,” she says. “Fortunately, Mount Stuart Estate is very forward-thinking and recognises the importance of giving young people opportunities. Having been so remote, we are now only a short drive into Rothesay, which is perfect for Len when it comes to nursery and school.”Another plus, having survived a steep learning curve living with Emma in Northumberland, the move to Bute was the catalyst for Ewan to swap the fire service for full-time farming.Born in Glasgow and raised in the south of Edinburgh, Ewan grew up with collies and had lived on a small holding for a while, so knew a little about keeping sheep and cows.“Our goal had been to find a farm that was big enough for both of us to work, and Ardros made it possible,” he says.Currently, they have  dogs,  sheep, and around  cows, the latter a mix of Aberdeen Angus and Bluegray, with a few English Longhorns.“Our claim to fame is one of our sheep is the brother of one of Jeremy Clarkson’s flock,” reveals Emma. Having recently been accepted into the organic scheme, the couple plan to breed and sell fully traceable organic beef and salt marsh lamb locally, making Ardros the first organic farm on the island.“We’ve never used pesticides or fertilisers, we just didn’t have the certication before,” says Emma.“If we are going to eat meat let’s eat good meat, and know it has been ethically reared, grass-fed, lived a good le and died on the island. Our farm is carbon neutral and therefore also better for the environment.”And so to dogs, of which there are many, including Purdy, a cute and highly affectionate toy poodle, which Emma reveals was a present to herself nearly  years ago.“I love all my dogs, but collies are working dogs, whereas Purdy is a pet. Most of my dogs have been Border Collies, the Ferrari of the dog world. To own a sheepdog is to know unbounded loyalty, plus sheep get used to the dog.“Our sheep are good, so we are able to breed and train dogs – and as many farmers don’t have the time to do it themselves, it’s a niche market.“We give them a carefree puppyhood and start training around eight or nine months, and when they reach the age of two, we have to decide whether to compete or work with a dog, or sell it, which can be hard, but then I know I’m helping dogs achieve what they have been bred to do,” explains Emma.The idea for a Sheepdog Schoolcame as a result of having a good internet connection for the first time. However, as being on an island makes it more dficult to provide tuition in person, Emma and Ewan have set up an online video subscription service, which currently has  subscribers.“Increasingly, we are finding people start off with the dog, then the sheep, then the farm … so our dogs are helping draw in a new sector.” Also new for , Emma and Ewan have collaborated with four other young farming couples on the island to form Trials of Bute , a two-day event planned for July - that will include four sheepdog trials and culminate in a championship with a prize pot of £. “Sheepdog trials are such popular spectator events our aim is to make this an annual event, free of charge and easily accessible, so people can come to the island and be inspired, which is how I started,” says Emma.Le has come full circle for this plucky couple. They now have the comfort of a two-bedroomed farmhouse with all mod cons, and their son Len will be able to go to a local school and socialise with other children.www.ardrosfarm"},{"url":null,"title":"jamie-mcgrath-swaps-st-mirren-wigan-athletic-alex-gogic-joins-hibs","story":"The playmaker, who rebuffed approaches from Aberdeen and Hibernian earlier in the transfer window, was out of contract at the end of the season and keen on a move where after breaking into the internatonal set-up.The -year-old has opted for a move down south instead, signing a two-and-a-half-year deal with the English League One side.

It is more important than ever we all get vaccinated to protect ourselves, our family and friends. Boosters increase our protection against the virus up to more than  per cent.We talk to myth-busting medical experts who answer your most frequently asked questions about these essential jabs. vw, px\"  What protection does a booster jab give Dr Emeka Okorocha, who works in AE in London and South East, said: “As a doctor, I have seen first-hand the effect COVID- can have on people. I want to remind everyone you can still get seriously ill with the virus, so it is so important to get the jab to keep ourselves, your friends and loved ones safe. COVID- is highly infectious. The vaccine remains our best line of defence against it. Omicron is highly transmissible and still has the potential to lead to signicant numbers of people in hospital, so it’s so important your immunity is topped up, and to come forward for your first or second doseyou haven’t already. We don’t know what threat any future iants may pose, soyou haven’t come forward for any jabs, it is absolutely essential you do so.”When can you have a booster jab Yorkshire-based Professor Mahendra G Patel OBE, Pharmacy and Inclusion and Diversity Lead, said: “You can get a COVID- booster three months after your second dose and  days after positive COVID test. It’s also not too late to get a first or second dose. Getting the vaccine has never been easier. Everybody aged  and over have now been offered two doses of a COVID- vaccine. If you are  years old or above on the day the vaccinations are taking place in school, you will be able to access a vaccine.If you have not yet had a COVID- vaccine, it’s not too late. Appointments for first doses of COVID- vaccines are still available for anyone unvaccinated.”Is it safe to have a booster jabI’m pregnant London-based Dr Jenny Jardine from Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, who is also seven months pregnant and has had her COVID- booster jab, said: “Both as a doctor and pregnant mother myself, we can now be very confident the COVID- vaccinations provide the best possible protection for you and your unborn child against this virus. I would strongly call on all pregnant women like me,you haven’t had the vaccine yet, to either speak to your GP or midweyou still have questions and then book right away today.”Does a booster jab carry side effects Dr Okorocha said: “The COVID- vaccine is quick, easy and free. Don’t worry about the side effects. Like all medicines, the COVID- vaccines may cause some side effects, but most of these are mild and short-term, lasting no longer than a week, and not everyone gets them. Also,you weren’t able to get your booster dose because you had COVID-, remember to book your jab  days after you no longer have the virus.”How easy is it to get a booster jab Bradford-based NHS Dr Amir Khan said: “We know many people are juggling busy lives, which is exactly why the NHS is making it as easy as possible for you to get your booster. New walkin vaccination sites have been set up across the country, and existing sites have extended their opening hours, so as many people as possible can get jabbed as soon as possible. And, once you’ve had your vaccine, then why not encourage your friends and family to book as well, so we all have the best protection possible.”How effective is a booster jab Prof Patel said: “New analysis of vaccine efficacy by UKHSA has found protection against hospitalisation from vaccines is good against the Omicron iant. When the reduced risk of hospitalisation was combined with vaccine effectiveness against symptomatic disease, the vaccine effectiveness against hospitalisation was estimated as  per cent two weeks after a booster dose. One dose of any vaccine was associated with a  per cent reduced risk of hospitalisation among symptomatic cases with the Omicron iant, two doses with a  per cent reduction up to  weeks after the second dose and a  per cent reduced risk  or more weeks after the second dose.”Your booster jab is vital vw, px\"  copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

We need to be careful that the national messaging, which currently sits well within larger city areas, does not impact negatively here.“The simple solution is for everyone to maintain the good practices in place that have kept many of us safe to this point. They include the wearing of masks, distancing, sanitising and keeping up the regular lateral flow testing and logging the results online whether positive or negative which help our colleagues in Public Health keep on top of potential community transmission.”The Scottish Government has announced new guidance on working from home will come into effect on Monday, January .This will recommend that employers consider a hybrid working system, with staff spending some time in the office and some time at home.Businesses had previously been asked to enable staff to work from home where possible.The requirement for physical distancing in settings where certain people are exempt from wearing face coverings # like those leading religious services or carrying out some receptionist duties # will be reduced from m to m from January .Face coverings will no longer be required for any adult taking part in organised activities with children under the age of five.OLECG vice-chair and the council’s interim executive director of environmental, property  IT services, Hayley Green, said: “Our business continuity plans are holding up but there remains a fragility and we do not want to react in a manner that could potentially risk services, particularly frontline essential services, by implementing change too quickly # we must maintain a steady as we go approach. We do not expect any signicant changes in the meantime in terms of how we are operating.“We will consider the new guidance carefully and make decisions based on the safety of all and the resilience of our operations.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

It is moored on a single tension tether. The subsea location and ability to winch low in the water column enables extreme storm loadings to be avoided so that the device can continue to operate in rough sea conditions. The Waveswing is designed to react to long ocean swell waves as well as short, wind-driven seas, for high energy capture.The £. million prototype project has been funded by Wave Energy Scotlandas part of the Novel Wave Energy Converter development programme. The demonstration at EMEC is also supported by the Interreg North-West Europe’s Ocean DEMO project.Neil Kermode, managing director, EMEC said:“We’re delighted to welcome AWS and the Archimedes Waveswing to Orkney and support its deployment and testing at our site in Scapa Flow.“Real sea deployment is a vital step in proving performance, reliability and survivability of these devices. We know that prototype testing at sea is really valuable to technology developers to check how a technology and its components work and react in the environment prior to scaling up. We are looking forward to helping the team as they prove how to install, operate and maintain their exciting machine in Orkney’s harsh conditions.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Alli has struggled under a succession of managers at Spurs in recent seasons and fallen out of the England reckoning. Van de Beek, , has failed to make an impression at Old Trafford since his £million move from Ajax in .On joining Everton, Alli said: “I’m delighted to have signed for Everton, a huge club with a great fanbase and history.“I’m eager to get started and can’t wait for my first game in an Everton shirt.“I’m looking forward to helping the team and the opportunity to work with the new manager Frank Lampard.”Donny van de 𝐁𝐥𝐮𝐞. 👌 pic FDgcgguAc— EvertonJanuary , The signing of Van de Beek is a short-term move that could suit all parties. It is understood there is no option to buy included in the deal while Everton will cover the cost of wages and pay a loan fee.“Now I can say I am an Everton player, I am really happy and can’t wait to help the team,” Van De Beek said.“I think it is a great club. There are really good players here and I came because I want to help them go up the table.”Lampard will hope the arrival of the pair can help re-energise the club and their fans after a miserable campaign to date. The Merseysiders are just four points above the bottom three after winning just one of their last  matches.The mood among supporters has also been low for some time with former Liverpool manager Benitez having proved a hugely unpopular appointment while frustration has also been voiced at the club hierarchy over a number of decisions. vw,vw,px, px\"Lampard will hope to lt the mood at Goodison Park Lampard recognises his immediate task is to turn form around and ensure the club pull away from relegation trouble.The former England midfielder, whose first game will be Saturday’s FA Cup tie against Brentford, told evertontv: “The most important thing to focus on is the short-term.“We know the new stadiumis coming and where this club wants to be, but, first and foremost, there are challenges in front of us right now.“The league position – and an FA Cup game at the weekend. I want to get to work very quickly on that, to deal with the short-term.”Lampard has brought former Cha, Real Madrid and Bayern Munich assistant manager Paul Clement with him as first-team coach. Joe Edwards will be his assistant with Chris Jones as coach and head of performance.🗨️ | \"It is a huge honour for me to represent and manage a club the size and tradition of Everton Football Club.\"📺 Frank Lampards first interview as our manager is now live!— EvertonJanuary , Caretaker manager Duncan Ferguson, who has been a part of the first-team coaching set-up under the last six permanent managers, and goalkeeping coach Alan Kelly will remain on the staff.Lampard said: “I’ve seen things from the outside that will be my priorities to try to improve – firstly, to get results, but also to try to improve confidence and the way we play and to engage with the fans.“The first thing they want is fight and desire and that must always be our baseline.“I knew I had to work overly hardto try to be the best I could. I’m the same as a manager and I want to see that in my team.”Everton’s managerial recruitment process was played out in public – quite literally, with another candidate in Vitor Pereira conducting a live -minute interview with Sky Sports News – but owner Farhad Moshiri is delighted to have finally secured the seventh manager of his near six-year ownership.“He is an impressive young man on and off the pitch,” Moshiri said. “He has played at the very highest level of the game and has football in his blood.“He impressed us all greatly during the thorough interview process and we’re all ready to give him all of our support as he looks to give the team an immediate boost.”We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

Without getting into the accuracy or inaccuracy of what’s being reported, Tom will be the only person to express his plans with complete accuracy.“He knows the realities of the football business and planning calendar as well as anybody, so that should be soon.”Brady said on Monday: “We’re in such an era of information and people want to be in front of the news often, and I totally understand that and understand that’s the environment we’re in.“But I think for me, it’s literally day to day with me. I’m trying to do the best I can every day and evaluate things as they come, and I’m trying to make a great decision for me and my family.“I’ll know when the time’s right. When I know, I’ll know and when I don’t know, I don’t know, and I’m not going to race to some conclusion about that.”Brady won six Super Bowls with the New England Patriots before adding a record seventh with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers last season and, should he leave, would exit on top of the charts in almost every major passing statistic.We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

This pandemic was hard for everyone.”He added: “I get it, and I will fix it. I want to say to the people of this country I know what the issue is.”However, he faced a hostile response from some on his own side and the threat of a vote of no confidence has not yet been defeated.– Former Cabinet minister Andrew Mitchell told Mr Johnson he “no longer enjoys my support”.– Tory MP Angela Richardson announced she had quit as a ministerial aide to Michael Gove, sharing her “deep disappointment” at the handling of the partygate row.– Aaron Bell, part of the  intake of Red Wall MPs, recalled abiding by coronavirus restrictions for his grandmother’s May  funeral before asking: “Does the Prime Minister think I’m a fool ”In the Lords, ex-Whitehall chief and independent crossbencher Lord Kerslake said: “Even without the detail the general findings are utterly damning. This goes to the heart of government. Can government be trusted to do the right thing and tell the truth  It’s hard to think of anything more important than that.”But Leader of the Commons Jacob Rees-Mogg said the “mood was positive” among Conservatives following an evening meeting on the Parliamentary estate.He added: “So many people voted personally for Boris Johnson rather than voting for political parties.“Politicians have to accept that our bosses are the British people, and they voted for that, they put him in office.”Peterborough MP Paul Bristow acknowledged it had been a “dficult day” but said there was support for Mr Johnson. vw,vw,px, px\"Peterborough MP Paul Bristow Mr Bristow said he left “absolutely pumped” and added that nobody in the meeting had called for Mr Johnson to go.The change in mood came as No  confirmed the PM would ask Ms Gray to produce a second report after the police investigation concludes, and committed to publishing it.But Ms Gray’s full report and the result of the police probe could yet threaten his premiership again, and Mr Johnson’s former chief aide Dominic cummings is due to questions on the report online on Tuesday which could provide more damaging details.Polling on Monday night from Opinium said % of UK adults wanted the PM to resign, and % believed Tory MPs should make him go.It comes after the Met revealed it is reviewing more than  images and over  pages of information passed to officers by the Gray inquiry.Mr Rees-Mogg suggested the images should also be published, as he said: “The more people see, the more understanding there will be of precisely what went on.”Mr Johnson also told MPs he was taking the issue seriously, underling how he had nearly died from coronavirus.While reports suggested he had told his party that election strategist Sir Lynton Crosby would be offering him strategic advice.Mr Johnson insisted he was “making changes” to Downing Street and the Cabinet Office, including by creating an Office of the Prime Minister with a permanent secretary to lead No .While Downing Street said work was being carried out on a new policy to tackle the drinking culture in No , although a blanket ban on drinking is unlikely given itsas a venue for receptions for visiting dignitaries and charity events.However, one Conservative who heard from Mr Johnson on Monday said the message to him was that MPs would “judge you by your delivery”.We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

This pandemic was hard for everyone.”He added: “I get it, and I will fix it. I want to say to the people of this country I know what the issue is.”However, he faced a hostile response from some on his own side and the threat of a vote of no confidence has not yet been defeated.– Former Cabinet minister Andrew Mitchell told Mr Johnson he “no longer enjoys my support”.– Tory MP Angela Richardson announced she had quit as a ministerial aide to Michael Gove, sharing her “deep disappointment” at the handling of the partygate row.– Aaron Bell, part of the  intake of Red Wall MPs, recalled abiding by coronavirus restrictions for his grandmother’s May  funeral before asking: “Does the Prime Minister think I’m a fool ”In the Lords, ex-Whitehall chief and independent crossbencher Lord Kerslake said: “Even without the detail the general findings are utterly damning. This goes to the heart of government. Can government be trusted to do the right thing and tell the truth  It’s hard to think of anything more important than that.”But Leader of the Commons Jacob Rees-Mogg said the “mood was positive” among Conservatives following an evening meeting on the Parliamentary estate.He added: “So many people voted personally for Boris Johnson rather than voting for political parties.“Politicians have to accept that our bosses are the British people, and they voted for that, they put him in office.”Peterborough MP Paul Bristow acknowledged it had been a “dficult day” but said there was support for Mr Johnson. vw,vw,px, px\"Peterborough MP Paul Bristow Mr Bristow said he left “absolutely pumped” and added that nobody in the meeting had called for Mr Johnson to go.The change in mood came as No  confirmed the PM would ask Ms Gray to produce a second report after the police investigation concludes, and committed to publishing it.But Ms Gray’s full report and the result of the police probe could yet threaten his premiership again, and Mr Johnson’s former chief aide Dominic cummings is due to questions on the report online on Tuesday which could provide more damaging details.Polling on Monday night from Opinium said % of UK adults wanted the PM to resign, and % believed Tory MPs should make him go.It comes after the Met revealed it is reviewing more than  images and over  pages of information passed to officers by the Gray inquiry.Mr Rees-Mogg suggested the images should also be published, as he said: “The more people see, the more understanding there will be of precisely what went on.”Mr Johnson also told MPs he was taking the issue seriously, underling how he had nearly died from coronavirus.While reports suggested he had told his party that election strategist Sir Lynton Crosby would be offering him strategic advice.Mr Johnson insisted he was “making changes” to Downing Street and the Cabinet Office, including by creating an Office of the Prime Minister with a permanent secretary to lead No .While Downing Street said work was being carried out on a new policy to tackle the drinking culture in No , although a blanket ban on drinking is unlikely given itsas a venue for receptions for visiting dignitaries and charity events.However, one Conservative who heard from Mr Johnson on Monday said the message to him was that MPs would “judge you by your delivery”.We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

She#s in Cruickston # there is quite a big estate there and when I went for a walk there, I came across a park almost every minute of the walk. I was amazed how many there were there.“I put up a post about this on Facebook # as the two parks we have in Portree are not really looked after and are quite dilapidated.“I asked why we can’t do better for our kids here. It started a big conversation and got loads of people talking about it. Lots of parks were mentioned where local groups had got together to develop them, like the one in Plockton and the one in Kyleakin.”Tfany was given a helping hand by friend Gary Shinnie who suggested the old park in Matheson Place, which had been left to rot, and agreed to assemble a squad of volunteers to help clear the site.After chatting to Highland Councillor John Gordon, Drew Millar from the local community council, and the Portree and Braes Community Trust, and a representative from the Lochalsh and Skye Housing Association it was decided that the best way for Tfany to take the project forward would be through the Trust’s Outdoor Activity group.The project was able to acquire £, from the National Lottery, and the group raised £,. last Friday and Saturday at the Co-op in Portree.Commenting on the response, Tfany said: #Friday and Saturday wasn#t just about fundraising it was also about making people aware of the project.“When people were standing and put their signatures down, we were able to explain to them what we were doing, and when they saw the plans, most people said that it was a great idea, and they loved the fact that it had things for children with special needs in it.”The group is raising money through funding applications, a JustGiving page, and is also inviting businesses to get involved in supporting the project too.A D plan of the play park has been made by Kompan, who also worked on the new playpark in Kyleakin.The park will comprise  dferent play activities including four swings, an octopus seesaw, a carousel, a four-tower unit with a tunnel and a slide, it will be able to accommodate  users of all ages.Although there’s still plenty to do to bring the play park to le, Tfany is confident that it will happen, and this year.to donate to project."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Sanas-Padlet-266-x-150-mm-1.jpg","title":"dreuchd ur ann an","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineADVERTISING FEATURE: NEW YEAR, NEW CAREERAig an àm seo den bhliadhna, bidh sinn tric a’ smaoineachadh air ar dreuchdan atharrachadh agus mar sin is dòcha gum bi an goireas ùr aig Bòrd na Gàidhlig feumail dhuibh ma tha sibh a’ beachdachadh air dreuchd ùr ann an teagasg tro mheadhan na Gàidhlig.’S e goireas didseatach a th’ ann am padlet far a bheil làraich-lìn, sgrìobhainnean agus bhideothan air an cruinneachadh air balla.

They prefer instead to view Gaelic as a natural medium for their music # a not atypical outlook for their island generation raised with the language as part of their education during the s.And this should be encouraging, for the key to the future survival of the language will lie not in its exceptionalism, but in its ordinariness.While Gaelic may be natural to Niteworks, what sets them apart is how they use it. Their trademark sound is forged from the rich Hebridean song tradition of their native communities, and the dance music they listened to in their bedrooms, and later in Glasgow nightclubs.They have just released their third album # A’ Ghrian,– which follows the eponymous debut album of  and Air Fàir An Làwhich came out in .In what should have been one of the marquee events of Glasgow’s Celtic Connections festival, last Friday Niteworks should have been on stage with the Royal Scottish National Orchestra. But to immense frustration and disappointment, Covid restrictions were not been lted in time and the concert has been rescheduled for the summer.Unsurprisingly, lockdown and the pandemic are themes that have influenced the new album, says band member Allan MacDonald.. “It has been over two years since I have been to a club as a punter.“That was a huge part of our lives. I wouldn’t say it has changed our musical tastes, but what we listen to at home now is dferent to what we would listen to in a club.“That has influenced us and the direction we are going as a band. We’re also getting a bit older, there’s two in the band that have young families now and this album is perhaps a bit more reflective than the others.”It is approaching  years since the quartet put on their first gig – at Braes Hall as part of the year of Highland culture celebrations in . Their first EP followed in , and Niteworks have since become regulars on the festival circuit # including annual appearances at SkyeLive in Portree.They aren’t full time as a band, however, and online rehearsing was a familiar process to them long before the outset of the pandemic.Allan, who is from Braes and from a family of pipers, works in renewable energy and is based in London. Synth and keyboard player Innes Strachan from Breakish works in sound production in Glasgow drummer Ruaraidh Graham, also from Breakish, works in Edinburgh for Historic Environment Scotland and bass player Chris Nicolson, from Braes, is with the BBC in Inverness.One of their ‘lockdown projects’ included writing the music to mark Edinburgh’s Hogmanay, and in turn this led to the orchestral collaboration and the more ‘expansive and cinematic’ sound of the new album, says Ruairidh Graham.“We were partly inspired by our work writing the music for Edinburgh’s Hogmanay Fare Well film that reflected on what  had been like for many during the pandemic,” he adds. “The nature of the project required broad expansive sounds, and that led to us going further in that direction through the writing and recording of the album.“Our upcoming orchestral concert for Celtic Connections further reinforced our desire to keep down that path.”There is an abundance of vocal talent to be found on A’ Ghrian, including from long-time collaborators Sian . Celebrated Scottish singers Kathleen MacInnes, Beth Malcolm, Hannah Rarity and Alasdair Whyte also feature, and Niteworks have incorporated English folk and Scots songs into their repertoire for the first time.The album, which was funded by Creative Scotland and recorded in autumn , also features Fiona MacAskill, Aileen Reid and Laura Wilkie of Kinnaris Quintet alongside Susan Appelbe on strings.A’ Ghrian is available to buy on CD and stream and download on all digital s, and the band will tour the until the end of .

Credit: Kelvin Boyes   Press EyeAndrew MaddenTwitterEmailJanuary   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailFollowing last Friday nights shock news that Edwin Poots failed in his bid to become the DUPs South Down candidate for Mays Assembly election, there has been many questions as to how the party’s selection process actually works.Sitting South Down MLA Jim Wells was not selected by the party, and the choice was between former DUP leader Edwin Poots and Diane Forsythe, who went before party officers last Friday. Ms Forsythe came out on top and the decision will now have to be ratied by the DUP#s central executive committee, which is made up of five representatives from each constituency, as well as MLAs and MPs.Read MoreEdwin Poots fails in attempt to get DUP’s nomination for the South Down constituencyMark Bain:OpinionTectonic plates have shted and left Poots thinking he should have been careful what he wished forMr Wells has said Mr Poots will challenge the selection decision, however it is unclearthis is likely to succeed.Here#s a quick guide to how the selection process works. How potential election candidates are chosenIn the run-up to an election, party officers -  senior members - determine how many candidates are to be selected to run for the party in each constituency. If it is decided that only one candidate will run in a constituency, then they are chosen by the constituency association.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up Constituency associations are made up of certain party members and representatives in that area. If the constituency association has less than  members, however, then the candidate is chosen centrally by party officers. This is what happened last Friday, when party officers deselected Jim Wells - who would normally have been automatically nominated to run as he is the party#s sitting MLA - and Edwin Poots and Diane Forsythe put their names forward. Each were then interviewed by party officers, who in this case chose Ms Forsythe.If more than one candidate is to run in a constituency, one is selected by the constituency association and the other is selected by the party centrally via party officers. What happens once candidates are selected Once candidates are selected for each constituency, then the entire ticket has to be ratied by the party#s central executive committee, which numbers around  people. As mentioned previously, this is made up of five party representatives from each constituency and all the party#s MPs and MLAs.As one party source put it, when the slate of candidates is put to the central executive committee, it is all duck or no dinner, meaning the entire roster must be approved, or none of it.You either select everybody or no one, in which case it would be sent back to party officers, the source said. Can a representative who has not been selected by party officers still try and run in that constituency Jim Wells has said Mr Poots will continue to fight to be selected, and he could plead his case before the party executive, but this would mean the entire roster going back to party officers and ing to executive at a later date for ratication,he is successful.For instance, while it has to be all duck and no dinner, in theory the DUP executive could voice their approval for all the candidates bar South Down , in which case the South Down selection process would be repeated and the refreshed slate of candidates would go before the executive committee once again to be ratied at a later date. What happens now The DUP#s central executive committee is to meet next Friday, where the party’s entire Assembly election ticket will either be ratied, or not. If not, then the selection processes are repeated, where necessary, and the slate of candidates goes for ratication once again, until the slate is approved.Related topicsEdwin PootsJim WellsNorthern Ireland AssemblyMost ReadRevealed: The Northern Ireland charity chief paid as much as the First MinistersPSNI officers wear brand new unorm for first time in  yearsRarely-seen Bloody Sunday pictures: Twelve minutes that changed Derry foreverIan Paisley gives we Fiona a £k pay rise for part-time jobIn Pictures: Bloody Sunday... images from the BelfastarchivesTop VideosPlayPSNI officers wear brand new unorm for first time in  yearsPlayVideo: Jamie Dornan dismisses bond rumours at Belfast premiere PlayVideo: Veteran DUP politician Jim Wells aims his future sights on punditry Latest Northern IrelandLisa SmythOpinionTime to rethink our reliance on alcohol to help get the job doneNew unorm for PSNI gets thumbs-up from fashion expertsVIDEO: ‘I’m taking hit on my own after being ousted in blaze of publicity’, says DUP MLA Jim WellsSwann hails grieving family campaigning for fire crew support in medical sSue Gray partygate report: DUP MP who broke down over No  lockdown parties says findings are ‘hugely damaging’LatestWhoopi Goldberg apologises for saying the Holocaust ‘isn’t about race’Premier League clubs spend almost £m in January transfer windowWhoopi Goldberg criticised for saying the Holocaust ‘isn’t about race’Judge rejects plea deal for man who killed Ahmaud ArberyAlec Baldwin to host new art fraud podcast,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueSean McGovern.Staff ReporterJanuary   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailA man has been convicted of harassing Mannok director Kevin Lunney.Sean McGovern received a suspended sentence after he was found guilty following a contested hearing at Enniskillen Magistrates Court.He is the father of Bernard McGovern, who is currently serving a sentence in Castlerea Prison for a separate incident against two directors, one of whom was Mr Lunney.Sean McGovern , from Springtown Road, Kinawley, denied harassing Kevin Lunney and his we and fellow directors Liam McCaffrey and Tony Lunney between October  and December , .Liam McCaffrey described an ongoing campaign of harassment taking many forms, including social media and more direct physical abuse”.He referred to the kidnap and torture of Kevin Lunney, but after a period of relative calm, claims of victimisation emerged around Bernard McGovern’s detention in Castlerea Prison ahead of trial for a separate attack.He was later released on bail and on ing to court admitted the charges of assaulting Kevin Lunney and another director, for which Bernard McGovern is serving a jail sentence.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up Mr McCaffrey told the court: “Signs were erected naming a list of people, including me. It was deliberate targeting. There were attempts to ramp up tension in the community and I felt it appropriate to bring it to police attention. I felt unsafe and in fear.”Kevin Lunney also spoke of posters appearing around Derrylin and close to his home, naming him, his we and other family members.He said: “These posters were very intimidating, they were intended to make me and my family uneasy. They appeared around the time of my abduction and torture and I was very concerned. A pattern was developing against my family.”He described a poster with Bernard McGovern’s picture with ‘VICTIMISED’ written across it.Mr Lunney advised, “I’m aware of Bernard is the son of Sean McGovern, whom I’ve known for around  years. Bernard was jailed for an assault on myself and a co-director in .”Mr Lunney’s we told the court her name was on a poster and, “My husband and others were named as well. The business has nothing to do with me. I couldn’t understand why my name was attached to something I had no involvement in.”She described a sign stating ‘Free Bernard McGovern’ placed on a pole near her home.Tony Lunney observed a sign asking who had most to gain around “sabotaging”. His name was written at the top with the other directors.“I felt very intimidated and concerned. My we and children travel that area and I was worried about them seeing it, especially with my name on it.”He also recognised McGovern’s car and a trailer parked containing posters with ‘VICTIMISED’ written on them.A police officer explained McGovern had the opportunity to attend voluntarily which he declined and was subsequently arrested.Giving evidence, McGovern confirmed he owned the posters and erected them because, he said, my youngest son Bernard was remanded and couldn’t get bail. It was a campaign against that. My son is the victim”.Under-cross examination, he accepted Kevin Lunney had seen him up a ladder but denied the poster would cause upset, stating, “Why would it affect him  I put posters in my area along the public highway.”The prosecution put it to McGovern: “No reasonable person would put up a poster in respect of Kevin Lunney who was at the time the alleged victim of a serious assault by your son. You were upset and annoyed and those posters were to harass and intimidate the victim.”“That’s totally incorrect,” said McGovern. “We treat people with respect and they get respect. There was no harassment or intimidation.”But Judge Keown said: “The details and background of this matter are well-known. I have no hesitation in finding the defendant erected posters along the route taken by Kevin Lunney showing the person accused of assaulting him. It is clear and obvious this was harassment.”He acquitted McGovern of harassing the three others but was nonetheless satisfied Restraining Orders were required for all, including Kevin Lunney, which will run for two years.McGovern waived his right to a pre-sentence report and Judge Keown handed down a term of four months custody suspended for two years.Most ReadRevealed: The Northern Ireland charity chief paid as much as the First MinistersPSNI officers wear brand new unorm for first time in  yearsRarely-seen Bloody Sunday pictures: Twelve minutes that changed Derry foreverIan Paisley gives we Fiona a £k pay rise for part-time jobIn Pictures: Bloody Sunday... images from the BelfastarchivesTop VideosPlayPSNI officers wear brand new unorm for first time in  yearsPlayVideo: Veteran DUP politician Jim Wells aims his future sights on punditry PlayVideo: Jamie Dornan dismisses bond rumours at Belfast premiere Latest Northern IrelandLisa SmythOpinionTime to rethink our reliance on alcohol to help get the job doneNew unorm for PSNI gets thumbs-up from fashion expertsVIDEO: ‘I’m taking hit on my own after being ousted in blaze of publicity’, says DUP MLA Jim WellsSwann hails grieving family campaigning for fire crew support in medical sSue Gray partygate report: DUP MP who broke down over No  lockdown parties says findings are ‘hugely damaging’LatestWhoopi Goldberg apologises for saying the Holocaust ‘isn’t about race’Premier League clubs spend almost £m in January transfer windowWhoopi Goldberg criticised for saying the Holocaust ‘isn’t about race’Judge rejects plea deal for man who killed Ahmaud ArberyAlec Baldwin to host new art fraud podcast,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Read MorePSNI officers wear brand new unorm for first time in  yearsIt marks the first time a unorm change has been made since the formation of the PSNI in .Chief Constable Simon Byrne has said that after trials and a public consultation, the new “professional, modern work wear” will be worn by officers up to the rank of chief superintendent.He added: “I believe the new unorm will help us to enhance the visible, accessible and responsive service we seek to provide to the community.”Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up While comfort and ality is to the fore, the Belfastasked two experts for their views on a more informal PSNI.Cathy Martin is the director of Belfast Fashion Week and the aptly named tailor Chris Suitor is a partner with Suitor Bros in Belfast.Ms Martin said that society was already moving towards a much less formal style of work wear in general.“I think for the nature of the job for most officers on the front line, there’s probably a need to be comfortable and less restricted,” she said.“A shirt and tie might actually be restrictive for some people. I do think I’ll miss the formality of the shirt and tie to a certain degree psychologically.“Maybe it’s an age thing but I feel that it gives a self-conscious element of formality and respect.“But at the same time I think that a more casual unorm might make the officers themselves a lot more relatable to the people that they’re dealing with on a day-to-day basis.”Mr Suitor called the modern look “visually pleasing”.“It does come across as more youthful, but at the end of the day they’re always trying to recruit younger people into the force,” he said.“I think that step towards a more athletic, sporty look and overall aesthetic will hopefully help them attract new people.”He added: “It’s definitely going to be more useable for them in the field. With the way that the modern man and woman is going, let’s be honest, we spend half our lives in gym gear nowadays.”As coronavirus restrictions begin to ease and workers begin toto the office, Mr Suitor said he had noticed a change in tastes.“As a business we’re structuring our offer more towards the smart-casual side than strict tailoring, because there’s definitely been a progression towards that softer, more dress-down look.“I hope that’s not something that will continue, we’ve been in the industry for  years and are a fan of that nice structured and sharp look.“But as a business we need to move with the times and offer what people want.”Related topicsPolice Service of Northern IrelandMore On Police Service of Northern IrelandPipe bomb attack in Lurgan branded ‘utterly reckless’Kne pointed at shop worker’s stomach during north Belfast robberyPSNI officers wear brand new unorm for first time in  yearsRoyal Mail driver threatened OAP over missing £kResidents evacuated in early morning north Belfast security alertMost ReadRevealed: The Northern Ireland charity chief paid as much as the First MinistersPSNI officers wear brand new unorm for first time in  yearsRarely-seen Bloody Sunday pictures: Twelve minutes that changed Derry foreverIan Paisley gives we Fiona a £k pay rise for part-time jobIn Pictures: Bloody Sunday... images from the BelfastarchivesTop VideosPlayPSNI officers wear brand new unorm for first time in  yearsPlayVideo: Jamie Dornan dismisses bond rumours at Belfast premiere PlayVideo: Veteran DUP politician Jim Wells aims his future sights on punditry Latest Northern IrelandLisa SmythOpinionTime to rethink our reliance on alcohol to help get the job doneVIDEO: ‘I’m taking hit on my own after being ousted in blaze of publicity’, says DUP MLA Jim WellsSwann hails grieving family campaigning for fire crew support in medical sSue Gray partygate report: DUP MP who broke down over No  lockdown parties says findings are ‘hugely damaging’‘Any threat to collapse Stormont must be removed’ – Conor MurphyLatestWalking Dead actor Moses J Moseley dies age Whoopi Goldberg apologises for saying the Holocaust ‘isn’t about race’Premier League clubs spend almost £m in January transfer windowWhoopi Goldberg criticised for saying the Holocaust ‘isn’t about race’Judge rejects plea deal for man who killed Ahmaud Arbery,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The CEO’s salary is set by the remuneration and performance committee which is made up of three members of the board, known as the Council. All of our board members are volunteers.”Unicef Ireland’s director, Peter Power, has an annual salary of €, , while St Vincent de Paul’s national director , Andy Heffernan, brings home between €, and €, Agnes Lunny is the chief executive of learning disability charity Positive Futures, based in Northern Ireland, and Positive Futures Ireland, based in the Republic.Her combined salary for both roles is £, annually.In her response to this newspaper request, Ms Lunny said: “My average working week across both roles is + hours, more often than not  hours. That puts my hourly pay at between £ and £.“My salary was recently increased following a benchmarking exercise against similar roles in Health  Social Care.”All-Ireland wellbeing charity Inspire’s chief executive, Kerry Anthony, has an annual salary of between £, and £,. An Inspire spokesperson said: “You will see from our accounts that our income mostly comes from contracts for services with very little coming from donations from the public. Any donations we do get from the public to support our work go straight to the projects for which they are raised and don’t contribute to the pay of our CEO.”Ulster Unionist MLA Andy Allen, a member of Stormont’s Communities Committee, said he can understand why some may be concerned by charity bosses taking in large salaries, however the signicant amount of work they undertake must be taken into account.“The structure and complexity of modern charities require leadership and ability at the highest levels to ensure the organisation is managed effectively to deliver vital support services for their beneficiaries,” he said.“While I understand fully the public concern that salaries of some charity chief executives are over £,, it is important to recognise the experience and skills required to run an organisation that employs hundreds of people, manages millions of pounds of public money and donations — delivering vital services to our most needy and vulnerable.If an inidual could earn more in a similar position in the private sector, as is the case in many of these examples, then how can our charities attract the best and most qualied leaders to ensure services to those most in need are deliveredthey are not offering a comparable salary that recognises the skills and experience needed ”In December , it emerged that the then-Communities Minister Caral Ni Chuilin had commissioned an independent review of the Charity Commission, following a report by senior civil servant Jonathan Baume looking at how the Department for Communities handled complaints in relation to the Commission.Responding to an Assembly question about the Baume report’s recommendations by TUV leader Jim Allister at the time, Ms Ni Chuilin said: “The former Head of the Civil Servicecommissioned a review into how the Department for Communities had handled a number of complaints from a member of the public in relation to the Charity Commission.“HOCS asked my Department to respond to the suggestions set out in the review. These are currently being progressed, including consideration of the Department’s role as the custodian of charity regulation law and policy and sponsor for the Commission.“The Department’s Head of Governance has also written to the Chief Commissioner to seek assurances in relation to matters highlighted in the Review.“In order to restore public confidence in a system that has undoubtedly been damaged, I have also decided to commission an independent review of charity regulation including a review of the performance of the Charity Commission in its role as statutory regulator.”Related topicsAndy AllenJim AllisterDepartment for CommunitiesMore On Andy Allen PremiumViewpointOpinionCharities must look at sky-high salaries PremiumShock figures show  died while waiting for place to call home last year PremiumDurkan ‘shocked’ that Stormont minister ed almost £m in funding PremiumQuestions raised after Justice Department s £m to Finance Department as PSNI faces budget shortfall PremiumHousing Executive owns more than  acres of unused land while, people on homes waiting listMost ReadRevealed: The Northern Ireland charity chief paid as much as the First MinistersPSNI officers wear brand new unorm for first time in  yearsRarely-seen Bloody Sunday pictures: Twelve minutes that changed Derry foreverIan Paisley gives we Fiona a £k pay rise for part-time jobIn Pictures: Bloody Sunday... images from the BelfastarchivesTop VideosPlayPSNI officers wear brand new unorm for first time in  yearsPlayVideo: Jamie Dornan dismisses bond rumours at Belfast premiere PlayVideo: Veteran DUP politician Jim Wells aims his future sights on punditry Latest Northern IrelandLisa SmythOpinionTime to rethink our reliance on alcohol to help get the job doneNew unorm for PSNI gets thumbs-up from fashion expertsVIDEO: ‘I’m taking hit on my own after being ousted in blaze of publicity’, says DUP MLA Jim WellsSwann hails grieving family campaigning for fire crew support in medical sSue Gray partygate report: DUP MP who broke down over No  lockdown parties says findings are ‘hugely damaging’LatestLine Of Duty creator Jed Mercurio and Jo Cox’s sister to receive royal honoursWhat the papers say – February BBC Three s as linear channelInsulate Britain protesters face court over alleged injunction breachWalking Dead actor Moses J Moseley dies age ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

These revelations extend far beyond the gardens of No. .In Northern Ireland, Sinn Fein ministers took to the streets of West Belfast for the funeral of an IRA man Bobby Storey in flagrant breach of the very Covid regulations that they were responsible for writing.”He added: “The DUP supports the call for a comprehensive public inquiry into the handling of the Covid- response right across our United Kingdom.This is needed to ensure mistakes are not repeated in future crises. Actions by government ministers and senior officials should not be out of reach of such an investigation. Indeed, no decision, policy or position should be off limits.”SDLP leader Colum Eastwood renewed calls for Boris Johnson to resign as Prime Minister following the publication of the report.The Foyle MP said that Mr Johnson must accept responsibility for the “clear wrongdoing and failure of leadership” which has eroded public confidence and corroded the institutions of government.“Any objective reading of Sue Gray’s update demonstrates that the rules were broken,” he said.The only question for Boris Johnson now is whether he will follow the habit of a letime and blame everyone  for his pattern of wrongdoing or whether he will take responsibility, admit what he has done and resign.”But the PM said Mr Eastwood has “really got to read the report and he’s got to wait… everything he said I’m afraid is not substantiated by the report, he should look and wait for the police inquiry”.Alliance MP Stephen Farry said evasive responses from the Prime Minister suggested he wasn’t genuinely sorry.“Does he recognise the long-term damage he risks doing to historic norms of democracy  Is it right that they are sacriced in the interests of one man who refused to do what the country knows needs to happen ” he asked.“And can he point to one single example where he personally has improved standards in public le ”Mr Johnson responded: “How about honouring the wishes of the people by delivering Brexit in spite of attempts to subvert democracy”.Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis backed the embattled Prime Minister. He believes the PM was right to accept all of the findings in Ms Gray’s report and said he will act to make changes.Mr Lewis described as “nonsense” calls from Labour leader Keir Starmer for the PM to be ousted.

We have taken back control of our waters and a year on from the Trade and Co-operation Agreement a positive picture is emerging for our fishing industry, he continued.ldquoWe have seen an increase in quota that will amount to around poundm by  and are investing poundm into coastal communities so that they can benefit from better infrastructure, new jobs and investment in skills.Local councillor Dermot Curran is encouraging people to respond to the consultation exercise, to reduce the impact of fishing on the marine environment, as well as support the industry. And he hopes that all three Co Down fishing ports will benefit from the funding that is to be made available.ldquoI am keen to see more detail to see exactly how Ardglass in particular can benefit from financial support at a time when there is much focus on a range of work that is required at the village harbour, Cllr Curran continued.ldquoThe need to deepen the harbour to facilitate larger vessels is key moving forward, but the need to have a dedicated boat repair facility in the village has also been raised with me. Currently, vessels have to go where to be repaired.ldquoIf Ardglass had its own dedicated repair facility, it would not only be able to service local boats but those based in other ports. Investment to repair boats locally would also create jobs.Cllr Curran said everyone with an interest in the fishing industry should make the most of the opportunity to comment on the detail in the joint fisheries statement.ldquoConfirmation that poundm is being made available for fishing communities is excellent news and I hope that the ports of Ardglass, Kilkeel and Portavogie will be able to share this very welcome additional financial investment, he continued.ldquoThis is an important step forward and clearly Minister Poots is committed to the Co Down fishing industry and the processing industries and communities which rely heavily upon it. This new investment will help safeguard all their respective futures which is good news. The investment will boost the local and regional economy.Last year, it was revealed that investment in the region of poundm is needed to upgrade Ardglass harbour to help maximise the portrsquos future opportunities.The Fishing and Seafood Development Programme reportrsquos recommendations for Ardglass included enhancing capacity at the harbour to provide security for fishing and processing businesses,The report revealed that a survey of the harbour walls in Ardglass showed that some repairs may be required within the next one to two years but their condition will not prevent the deepening of the harbour mdash to nine metres below the waterline mdashthey are stabilised and protected from undermining prior to dredging operations.It says the current water depth and quaysideprevents larger fishing vessels from landing at Ardglass with tankers transporting fish landed in Belfast to the village for processing. Mackerel and Irish Sea herring continue to be landed in Ardglass.The report said there is inadequate space for growing the inshore fleet at the port as the quayside is dominated by the larger demersal fleet and occasional visiting pelagic vessels, with the adjoining marina for the exclusive use of leisure craft.It was also noted that a constraint to the landside development of the harbourrsquos estate is the mixed ownership of existing properties which prevents the Fishery Harbour Authority from having full control over activities at the port and limits the ability to plan strategically..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/26_January2022_Caoimhe.jpg","title":"Caoimhe raises £900 for turtle rehabilation scheme in Maldives  ","story":"WHEN it comes to conservation, Downpatrick woman Caoimhe Morgan-Burns practices what she preaches.The  year-old has raised pound by collecting rubbish from the sides of the Ardglass Road and Ballysallagh Road.The money is to go towards the cost of a pound, trip to Naaru Island in the Males in June where Caoimhe will devote four weeks of her time to volunteer at a sea turtle rehabilitation centre.The trip will mean a lot to Caoimhe, a former pupil at Shimna Integrated College in Newcastle, as she will head to Bristol University in September to study Wildle Ecology and Conservation Science.Caoimhe plans to plant some trees on her familyrsquos land so and is thinking up of other fund-raising initiatives towards the cost of the trip.She spent over five hours removing rubbish from the edges of the road and was dismayed by how much she collected from her own home road.ldquoI collected  bin bags full of rubbish.

The winning schools each received pound of NIFQA beef and lamb, kindly sponsored by ABP Food Group.Livestock and Meat Commission education and consumer promotions manager, Sarah Toland, explained that one of the key drivers for the competition was to encourage the use of NIFQA beef and lamb in schools and to complement the organisationrsquos existing schools programme.ldquoWith this in mind we specically targeted food and nutrition teachers and their students when drawing up the criteria for the project, she said.Sarah congratulated the winning schools, noting that as the competition received an encouraging number of entries, to select the top three was no easy task.De La Salle teacher Irene Stokes said the competition helped increase awareness of the importance of sourcing local NIFQA produce.She added: ldquoThis competition allowed our students an opportunity to highlight the vital nutrients that beef and lamb provide and how both can add iety, colour,flavour and texture to any dish. ldquoOur students are also becoming increasingly aware of sourcing meats that have the NIFQA symbol and the impact this has on the local economy.Down High teacher Sharon McKee said the competition was a ldquofabulous way of encouraging students to consider the valuable contribution of red meat in their diet.She added: ldquoOur Year  pupils are currently investigating the nutritional and dietary needs of adolescence so this competition fitted well into our curriculum and brought the theory to le..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/26_January2022_Downe.jpg","title":"Downe partnership to help map future  ","story":"THE first meeting of a new forum involving health chiefs, hospital campaigners, trade unions and politicians to oversee service provision at the Downe hospital is expected to take place in the spring.The South Eastern Trust mdash which is responsible for the hospital and the delivery of a raft of health and social services across the community mdash has described the creation of the new Downe Health and Care Partnership Forum as exciting.Last summer, South Down MP Chris Hazzard suggested to senior health chiefs that a new partnership involving a range of key players should be established to help map out the most appropriate model of health care for the area and it will soon become a reality.Health chiefs said the forum, which is the first of its kind in Northern Ireland, said the two key objectives are to plan for the future with everyone who uses services in the area and work in partnership to improve the health and wellbeing of the community.The health trust said this is in line with the organisationrsquos so-called ldquoquality  all strategy which puts excellent care at the centre of what it does.Officials say the new forum will consider local population health and social care needs, support people to lead healthier lives and take action to reduce health inequalities.Health trust chief executive, Roisin Coulter, said the organisation wants to work collaboratively with the local community regarding existing health and social care services to plan and design for the future.ldquoWorking in partnership with a wide range of key stakeholders will be vital to the forumrsquos success.

I accused the departmental officials of paralysis by analysis and unfortunately that has proved to be true.ldquoSince then, of course, the traffic congestion, which is now traffic chaos, has been greatly increased by the Irish Street closure, and it should be noted that not a single traffic management action has been initiated in the interval, he continued.NEWCASTLE ndash A cross-community unity campaign has been launched to save Newcastlersquos only public residential home from closure.Mourne House has been targeted for closed by the Eastern Health and Social Services Board but this week local politicians have joined with the Friends of Mourne House in mobilising public support against the plan.Representatives from the Friends group have already met with Board officials in a bid to persuade them to adopt a proposal from the charity, Age Concern, which is offering to take over the management of the  year-old home.DUNDRUM ndash Over pound, damage has been caused in another arson attack in Dundrum.Two caravans were completely destroyed and another badly damaged in the attack at the Bayview Caravan Site off the Dromara Road early on Saturday morning.It is believed the blazes were started in the early hours and two of the caravans were well alight by the time fire crews arrived on the scene.The incident is the latest in a long line of malicious arson attacks in the village which police believe are the work of a pyromaniac.Just before Christmas the villagersquos two primary schools were targeted with the Downshire Primary School sustaining over pound, damage. The arsonist has also attacked Dundrum cricket club, the orange hall and the parochial hall.BRYANSFORD ndash Plans have been announced to convert one of Bryansfordrsquos most historic landmarks into apartments, a craft shop and a restaurant.The former home of the Earl of Roden, close to the gates of Tollymore Park, will be converted into eight apartments, and an outbuilding will be extended to form a craft shop and restaurant facilityplanning permission is granted by the DoE.A further planning application proposes to build a number of luxury apartments on a site to the rear of the building, with an access from the nearby Burrenreagh Road.The building, which comprises extensive outbuildings and a courtyard, was used as a travellersrsquo inn during the last century when the Roden family lived in Tollymore House in the forest park.Since the destruction of Tollymore House the inn has been the home of the present Earl of Roden. In  it was the scene of an antiques robbery in which Lord Roden was tied up and threatened as raiders stole valuable paintings and antiques.Part of the outbuildings were regularly used by youth groups for residential weekends in the Mournes.BALLYNAHINCH ndash The job losses at the Ballynahinch GPT plant mean the lsquoBig Threersquo players in Down District industry no longer top the  jobs mark.GEC Plessey Telecommunications was the last of the lsquoBig Threersquo to employ more than  on one site.The lay-offs mean there are virtually no large-scale industrial employers left in Down.The GPT plant has been set on a steady course of expansion, even after the amalgamation of Plessey, as it then was, with GEC in . It took over the vacant Albion clothing factory on the Antrim Road and at one point last year was employing  people.The number has been whittled away and will be reduced to  employees.The other two major employers have also been hit over the last four years. The Shirley Tannery, owned by English-based Pittard Garnar at the time, employed  until its closure was announced in February . Although it re-opened later that year, the numbers employed has been dramatically scaled down.The decline in the numbers is even more pronounced when it is considered that in its heyday in the late rsquos, the tannery employed up to  people.STRANGFORD ndash There has been a renewed call for a bridge linking Strangford and Portaferry.The newly-formed Strangford Lough Bridge Project Group says a bridge across the Strangford Narrows is the only means of guaranteeing a continuous link across the lough.However, the group accepts that a scheme involving a barrage to harness tidal power would be environmentally unacceptable.Group chairman, Mr James McMullan, from Portaferry, said ldquoI believe there is overwhelming support for a bridge.ldquoPeople in Portaferry are concerned about the future of the DoE ferry service. A bridge has to be the ultimate answer. It would provide a link  hours a day and would not be subject to breakdowns, he continued.And Mr McMullan says he intends to seek the support of local councillors for his proposal.ldquoI accept a barrage would have environmental implications but a bridge on its own would benefit communities on both sides of the lough, he added.RACING ndash A campaign to introduce Sunday horse racing in Britain could result in Sabbath day racing coming under starters orders at Downpatrick.Mr Iain Duff, course registrar at Downpatrick, has given his support to the Jockey Club campaign and is demanding sweeping changes in legislation which prohibits betting on a Sunday.Mr Duff says Downpatrick and Down Royal ndash the Provincersquos other racetrack ndash should be allowed to hold Sunday meetings.Mr Duff says the law could be changed easily by making an Order in Council which would then enable tracks to hold meetings when people are most prepared to go racing on Sunday.He believes the move is needed to bring racing here into line with the Republic where Sunday racing was introduced some years ago.ldquoSunday racing in the Republic has proved to be a wholesale success. Surveys have shown more people go racing on a Sunday than on any other day, he remarked.ldquoYet the Northern Ireland Minister of Agriculture last November rejected the appeals of deputations representation Downpatrick and Down Royal seeking an equal opportunity.Mr Duff said thatSunday racing is permitted, the law relating to gambling would have to be changed.Mr Duff added: ldquoEverybody in racing respects the views of people who may be against Sunday racing, but I donrsquot think they should be allowed to dictate to the majority..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/26_January2022_Matt.jpg","title":"Matthew survives on Dancing With The Stars  ","story":"LOVE Islander Matthew MacNabb survived the first public vote in RTErsquos Dancing With The Stars mdash despite gaining the lowest number of points.The Downpatrick man was faced with the challenge of dancing the jive on Sundayrsquos show, known to be notoriously dficult for tall male dancers.Standing at ft in, the  year-old admitted it was tough going, but was personally delighted with his effort with professional dance partner Laura Nolan.Speaking from Dublin on Monday, Matthew told the Recorder: ldquoI was happy with my dance last night as I had a nightmare with it all week trying to get the timing and coordination down.ldquoThat was the best I danced it and I worked so hard all week but I guess giraffes arenrsquot meant to jive.In the end, it was novelist Cathy Kelly who was the first celebrity to leave the show.The local GAA player and digital marketing consultant said he had been overwhelmed by the support and votes he had received.He said: ldquoTo be bottom and to get through shows how amazing people are to vote for me and I really appreciate it.

THE big match of the week saw the top two teams face off against each other as the league leaders from Killyleagh made the trip to Spa to face the only team to have beaten them this year.They were just left to pick up the crumbs as the hosts continued their unbeaten run which led to this big win that no makes them favourites for the league with two games in hand and only eleven points behind with four rounds left to play.Davy Cavan, Paul and Don McNamara were up against Stevie Brown, Kieran McMullan and Ricky Cathcart and after four ends it was all square at -. But then Don upped the pressure and the hosts dominated thefinal ends to run out - winners.On the other mat the home triple of Hilary Cavan, Robin Horner and Graham Christie were playing some great bowls against Paddy Murray and after lting a count of six on the third end would only lose three ends in their - win. At the break the home side had a -shot overall lead.The Saints made a slight comeback in the third game as Philip Woodside, David Anderson and Neil Brown continued their good run of form against Frances and Derek McCann and skip Alan Laughlin, who after losing the first two ends won the next three to go - up before Alan hit back to make it it - after seven ends.This would be as good as it would get as the visitors won the last three ends to finish - winners to secure the only away points of the match.A mention must go to this triple for playing and controlling this game so well, especially as Philip had a throwback to past times with the quality of lead bowls.The last game of the night saw Rose Marie Wylie, Davy Vance and Peter Christie score seven shots from the first two ends against Terry Quinn, Nigel Brown and Tony Ward.They never relinguished this lead as the game finished - in their favour to secure another great win.Surely now no-one can stop Spa from continuing on and finish the season unbeaten and as champions.DROMARA.....................

Dromararsquos Denis Kane, Richard Kelly and JamesMcKinney took control of their game against Haydn Tumelty, Dermot Rooney and Liam Higgins and even though they won only four ends and scored  shots to win -, this left Dromara with a five-shot lead in the overall.Owenbeg finally got going in the final game as Nathan Tumelty, Alan Telford and Collie Gibson really put Marie McNeill, Phil and Eamon Kelly to the sword.They only let their opponents score two shots as they scored steadily and heavily to run out victors by a - margin.It has to be said that Nathan was giving his team-mates an easy time with his standard of lead bowls on what are tricky mats.This win was enough to get Owenbeg the extra points and scrape an overall draw.ST MACARTANrsquoS...........

How are your New Year resolutions going How many times do you decide to lsquostop thisrsquo, lsquostart thatrsquo, and find a few weeks later that you have blown it and feel guilty and frustrated with yourself Starting all over again on the back of frustration and then pushing yourself even harder, making it increasingly dficult to stick to your resolution Breaking habits or quitting something on the surface seem like great ideas when wanting to improve your health and well-being. Irsquod love to introduce you to approaches that are foundations that last and make you feel empowered and happier in  and beyond.What I think is essential, when we want to stop a bad habit or make a change in our lives, is to make sure that we are on our own side.Self-compassion is basically being your own best friend. When we are with our best friend, we listen to them. We comfort them and speak on their behalfthey ask us to help them. To get the cogs in motion,answer yes or no to the following questions:Do you find it hard to say no Do you find it dficult to take a compliment Do you criticise yourself often Do you compare yourself to others Do you worry about what others think about you How many were answered lsquoyesrsquo Maybe after everything that we all have been through over the last couple of years,  has the possibility to be the year that you remember as the year you began to take control, to recover and heal.  could be the year when you started loving yourself more.There are three elements that I would like to introduce today that are to be consideredyou want to feel empowered and active in real self-care.AwarenessAwareness begins with the practice of noticing. It helps us be in the present moment and be calm as we take in the sights, sounds and touch mdash even taste mdash around us.Mindfulness and meditation have been trendy in recent years, but from my one-to-one counselling work, quite a few people have said that ldquoit didnrsquot work for them, or ldquoI didnrsquot really see the benefits.Once we talked about that more, we came to the realisation that they were practicing mindfulness to not feel, to escape feeling uncomfortable or to push away dficult or negative thoughts. As a practice, things changed for the better once my clients were made aware that mindfulness was to observe their feelings and observe their thoughts with an open mind as attention was gently brought back to the breath.Taking little pockets of time in our day to consciously pause, taking a few breaths in and out and observe, can immediately let our bodies and minds be calm and focused.The small daily things are the most important things to ensure real change. You can try this little exercise and be aware how your body and mind feels:S  ndash Step back.T ndash Take three deep breaths in and three slow breaths out.O  ndash Observe the thoughts and feelings in that very moment.P ndash Proceed.Awareness also involves being able to see patterns that arise in our thoughts and feelings, as well as the behavioural outcome. Kind of like detective work, we are then able to reframe our thinking, as well as breaking the familiar cycle of judgement and frustration. Just a wee word about practicing awareness mdash it is not about self control. Awareness helps us to begin to understand ourselves and develop self compassion and practice patience .Essentially, self awareness is about empowering ourselves and providing regulation of our body and mind. Self-regulation in turn, seeks to identy and reduce the causes of problems in mood, thought and behaviour.Self-control seeks to inhibit or manage such problems only when they arise. Self-control looks at old methods of punishment and reward to manage behaviour ndash maybe like the way we begin every New Year resolution mdash or every Monday, etc.AcceptanceEspecially when a New Year starts ndash therersquos this pressure to go to extreme measures, with this notion of being accepted more, to be seen and or valued more. But pretty much into the month of January we notice how it can rob us of truly living.We are not human DOINGS ndash we are human BEINGS. I have worked over the last  years as a counsellor and have heard people talk about trying to control their lives, but feeling like it was evading them more and more.Clients found themselves going harder, pushing harder, feeling exhausted, feeling helpless ndash then pulling up their socks and trying again. Although it may go against the grain of whatrsquos familiar, itrsquos healing to ease ourselves from a place of trying mdash to be perfect, as good as others, etc mdash to self-acceptance.Accepting lessens the pressure and helps us go with the flow.Self-acceptance is a journey. If anyone  needs to put pressure on us, itrsquos them who needs to deal with their own expectations mdash not us. Acceptance challenges deeply held beliefs that we are not lsquoworthyrsquo enough or lsquogoodrsquo enough to be whole. Like awareness, acceptance develops self compassion ndash a connected relationship with ourselves.In Dialectical Behavioural Therapy, there is a theory called Radical Acceptance developed by Martina Linehan, who quotes: ldquoRejecting reality turns pain into suffering.It is really tough to accept things how they are, from childhood trauma to unexpected traffic jams. It is really such a relief and sense of clarity when we realise and accept things that we are not in control of.It is absolutely OK to feel whatever we feel in the moment. Itrsquos not just sitting back and letting bad things happen of course. It is quite pro-active from problem solving based on how things actually are, self compassion when paying attention to how we feel in the moment. Meeting emotional pain head on, after all, it is what it is. Acceptance means no more unnecessary suffering.AssertionGabor Mate talks about assertion as a declaration to ourselves and to the world that lsquowe arersquo and that lsquowe are who we arersquo. Itrsquos not being simply able to stand up for ourselves mdash therersquos something more heartfelt than that.Assertion challenges the all too common belief that we must somehow justy our existence. There are lots of things that we can learn about and practice when it comes to assertion in itself, but maybe after reading the first two elements you are realising that our inidual minds, bodies and spirit are all so important.Making decisions about diets, relationships, careers, etc, usually get focused on a lot more during the month of January, as well as quitting things and going cold turkey on habits that have been part of our lives for years.Assertion isnrsquot just a quick course from a manual or podcast about tips and tricks. It is a really important statement of our being. It is a positive valuation of ourselves mdash independent of our history, abilities, personality or the worldrsquos perception of us.In regards to resolutions, assertion doesnrsquot involve action or reaction. Like I said before, it is our BEING, no matterwe take action or not. Assertion helps us be crystal clear about what we value and what is not OK with us as iniduals.From our values we can develop boundaries. Yes, let the rest of the world cope with that, or not. In fact, assertion may be the very opposite of action, not only in the sense of refusing to do something that we do not wish to do, but letting go of the very need to act at all.I really do hope that  gives you gts and wonderful surprises, as well as the comfort and support over dficult times. If you feel that you like to find out more about ways of real self care, developing good habits and creating change, you can contact me on  .For the month of January, I am offering free -minute assessment sessions.

Thirty eight percent of drivers were detected driving at between mph and mph.The provision of the series of electronic devices was in response to community concern about speeding across the district and viewed as part of a major offensive on those who break the law and to encourage drivers to slow down.PCSP officials say the average speeds recorded in Downpatrick, Killyleagh and Newcastle have reduced with no change in Newcastle.

The average speed of cars travellingpast each sign was mph in Ardglass and Clough, mph in Castlewellan, mph in Downpatrick, mph in Newcastle and mph in Newcastle.The PCSP is planning to install seven more speed indicator signs with demand for the devices described as ldquohigh with particular interest from residents and councillors in the Downpatrick, Rowallane, Slieve Croob and Mournes district electoral areas.Local councillor Dermot Curran, who lives in Ardglass, has described the mph speed recorded at the Downpatrick Road in the village as ldquotruly shocking.He said while the number of drivers breaking the ious speed limits is reducing, there were a number ldquothumbing their noses at the restrictions in place and posing a serious danger to other road users and pedestrians.ldquoThe fact that drivers are not slowing down in built-up areas, regardless of the time of day, is a real worry. The consequences of a driver losing control of a car travelling at mph is truly frightening. The message that speed kills cannot be reinforced enough,he remarked.ldquoThere is clearly a hardcore of drivers who care little for their own safety, or that of other road users. It is an issue that must be addressed..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/26_January2022_Ashling.jpg","title":"Twilight vigil for Ashling  ","story":"MEMBERS of Newcastle CCEacute and the wider community came together last week for a twilight vigil in memory of Ashling Murphy, the -year-old teacher from Tullamore, Co Offaly, who was murdered while out running.Musicians gathered at the Garden of Hope at the Lodge in Castlewellan on Tuesday night to pay their respects to the talented traditional musician with music and poetry.Ashling was an active member of the Ballyboy Comhaltas branch in Co Offaly.Many local branch members have spent time in Tullamore attending All Ireland Fleadhs and some have walked along the Grand Canal where Ashling was killed.Some of the Comhaltasrsquo younger musicians were friends with Ashling and played music with her. They enjoyed each otherrsquos company and are still coming to terms with the tragedy.Cllr Roisin Howell, who organised the event, told the assembled people: ldquoAll of us in the branch are shocked and saddened by the death of Ashling Murphy.ldquoThe brutal manner of her death has both angered and bewildered the entire nation. We stand here in the Garden of Hope, united this evening, keeping Ashlingrsquos family and friends in our thoughts and prayers.A poem by Belfast writer Helen McClements was read out and the musicians honoured Ashlingrsquos memory by playing some of the tunes they had played with her.People also left candles and flowers at the monument as the music played.The first verse of the poem is as follows:Before she went down to the Grand CanalI wondershe chanced to run earlyCatching the last of the waning sunBefore darkness fellSnuffing out the light..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/26_January2022_Brigid.jpg","title":"Two hour talk  to re engage with life of St Brigid and her link to district  ","story":"THE distinctive St Brigidrsquos cross is something that many Catholics are very familiar with, including having fond memories of being taught how to make one at school which was proudly displayed at home.As the the feast day, February , approaches, the interest in the le and work of one of the worldrsquos most beloved saints is still high.Local people will have the chance to re-engage with the story of St Brigid, who is special to the Downpatrick area as she is reputedly buried alongside St Patrick in the grounds of Down Cathedral.Historian and tour guide Brigid Watson, of Sustainable Journeys Ireland, will be hosting a talk on the le of St Brigid with a demonstration of cross-making and a chance for participants to make personal crosses.Entitled Brigid Saint or Goddess, the two-hour talk will be held at the St Patrick Centre in Downpatrick from -pm next Tuesday, February , and again on February  and March .Brigid explains why the story of St Brigid and her namesake remains fascinating to her.ldquoSt Brigid is the female patroness of Ireland and one of the most widely revered saints in Ireland and beyond. She lived in the period -AD and was a visionary spiritual leader and inspirational woman, she explained.ldquoBrigid was recognised as a saint from around the seventh century and seven dferent lsquolivesrsquo of St Brigid were written which is indicative of the cult following she had.ldquoHer feast day is on February which is the first day of spring mdash Imbolc in the Celtic calendar. There are three other feasts in the Celtic calendar mdash May , Bealtaine August , Luacutenasa and November,  Samhain. Each of the feasts has associated with it a specic set of beliefs and customs.ldquoThere was a pre-Christian aspect to the feast on February . The main importance of the feast of St Brigid would appear to be that it was a christianisation of one of the key dates in the farming year in Ireland. In earlier centuries in Ireland and in many areas St Brigidrsquos day was observed as a holiday and some farming related activities were not permitted. In , the government of the Republic of Ireland decided to make the February  a bank holiday. This is an inspired choice of date for the new bank holiday.Brigid said the main customs associated with St Brigidrsquos Day are the making of St Brigidrsquos crosses the Briacutedeoacuteg and the Brat Briacutede. These customs were traditionally practiced on the eve of St Brigidrsquos feast day as according to Celtic timing, night came before day.The custom of making St Brigidrsquos crosses is still widespread throughout Ireland. There are regional iations across Ireland in the design and composition of the cross. The most common one is the simple four armed cross.ldquoThe explanation of the custom is that St Brigid made the cross when she was comforting a dying man who wished to convert to Christianity. She placed it in his hands, explained Brigid. ldquoPeople believe that the St Brigidrsquos cross offers protection from sickness and other forms of adversity for their homes, family and animals.ldquoToday in Co Down farming and non-farming families still want to get a St Brigidrsquos cross for this reason. In Ulster, a three-armed cross was placed in the stable or byre for the protection of animals. Throughout my le I have made St Brigid crosses for our home.ldquoAs a teacher I have taught groups of pupils how to make the cross. It is important that we pass on customs and traditions to the next generation and do not lose the wealth of culture we have in Ireland.She said that the Briacutedeoacuteg is another custom associated with St Brigidrsquos Day. It consisted, or consists, of a group of young people called briacutedeoga, lsquobiddiesrsquoor biddy-boys going from house to house carrying an effigy of St Brigid .The children received some donation at each house visited. Often a doll was made for the occasion. The body of the doll may have been made from a sheaf of straw. A ball of hay, straw or turnip was used to represent the head. It was usually constructed with a strong stick or churn-dash at its core.The use of the churn dash was thought to reflect the saintrsquos association with dairying. A purchased rag doll might be used. Whether a doll was made or purchased, it was a representation of St Brigid and was dressed in white.The original objective of the exercise was the collection of alms for the poor. The group always provided some entertainment for the homes visited with singing or music. The girls and boys in the group dressed up in disguise for the occasion. The custom lasted longest in Co Kerry and still survives today in a few areas.The third important custom which was widespread throughout Ireland is known as the brat Briacutede . A piece of cloth, larger than a hankerchief, was put on a bush outside the home on the eve of St Brigidrsquos feast day and it was not usually brought in until morning.Brigid added: ldquoThe belief was that when St Brigid was travelling around the country that night and she came across the cloth, she blessed it with the curative powers of her cloak. It was put away and used as a healing cloth throughout the year for sickness, pain and as protection against harm. With changes in society this custom has only survived in some areas including the south and west of Ireland.The historian said that Saint Brigid, who is strongly associated with nature and farming, is ldquoa saint for our times. With the environmental crisis facing us we can learn from the reverence which the early Celtic saints, including St Brigid, showed towards nature. They appreciated the fundamental importance of nature to humanity.ldquoThe challenges we face today are much greater than those in the th and th centuries but the need for social justice is the same. May the le of St Brigid be an inspiration to all to take action for a better world.When she died St Brigid was buried beside the high altar in the church in Kildare. Her remains were brought to Downpatrick for reasons of safety at the time of the Viking raids on monasteries and reburied with those of St Patrick and St Colmcille at Down Cathedral.To book a place at pound for one of talks visit https:www.saintpatrickcentre friends saint-brigids-day-experiences..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/13428814.jpg","title":"news","story":"As a subscriber, you are shown % lessThose ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local servicesThese adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It seems that the DUP position with grassroots unionism is weakening. They argue it was their opposition that has brought the foreign aggressors of the EU back to the table. If it were not so serious, it would be laughable. Who are they trying to kid  Someone like Kate Hoey and other lay people, who are not elected politicians, have taken more action to oppose the iniquitous protocol. May is fast approaching and we will be waiting for the usual spiel such as vote for usyou oppose the protocol. It took some unionist politicians time to waken up to the rubbish being spun, like, Northern Ireland can have the best of both worlds. If we look at the DUP’s record of their opposition, it is derisory.Unionist parties need to make their position clear that a vote for them will mean all-out war against the protocol evenit means scrapping support for the Belfast Agreementand pulling down the Assembly. The powers that be must be made to sit up and realise that unionists have had enough of their country being made a bargaining tool.

I took up art, I did it for about a year and that was the end of that.“Then about five years ago, my sister’s husband had died and we were clearing out the house. I found that she’d kept all of the sketches I’d done when I was  in an envelope. “I started looked at them, messing around with them, I bought some paints and started colouring them in.Clubsound in the s. PACEMAKER PRESS BELFAST“The nights I wasn’t working I was painting. In two years I must have done about  paintings for people.“It’s a blessing for me, it kept me sane, when you play every week and suddenly you stop, it hits you hard.“It relieved the boredom, it gave me something to focus on, when a painting turned out successful you felt you’d achieved something.“My biggest satisfaction is that I’ve painted memories for people that are now hanging in their house.George Jones started and finished his radio career with Downtown. Picture by CHARLES MCQUILLAN PACEMAKER.“It’s another sense of entertainment I suppose, another string to my bow. If my sister hadn’t kept those sketches I wouldn’t have all of this.”George recalled his sister’s influence on his musical career: “The first two records my sister brought in that started me on music when I was about nine or  were Little Richard ‘Long Tall Sally’ and Elvis ‘All Shook Up’. “In those days it wasn’t vinyl, it was  bakelite – it looked the same as vinyl butyou’d dropped it, it would have smashed. “I listened to them non-stop and then she bought me my first guitar at .”George said he formed skfle groups with boys of his age in the Bloomfield area of east Belfast. One of them was Van Morrison, whom George went on to tour with as The Monarchs.He said: “I go to lunch with Van Morrison quite a lot. The Monarchs were the first band to go to Germany. We had a hit record in  when the Beatles were still hovering around Germany.“Van has been trying to find the rights to it to repress it and put it out as a single on vinyl. I sung on it and he played saxophone – a bit of rock and roll.”George, who has been part of the successful ‘Do You Come Here Often ’ and ‘Rock ‘n Roll Years and Dance Hall Days’ shows, started learning the guitar at . He believes that might be the magic number: “I’ve interviewed so many people in my years on the radio who started the exact same way. “I’m hesitant to ask when they started to play the guitar – it’s always . So many great guitarists I interviewed, the likes of Hank B Marvin, started at .”Having found his first chords at  George is still going strong at .He said: “For me it’s been an incredible le, just when you think it’s all over, Clubsound have found a new lease of le.“We’ve found out that young people have started listening to the albums their parents have. I hesitate to use the term, but you become a cult.“Young ones come up to me and say ‘Yeoooo, Shankill Airways, my mum plays that all the time’.”George said the state modern music meant that people are yearning for songs from bygone days, especially the fties and sixties: “It was real music, there was no electronics – it was guitars, live drums, you were getting the whole live vibe.“In our day you just piled in, there was no such thing as tickets, you paid at the door and they squeezed in as many as they could.That added to the experience.”George plans to publish his memoirs as a book. In it he plans to recount his first meetings with Rory Gallagher and an incredibly green Gary Moore, of whom he told his father, ‘that wee lad will never be a guitar player’.‘It took a long time but I’m now over shock exit from Radio Ulster’George said that when he made his radio debut with Downtown his plan wasn’t to dilute his Clubsound persona too much.He said: “I used to bring what I did on stage onto the radio. I used to bring these we characters like Sadie that I did the voices for – she got more mail that I did. Radio needs to entertain,you’re on for two hours you’re not just sitting there spinning dics, you have to draw people in.”It wasn’t long before George was snapped up by Radio Ulster where he delivered ‘Just Jones’ for an amazing  years. Then one fateful day he was told he was surplus to requirements despite his popularity.George said: “People come up to me to this day, saying, ‘we miss you on the raido’ and ‘why did they do that to you’. “It was a big change in my le, it brought me down to earth more than anything. I thought those days were over – about two more times before that we were down and out and started over again, especially after the Miami thing and in South Africa my son nearly died of typhoid.“There were downs, but this was one I didn’t expect. I felt I was doing a good job.“During my six month notice period the public lted me to heights I never would believe. On the last week I was there I got nearly , emails from all over the world. I walked out of there about  feet tall. That was the bonus.”He said: “My we and family have helped me put it behind me. It took a long time because I was hurting.“I took up U with good success. It was water under the bridge and I had to put it under the bridge. I finished up in Downtown where I’d started in the s. Then I said to myself, radio is changing but it’s time for me to step aside.“When I look back now at radio in general, it’s like looking back to the wonder years of music, it saddens me – why has it changed so much  The commercial radio stations are just advertising boards with bits of music. “The word entertainment has disappeared from broadcasting. You couldn’t sit and listen to a radio show for two hours now, whereas before you’d have people would have been glad of that two hours of company.”Asked who he listens to on the ‘wireless’ George said: “Ken Bruce is still one of the old school and he makes me laugh. He still plays the oldies. Steve Wright still plays oldies. Asides from that it’s Classic FM.“It breaks my heart but I wouldn’t listen to any local radio stations.”Where to see George and Clubsound in actionClubsound’s current line-up of George Jones, David McKnight, Barry Woods, Alan McCartney and Jimmy Black will be on the road this spring including gigs at Theatre at The Mill in Newtownabbey on Saturday, March , Armagh’s Market Place Theatre on Saturday, April  and the Portico Arts and Heritage Centre in Portaferry on Monday, April . There will also be a gig at the Millennium Forum in Londonderry on Thursday, November .

No other party would do it. “This is a guy who has held four senior positions in the Executive of Northern Ireland. He has years of experience in local government. He was our party leader. You can’t leave him not running in the election, you can’t.”Mr Wells said he was quick to lend his support to Mr Poots in the South Down selection contest, saying: “When it became apparent to me that I was toast, I was gone, the obvious person I thought was a very suitable candidate was Edwin who has vast experience and could give South Down first-class representation. “That hasn’t, as yet, happened and I think that’s very regrettable. “We’re going to have to wake up on Monday morning and ask ‘how do we deal with this’.”The News Letter approached Mr Poots, Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, and Ms Forsythe for comment on the selection process yesterday.The party has remained tight-lipped following Friday’s selection process.A spokesman pointed the News Letter to a brief statement outlining its selection of Ms Forsythe.Jim WellsEdwin PootsJeffrey DonaldsonDUP  \"       \"  Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up  Most PopularJim Wells: I have to accept my DUP career has ended in humiliationJim Wells: There could be a twist in tale of DUP South Down nominationThe killing of two RUC officers in Londonderry was the backdrop to Bloody SundayUUP leader Doug Beattie: Bloody Sunday was wrong and must never happen againThe DUP gets weaker within grassroots unionismMost PopularBest air puriers : Do air puriers work  Can they remove viruses, and which are the best in the UK Aldi outdoor log burner review: how much are Gardenline burners - size, weight, colour and features best backpacking tents UK : lightweight, one-person tents ideal for hikingDine in on Valentine’s Day with Morrisons £ meal deal  - here’s what’s on offer, and how to buy online Valentine’s Day UK  flowers: roses, Lego, MS - best February flower ideas for delivery to your door                       This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us on    ExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryNewspaper ArchiveUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter \" fill\"#ea\"  ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-fbyfCU sc-GEbAx ueSoA gsnYBQ\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyModern Slavery Statement  News you can trust since Sign in   \"    Welcome backEdit Account-Sign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessFarmingEducationHealthOpinionPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportOpinionWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensPuzzlese-PaperCoronavirusMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessRecommended\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      RecommendedEntertainmentTechnologyLestyleHome and GardenFashion and BeautyDealsPublic NoticesContact UsFree Happy AdsFollow us       \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

They say that the beach is a sand and shingle beach and has a reputation for being one of the cleanest in the region. There is a coastal walk, chance to go fishing, surfing and views of Tusker Rock.For those owners who may not yet have ventured to the beach with their pups or are concerned about behaviour while at the beach, Wood Green’s dog behaviour and training specialist, Wendy Kruger, has provided some tips to prepare your dog for the beach.• Ensure your dog’s microchip and collar tag details are up to date – just in case.• Get used to checking ground surface temperatures before you take your dog out, as dry sand can be too hot for dogs’ paws on sunny days. To check the ground temperature, place the back of your hand on the ground. If its too hot to hold comfortably for five seconds, it’s too hot for dogs’ paws..remove• Practise basic, reward-based training when out and about to help your dog to maintain focus and engagement on walks.• Recall is also an area that needs particular attention. Evenyour dog has a great recall at home, its not something that can be guaranteed in unfamiliar environments with exciting new distractions. Games with toys are a fantastic way to help your dog engage with you when there are other distractions around. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

This motion was proposed by Green Party Councillor Simon Lee, and called upon NILGOSC to:“Outline their plans for esting from fossil fuels, including timelines, and request that they meet with Officers, Trade Unions and Elected Members to present these plans.”While stopping short of calling for immediate estment, the motion passed by Lisburn and Castlereagh City represents another step forward, and means that a majority of councils inNorthern Irelandnow wish NILGOSC to undertake actions to bring about estment. Motions calling for full and imminent estment have previously been passed by Newry Mourne and Down, Belfast City, Fermanagh and Omagh, and Derry City and Strabane. Councillors proposing such motions have been supported in their efforts by Fossil Free NI, a grassroots group which has been campaigning for estment since .Commenting on the passing of the motion at Mid Ulster Council, Councillor Dan Kerr said: “I am glad that the council unanimously supported the estment motion, and that we, alongwith many other local authorities both nationally and internationally, have added weight to this campaign. We hope that it can highlight the unethical nature of continued investment inthe fossil fuel industry, and also that with practical action we can strive for a better world for both present and future generations.”Dr Seamus Campbell of Fossil Free NI also expressed his delight at the passing of the motions, adding: “With COP highlighting the necessity of urgent climate action, it isimperative that our communities are not fuelling climate catastrophe. Calling upon NILGOSC to est from the fossil fuel industry is one way to do this. We are delighted that our localrepresentatives and have passed these motions and sent a clear message that business as usual in longer an option. We hope it will encourage other councils to pass similar motions,thereby demonstrating strong community support for estment and actions which benefit both people and the planet”.Castlereagh City CouncilLisburnCouncillorsMid UlsterCouncil  \"       \"   for the newsletterKeep up with the latest news and views from NorthernIrelandWorldSign Up       \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"    ]]Most PopularPipe bomb attack confirmed after loud blast heard across Lur...NewsPSNI officers wearing new style of unorm from today...NewsDrugs seized by Carrickfergus and Larne PSNI team during wee...NewsFormer employee awarded £k after suing Carrick firm over ...NewsSuspected puppy farmed dog found in a Co Armagh ditch had gi...NewsMost PopularBuying a Nintendo Switch for your household  Our guide on ho...RecommendedDine in on Valentine’s Day with Morrisons £ meal deal ...Recommended Smart smoke alarms UK: what do you need to keep your home sa...Recommended                       This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us on    ExploreNewsSportWhats OnLestyleYour Northern IrelandRecommendedMore from Northern Ireland WorldAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoNewspaper ArchiveUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessArchiveSubscribeEventsPlace your AdReaders Charter \" fill\"#ea\"  ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-fbyfCU sc-GEbAx ueSoA gsnYBQ\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyModern Slavery Statement       \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"    Sign in   \"    Welcome backEdit Account-Sign OutNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      NewsCoronavirusTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsHealthBusinessEducationEnvironmentPeopleRead ThisFootball\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      FootballIrish League FootballSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      SportMotorcyclingIce HockeyOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      LestyleFood and DrinkTravelHomes and GardensCarsFamilyRetroOpinionYour NI\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Your NI​Antrim and NewtownabbeyArmagh Banbridge and CraigavonBelfastCauseway Coast and GlensLondonderry Derry City and StrabaneLisburn and CastlereaghMid and East AntrimMid UlsterFermanagh and OmaghNewry Mourne and DownArds and North DownMust ReadContact usAdvertise My BusinessFollow us           \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"     \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily NorthernIrelandWorld Today newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

We loved the work he did with us for our first single.”Detailing how the band now has a fourth member, Daniel added: “Jordan has been playing since   and we’ve known him for a good while. He adds another dimension to what we’re doing.“Chris will play the piano and lead guitar, while our drummer Thomas designed the artwork for the cover.

These follow the Northern Ireland Executive’s recent decision to ease Covid- restrictions.”Full details of the new timetables are available on Translink’s website and journey planner www.translink----Read More Read MorePSNI officers wearing new style of unorm from todayTranslinkRoy BeggsNI ExecutiveEast Antrim  \"       \"   for the newsletterKeep up with the latest news and views from NorthernIrelandWorldSign Up       \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"    ]]Most PopularPipe bomb attack confirmed after loud blast heard across Lur...NewsPSNI officers wearing new style of unorm from today...NewsDrugs seized by Carrickfergus and Larne PSNI team during wee...NewsFormer employee awarded £k after suing Carrick firm over ...NewsSuspected puppy farmed dog found in a Co Armagh ditch had gi...NewsMost PopularBuying a Nintendo Switch for your household  Our guide on ho...RecommendedDine in on Valentine’s Day with Morrisons £ meal deal ...Recommended Smart smoke alarms UK: what do you need to keep your home sa...Recommended                       This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us on    ExploreNewsSportWhats OnLestyleYour Northern IrelandRecommendedMore from Northern Ireland WorldAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoNewspaper ArchiveUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessArchiveSubscribeEventsPlace your AdReaders Charter \" fill\"#ea\"  ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-fbyfCU sc-GEbAx ueSoA gsnYBQ\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyModern Slavery Statement       \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"    Sign in   \"    Welcome backEdit Account-Sign OutNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      NewsCoronavirusTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsHealthBusinessEducationEnvironmentPeopleRead ThisFootball\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      FootballIrish League FootballSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      SportMotorcyclingIce HockeyOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      LestyleFood and DrinkTravelHomes and GardensCarsFamilyRetroOpinionYour NI\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Your NI​Antrim and NewtownabbeyArmagh Banbridge and CraigavonBelfastCauseway Coast and GlensLondonderry Derry City and StrabaneLisburn and CastlereaghMid and East AntrimMid UlsterFermanagh and OmaghNewry Mourne and DownArds and North DownMust ReadContact usAdvertise My BusinessFollow us           \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"     \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily NorthernIrelandWorld Today newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.
