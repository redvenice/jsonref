Proactive coaching provides endless possibilities for personal development, increased awareness, and an all-round better life\u0027.   Mr Bukowski added: \u0027He\u0027s got this woke job title of Chief Impact Officer and today\u0027s announcement has done just that for the company, had a huge impact.\u0027This announcement is worth millions to this startup in free publicity and if he\u0027s done a good deal with a salary as well as shares in the business, it will probably make millions for Harry too.\u0027He could never have done this deal if he was still a working member of the Royal Family. They\u0027ve announced the job just after the Oprah interview, amid an outpouring of support for the couple in the US. They\u0027re on a crest of a wave there. If the company is as good as Harry says, it is a smart move. But if it\u0027s a pile of poop, he won\u0027t have to many more chances to cash in.\u0027He added: \u0027If people weren\u0027t clear on Harry and Meghan\u0027s business strategy, they should be now.\u0027Harry said: \u0027This is about acknowledging that it isn\u0027t so much what is wrong with us, but more about what has happened to us over the course of life. Often because of societal barriers, financial difficulty, or stigma, too many people aren\u0027t able to focus on their mental health until they\u0027re forced to. I want us to move away from the idea that you have to feel broken before reaching out for help\u0027.  The prince, who says he has been using BetterUp\u0027s app since January, began talks with them about a role last autumn after being introduced to USC graduate Mr Robichaux \u0027through a mutual friend\u0027.BetterUp employs therapists and executive coaches on contracts, who are paired with clients to provide mental health coaching by video link through the app. Most of its clients are in the United States, but it does have executive coaches employed in the UK.The tech firm that works with corporate giants including Facebook, Google, Snap Inc, NASA, Hilton and Warner Brothers. There will be some raised eyebrows because Harry has spoken widely on the need to protect the environment, but BetterUp has also worked with oil giant Chevron. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/16/01/4F1F8CE000000578-0-image-m-42_1534379763874.jpg","title":"Britains youngest lottery winner Callie Rogers penniless living benefits","story":"Share this articleBritain’s youngest Lotto winner Callie Rogers is living on benefits after coke crash and blowing £1.8m jackpot"},{"url":null,"title":"China sanctions British politicians Uighur criticism","story":"Share this articleThe Government faced a potential Tory revolt with backbenchers prepared to support an amendment to the Trade Bill aimed at preventing ministers signing a deal with countries involved in genocide.Activists and United Nations rights experts say at least one million Muslims have been detained in camps in Xinjiang.The activists and some Western politicians accuse China of using torture, forced labour and sterilisations.China has repeatedly denied all accusations of abuse and says its camps offer vocational training and are needed to fight extremism.A Ministry spokesman said: \u0027China is firmly determined to safeguard its national sovereignty, security and development interests, and warns the UK side not to go further down the wrong path.

She is a self-confessed nerd and adores her job as deputy head of maths, earning herself the affectionate nickname Mrs Maths. When she’s not teaching maths, attending maths conferences, or baking maths cakes – such as a giant calculator – she’s championing the digital maths community, on her blog and through social media. Hawthorne, a mum-of-two who is married to a maths teacher, shares her lessons on her blog and hosts online maths chats, encouraging other teachers and mathematicians to get involved and talk with one another. She uses hashtags for specific subjects, allowing members of the online community to contribute and benefit from the success of others. “I regularly talk to people who have written maths books, or lead on national projects. It’s led to a massive improvement in my teaching.” Technology has provided Hawthorn with a collaborative “brain” to pick, and her championing of digital cooperation means decades of experience are on hand. She says: “It’s so important for learning and improving as a teacher. You can say: ‘I’m struggling to teach this,’ or ‘My children are not getting the concept of that.’ The responses and ideas have really made a difference to the way I teach – and to the rest of my department as well. I’m always encouraging them to join in. “It feels like a community – we’ve even started a lockdown social group, which is just a lovely chat with a load of maths teachers! It’s helped me help the pupils with how to do things online, especially during the pandemic.” As a PE teacher, the only technology that Elliot Bailey, 26, previously incorporated into his lessons were treadmills and exercise bikes. But that was pre-pandemic. Now, a year after Covid-19 changed all of our lives, his innovative use of tech and live-stream lessons provide his pupils at Sandringham school, in St Albans, Hertfordshire, with escapism and fun – when they need it most. Bailey, who is also a semi-professional footballer for St Albans City FC, has created a video hub where his pupils can share clips of themselves keeping active in lockdown. The compilations have included tap-dancing, kids flipping on trampolines and even a Segway dog walk. Bailey and his colleagues are working hard to keep things fresh, he says. “After a few weeks the novelty wears off so we have to keep changing it. I’ve made board games, such as snakes and ladders, with fitness elements. We roll a dice and the squares the pupils land on have either a 30-second workout, rest or sprint. “I also created a Marvel-style game – it took me ages! To beat the characters, the players have to do, say, 20 press-ups in 30 seconds. Pupils really love that one.” He’s had to become something of a shape-shifter in lockdown, giving Joe Wicks a run for his money one week and feeling like a children’s TV presenter the next, but Bailey says teaching during the pandemic is his proudest achievement to date. He adds: “I know the students look forward to PE lessons. I feel like they need that escapism. I’m proud and privileged that I can keep children engaged and involved during this time.” Meanwhile in Northumberland, Nick Tuck, 47, has helped transform the online infrastructure at Ponteland high school, in Ponteland, where he works as head of science. Due to Tuck’s hunger to move things forward, every pupil now has their own online account and access to learning resources at any time, building the kind of digital literacy and independence that will benefit them far beyond the classroom. The father-of-two believes that the days of pupils heading to “the computer room” should be a thing of the past, and that technology needs to be part of everyday lessons, just like an exercise book. Tuck, who is a Google certified educator, says: “If IT comes to you in a science lesson it becomes a normal part of that lesson, enhancing it.” As a result, when the pandemic reared its head, pupils and staff were as prepared as possible for home schooling. What do the pupils think of it all? They’ve become great cheerleaders for his new system, singing its praises to other staff and encouraging them to jump on board. And one unexpected benefit of IT-integrated lessons, Tuck has found, is that pupils are far less likely to lose or forget about tasks. It turns out the dog can’t “eat your homework” if it’s nestled safely online. He laughs: “There’s nowhere to hide.” "},{"url":null,"title":"sport and science theyre a natural match for this creative teacher","story":"This might sound like a novel approach, but for Branch – a primary school teacher with a passion for sports, and a background in physical education and science – it’s a method that makes perfect sense. “Physical education is a fantastic tool for teaching all kinds of other subjects, particularly science,” he says. “As with many scientific concepts, electrical charge is quite complex and confusing, but by setting up a course in the gym with the indoor apparatus, the children have a visual to hold on to – it helps to bring the theory to life.” Despite the disruption caused by the pandemic, it’s clear that the 35-year-old – who completed a PGCE in primary education with science at the University of Exeter last year – is relishing his position as a newly qualified teacher (NQT) at Stokenham Area primary, in the village of Stokenham, Devon. “I love getting creative with planning and finding interesting ways to make traditional subjects more engaging to pupils,” he says. “One of my favourite lessons so far was when we took children out into our forest playground to teach them about light and refraction. We angled mirrors up at the tree canopy, which created some amazing visuals. The children were completely captivated, which was brilliant to see.” For someone as active as Branch – he’s a keen runner who regularly sets off at 5am for a 10-mile run before work – the 215-pupil school, just five miles from Torcross and the beaches of Slapton Sands, provides the perfect setting for his lifestyle and his sporting ambitions. Before he reaches his 40th birthday, he has set himself an ambitious target: to complete a sub-three-hour marathon, an ultramarathon and an Ironman triathlon. But it’s all a long way from where his teaching aspirations began. Branch first dipped his toes in the world of education 10 years ago when he was living in Malaysia’s bustling, high-rise capital, Kuala Lumpur. There he worked as a freelance writer, football coach and as a sports teacher at a number of international schools. Before that, he’d had a stint as a ski instructor in Canada after dropping out of his degree in PE at Leeds politan University. “As a kid I really enjoyed trying out new sports and giving something a go. Every lunchtime and evening during the school week was taken up with me playing anything and everything possible,” he says. “When I arrived in Malaysia there was very little organised sport for children, so I set up a football academy to give them an opportunity to play, and I loved seeing them learn.” He may not have realised it at the time, but it was an experience that set him on the path to discovering his calling in the classroom. “It’s easy to see now that my time in Malaysia marked a massive turning point for me,” he says. “Working with kids, older and younger, gave me a love of teaching and a confidence in my own ability. I knew that I wanted to come back to the UK and learn to teach properly.” Branch returned in 2016 and enrolled at Plymouth Marjon University to complete his PE degree, graduating with first class honours in 2019. So how, and why, did he end up specialising in science? “I’ve always been interested in science – my grandfather was a lead chemist for English China Clay and encouraged me in STEM subjects,” he says. “Then at uni I devoured science modules in my PE degree. When I saw you could make a traditional subject come alive, I wanted to specialise in it.” It’s a decision he hasn’t regretted for a moment, especially as the “phenomenal” staff at the University of Exeter encouraged him to bring his passion for sports and the great outdoors into his teaching, so as to make learning as hands-on as possible. It’s a tactic he’s embraced, as his science class on light and refraction shows. Another lesson that brings back happy memories was one that involved taking pupils to study rock formations on a local beach. “Seeing children physically experience a concept is fantastic,” he says. Branch has already achieved a lot in his short time as a teacher, but it’s his ambitious plans for sharing his love of sports with pupils after lockdown that he’s most excited about. He hopes to set up after-school clubs in lacrosse, athletics, cross-country and girls’ football, as well as for water sports such as kayaking and paddleboarding. He’s clearly ready to race ahead. “There may be little like the high of beating your personal best in a race, scoring the winning goal in the 90th minute, or hiking a fresh powder run in the Alps,” he says, “But teaching is so much more meaningful than any of that because of the impact you have on others. “It’s incredibly rewarding to see children achieve things they thought they couldn’t possibly do, or to break through their fear and try something new. I certainly consider myself very lucky.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/de4e97b749ea2d5a1a5c0f2df472ace2b0b97892/0_16_2396_1438/master/2396.jpg?width=300\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5ac3e2d7aff1bb3e7de292c3b95f1667","title":"suffolk town aldeburgh divided over antony gormley works placed on beach","story":"Caroline Wiseman, a local art dealer, bought the pieces – titled Oval, Peg, Penis and Snowman – that were designed by Gormley in 2001 for a regeneration project in Peckham, south London. Placing the objects near the South Lookout tower on the shingle beach outside her studio last year, the collector wanted the 100kg art installation to be of “cultural benefit” to the upmarket town. Those aspirations were dashed, however, after she admitted to not having obtained planning permission for the pieces, which, in any case, Gormley’s representative said were designed to stand upright rather than lie horizontally. Writing to East Suffolk council in objection to Wiseman’s retrospective planning application, Gormley – the creator of the Angel of the North – said his work for an urban environment had been misrepresented. Wiseman’s application has now been withdrawn and the works are due to be removed next week, but the matter continues to be a source of contention. “The placing of Antony Gormley’s work on a public beach not in the form he intended is offensive,” said Helen Napper, who has lived in Aldeburgh for almost 30 years. “It’s not a good idea when someone autonomously decides what the town needs without public consultation. A public piece of work should have a broader consensus.” Napper was among those who objected to the sculptures resting at the site permanently. Opponents raised concerns around upkeep of the artworks and accessibility issues. However, many people expressed support for the works, which are collectively titled Quartet: Sleeping. One local resident, who gave her name as De Gard, 54, said: “I felt the sculptures were ambiguous. This is where all the fun was had because people were saying things like ‘are they sex toys? Seals? Bombs?’ It was just a bit of fun. There was also an educational purpose as they added a curiosity by acting as a point of discussion around art, landscape and the environment.” Another local, who wished to remain anonymous, said: “I liked the layers of the stone and thought it brought a lot of positive attention to the area, rather than the focus just being on the fish and chip shops.” The works are not the first in the town to polarise artistic sensibilities. In 2003 a 12ft-tall steel artwork was unveiled at the northern end of the beach as a tribute to the composer Benjamin Britten, who wrote one of his most famous operas, Peter Grimes, about the life of a fictional local fisher. Created by the Suffolk artist Maggi Hambling, the work, known as the Scallop, was criticised by lovers of that stretch of coastline vehemently against siting it on the unspoilt beach. Drawing comparisons between the two public works, Caroline Gay Way, a member of the Arts Club Aldeburgh Beach along with Wiseman, said: “When a sculpture is put somewhere unexpected, some people may say that the work ruins the look of a pristine beach. But at the same time the artwork draws people to visit because it is a talking point. “The Gormley sculptures were low-key compared to the Scallop, which was very large, has been weathered and has become part of the Aldeburgh experience. Lots of people now come just to see it.” Wiseman, who has sold the sculptures, plans to produce an “Angel of the East” using sea bricks on the site where the Gormley artworks soon will have once rested. “It is going to be a perfect circle of beautiful red stones found on the beach so we can all celebrate the rising sun and being alive in the universe,” Wiseman said. Responding to criticism over the alleged lack of public consultation, she added: “I think I didn’t need planning permission to have the structures anyway. I believe the council would have likely refused the application, which is why I withdrew it.” Gormley declined to comment when approached by the ."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c124a4919fda86646dca75744ee0e41a2566bea5/0_174_5221_3133/master/5221.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=c960d3992bf54639b5f3361266a23312","title":"as covid rules relax in england which foods should we be sharing","story":"If you’re meeting in a park and need something easy to transport, hot sausage rolls or pies are a great idea because the pastry keeps them well insulated, and everyone can have their own with no need to share utensils. Jacket potatoes are similar: stuffed and well-wrapped in foil they double as hand-warmers, and the same goes for flasks of soup – French onion, perhaps, with cheese to top, or a spicy south Indian rasam. Ask everyone to bring their own mug, and you won’t even have much to carry. If you’re at home the options are almost limitless, but as we all discovered last time round, food does cool down surprisingly quickly outdoors, so it’s wise to choose something that is happy to be reheated if necessary. One-pot meals such as a vegetarian chilli are ideal – you can of course use meat substitutes, but I like the body that beans give the dish, as well as the smoky warmth of chipotle chilli, and a shot of earthy coffee as a Stetson tip to its cowboy creators. Serve with cornbread or tortilla chips and the usual sour cream, salsas and chopped avocado. If it’s fine, I’d dust off the barbecue: it’ll throw off warmth and minimise the distance the food has to travel to reach your plate. Greek kleftiko, slow-cooked lamb shoulder with herbs, garlic, lemon and potatoes, would be a fine choice for Easter – either bake it in the oven as usual and pop the meat on a hot grill to finish, or cook the whole lot slowly in a roasting tray in a covered barbecue, which will make your garden smell like a taverna on an Ionian quayside. It doesn’t really need any side dishes, but I never say no to a Greek salad.

The intervention came as the EU and the UK are locked in talks about the fate of OxfordAstraZeneca jabs produced in a factory in the Netherlands over which both sides are laying claim. Sources said that despite conciliatory language earlier in the week over finding a solution the two sides were struggling to find common ground. In an interview with FranceInfo radio, Le Drian suggested that the EU should not have to lose out on the doses to help Britain with a problem of its own making. EU officials and top-rank politicians have repeatedly said they will block any export request by AstraZeneca. “The UK is proud to have vaccinated many people with the first dose, but they will have a problem with the second dose,” Le Drian said. “And we are fully vaccinated with two doses, not one. Today we have the same number of fully vaccinated people in France and the United Kingdom. “A cooperative relationship must be found with the UK so that AstraZeneca fulfils its signed commitments with the EU, but we can’t accept any sort of blackmail. The UK is pushing for the first jab, knowing there will be problems with the second one. Europe does not have to pay the price for this policy.” The French government did not respond to requests for evidence for Le Drian’s claim. Thierry Breton, the EU’s commissioner for the internal market, who has been given responsibility for increasing vaccine production, also warned on Friday: “We have the tools and will make sure everything stays in Europe until the company will come back to its commitments.” British government sources say the delivery of second doses in the UK could still be carried out ahead on schedule, even if shipments from the Dutch plant are blocked – although they are keen to avoid that eventuality. “Factoring in all the challenges, we still think we can meet the target set out,” said an official. The speed of the government’s rollout was in part based on a the decision in early January to prioritise the first dose of a vaccine, with a second dose up to 12 weeks later, a larger gap than originally planned. Earlier this month, Boris Johnson said the UK had sufficient supplies to ensure that people would be given their second jabs on time. “We will have the second doses that people need within the 12-week window, which means around 12 million people in April,” the prime minister said. People in the UK are receiving doses of two vaccines approved by the medicine regulator: the PfizerBioNTech jab, of which 20m doses have so far been imported from Puurs, Belgium, and the OxfordAstraZeneca vaccine. There have also been delays to expected deliveries from India and on Thursday the Indian government ordered the Serum Institute to halt exports until local needs were met. The NHS has warned vaccination centres that the number of people getting the first dose of their Covid-19 jab will be “constrained” for four weeks from 29 March as a result of a “significant” reduction in the vaccine supply available. The UK government has said it is prioritising the nine priority high risk groups and second doses, but that it is on track to offer a first jab to every adult by the end of July. Officials are, however, insistent that the UK has the contractual right to the “significant number” of doses of the OxfordAstraZeneca vaccine in the Netherlands. The next conference call between EU and UK officials is expected on Saturday. The two sides have said they are seeking a “win-win” outcome but sources confirmed that the differences in positions were stark. A European commission spokesperson said: “The discussions with the UK are ongoing. We do not have any comments to make at the moment on the content of those discussions. “But as you know our common aim is to ensure that we have good cooperation in terms of supply chains in terms of producing the vaccine. We have noted the India decision … I have no comment to make on the link between the Indian decision and any discussions under way with the United Kingdom.” In a sign of the difficulty of the issue, on Thursday evening, following a virtual summit of EU leaders, both the European commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, and Macron insisted they would not allow AstraZeneca, which has only delivered to the EU 30m doses of the expected 120m this quarter, to export to the UK. Macron told reporters in Paris: “I support the fact that we must block all exports for as long as some drug companies don’t respect their commitments with Europeans.” Additional reporting by Heather Stewart"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4e94613cbb1d972349731bef2d3a2d053e5e2cb7/0_290_4553_2731/master/4553.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=5792b7fe4cb5f0c4c105614cc3e97f1b","title":"india v england second one day international live","story":"And that, phew, is that.

So many questions...Good stat from Tim on the spinners’ ineffectiveness this series: More thoughts on DRS, this time from Graeme Thorn, “The key to understanding DRS is that it’s a review system, not a video umpiring system: “umpire’s call” is essentially stating that there isn’t enough evidence from tracking or from pictures or sound that theon-field decision should be overturned.” And one last though from Gary Bartley: “Just a quick one on Umpire’s Call. To remove it would remove one of those magical cricket intangibles, namely that some reviews just ‘look’ out. And conversely some don’t, even if the ball tracking predicts them to be hitting the same amount of the stumps.If you shoulder-arms to one that swings back in at you, you’re getting given out. If you get a big stride in and miss a sweep, you’ll probably get away with it.Probably.”An email with a slurp from Tim Sanders: “Hello Tanya – I feel duty-bound to quash any thoughts of Ribena as a sports drink, since they responded to the UK tax on sugary drinks by switching entirely to artificial sweeteners. I have Type 1 diabetes, and the old stuff was my emergency ration of choice for a blood sugar dip. My wife would occasionally be woken by the final slurps following a ‘hypo’ in the small hours. However, they made the switch without changing the look of the carton, so one night I found that a) the Ribena tasted funny, and b) aspartame is no use at all for hypoglycaemia. So now, it’s jelly babies all the way. I sometimes pause to reflect on the terrible waste of all those lovely blackcurrants.” Oh poor you! (though personally I think Ribena tastes like cough medicine.)“Afternoon Tanya.” Hello Tom Hopkins“I tend to agree with Nic (14th over). People think they want clarityconsistencycertainty, but as football is currently finding out they really don’t. They want something that feels ‘fair’, not a quantifiable property. Also as VAR (which doesn’t even try to predict anything) is showing us, the technology doesn’t really provide certainly in any case. “By the way:Two atoms are walking down the street. One of them says to the other, “Dammit! I’ve lost an electron.” “Oh no”, his friend replies, “are you sure?”“Yes. I’m positive.”” “So Nick from Watford is basically saying that umpire’s call in DRS is Schrödinger’s wicket,” writes Robin Hazlehurst. “It is both out and not out simultaneously, and so the ball is both alive and dead simultaneously.”“Thanks for bringing us the cricket at our desks, we’re all jealous.” Ah ,well, glad to be of service, Andrew Waters.  “On umpire’s call, I agree with Physicist Nic at 13:29 that to call fo the removal of umpire’s call is to fail to understand machine measurement. It is therefore right that some allowance is given and the umpire’s experience relied on in close cases. However, the problem is that umpire’s call only works one way. Where ball tracking shows the ball hitting the stumps, but within the umpire’s call tolerance, then the batman can still be not out. However, where ball tracking shows the ball missing by even a millimetre, then the batsman is always not out, even if the umpire gave it the other way. For the life of me I can’t understand what logic there is in allowing for an error one way but not the other. I suppose that they want to give the benefit of the doubt to the batsman, but what you’re really doing is failing to acknowledge that a machine error could occur in either direction.”“I’m glad that Roy and Bairstow displayed considerable patience to begin with, especially against the wily Bhuvra.” writes Column Fordham. “As pointed out observantly by Krishna Iyer (surely an amalgam of Ishan Kishan and Shreyas Iyer?), they seem to be following the Indian approach of ‘build and see’.

The video footage shows the feline family standing on top of a hill in the Land of the Leopard national park. In the video, the young mother, identified as Leo 117F, is seen spotting a mystery animal and then leaving the scene, apparently walking closer towards it. Soon her cubs also discover the animal and begin to watch their mother’s interaction with the “intruder” intently, the park said. None appeared to be afraid. Ivan Rakov, spokesman for the national park, said it was the first time that Leo 117F, who is believed to be four years old, had been caught on video with her cubs. “We’ve discovered that she has been able to raise a family,” Rakov said. “This is her first litter.” He said raising three cubs at once in Russia’s taiga was no mean feat and required a “lot of space and a lot of food”. Amur leopards are considered to be the rarest of the world’s big cats. They can climb trees and their spot patterns are unique, like people’s fingerprints. Rakov said the video footage showed that the fight against poachers and a series of other steps taken in recent years to boost the population of the threatened species had borne fruit. Over the past 20 years the number of Amur leopards in Russia has grown to around 100 from 35. “This is one more piece of evidence that measures taken by the Russian state to preserve the world’s rarest big cat are working,” Rakov said. The population of the big cats had returned essentially “from the dead”. “It’s a major success for Russia,” said Alexei Kostyrya, rare species projects coordinator at WWF Russia’s Amur branch, pointing to the country’s joint conservation efforts with China.  Rakov said that about 40 of the animals had “dual citizenship” and roamed freely between Russia and China. Established in 2012, the national park is also home to other big cats including the Amur tiger and the lynx."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cb422b7dda3082fd377ef3258739cfb5e9f16d9b/0_258_4239_2543/master/4239.jpg?width=300\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e7516066bf8d2b32a1ad64fa76f38677","title":"shops stay open until 10pm england lockdown eased jenrick","story":"The communities secretary, Robert Jenrick, said the extended opening hours on Monday to Saturday would help shoppers return to high streets safely when non-essential shops are permitted to reopenin England from 12 April. The move is likely to be welcomed by shoppers, who in December went stores such as Primark in the middle of the night to avoid crowds and retailers whose finances have been badly damaged by enforced store closures. Shop staff, however, may be less enthusiastic about working late into the evening. The British Retail Consortium estimated this week that shops had missed out on £27bn in sales across the three lockdowns, a huge shortfall that had contributed to closures and job losses during the pandemic. Shops will be able to extend their opening hours from 7am to 10pm to help customers avoid peak times and ease transport pressures, according to the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government. Announcing the temporary measures, Jenrick said: “To support businesses to reopen and recover, I’ve extended measures to allow shops to stay open for longer. This is part of a package of support to help reopen our shops and high streets safely, backed by £56m. “This will provide a much-needed boost for many businesses – protecting jobs, reducing pressure on public transport and supporting people and communities to continue to visit their high streets safely and shop locally.” Another recent study found that more than 11,000 outlets permanently disappeared from high streets, shopping centres and retail parks in Great Britain last year. Independent retailers and villages fared far better than chain stores and city centres as the shift to working from home and a desire to avoid public transport benefited more convenient neighbourhood shops. John Lewis confirmed plans earlier this week to permanently close eight more outlets, including department stores in York, Peterborough, Sheffield and Aberdeen, with the potential loss of almost 1,500 jobs. Its chair, Sharon White, has talked of an economic earthquake. “We’ve seen decades-worth of change in the space of one year. Shopping habits have changed irreversibly,” she said. The government has also announced that it will extend flexible working hours on construction sites, and allow food deliveries to supermarkets over more time periods. Other measures include keeping the flexibility for pubs and restaurants to put up marquees to help increase seating capacity in a Covid-secure way."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5d671db88ad1ea4f8b3a01b02a80ebe14551e51a/0_171_2272_1362/master/2272.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=8a9cc678ced9c1fa87438fadf727f077","title":"uk government in talks over expanding covid travel red list","story":" understands that officials met on Friday to consider the case for taking a tougher approach. British residents and nationals returning from countries on the red list must quarantine in an airport hotel for 10 days at a cost of £1,750, while other arrivals are banned. It remains illegal to go on holiday. Ministers are expected to take a decision next week against the backdrop of rising Covid cases across parts of Europe. In the UK, the case rate per 100,000 people for the past two weeks is 114, according to data published by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. The same rates are far higher in large parts of the continent, with Poland on 716, France on 562 and Italy on 517. From Sunday, anyone travelling from France to Germany will have to submit a negative test and go into 10 days’ quarantine. One insider said: “It’s getting to the point where it’s not really sustainable to not respond to that.” They suggested there could be “quite a few additions” to the red list – which currently includes 35 countries including Brazil and the UAE – and that the threat of variants being imported and then being spread by community transmission was “definitely part of the thinking”. “It’s very different to last summer when it was just about cases,” they said. “We can’t have variants coming in that could potentially affect the vaccine rollout.” Official data published by the UK government on Thursday showed 412 cases of the variant first identified in South Africa had been found in the UK so far. This is the variant causing most anxiety among ministers because some studies have suggested it may be partially resistant to vaccines. A Department of Health and Social Care source said: “We’re keeping a very close eye on it … it is of concern, and that needs to be fed into all the other elements that need to be considered when you’re looking at the red list.” Other government sources played down the likelihood of changes to the red list, however, stressing in particular that close trade ties across the Channel would make a crackdown on France very difficult. Ministers are expected to announce increased testing of freight drivers arriving from France in the coming days in an attempt to reduce the risk of variants arriving by that route. Earlier this week Boris Johnson was pressed by the Labour MP Yvette Cooper on why tougher measures had not been taken to prevent the South African variant arriving. He said adding France to the red list was “something that we will have to look at” but underlined the difficulties of doing so. Government experts are confident that so far there is no widespread community transmission of the South African variant, with most cases traced back to travel. But concerns have intensified ahead of the next stage of the easing of Covid restrictions in England, which from Monday will allow more outdoor mixing and could let mutations spread more rapidly if they do take hold. At the beginning of March, Matt Hancock, the health secretary, resisted calls to add more countries to the red list despite news that the Brazil variant, which is believed to be more infectious, had been found in 15 more countries. At the time, he said that was because the proportion of variants of concern found in those countries relative to total cases was “exceptionally low”. But Johnson said this week that “on the continent right now you can see sadly there is a third wave under way”, and government figures are deliberating how to avoid it hitting UK shores. Ministers face a series of key decisions in the coming weeks on issues that were set aside when the roadmap was published – including whether holiday travel abroad can resume in the summer, from 17 May at the earliest. A global travel taskforce chaired by the transport secretary Grant Shapps is due to publish its first report on 5 April. Government sources say it is likely to set the framework for a resumption of some travel but may not yet set specific dates. One option is a three-tier traffic light system, segregating countries according to how prevalent Covid is and whether they have a vaccination certification system. A separate review chaired by the Cabinet Office minister, Michael Gove, is considering how the UK can introduce its own Covid certification system, which could be used to facilitate travel but also to control entry to venues such as pubs and sports stadiums. Hancock and Gove are both more cautious about reopening the borders in summer, according to colleagues, with the health secretary arguing that the tougher the UK’s travel restrictions are, the more relaxed the rules can be at home. “We need to think very carefully about it,” said an ally of Gove. A Downing Street source stressed that it remained illegal to go on holiday and as a result travel flows were still well below normal, and all arrivals had to show evidence of a negative test and must self-isolate."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f9232d51be7a9b2e56dd0c5f6428f3d3bc37c06b/0_240_4468_2680/master/4468.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=c5fcefa94cacf8d3e51f44aee15cc224","title":"coronavirus live news eu demands fair share of covid jabs us doubles vaccine target","story":"Since France began to impose new lockdowns in local regions last week to contain the spread of more contagious variants, the government has stuck with its stance to keep school closure as the last resort. Blanquer told reporters that keeping schools and colleges open in France remained a “fundamental goal” for the government. He said 148 schools out of 60,000 in the country were closed on Thursday.Britain has said it does not believe in imposing vaccine blockades and that the EU must allow Covid-19 vaccine contracts to be fulfilled.  “We need to achieve a relationship of cooperation with the United Kingdom so AstraZeneca fulfils its commitments, signed with the European Union, and everyone gets what they need,” Le Drian told France Info television in an interview. “But one cannot play like that, a kind of blackmail, where you wanted to vaccinate with all your might with the first dose and then you find yourself handicapped with the second doses. It*s not for Europe to bear the cost of this policy.” Le Drian said Britain had outstripped Europe with its inoculation rates by focussing on first doses, while Europe was administering both first and second doses.  The EU this week tightened its oversight of coronavirus vaccine exports, giving it more scope to block shipments to countries with higher inoculation rates. British foreign minister Dominic Raab hit back, accusing the European Commission of brinkmanship.It would be the first jab developed in the country to reach clinical testing, Reuters reports.  Sao Paulo Governor Joao Doria said the goal was to begin inoculations with the vaccine in July, an aggressive timeline even by the standards of the recent race for new Covid-19 shots. Butantan aims to produce 40 million doses of the new vaccine this year, called Butanvac, starting in May, officials said, aiming to help a sputtering national immunization program, which has done little to stop Brazil’s raging coronavirus outbreak. Doria told a news conference that Butanvac production will not interfere with the the state-funded institute’s partnership to produce and distibute a vaccine developed by China’s Sinovac Biotech Ltd. Butantan officials said the new vaccine had been designed to protect against the contagious P1 variant of the coronavirus, which emerged in the Amazon region last year and is fueling to a deadly second wave of cases overwhelming the hospitals.“The position stands that the benefits outweigh the risks,” Mariangela Simao, WHO assistant director-general, told a news conference, Reuters reports.  “It’s being investigated, a potential link to a very rare side-event ... which would happen (to) one in a million, is still being investigated by WHO and also by the European Medicines Agency and other regulatory agencies.”According to a paper from the Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Modelling, Operational sub-group (SPI-M-O), dated to 10 March, there are a number of considerations that need to be taken into account when weighing up whether asymptomatic Covid mass testing should be carried out at home or at assisted testing sites, including ease of access, accuracy of the results, the risk to others of an infected person leaving home and delays in the system. But they say, basic metrics are also needed for them to be able to estimate the impact on wider transmission of changes to testing strategies. Among them, the group say they would need to know the proportion of people who have symptoms and ask for a test who had previously been told to isolate as they’d been identified as a contact of a case the week before. “If NHS test and trace were able to collect and publish these and similar metrics, it would become clear how much impact the test-and-trace system is having on the spread of infection. Without such information, it is not possible to make robust calculations about the differential impact of small adjustments to the delivery of testing,” they write.The country’s health ministry said the daily tally of new infections rose to 23,987 from 23,696 on Thursday. Italy has registered 107,256 deaths linked to Covid-19 since its outbreak emerged in February last year. Patients in hospital with Covid-19 – not including those in intensive care – stood at on 28,472 on Friday, slightly increasing from 28,424 a day earlier.“Covax is ready to deliver but we can’t deliver vaccines we don’t have. Bilateral deals, export bans, and vaccine nationalism have caused distortions in the market with gross inequities in supply and demand,” Tedros told a news conference.  “Ten million doses is not much and it’s not nearly enough.”The number of new cases marks a slight drop from the 6,397 recorded on Thursday.  The daily deaths figure is up from the 63 recorded the day before although the overall trend has continued to fall.  Also 29.3 million people have now had a first dose of the vaccine, while 3 million have had a second dose. The regional governor, Vincenzo De Luca, said the deal will become effective once the shot’s use in Europe becomes authorised. “We have signed the contract after weeks of negotiations ... pending approval of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and the Italian regulator (AIFA),” said De Luca.  Campania, which includes Naples, is one of Italy’s most populated regions, with about 5.8 million residents. It has been among the worst affected areas since the pandemic took hold in February last year, with more than 320,000 confirmed cases.  “Once we have vaccinated our citizens, we will offer the shots we don’t need to the rest of Italy,” De Luca said.Magufuli was buried in Chato after nearly a week of mourning by crowds in various cities as his casket was moved around the country. Magufuli was hailed for his fight against corruption and massive infrastructure projects, but he achieved global notoriety in the final year of his life for his Covid denialism. Early in the pandemic, he halted the publication of coronavirus data in Tanzania and refused to take measures to halt the spread of the virus.  He famously claimed to have sent a laboratory five unlabelled samples for Covid testing – goat, motor oil, papaya, quail and jackfruit – and that four came back positive and one inconclusive.  Magufuli died aged 61 from what authorities say was a heart condition, after a mysterious absence of almost three weeks. Questions remain over the true cause of his death and Tanzanian opposition politicians claim he died from Covid-19.People arriving in Germany from countries included in the list must provide a negative coronavirus test no more than 48 hours old at the border. On top of that, they must also quarantine for 10 days, a period which can be shortened if they get a second negative test after five days.The prime minister, Mario Draghi, told a press conference on Friday:  The justice minister, Marta Cartabia, was preparing regulation, likely a decree, but the details have not yet been determined, Draghi said, according to AFP. His announcement came after the Liguria region’s president, Giovanni Toti, on Thursday called for a national law after at least 12 people were infected with coronavirus at two hospitals in the area due to two unvaccinated health workers. “In light of the need to protect citizens at a fragile time, such as hospitalisation, there may be the legal conditions, and also political, for a measure,” Toti said.

Since then, over 200,000 people have been diagnosed in the State, and more than 4,000 people have died.Globally, over 100 million people have been diagnosed and over 2.5\u0026nbspmillion have died since the virus was first identified in China in December 2019.NEWS AND UPDATES: - How many have been vaccinated here?Scientists have been racing to develop a vaccine that would bring an end to the pandemic, and there are now 64 different vaccines in clinical development, with another 173 in preclinical development, according to the World Health Organisation.Four of these have been authorised for use in the EU - one from AstraZeneca, one from BioNTech-Pfizer, one from Moderna and another from Johnson \u0026amp Johnson (Jannsen).The EU has put in place purchase agreements with Sanofi-GSK\u0026nbspand Curevac, and\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspis also in talks with two other vaccine producers - Novavax and Valneva. 193,548 had received their second dose.Some 178,289 of these vaccines had gone to people in long term residential care facilities, while 313,169 had gone to frontline healthcare workers and 206,911 had gone to people over the age of 70. Some\u0026nbsp10,689 people in Cohort 4 - those\u0026nbspaged between 16 and 69 at very high risk of severe Covid-19 disease - received a dose.\u0026nbspGlobally, over 450\u0026nbspmillion doses of a Covid-19 vaccine have been administered.But how do these other vaccines work, and when will they be approved for use here? Have there been any reported side effects? And when can you expect to receive a vaccine?The  Vaccine Tracker will be updated daily as the country embarks on the largest inoculation programme in the history of the State.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 70°C.EMA approval: Granted on December 21st.Overview: Developed by New York-based Pfizer and German company BioNTech this vaccine has a brand name of Comirnaty. It uses messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, which has instructions for producing a protein from Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. The person’s immune system recognises this protein as foreign and produces antibodies and activates T-cells (white blood cells) to attack it, giving them immunity. The vaccine will last for six months when stored at -70C, and five days when stored at between 2 and 8 degrees Celsius. The EU has approved the withdrawal of six doses from each vial.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, headache, muscle and joint pain, chills and fever. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 5.4 million doses by the end of 2021.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 20°C.EMA approval: Granted on January 6th.Overview: Developed by Boston-based company Moderna, this vaccine is manufactured for EU states at partner plants in Switzerland, France and Spain before being distributed across the continent. Like the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine, it uses mRNA technology to produce a Sars-CoV-2 protein, which the body then attacks to give immunity. It will last for up to six months when stored at - 20°C. The first Moderna vaccine was given in Ireland on January 16th.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, chills, fever, swollen or tender lymph nodes under the arm, headache, muscle and joint pain, nausea and vomiting. Less common was redness, hives and rash at the injection site. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 870,000 doses by the end of 2021.EMA approval: Granted on January 29th.Overview: The OxfordAstraZeneca vaccine was thought of as a potential game-changer because it can be transported and stored at 2 degrees to 8 degrees for up to six months, making it much easier to move around and administer. It is also much cheaper, costing about $3-4 per shot, compared with $20 for the PfizerBioNTech jab, with the former being made on a not-for-profit basis for the duration of the pandemic.It is based on a harmless chimp cold virus that cannot grow inside human cells. Scientists have tweaked this virus so that it carries genetic material containing the instructions for a protein of the coronavirus. Once the vaccine has been administered, our bodies produce the coronavirus protein, triggering an immune response.During the trial, a dosing error led to the serendipitous finding that when clinical trial participants were given half a dose followed by a full dose, the vaccine had a higher efficacy than when participants were given two full doses, with 90 per cent efficacy in the former case and 62 per cent efficacy in the latter. This led AstraZeneca to announce in November a new global trial of the vaccine with the half dosefull dose regime.In January, a bitter row broke out between the European Union and AstraZeneca after the pharmaceutical company drastically revised downwards the number of doses it could deliver the bloc. While talks continue on how to increase production, the company has now committed to a total of 40 million doses for the EU in the first quarter of 2021.While the EMA approved the use of this vaccine for all ages, doubt was cast over its efficacy in the over 65s due to the lack of data from Astrazeneca’s clinical trials in this cohort. As a result, Germany, Austria, Sweden, Poland and Belgium have opted not to approve this product for their older population.Following suit, Ireland has also decided to use the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine for the over 70s where possible, not the AstraZeneca jab, resulting in a significant reorganisation of our vaccination plans.On March 11th Norwegian health authorities said three health workers in Norway who had recently received the AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine were being treated in hospital for bleeding, blood clots and a low count of blood platelets.Norway halted the rollout of the AstraZeneca vaccine, following a similar move by Denmark. Iceland later followed suit.On Thursday, March 18th, the EMA announced it had found\u0026nbspno causal link between the vaccine and blood-clotting events and use of the vaccine\u0026nbspresumed on Saturday March 20th in Ireland.How many will Ireland get? 190,000 doses in February and a further 95,000 in early March - supply after this is not confirmed.Storage: Lasts for up to two years frozen at –20° C, and up to three months refrigerated at 2–8° C.EMA approval: Approved on March 11th.Overview: The EMA started a rolling review of this single dose vaccine from Janssen, the Belgium-based subsidiary of Johnson \u0026amp Johnson on December 1st .On January 29th the company announced the results of its Phase 3 trial: the vaccine had an efficacy of 72 per cent in the United States, 66 per cent in Latin America, and 57 per cent in South Africa.This vaccine uses double-stranded DNA to deliver a protein from the SARS-CoV-2 virus into the body, thereby creating immunity. It is different from others on the market in that it requires just one injection. The EU has agreed an initial contract for 200 million doses, with an option to buy 200 million more.On February 16th the company applied to the EMA for\u0026nbspseeking authorisation for its single-dose vaccine, and it was approved on March 11th.How many will Ireland get?\u0026nbsp2.2 million doses,\u0026nbsp600,000 between April and June.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: US company Novavax has developed a Covid-19 vaccine which stimulates an immune response by delivering spike proteins into the body. These spike-proteins are grown and harvested from insects. Similar technology is used in the production of vaccines for influenza and HPV. The European Commission has concluded exploratory talks with Novavax with a view to purchasing up to 200 million doses. The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 3rd.Overview: In September the EU signed a deal to purchase 300 million doses of this vaccine. It is based on the same technology as one of Sanofi’s seasonal influenza vaccines - more conventional than the mRNA used by Pfizer and Moderna - and it was thought it could play a big role in ending the pandemic. However, despite positive results from Phase 1 trials, news came in December that Phase 2 trial results showed an insufficient immune response in older adults. Phase III studies were expected to start in December, but the companies now plan to begin a phase 2b study in February with a different formulation of the vaccine. Even if their new formulation is successful, they do not expect the vaccine to be available until the end of 2021.Storage: Will last for at least 3 months at 2–8°C.Overview: The German company CureVac began its final Phase 3 trials in December, with results expected in the first quarter of 2021. It uses the same mRNA technology as the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines, but can be kept at normal refrigerator temperatures. The company has signed a deal with the EU to supply 405 million doses, pending regulatory approval.The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 12th.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: Valneva is a French company which has created a Covid-19 vaccine based on their Japanese encephalitis vaccine. It delivers a chemically inactivated coronavirus and uses an adjuvant (immunity booster) to create immunity. It entered clinical trials in December and expects to have its first results by April 2021. On January 12th the European Commission concluded exploratory talks with the company for the supply of 30 million doses, with the option to buy a further 30 million.When might you be vaccinated?In December the HSE published the provisional order in which people in Ireland will be vaccinated against Covid-19. After over-65s in care homes and frontline health workers, people aged 70 and older and other healthcare workers are next in line to receive the vaccine.\u0026nbspPeople aged 16-69 with very high risk conditions will then be\u0026nbspthe fourth cohort to be vaccinated.The next categories are: people aged 65-69 years an ill-defined group referred to as “key workers” and people aged 18-64 with certain medical conditions. Next up will be: those living or working in crowded conditions people working in education those aged 55-64 workers in other occupations important to the functioning of society people aged between 18 and 54 and, finally, pregnant women and those under 18.The vaccination of people aged over 85 began on Monday, February 15th. Those in the 70-84 age bracket should begin to receive their first dose by March 8th, alongside people aged 16-69 with very high risk conditions.The HSE has said everyone over the age of 70 should have received their second dose by mid-May.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4520425.1616709609!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"information available to government is mind boggling whistleblower","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tShane Corr is a senior civil servant at the Department of Health. Photograph: Screengrab from RTÉA whistleblower at the Department of Health has said it is “mind boggling” the information that is available to Government departments.Shane Corr, a senior civil servant at the Department of Health, has disclosed to RTÉ’s Prime Time programme how the department has been secretly using information from doctor consultations to build and maintain dossiers on children with autism who were involved in historic legal actions against the State.The dossiers, which include the sensitive medical and educational information of children involved in long-dormant court cases, are believed to have been built and maintained over a number of years by the Department of Health without the knowledge or consent of parents.Mr Corr told the programme he made protected disclosures to his superiors highlighting the existence of detailed sensitive files being held on legal cases and was later told an external investigator’s report raised no concerns.“It is mind boggling the information that’s available to Government departments and how they use it in this case is frankly shocking,” he said.Mr Corr said he first became concerned when in the course of his work he came across documents concerning the treatment of vulnerable people, including a template letter indicating there was a particular approach to litigating Special Education Needs cases known as SENS.“I saw something that frankly I can only describe as shocking. I saw an email from an official at the Department of Health to a doctor who is working for the HSE explaining that they were involved in litigation with one of her patients and asking for information from this doctor,” Mr Corr said.Mr Corr said the reply from the department was “no, we haven’t informed, we haven’t informed the patient, we haven’t informed the parents and we’re not going to. We don’t ask for consent.”“This is standard practice when we’re running a case, litigating case, we ring HSE units around the country and we ask for information, any information that might be helpful to the case.”The department received a lengthy clinical evaluation the following day detailing the child’s struggles, according to RTÉ, while the family’s underlying legal action had been dormant for 10 years.Mr Corr also said he saw “several notes relating to alcoholism within the family structure”.“I saw notes related to siblings of the children. They weren’t relevant. Every type of family information was there...whether the child is prone to violent acts towards its parents, its siblings, its teachers, its doctor. Everything that you would not want to know about the family living beside you, it was there,” he said.Mr Corr said the files were not part of his work but could be accessed, searched and viewed by anybody working in the department’s ision dealing with the likes of older people, social care and disability policies.“All of this information was contained on a folder within the Department filing system,” he said. “I had my own password to get into the system, my own account. After that I went onto Win Explorer, I typed in the key words that I was looking for which would be generally ‘children’, ‘disabilities’, maybe ‘litigation’, and all of these documents were there. I mean they were just as available as if they had been paper documents sitting in a file beside me.”Mr Corr said on one child’s record there was a video from the HSE in which the child was in an extremely distressed state.“This information should not be there,” he said. Mr Corr described the video as “one of the most distressing things I’ve ever seen”.“It’s a child literally breaking down. A video of a child and it’s in the folders of this litigation unit,” he added.Department of HealthIn a statement, the Department of Health said it was made aware of the RTÉ investigation last year and initiated an independent review of its practices.On Thursday evening, the department moved to reassure parents, families and other interested parties that it “never unlawfully held sensitive medical and educational information of children involved in dormant court cases”.In a statement issued just hours before the programme aired, it said it was conscious of the “impact that these headlines will have on affected families”.It has undertaken to engage with stakeholders in the coming days to address any concerns.After being made aware of the programme last year, the Department said it commissioned an unnamed senior counsel to carry out a review, which was completed in November and which identified no breaches of data protection law.“The review found that information contained on relevant files managed by the Department is consistent with, and typical of, the sort of information which arises in such litigation. The examination also found no basis to suggest wrongdoing arising from the information contained,” it said.The Department of Health did not respond immediately to a request for a copy of its independent report.Health Service ExecutiveThe HSE said it lawfully shares information with the Department of Health on a range of issues, including the provision of health services to children with special education needs.“It is normal practice for defendants to litigation to share information, and we do so from time to time to assist in the management of certain High Court cases taken against the State,” it said in a statement it first released to RTÉ.“Furthermore the HSE regularly provides anonymised information to the Department of Health regarding ongoing legal cases, specifically in relation to the Disability Act.”The HSE told RTÉ that, in relation to the alleged breach of confidentiality, it was “unable thus far to identify incidents that fit the not very specific description given” by the broadcaster.“We would not knowingly share personal information in breach of doctorpatient confidentiality or otherwise unlawfully, and we take our obligations in this regard very seriously,” it said, requesting the ability to respond to any specific allegation before the programme went to air"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4520775.1616783473!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"martin seeks review of department s gathering of dossiers on children","story":"\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t                                                            Shane Corr, a senior civil servant with the department of health made a protected disclosure as a whistleblower. Photograph: Screen grab from RTÉThe Taoiseach has asked Ministers to set up a team to examine issues raised by an investigation which revealed the Department of Health’s maintained dossiers of sensitive information on children with autism who were involved in legal actions against the State.The dossiers, which include the sensitive medical and educational information of children involved in long-dormant court cases, are believed to have been built and maintained over a number of years by the Department of Health without the knowledge or consent of parents.Shane Corr, a senior civil servant at the department, told the programme he made protected disclosures to his superiors highlighting the existence of detailed sensitive files being held on legal cases and was later told an external investigator’s report raised no concerns. “It is mind boggling the information that’s available to Government departments and how they use it in this case is frankly shocking,” he said.Robert Watt, the interim Secretary General of the Department of Health, said he wanted to reassure all parents, families and interested parties that the department has never unlawfully held sensitive medical and educational information of children involved in dormant court cases.“We take the allegations made last night extremely seriously and the Taoiseach has today announced that a multi-disciplinary team will now be formed to consider the issues raised with the aim of understanding fully what happened here,” Mr Watt said.The spokesman said the Taoiseach was consulting the Ministers for Health, Children and Education, and the Minister of State with responsibility for Disability, with a view to setting up “a multi-disciplinary team” to consider the issues.“This is with the aim of understanding fully what happened here and also to ensure a proper policy framework and guidelines for the future.“Above all, confidentiality in relation to a child’s medical and educational needs must always be protected.“The fundamental role of the State is to advocate for the child and to ensure that the State provides services and facilities to children to enable their full development and potential to be realised.HSE director general Paul Reid has said the organisation will investigate the issues that emerged from the investigation.Trust must be the cornerstone of the health service, Mr Reid told RTÉ radio’s Morning Ireland. Nothing could be right about the sharing of sensitive information inappropriately, he added. “If it has been done we will get to the bottom of it.”On the same programme the Children’s Ombudsman, Niall Muldoon said that while the actions of the Department of Health may have been lawful, they were “absolutely not” appropriate.It was not appropriate that private information was being gathered solely with the purpose of putting pressure on families to drop legal cases, he said.Mr Muldoon added that he was concerned that such actions were systemic as the files remained open for years through different staff.The actions of the Department of Health were an abuse of power, he said and he wanted to know if similar actions had happened in other cases involving children, maternity cases or school issues.Minister of State for Education Josepha Madigan defended her department’s role in the controversy. Information relating to children’s schooling was also collected including school reports and psychological assessment. Ms Madigan, who has responsibility for disability, said in the Seanad that her department “is not aware of any instance of inappropriate sharing of information, nor does it take lightly any decision to defend cases concerning children with special educational needs and the rights of the child to an appropriate education under the Constitution. She said the “needs of the child and a desire to act in the child’s best interests are always to the fore in the making of any such decision”. Ms Madigan told Green Party Senator Pauline O’Reilly that “in defence of any legal proceedings, it is appropriate for the department to engage with relevant State bodies and the school or educational establishment in which the litigant is a pupil to understand fully and appreciate the education provision on offer. This is to ensure that any alleged deficiencies in provision can be appropriately considered and, in many cases, to look at what further supports might need to be provided.”Seanad leader Regina Doherty said the Upper House would on Monday debate the issues around the documentary. The Department of Health has not yet confirmed which Minister will attend for the discussion.Earlier, Sinn Féin health spokesman David Cullinane called for Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly to stop the practice of gathering information on children with special needs and their families. Mr Cullinane also said the new current secretary general of the department Robert Watt and former secretary general Jim Breslin should attend before the Oireachtas health committee which meets on Friday afternoon in private session.He also said they had to find out “who knew what and when” and this also involved former ministers for health Simon Harris and Leo Varadkar and other senior civil servants. Mr Varadkar told the Dáil on Thursday he was minister a number of years ago and “I don’t have any personal recollection of this at all”.Sinn Féin finance spokesman Pearse Doherty on Thursday called for an inquiry similar in scope and duration to the Scally inquiry into the cervical cancer screening programme, which should investigate the roles of the Departments of Health and Education and the HSE.Mr Cullinane told reporters “the very first that needs to happen is for full disclosure that the families of those children with special needs are informed of exactly what information was stored on these data bases in relation to their child”.Meanwhile, the deputy chief executive of autism charity As I Am, Fiona Ferris, said questions needed to be answered “internally and externally” about the actions of the department. This was “yet another breach of trust”.The actions of the department would raise concerns for families and would make them question their trust in the team working with their children.There was a need for a full legal review along with an examination of the culture and ethics surrounding the action, she said.ReviewThe Department of Health has said it was made aware of the RTÉ investigation last year and initiated an independent review of its practices.On Thursday evening, the department moved to reassure parents, families and other interested parties that it “never unlawfully held sensitive medical and educational information of children involved in dormant court cases”.In a statement issued just hours before the programme aired, it said it was conscious of the “impact that these headlines will have on affected families”.It has undertaken to engage with stakeholders in the coming days to address any concerns."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4520420.1616752307!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"search the data how is covid 19 spreading in your local area","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTullamore was one of five locations in the country where walk-in testing centres opened in an attempt to locate and understand asymptomatic spread patterns. File photograph: GettyCovid-19 infection rates in Tullamore, Co Offaly, have surged again with the town remaining the worst location in Ireland for virus spread, according to new data.Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) statistics measuring 14-day-incidence rates of infection, published on Thursday, shows the midlands town had 754.5 cases per 100,000 people as of last Monday.That is more than five times the national average of 158 detected across the country’s local electoral areas.Tullamore topped the poll last week as well but at that stage its infection rate was 484 per 100,000. The 56 per cent increase in just one week illustrates the challenges being faced in the region.Tullamore was one of five locations in the country where walk-in testing centres were opened in a bid by health authorities to try to locate and understand asymptomatic spread patterns.The spiralling rates in the town are also contextualised by the second highest region for 14-day-incidences – Buncrana, Co Donegal – which stood at 518.6.After those two, only Roscrea and Templemore in Co Tipperary breached the 400 mark with a rate of 409.8.Other locationsThat means that of the total 166 electoral areas contained in the HPSC round up, Tullamore now has infection rates of at least twice those of 160 other locations.The worst 10 locations in the country, where per 100,000 rates fell between that 755 high water mark and 349, also included Navan, Co Meath (395.1) Balbriggan, Co Dublin (391) Edenderry, Co Offaly (377.3) Ballymun-Finglas, Dublin (369) Tallaght-South, Dublin (366.6) Ongar, Dublin (365.6) and Longford (349).On the very other end of the table lies Kenmare, Co Kerry.

File photograph: PAThe British government’s latest guidance on flying of the union flag in England, Scotland and Wales has prompted unionist politicians to call for the standard to be flown year round on government buildings in Northern Ireland.Unionists also have linked the flags issue to the Northern Ireland protocol. This has led to an Irish Sea border and the disruption of trade from Britain to the North.On Wednesday the British government called on all local councils to fly the union flag on civic buildings as a sign of British national identity. This was part of an initiative to promote the union of Britain and Northern Ireland.The guidance, however, does not apply to Northern Ireland where the union flag flies over government buildings on about 20 designated days annually.At the end of 2012 and through 2013 Northern Ireland and Belfast in particular was subjected to serious loyalist violence, protests and business disruption after Belfast City Council voted that the flag should fly over city hall on the designated days and not all-year round.DUP Lagan Valley MP Jeffrey Donaldson said on Thursday that flying the ensign 365 days a year over British government buildings should be extended to Northern Ireland.“Many will see it as bizarre that the UK government is only deciding in 2021 to fly the union flag, the flag of our nation, on all government buildings every day. When I visit other nations around the world, flying the national flag on government buildings is commonplace,” he said.Mr Donaldson added that if the British government “wanted to immediately improve the union they would start with the removal of the protocol”.The Traditional Unionist Voice (TUV) party also called for the flag to fly every day over government buildings.Meanwhile unionists, as they had threatened, launched a legal action aimed at scrapping the protocol. They also started a crowdfunding appeal to help pay for the actionwhich is being taken by a coalition of pro-union politicians such as DUP leader and First Minister Arlene Foster, former Ulster Unionist first minister David (Lord) Trimble and former Labour MP Kate (Baroness) Hoey.Ms Foster said the DUP would work with other unionists to send a “united message to our government and to free Northern Ireland from the protocol. We cannot allow our United Kingdom to be ripped apart and our UK internal market to be ided in order to protect the single market of the EU.”Lord Trimble said he joined in the action “because Northern Ireland’s place as an integral part of the United Kingdom is at stake. Extensive parts of Northern Ireland – much of its economic fabric – have been turned into a colony of the European Union. ”UUP leader Steve Aiken said the “protocol fundamentally undermines the integrity of the United Kingdom, the Belfast Agreement and the principle of consent”.TUV leader Jim Allister said the “protocol annexes Northern Ireland into the EU, leaving us subject to laws we did not make and cannot change”.Baroness Hoey said she was “not prepared to allow those living in Northern Ireland to be treated as second-class citizens of our own country – the UK”.Former Brexit Party MEP Ben Habib said the UK was “the only country in history to have voluntarily partitioned itself. We must not rest until the protocol is ended.

Video: EU Commission\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tCommission president Ursula von der Leyen: “The EU needs to ensure Europeans get a fair share of vaccines.”  Photograph: Getty ImagesThe European Union has exported more vaccine doses than have been administered to citizens within the bloc, according to new figures, with the lion’s share going to the UK. The bloc has received 88 million doses, of which 62 million have so far been given out, new figures released by the European Commission (EC) showed, while it has exported 77 million doses across the world, including to North and South America, Africa, Asia, Australia and New Zealand.However, the largest portion of 21 million doses went to shore up the UK’s vaccination campaign, according to an EU official, a figure that would make up the bulk of the roughly 30 million doses so far given out in Britain.The figures were released as the bloc prepares to tighten export controls on vaccines to allow member states or the EC refuse export permits for shipments that are going to countries with a higher vaccination rate than the EU or which are not exporting to the bloc in turn.“The EU needs to ensure Europeans get a fair share of vaccines,” said commission president Ursula von der Leyen.While doses have been exported from the EU to both the US and the UK, leaders have accused both London and Washington of imposing de facto bans on vaccine exports in the other direction.The proposals to tighten EU export controls are contentious, with Ireland among a group of member states which have expressed concerns that it could risk retaliatory action by other countries and jeopardise complex international supply chains.However, proponents argue that the threat of curbs should be enough to get results, particularly in strong-arming pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca into delivering orders after it drastically fell behind. OutputEU talks on vaccines are ongoing with London, and are expected to be held weekly with Washington as the world vies over a limited but growing output of Covid-19 vaccines.Overall, even with the drastic AstraZeneca shortfalls accounted for, the EU is due to receive enough vaccines to fully inoculate about 255 million people by the end of June or 70 per cent of the bloc’s adult population, with the doses distributed proportionally among member states. In Ireland, where the population is younger than the European average, the quota goes further to cover roughly 78 per cent of adults by that point.

Photograph:  Julien Behal PhotographyPA WireThe “eyes and interest” of the United States continue to “make a difference at a delicate time” for post-Brexit Northern Ireland, Taoiseach Micheál Martin has said.Speaking at a virtual meeting of the traditional Friends of Ireland St Patrick’s Day event, Mr Martin told Irish-American politicians that there has been “deep appreciation of the importance of the balances and nuances” of Northern Ireland’s Belfast Agreement in Washington since Brexit.This was “an appreciation that we do not take for granted”, the Taoiseach said in an address that touched on the tensions caused by Brexit in the North and between the EU and UK.Mr Martin said the Government always knew that the UK’s departure from the EU would “create strains and complications, especially in Northern Ireland”, and that the “voices” of Irish-American politicians within the caucus “helped pave the way” for the Brexit withdrawal deal.The Northern Ireland protocol within that agreement was “an agreed, balanced compromise” and was “the only way” to manage complexities in Northern Ireland and to avoid a hard border.“Implementing the protocol involves change and sometimes it takes time for people to adjust to new ways of doing things. The protocol has only been in operation since the start of the year,” Mr Martin said.“I have always known that there would inevitably be bumps and wrinkles along the way. That is why the agreement itself contains mechanisms through which any difficulties can be resolved.” For the protocol to succeed and deliver benefits for the people of Northern Ireland, there has to be a relationship between the UK and the EU “based on trust and good faith”, he said, in a reference to the tensions over the UK government’s decision to delay border checks for British businesses.Proud memberIn a video address, US president Joe Biden said that he was a proud member of the Friends of Ireland caucus when he was a US senator and paid tribute to his former colleagues who “tended to the flame of Irish-American relationships – a flame that glows ever brighter every single day”.Democratic congressman Richie Neal, a co-chair of the Friends of Ireland group, said in his online remarks that the 1998 Belfast Agreement underpinning the Northern Ireland peace process “remains the only way forward on the island of Ireland – there is simply no plan B”. Mr Biden quoted his favourite poet Seamus Heaney and his poem The Cure at Troy, which he has quoted in public for years, saying: “We have a chance to make hope and history rhyme.” The Friends of Ireland caucus of Irish-American politicians marks its 40th anniversary this year. Normally the Taoiseach would attend the Friends of Ireland St Patrick’s Day lunch alongside the president at the US Capitol – one of only two occasions in Washington’s political calendar when the president travels to Capitol Hill – but the Covid-19 pandemic forced the event online.

Photograph: Antonio MasielloGetty ImagesA string of new manufacturing sites involved in the production of AstraZeneca, Moderna and Pfizer Covid-19 vaccines were added to the European Union’s supply chain on Friday and rules for the transport of some doses were eased, in a boost to the continent’s supply and rollout of doses.A manufacturing site for AstraZeneca vaccines run by contractor Halix in Leiden in the Netherlands was approved by the European Medicines Agency (EMA), after a long wait for the company to submit its application.This will “bring the total number of manufacturing sites licensed for the production of the active substance of the vaccine to four”, the EMA announced.In addition, a new manufacturing site in the German city of Marburg was approved for Cominarty, the BioNTech-Pfizer vaccine, which will produce “both active substance and the finished product”.The EMA has also approved a new manufacturing site involved in the production process of Moderna’s Covid-19 vaccine in Visp in Switzerland. “The addition of the new manufacturing lines . . . together with other changes to the manufacturing processes that were greenlighted by the Committee are intended to scale-up production capacity and increase supply of the vaccine for the EU market,” the regulator said.The approval of the Halix site in the Netherlands followed a long wait for AstraZeneca to submit an application to approve the plant for EU production. Vaccine manufacturing sites must be approved by the EMA and certified to be “capable of consistently producing high-quality vaccines according to agreed specifications”, which involves submitting evidence and being inspected by local authorities.Officials say AstraZeneca has not explained why it waited until this week to apply for EU authorisation, but there are suspicions that this was a tactic to juggle competing international orders, as its production could not be delivered to the EU without the permit.The Dutch plant is now a focus in intense negotiations between London and Brussels over vaccine supply chains after the bloc announced it would tighten vaccine export controls to prioritise unmet EU orders over exports.Alongside the announcement of new manufacturing sites, the EMA announced an easing of guidelines for the transport of Pfizer vaccines that should help the speed of rollout across the continent, which was previously limited by the availability of special freezer storage.Vials of Pfizer vaccines can safely be transported at at the standard pharmaceutical freezer temperature of -25 to -15 degrees for a one-off period of two weeks, rather than always needing to be stored and transported at -90 to -60 degrees in special freezers, the EMA announced.“It is expected to facilitate the rapid rollout and distribution of the vaccine in the EU by reducing the need for ultra-low temperature cold storage conditions throughout the supply chain,” the medical regulator said in a statement.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"world view israel s election leaves netanyahu needing unlikely allies","story":"The \u0027 unrivalled foreign affairs coverage, now brought to you in weekly podcast form.

It wasn’t a real press conference, but it was a revealing piece of reality television. Biden campaigned as a return to normality. But this episode from a slo-mo Truman Show is anything but. The number of questioners was restricted, ostensibly due to Covid-19 regulations. The questions were known in advance: on Thursday morning, Americans with nothing better to do could read in newspapers and on websites which journalist was going to ask what question.Biden knew what was coming. He even knew the sequence of the questions. We watched as he slowly ummed and aahed his way out of one question and into the next, looking for the list of journalists’ names as he shuffled his notes and cue cards like a retired quizmaster.There were four conservatives among the thirty reporters. Biden took a question from the Wall Street Journal but, somehow, Fox News, Newsmax and Sinclair weren’t on his dance card. Some of the questions were base flattery, but a few hit home. You could tell when they had: Biden didn’t answer the question, but slipped into one of his default mode, mostly misty reveries about the past, with sudden and inappropriate outbursts of anger.Asked about human rights in China, he ducked his head and slurred through a prepared script. Asked about his promise to tighten the gun laws, he delivered a rheumy soliloquy about infrastructure. He blamed Donald Trump for the humanitarian crisis on the southern border, and described Trump’s policies as his own. He agreed that the Senate filibuster was “a relic of Jim Crow”, then shrugged about getting rid of it and shouted that the Republicans were “sick, sick”.Press conferences are one of the phenomena that the historian Daniel J. Boorstin called “pseudo-events”. They are staged to look like news, but their real purpose is to attract and distract the media. Trump made the press conference the real event by giving it his utmost. Biden, by his absence from the ritual, made the press conference into the news in his own way. And now his inept surrender to the ritual will become the plotline of the new series.Trump raised the hollow trick of the press conference to a minor art. He enjoyed the back-and-forth, and he accelerated the exchanges like a boxer. Trump wasn’t afraid of a roomful of almost entirely hostile journalists. Biden’s team are afraid of a roomful of almost entirely friendly journalists. They don’t trust him to hold a conversation on an open mike. It’s not hard to see why.Asked about the Democratic left’s proposals to dispense with the filibuster, Biden freestyled, and broke out into exuberant gibberish:“I have never been poor at calculating how to get things done in the United States Senate periods of the best way to get something done, if you hold near and dear to you that you like to be able to… anyway.”His head dropped, as if he was looking for a cue card that wasn’t there. “We are ready to get a lot done,” he said after a pause, his voice low and pleading, “and if we have to, if there is a complete lockdown and chaos as a result of the filibuster, then we’ll have to go beyond what I’m talking about. Okay, hang on… uh… sorry.”The transcript is about as exciting as a pinocle tournament in a seniors’ home, but the drama of Biden’s delivery is gripping. He can spin out at any moment. Even on a good day, he gets a faraway look in his eyes. Or he simply goes quiet in the middle of a sentence with a look of a man who’s realising that he’s eaten something funny.Biden waited 64 days, the longest  in modern Presidential history, before holding his first press conference. If his absence had only occasioned a chorus of ridicule and outrage from the right, he might never had held one at all: the Democrats regard conservative media and the Republicans as Marie Antoinette regarded the peasants.It was the grumbling from the left that forced him onto the dais on Thursday. He scraped by, for now. Soon, he’ll have to undergo another ordeal by camera. Sooner or later, he’ll fail to meet it, however soft the questions are and however much he reads from cue cards. And then “uh… sorry” won’t cut it – not with Xi, not with Putin, and not with Kamala Harris.We were told that reality television politics was over when Trump left office, but they’re not. Biden’s torture is this season’s plotline. The twist will be that it’ll be the Democrats who pull the plug. They’ll give him a cue card for that too.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"cheese making french monks prayers answered emergency lockdown","story":"A French monastery in deepest Burgundy launched an emergency online sale Friday to empty its cellars of 4,000 of its prized cheeses after a sudden drop in demand last year due to the coronavirus crisis.And their prayers appear to have been answered with the sale a roaring success.In normal times, it can be hard to get hold of one of the semi-soft cheeses that the Trappist monks at the Citeaux abbey just south of Dijon have been producing since 1925. It  won silver medal at last year’s prestigious international food and drink competition in Lyon.Most go to restaurants or intrepid cheese lovers who make the pilgrimage to their shop at the birthplace of the Cistercian Catholic.Normally we turn down orders. We are sold in Hong Kong, Tokyo, Dubai, brother Jean-Claude, in charge of marketing at the monastery founded in 1098, told AFP.However, with restaurants closed since October, the abbey found itself with 4,000 cheeses on its hands - the equivalent of 2.8 tons.We tried explaining to our 75 cows that they needed to produce less milk but they don\u0027t seem to have understood, said Jean-Claude.Our sales are down nearly 50 percent, he said. We need to clear out our stock.So the monks teamed with the internet start-up Divine Box, which sells products made by abbeys in France and elsewhere, with a goal of selling at least a ton of cheese by Tuesday.The minimum order is two wheels at €23 (£20), plus shipping.By Friday evening, the flash sale appeared to have gone ballistic with some 1.6 tons already sold.We\u0027re going to make it, said Jean-Claude.The monks are not the only cheese-makers to fall foul of Covid.Shortly after lockdown commenced a year ago, a string of producers pleaded with the French to do their national duty and buy cheese or see tons of the stuff go to waste.Figures on Friday from FranceAgriMer and Kantar suggest the French partially heeded the call as they bought 8 per cent more cheese in 2020 compare to the previous year.Mozzarella saw the steepest rise in demand among major cheese categories, with a 21 per cent volume jump.Meanwhile, Emmental was the top seller with 164,500 tons sold, followed by camembert, on 48,500 tons and raclette, famed for melting over potatoes alongside charcuterie on cold winter evenings - up 12 per cent.“Families had to cook more at home, which explains the high rise in ingredient cheeses (mozzarella, Emmental, compté etc),” said FranceAgriMer.However, other niche cheeses destined for restaurants appear to have suffered.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"frank skinner people like hear demons not believe actual demons","story":"There are many ways for those in the public eye to bare their souls, some raw, some cringeworthy, and some where you fear for their sanity. But publishing a prayer book is arguably in a different league, especially when you are Frank Skinner, the best-known face of the Nineties’ “lad mag” generation.It is tempting, with A Comedian’s Prayer Book being published on April Fool\u0027s Day, to suspect that the man whose first love remains stand-up is playing it for laughs in time for Easter. But, no. Inside its covers are a series of highly personal, unguarded monologues by Skinner, directed to a silent God, with the reader invited to eavesdrop.In them, Skinner ponders – as a believer – on the nature of faith, on the fate of his beloved late mother, Doris, between heaven and hell, on the Holy Trinity (imagined as X-Men), and on why TK Maxx sells statues of a smiling, seated Buddha but not crucifixes of a dying Jesus.Though Skinner also talks about being a practising Catholic who daily reads the Bible, there is nothing pious in the tone. Instead, he often raises a laugh – a first for any prayer book, in my experience.But it is simultaneously deadly serious and seriously brave. “Doing God” in our secular, sceptical age is usually taken to risk career meltdown. Yet here is 64-year-old Skinner casting caution to the wind and coming out publicly when he admits that in his own comedycelebrity world over three decades, he has only met enough fellow believers “to fill a Vauxhall Corsa”.The gospel quotation may sound a bit harsh as I write it down, but Skinner does have form when it comes to talking candidly in public about what had previously been private. Indeed, he made his name in the mid-1990s in TV shows like Fantasy Football League by singing “Three Lions” and sharing locker-room chat with David Baddiel about women and sex, which attracted and repelled viewers in equal measure, usually along gender lines.He can’t quite remember why he agreed to do the book but, as he points out, it hasn’t come quite out of the blue. “When I was doing interviews 25 years ago, I would talk about how I read poetry and had two English degrees, and that I was a Roman Catholic, but it never made it into print.”Skinner grew up in the 1960s as the youngest of four children in a working-class home near West Bromwich in the Midlands (he still supports the local team). Back then, he was Chris Collins, but when later he came to sign on with Equity someone else was already using that name, so he opted for “Frank Skinner”, after a member of his dad’s dominoes’ team.Catholicism was, he recalls, a big part of family life, and his education – “statue-kissing, entrail-centric saint depictions and skeletons in bridal veils” is one description he uses in the book. He left the Church at 17.But he couldn’t let it go. The next 12 years were spent reading theology from what he now refers to as anti-Catholic books, but he quietly rejoined the flock when a sympathetic priest listened to his doubts and urged him: “Just come back.”By that time, he was working as a teacher. He had been thrown out of secondary school, picked up his education again at an adult learning centre, and got a degree in English from Birmingham Poly and a Masters from Warwick.The return to faith coincided roughly with his decision to stop drinking when he found himself downing sherry for breakfast. Were the two linked? “I really don’t know the answer to that. Heavy drinking and Catholicism are not necessarily mutually exclusive.”Drink, he suggests, had changed his personality. “In a way, I achieved a white heat of happiness in drink that I have never achieved in sobriety. I was quite a solitary child and, as a drunken adult, I was extremely gregarious. And then when I stopped drinking, I steadily retreated into myself.”In private, perhaps, but he also chucked in the day job and started doing comedy, winning the coveted Perrier Award in 1991 at the Edinburgh Festival. It paved his way into television. Apart from those overlooked references to journalists about his beliefs at the time, though, there were few hints in anything he did – including an eponymous chat show – that Skinner would one day write a prayer book.He turned his back on television in 2005, to refocus on stand-up, and in the middle of a long tour recalls how he decided to shake up his act by leaving out the swear words. It wasn’t, he stresses, a moral thing.“I don’t have any problem with what we used to call effing and jeffing. The gags just worked better without those words. But I do wince,” he adds, “and this happened to me yesterday in the street, every time I hear anyone say, ‘Jesus Christ!’“This is the age to be offended,” he continues. “If you are not being offended, then you are an unfashionable inidual. I’m not one of the anti-woke people who go round complaining that you can’t say anything now. In a way, I think the woke movement has done a lot of things that I wish religion in general had done.”Yet woke-ness doesn’t always seem so keen to protect religious beliefs when they are attacked, whether those of a Catholic like him who doesn’t like to hear the Lord’s name taken in vain, or Muslim parents at Batley Grammar School, angry this week that a teacher showed their children images of the Prophet Muhammad, forbidden in Islam.Should anything be taboo? “There are things that should,” he replies, “but I don’t think they are anything to do with being un-woke.”There is an irony here because this is the same Frank Skinner who used to be as unwoke as possible in his on-screen chats with comedian David Baddiel. It is a measure of how much he has changed. “At the time,” he explains, “I was very much the working-class lad, which was a large part of my personality. I was having lots of sex and it was at the centre of my being, in many ways. It isn’t now.”Since 2003, he has shared his life in Hampstead, north-west London with Cathy Mason, a comedy agent. Together, they have an eight-year-old son, Buzz – “who trails more ‘clouds of glory’ than anyone I know”, as he puts it when dedicating the prayer book to him.Skinner has returned to telly, most recently to Sky Arts for Boswell and Johnson’s Scottish Road Trip. His Saturday morning show on Absolute Radio has won many awards, and – Covid permitting – he is still touring, due to get underway again with postponed dates in June.“One of the difficult things,” he muses, “is to bring the audience with you when you decide to change.” And then corrects himself. “It’s not that you decide to change, you just change.”The resulting challenge of adapting is, he suggests, one place where prayer comes in. “When I pray, it is the only conversation I have where I utterly drop my guard about every doubt and fear and idiocy and imperfection. If I didn’t pray, I don’t know where I’d find that unwrapping of myself.”A Comedian’s Prayer Book by Frank Skinner (Hodder Faith, £9.99) is out now. £8.99 at books.telegraph, or call 0844 871 1514.

The landmark ruling prompted the NHS to immediately pause new referrals for hormone treatment. But on Friday Mrs Justice Lieven concluded that the parents of a 15-year-old girl taking puberty blockers retain the parental right to consent to that treatment.The teenager, identified only as XY, was born a boy but lives as a girl. She began puberty blocker treatment before last year’s ruling on the basis that she was able to consent to the treatment herself. But that view had been cast into doubt, prompting the court to this week decide whether XY\u0027s parents could continue to consent to the treatment on her behalf.Mrs Justice Lieven concluded that, whether or not XY is considered legally competent to make the decision about puberty blockers, her parents can. The judge said: They are adults with full capacity and, as the people who know their child best and care for them the most, will be in a position to reach a fully informed decision.The evidence strongly suggests that XY\u0027s parents have fully considered these matters and come to a careful and informed decision. The gravity of the decision to consent to puberty blockers is very great, but it is no more enormous than consenting to a child being allowed to die.Equally, the essentially experimental nature of puberty blockers should give any parent pause for thought, but parents can and do routinely consent on their child\u0027s behalf to experimental treatment, sometimes with considerable, including life-changing, potential side-effects.The girl\u0027s mother said in a witness statement that she had done extensive research on puberty blockers before her daughter started taking them and was fully aware of the potential side-effects.Cases where there is a disagreement between clinicians, or concern that parents are being pressured by their children to consent, should be brought to court, the judge said.Mrs Justice Lieven was one of the three judges who last year ruled in favour of Keira Bell over whether children can consent to the use of puberty blockers.Ms Bell, who began taking puberty blockers when she was 16, later detransitioned to her birth sex. She brought legal action against the Tavistock and Portman NHS Foundation Trust, which runs the UK\u0027s only gender identity development service, arguing that children cannot properly consent to taking puberty blockers.The High Court ruled in Ms Bell\u0027s favour in December, concluding that children under 16 need to understand the immediate and long-term consequences of the treatment to be able to consent to the use of puberty blockers.Mrs Justice Lieven said the key difference between XY and Ms Bell\u0027s case is that parents are generally in a position to understand and consider what is in the best interests of their child.The judge added that the use of puberty blockers for children with gender dysphoria raises unique and highly controversial ethical issues and the ision of clinical and ethical views has become highly polarised.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"pictures day bulldog blues little lions lunch","story":"This bloated-looking lion cub may have been realising its eyes were bigger than its belly, as it stretched out on a termite hill in an attempt to digest a large helping of zebra in Kenya\u0027s Masai Mara national parkSchool trips can resume from April 12 as organisers say they will boost children\u0026#39s mental healthAmazon \u0026#39knew delivery drivers were urinating in bottles\u0026#39 despite claims to contraryCoronavirus latest news: Global jabs pass 500 million as Europe vaccine feuds deepenFriday evening UK news briefing: Alex Salmond returns with new Alba Scottish independence party  How Boris Johnson went from threatening to eat ID card to opening door to pub Covid passports Special report: Sturgeon clings to tarnished crown after inquiries ‘lift lid on the sewer’ of SNP politicsDemocrat arrested for protesting restrictive new Georgia voting law Parents of trans children can consent to puberty blockers on their behalf, High Court rulesFrance warns Britain against trying to \u0026#39blackmail\u0026#39 EU before vaccine crunch talksPolice officers are victims in almost half of all hate crime prosecutionsFrank Skinner: \u0026#39People like to hear about my demons – but not that I believe in actual demons\u0026#39French monks\u0026#39 prayers answered as emergency lockdown cheese sale takes offCovid lockdown roadmap: the key dates for when restrictions will end and what rules will changeWhat you can and can\u0026#39t do from March 29 as lockdown rules start easingMother of black sisters stabbed to death says police did not give killing same attention as Sarah Everard case Growing calls to limit German chancellors to two terms following Angela Merkel\u0026#39s handling of the Covid pandemicArmed forces to adopt \u0026#39Premier League-style training\u0026#39 to improve fitnessGeorge IV \u0026#39sexual harassment\u0026#39 of teenage crush revealed in lettersEgypt train crash: 32 people killed and scores injured after serious head-on collision Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"grieving families united call covid","story":"NewsGrieving families united in call for Covid inquiry demand tell us why they diedEXCLUSIVE: Tonight the relatives of Covid- victims share their stories of grief and demand closure from a Prime Minister who dismissed a rapid review of his handling of the pandemic before the crippling second wave and now refuses to set a date for a public inquirymirrorShareCommentsByAmy-Clare MartinNews reporter:,  MAR Updated:,  MAR Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soonCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror incoming video boris-johnson-admits-hed-done-,customFields:,enableJWPlayer:true,jwPlayerSiteID:hPpIvH,jwPlayerMediaID:WTfCWvx,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : #

More than , people have so far signed a petition calling for an immediate examination of the decisions which led the UK amassing one of the highest death tolls in the world.It comes after Labour leader Keir Starmer this week said we owe grieving families answers, as the nation marked a year since the first lockdown.Piling pressure on the government, he said: “We owe both the NHS staff and the families of those who have died to have an inquiry and to learn what went wrong.” However the Prime Minister has so far refused to set a date, adding: “There will be a moment to properly review, to learn lessons for future pandemics.” What is your view  Have your say in the comment section Campaign group Covid- Bereaved Families for Justice now represents more than  people who have lost loved ones to Covid-. Their calls for a rapid review following the first wave last summer were denied. They believe an early examination of the handling of the first wave of infections could have saved precious lives and prevented mistakes from being repeated. Instead the second wave proved even more deadly, and families believe the government was once again too slow to lockdown or impose border controls. Jo Goodman, co-founder of Covid- Bereaved Families for Justice, told the Mirror: “It’s hard to believe it was nine months ago - last June - when we were calling on the government to hold a rapid review of their handling the pandemic so that lessons could be learnt to prepare us for the winter.  “Unfortunately they refused and we watched as the second wave death toll dwarfed that of the first, and thousands of new members joined our group. Each with their own tragic stories of loved ones lost to the Covid-. “The lessons from an inquiry last summer might have meant those families would instead be celebrating together, as the country begins to open. The government simply cannot risk this happening again by pushing an inquiry back even further. “But an inquiry isn’t just about learning lessons that could save lives. For many bereaved families it’s also likely to be the only way they can find answers to what happened to their loved ones. An official, evidence-based account of what did and did not happen, independent of political influence, can help provide closure for many of those in mourning. “The prime minister has promised an inquiry, andhe can tell us when the pubs will reopen, it’s time he told us when it will start.”  Grieving families told the Mirror how loved ones were told to isolate at home with paracetamol, while others were denied the chance to say goodbye due to Covid- restrictions. Others have been forced to grieve in isolation and believe their loved-ones deaths could have been prevented. Grieving Lobby Akinnola, , demanded an immediate inquiry to help give families closure to hold those in power to account. He said it felt “like the world collapsed around me” when he received a call from his mum, who discovered his dad Olufemi, , had died at home on his final day of self-isolation. He told the Mirror: “That was easily the worst day of my le and to imagine that that has happened , times. I can’t comprehend it.”  Alison Saunders, who lost her partner of  years James Yeats, , said the “whole system failed”. Recalling the last time she saw him, she added: “When he walked out into the ambulance he said “well I’ll see you when I see you then”, and he fully expected to come home and I expected him to come home.” Sadly, he died within the week. At hospital, he was immediately placed in an induced coma and Alison could not visit or speak to him again, until a nurse called and put a phone to his ear for her to say her goodbyes. “I don’t knowhe heard anything I said,” she added. Victim: James Yeats,   Alison Saunders, , said the lack of preparedness left people at home to die alone – with only a telephone helpline to save them. Her partner of  years James Yeats, , who had no underlying health conditions but was mildly asthmatic, called NHS  - the Scottish equivalent of NHS  - two days before he was admitted to hospital. But a call handler told him to continue treatment at home – despite him explaining that he was struggling to fill his lungs. When he was finally admitted two days later on April ,  his organs had already begun to fail. She told the Mirror: “When he walked out into the ambulance he said aposwell I’ll see you when I see you thenapos, and he fully expected to come home and I expected him to come home.” Sadly, he died within the week.  Alison, of Whitburn, West Lothian, believes that James, who had undergone major bowel surgery months before, should have been on the shielding list. She also believes better telephone medical advice for those recovering from Covid at home could have saved the grandfather-of-four. She added: “They were just leaving you to die basically. “The recording of the phone call with NHS  is heartbreaking. Here’s a guy trying to tell someone how ill he was and there’s a girl at the other end going tick, tick, tick off a list.” She said the “whole system failed”, adding that many lives could have been savedwe had closed borders earlier, locked down quicker and had a better back-up plan in place for health emergencies. Victim: Tony Clay,   Kathryn de Prudhoe’s father Tony Clay caught Covid- before Britain entered the first lockdown in March last year. She said government messaging at the start of the pandemic led her father, a fit and healthy -year-old, to believe that he was not at high risk, while advice from NHS  was “completely inadequate”. He flew back to Leeds, West Yorkshire, from his retirement home in France on March  and fell ill with Covid symptoms within days. Others in his household started to recover after two weeks, but Tony didn’t. Kathryn told the Mirror: “My mum called NHS  and he was told to stay at home and take paracetamol. But  hours later he collapsed. “By the time he got into hospital he had already suffered a heart attack and a bleed on the brain and he died alone. We weren’t allowed to visit him.” Kathryn, a counsellor and psychotherapist, said she thinks mistakes made in the first wave were repeated in the second wave – in which her uncle, , also lost his le. Calling for an immediate inquiry, she added: “The fact that the summer was squandered while the Prime Minister went on a camping holiday when we should have been battening down the hatches and preparing for the second wave – that I can’t forgive.” Victim: Olufemi Akinnola  Lobby Akinnola, , said it felt “like the world collapsed around me” when he received a call from his mum, who discovered her husband had died at home on his final day of self-isolation. Lobby’s dad Olufemi, , had called NHS  three times and spoken to his GP during his three-week battle with Covid- and followed advice to continue treatment at home. His family felt he had turned a corner in his fight against the virus until he suddenly passed away on April . Recalling the moment he received the call, he told the Mirror: “I fell to the ground and I just screamed. I have never felt so weak and I have never felt so overwhelmed. “That was easily the worst day of my le and to imagine that that has happened , times. I can’t comprehend it.” Lobby is demanding for an immediate public inquiry into the government’s handling of the pandemic so lessons can be learned. The bio-engineering researcher, from Northwood, north west London, believes it will give closure to grieving families and to hold leaders to account. “It provides closure to the people who have lost loved ones in this pandemic and gives us information to make sure we don’t find ourselves in this position again.” He added: “I am trapped in this grief. Every day I wake up and with the same realisation that my dad is gone. It has been almost a year and I am still not used to it and I don’t think I’ll get used to it. “Because it really feels like he didn’t have to die and it really feels like it wasn’t his time.” Victim: Ranjith Chandrapala  Speaking to her dad for the final time via a video call on a nurses smartphone, Leshie Chandrapala begged her dad Ranjith to keep fighting Covid-. Leshie said the popular London bus driver, , “looked like he was asleep” from his bed in ICU at Ealing Hospital, shortly before he passed away in May last year. “I said please try and come back to us, but in my heart I just knew,” she told the Mirror. “It was really tough. It was so hard to not be there for him or be by his side.” Leshie, , believes her father likely contracted the virus on his regular bus route, which began at the same hospital he died at west London. She said a public inquiry is urgently needed to address “unanswered questions” about the government’s handling of the pandemic – as well as safety concerns and a lack of PPE for bus drivers in the early stages of the pandemic.She added: “What was Boris Johnson thinking locking down so late not attending Cobra meetings  I think that’s unforgivable. If the buck stops with you, you better be prepared to be serious from the start and I don’t think Boris Johnson was very serious in the beginning.“My dad was sitting in a tin can with up to  people who could all have been sick at any given time, so why logically that wasn’t thought of as a dangerous situation and why drivers weren’t given PPE from the outset is just baffling to me.” Victim: Ian Handley,   Mike Handley, , believes his dad Ian contracted Covid- while he was being treated in hospital for an infection in his heart valve.The retired bus driver, , was discharged following a month in hospital on October , with notes saying he had tested negative for coronavirus, but started coughing two days later.Mike subsequently discovered that his father, a popular parish councillor from Chorley, Lancs, was not tested before he left hospital. Later that month he was readmitted to hospital with Covid- and died on November , leaving behind a we of  years, two children, three grandchildren and four great-grandchildren. Mike believes that the government failed to learn lessons from the first wave which could have saved his father and countless other lives.  He told the Mirror: “If a public inquiry had been held after the first wave last summer I am sure there would be questions asked and answers given that would have stopped a lot of things that went wrong with my dad. “I just want lessons to be learned. I am not after revenge because nobody could have foreseen this pandemic that’s hit us. But they did have the first wave and they just didn’t learn anything from it.” Why Boris Johnson will do every he can do avoid a Coronavirus public inquiry - analysis, by Jason Beattie, head of politics The truth and Boris Johnson have always been uneasy bedfellows. The Prime Minister prefers to dance round facts than ever embrace them. So it is not surprising he is so reluctant to commit to a public inquiry into the government’s handling of Covid. An investigation would force the Prime Minister to see his true reflection in the mirror. The image he will see before him is not the mighty Churchillian leader of his imagination but a hesitant, insecure and dishevelled figure whose misjudgements and indecisiveness contributed to the UK’s grim death toll. Perhaps an official inquiry would be too much for the Prime Minister’s vanity to bear. But Johnson is not just scared of confronting his own insecurities.

He is worried about the political consequences of having every detail of how the government performed during the pandemic bagged, tagged and analysed for public inspection. The story he wants the history books to record is how the, admittedly successful, vaccination programme rescued the country at its darkest hour. This narrative begins with Margaret Keenan becoming the first person to receive the jab on December   and rests on the hope the public will forget all that happened before. Only a public inquiry can record that more lives have been lost to Covid – at least , so far – than the , who died during the Blitz. It is the only mechanism which can explore why the UK government was not ready for a pandemic despite wargaming such a situation in . It is how we can shine a light on whether a decade of underfunding had left the NHS too weakened to cope, why those in those in poorest areas were twice as likely to die from Covid and why frontline workers struggled to obtain protective kit.

And theyaposve made it their mission to eradicate outdated stereotypes about their community - having previously been refused entry to holiday parks and finding themselves barred from restaurants. Neither of them is looking to get married soon and hit back at the treatment theyaposve received over the years because they are travellers.  In an interview with The Sun, Caitlin said: We have been treated like dirt.People will call us names as well, like Pikey, Dosser, Tinker, Gypo, and Knacker - but we are just humans.” The sisters, who want to work in showbiz, live in a caravan near Hertfordshire and have never had boyfriends and wonapost date before marriage. In a video series about their lives on TikTok, Caitlin admitted that most women in their community donapost work. She said: I feel like one out of  Traveller women actually have a job and go to work because they mostly leave it down to the husbands. aposWe donapost really go to work. I know people that have been to work.  But the duo hopes to turn their social media, from which they earn about £ a week, could become their career. While growing up, the pair say they have faced discrimination because they are Irish Travellers. Caitlin said: “We have also been barred from most pubs, restaurants, food shops, nail and beauty salons, leisure centres and social clubs - and it is not right.” They say they were refused entry to Pontins before after the holiday park in Southport allegedly said they were overbooked. In February, it emerged that the company kept a blacklist of  common Irish surnames - such as Boyle, Gallagher, McGuiness - to ban travellers. The Equality and Human Rights Commission recently ruled the holiday firm was directly discriminating on the basis of race. The sisters say they have been routinely turned away from restaurants or pubs and itaposs dficult to find a wedding venue that accepts Travellers.  But they do face strict rules - neither of them have travelled abroad without their parents and wonapost do so until they are wed. They hit back at assumptions that everyone gets married young or enters an arranged marriage. In a TikTok series dispelling myths about their lives, Lizzy explained: aposEveryone assumes all travellers get married at  or . Some do get married at  or , maybe not , maybe . Some get married , , , you can get married at . But itaposs more common to get married in your teenage years. And it all depends on when you meet them. Some get married two months after they know them, or five years after they know them. You canapost put a time to a person.

But the -year-old’s musical gts mask a story of hardship and extraordinary heartbreak.As a teenager growing up in Iraqi Kurdistan, the young singer was forced to flee his homeland to escape the violence of Saddam Hussein’s rule – and the threat of execution.His only crime  Being accused of singing songs that were critical of the regime. “I was arrested and, together with my father, had to sign a pledge that I would never sing again – not even at home with friends. If I did I would be executed,” he says. Only  when he left his family behind, Nawroz spent the next nine years in exile in Iran, Iraq, Syria and Lebanon, before finally settling in the UK. Now a British citizen, the -year-old is one of the soloists with the National Lottery-funded Citizens of the World Choir, which he joined in . This group of refugees and asylum seekers was started by a British music teacher to promote healing through music, and greater understanding of people displaced by war, famine and persecution. But the sadness remains. After leaving home, Nawroz saw his parents only briefly on two occasions before they died – his mother as a result of Saddam’s infamous chemical attack on the Kurds – and he has lost contact with his two sisters. “I don’t have a we, don’t have kids, don’t have that many friends – I don’t even have a dog! So the choir is like my new family,” he says. No fewer than  dferent nationalities are represented among the choir’s  members. And many of them, like Nawroz, have extraordinary and often harrowing stories of the incredible hardships and dangers they faced after being forced from their homelands to find a better le where.  Founder Becky Dell, a -year-old classically trained musician who runs her own music academy in Greenwich, south east London, says: “I have been totally floored many times on hearing what some of these people have been through.” She and some friends established the choir with the help of Liberal Democrat peer Lord Roberts of Llandudno. “Attitudes towards refugees and migrants can often be distressingly negative, intolerant and dehumanising,” Becky says. “Lord Roberts was very keen to do something involving the people already in the UK that would help to counteract that by showing them in a dferent, positive light.” After the word had been put out through refugee and migrant charities and social workers,  people turned up for the first rehearsal in . “At least half of them had never sung before and some of them came from countries where singing is banned,” says Becky.  “There were no auditions and no one has ever been turned away – I didn’t want people who had already been through all sorts of trauma and stress to have to validate themselves to be in the choir.” Prior to the first lockdown, the choir was doing around  gigs a year. They sang at the late UN Secretary General Kofi Annan’s memorial , and have appeared at Shakespeare’s Globe Theatre , St Paul’s Cathedral, the Houses of Parliament and on the BBC’s Sunday Morning Live. “Although we obviously haven’t been able to do any gigs in person, we’ve managed to keep going throughout the pandemic – thanks mainly to the £, of National Lottery funding we received,” Becky says.

The top  binge-watched TV series during lockdown also included Peaky Blinders, Game of Thrones and Downton Abbey, according to a study of , adults. Breaking Bad, Killing Eve and The Crown also proved popular as  per cent of viewers say they have watched more box sets over the last year than ever before. And while :pm was the peak time to binge-watch TV, one quarter of adults admitted they had tuned in to their favourite show before am. The findings are supported by figures released by Vodafone which show a huge increase in the amount of streaming and downloading during the pandemic, with re-bingeing box sets being one of the main drivers. How many have you watched  Let us know in the comment section During the lockdown, which started on  March , there was a  per cent increase in internet data usage, driven by schools shutting and adults moving to home-working. And whereas the first major increase in internet traffic pre-pandemic would usually occur at .pm when children ed from school, the first major increase in usage now starts from am. Max Taylor, consumer director at Vodafone, which has launched its new Pro Broadband service, designed for the new reality of working, living and playing at home, said: This study shows how we have enjoyed re-watching box sets and our favourite TV shows, and that some of us are no longer restricting box set bingeing to evenings. It seems many of us are quite happy to settle down to a couple of hours in front of the TV during the daytimework allows.  Never before has it been so important to have an unbreakable connection at home. Our broadband service will automatically switch to Gthereaposs an issue with the fixed-line, meaning that you no longer have to worry about your favourite shows being interrupted half way through. This means that TV lovers, gamers, home workers and school children can enjoy their favourite shows, game with their friends, access online learning and participate in video calls without worrying about the connection dropping. Other TV shows which have been viewed again during lockdown include Sherlock, Luther and The Walking Dead.  It also emerged eight in  adults absolutely love a good box set. And six in  even said that that spending hours in front of their favourites has helped them get through the ious restrictions of the pandemic - with four episodes in a row being the most they are likely to watch. Three in  of those polled via OnePoll even admitted to guiltily watching their favourite shows during the daytime - when they should have been working. To help cope with the demand, Vodafone recently launched a new broadband product that reaches every room in the house, with a G back-up to deliver an uninterrupted service.

London, Manchester and Leicester are among those places and they could see a resurgence of the virus, warned Professor Andrew Hayward, a member of Boris Johnsonaposs Scientic Advisory Group for Emergencies . He told the Mirror that local restrictions might be necessary to control any severe rises in cases that put pressure on NHS hospitals. The vaccine rollout to older and vulnerable people will likely curb hospitalisations and deaths, though people whoaposve only had one dose are still at risk, Professor Hayward added. Have you been affected by coronavirus  Email your story to webnews@mirror.The Government launched its four-step exit strategy, or roadmap, on March  when schools reopened, and the restrictions are being relaxed again with the end of the stay-at-home rule and theof the aposrule of sixapos. Step  is due to begin as early as April  with the reopening of non-essential shops, pubs, restaurants, hairdressers, gyms and zoos, and the green light for staycations in England. Professor Hayward, an infectious disease expert at University College London, said the speed and extent of a fresh surge in cases is dficult to predict. He said: The reopening of non-essential retail, outdoor hospitality, hairdressers and gyms is a big step and in combination with the fact that schools are running is likely to lead to a resurgence in cases although the speed and extent of this is dficult to predict. With so much changing so quickly, keep on top of what is happening with the Mirroraposs news updates by email. Delivered straight to your inbox, our daily coronavirus briefing will keep you informed of what is happening with Covid, lockdown, the vaccination rollout and the impact on how we live.here. “The effect on hospitalisations and deaths will be minimised because of the high vaccine coverage in older adults and those who are clinically vulnerable.Despite this, we need to remember that whilst most of the protection comes from the first dose, protection increases further after the second dose, so some partially vaccinated people are still at risk. In England, about , people aged over  and . million over  have not yet been vaccinated. Professor Hayward said: Some geographical areas, for example London, Manchester and Leicester, have lower than average vaccine uptake.It is communities with lower vaccine uptake that will likely see the highest levels of hospitalisations and deathsthere is a resurgence of cases.Often, these are poorer communities who have already been badly affected by Covid-. Overall, this may mean some areas are more affected than others which will put pressure on some hospitals, depending on the severity of this there may be a need for local measures to counteract this. The Government hasnapost ruled out the possibility of local restrictions to contain new iants. It has said it has no plans toto the local lockdown tiers that caused confusion and experts said were ineffective. Professor Lawrence Young, a virologist and expert in molecular oncology at the University of Warwick, is also expecting a rise in cases after March  and after Step  begins. He said: Every change as we slowly release from lockdown is likely to have an effect on the case levels.This is why the roadmap is taking a cautious approach, leaving gaps between each relaxation so that the impact on infections can be carefully monitored. It is dficult to predict a figure, but keeping the R rate below  will be really important and officials must keep an eye on local outbreaks and increases, he added.  If people relax too much as restrictions are eased and do not follow the hands, face space guidance, the increase could be of signicant concern, Professor Young warned. But the biggest concern has to be the importation of more infectious virus iants that might not be as responsive to the vaccines, he added. It is hoped that any increases in cases during the four-step plan would be curbed by more people receiving a Covid vaccine and the natural seasonality of respiratory infections, said Professor Hayward. He added: If there is a rise it may decline again in the summer. However, this is dficult to predict as we have no experience of how a more transmissible strain such as the Kent iant will act in summer months and other iants such as the South African iant may evade vaccine related immunity, leading to ongoing transmission, although it is hoped that the vaccines would still reduce hospitalisations and deaths even for new iants.” An uptick in cases will keep pressure on the NHS, warned Dr Olivia Szepietowski, of the Covid testing company Medic Testing. She said: As the UK emerges from this most recent Covid wave the NHS will have to once again turn its focus to other healthcare matters and we are going to see a signicant strain on other services which have had to fall to the wayside.I think it’s inevitable that we will see an increase in cases after the rules relax on March , especially as we don’t know what the full impact of the new iants will be. However, given the successful vaccine rollout, frequent testing programmes for schools and businesses, and the stepwise easing of restrictions it is unlikely to be a large rise, and the overall trend should hopefully continue to decline.” Experts had predicted pupilsaposto school on March  would lead to an uptick in cases and the R rate. Professor Young said data has started to show increases in the number of infections in primary school students aged -, and kids aged -, mostly secondary school pupils, who are being routinely tested. He said: This increase in infections is likely to continue in the young population but there is no evidence that this is spreading to older groups.  The UKaposs R rate increased slightly to between . and ., according to the latest Sage estimate on Friday. This is compared to a figure of between . and . the previous week. R represents the average number of people each Covid- positive person goes on to infect. When the figure is above , an outbreak can grow exponentially, but when it is below , it means the epidemic is shrinking. An R number between . and . means that, on average, every  people infected will infect between seven and nine other people. The latest growth rate is between minus % to minus %, which means the number of new infections is shrinking by between % and % every day. Infections are falling in the -plus group, which has been offered a first dose of a vaccine, and mostly unvaccinated people aged -, said Professor Young. He added: This shows that overall levels of community transmission are decreasing - a combination of the lockdown and possibly vaccination starting to impact virus spread. Some experts have said a third wave in the UK, like the ones seen in France, Italy and Germany, is inevitable once restrictions are lted and people are socialising in greater frequency and numbers.

The animal was seen near Ham Mill Lane in the village of Thrupp, just outside Stroud, walking through a field surrounded by trees. A man captured the creature on camera at around am on Wednesday before quickly fleeing the scene.The local, who wants to remain anonymous, said the animal was just  yards away when he took the pictures on his phone, Gloucestershire Live reports.The man said: “Unsure what the animal was but it was certainly feline in its movement. “My first thought was that it was a family dog that had maybe got out so initially I wasn’t scared at all, but once I realised what it could be I snapped a couple of pics and quickly retreated. “I’ve never seen an animal like it before but it seems plausible that a large cat could be roaming the countryside.Have you spotted a big cat prowling the countryside  Contact us at webnews@mirror“It seemed to be playful and completely unaware of me in the minute or so that I observed it.” This is not the first time someone has reported seeing a big black cat in the area. In , Guillaume Lyons, , claimed he saw a big cat on the towpath just down the road from this sighting near his home village of Brimscombe. He described the creature he saw as being as big as a Labrador but slim as a Dalmatian.  A man who spotted a similar creature near Stroud said: This photo taken in the Stroud area of Gloucestershire exhibits all the features of an Asian melanistic black leopard, sometimes referred to as a black panther. The long tail with a slight tuft on the end is diagnostic to leopards However, this photo reveals a creature that has adapted to living and hunting fast moving deer in the UK. It is slim, streamlined, long legged, with a smallish head, but still an efficient predator which has the tools for the job, with the teeth and claws. This particular type of British big cat, like the one in the photo, reflects at least  per cent of the sightings that I have received over the years andgenuine now gives credence to either natural adaptation of a species, or a hybrid animal now breeding true to type and living and breeding within the British Isles. Earlier this year, Puma Watch North Wales received a number of reported sightings of big black cats, alongside photos of huge paw prints. The most recent sighting was on the A at Tanlan, in Flintshire, North Wales, the Daily Post reports.While a delivery driver claimed he spotted an aposenormous big catapos he believes to be a puma in Chester earlier this year. In May , some photos showed a large black cat roaming in the wild near Tedburn St Mary in Devon, near to where a decapitated lamb was found.

Growing groups of enraged parents protest about blasphemy outside the school, calling for the teacher to be sacked - not merely suspended - and the flames are being fanned on social media with people telling of their immense ‘hurt’ and revealing the RE teacher’s name and address. To non-Muslims it must seem such an anathema. There are those who are genuinely bemused and don’t understand how such a ‘depiction’ of the Prophet can provoke such a reaction.“Everyone is allowed to mock Christians. What about those disrespectful images of the Queen that were in the Charlie Hebdo magazine recently  No-one took to the streets then.” Then there are those who feel justied in calling all Muslims ‘savages’. What is your view  Have your say in the comment section  “Here we go again, the so-called ‘Religion of Peace’. Why weren’t they out protesting when Muslims were committing unIslamic acts such as grooming  Double standards.” They say thatwe cannot abide by the laws of the west such as freedom of speech then we should go live in Islamic countries. The fact is that the pictures are obscene andthey were about any one of us we would feel totally justied in being upset and thinking about taking legal action over them. In this case, when they are about the single most revered figure in the whole faith of Islam then no wonder that Muslims feel so violated.  I live in Bradford where we had the infamous Salman Rushdie affair  years ago and Muslims took to the streets in protest about the way the Prophet was portrayed. Even those who were fairly laidback when it came to practising the faith suddenly became more devout. It was like an attack on their very existence. There was even a book published by a Muslim scholar at the time with the title along the lines of: “Say what you want about God but leave the Prophet alone.” Which illustrates how revered the Prophet is. I understand the concept of free speech but we have ALL seen this deplorable cartoons, we have all read the headlines and seen how blood has been shed over them. Was it really necessary to show them again   Certainly Muslims feel aggrieved about a number of issues whether it’s the fact that we suffer discrimination and all sorts of economic, educational and health disparities. Muslims living in densely populated urban areas have a le expectancy roughly ten years shorter than the average population. People from BAME communities, especially Muslims, suffered disproportionately in the Covid crisis. But there is a dference between feeling hurt and then using that to justy violence.  The imam who spoke outside the school seemed measured and called for an investigation but anyone who thinks that death threats are justied is the antithesis of what it means to be Muslim. Unfortunately, any dispute like this quickly escalates and gets hijacked by hotheads and trouble-makers. We forget the example that the Prophet himself set. It was said there was an old woman who would throw rubbish and litter over him when he passed. From coronavirus to Brexit, our daily politics newsletter is there to guide you these turbulent times.

The Duke of Edinburgh was in hospital when the couple went on TV to make a series of shocking allegations about their time in the royal family - including accusing an unnamed member of The Firm of making a racist comment. Royal expert Roya Nikkhah explains that the Queen was still speaking to her husband about family matters during his stay - his longest ever. Speaking to Royalty TVaposs The Royal Beat, she said: “We hear from people close to The Queen and Duke of Edinburgh that she still discusses family matters with him and still sees him as the head of the family, behind the scenes. The character that Prince Philip is, I don’t think for a second that he won’t have been reading the papers in the hospital. I suspect he would have known a lot of what was going on. I think he would have had a few fruity words to say about the Oprah interview, put it that way. During the programme, the Mirroraposs royal editor Russell Myers added: Prince Philip probably wanted to bash some heads together I would imagine. He is not one for any nonsense. Iaposm sure his advice would be ‘everyone needs to settle down and stop sniping at each other’.” Want the latest royal news to our daily royal newsletter by clicking here.  Ingrid Seward, the editor-in-chief of Majesty magazine, believes Philip may have compared Harry to his mum, Princess Diana. She said: [Prince Philip] had a run in with Diana towards the end of her le, so you can imagine the things he might have said.” Another of the claims the couple made in their interview was that Meghan was denied help for her mental health after saying she had suicidal thoughts.

So what exactly will you be able to do under the Governmentaposs plans to gradually bring England back to normality Since March , schools, colleges and universities have reopened and people are able to meet one other person from a dferent household outdoors for a socially distanced catch-up.  From March , stage one of the roadmap starts.It means the Governmentaposs aposstay at homeapos message will be over but youaposll still be advised to stay local. Youaposll be able to meet outdoors with no more than five people from a dferent household. Alternatively, two households can meet outdoors without a cap on the number of people gathering. Parent-child groups will be allowed to resume, meaning a total of  people, not counting under-fives, will be able to meet for outdoor activities. You will be able to leave your home for non-essential reasons and use public transport but the government advises avoiding the busiest times and routes.  While long-distance travelling isnapost encouraged, travel in England is allowed providing other rules such as overnight stay arenapost broken. Youaposll be able to take part in some outdoors sports as open air facilities such as swimming pools and tennis courts can reopen. Weddings can take place and be attended by a maximum of six people while  is the cap for funerals. What you canapost do You wonapost be able to have a much-craved pint or drink until April , when pubs and other hospitality venues will be able to open their gardens and rooftops. The rule of six or two household will still apply then, but you donapost have to have a meal while drinking and there is no curfew. You also wonapost be able to use indoor leisure or gyms until the same day, and even then only solo or with people from your household. April  marks the second stage of the PMaposs roadmap to lting lockdown and will see non-essential shops reopen as well as hairdressers, gyms, zoos, theme parks and libraries.Holidays in the UK will be allowed with your household, as long as it is in self-contained accommodation. Weddings can be attended by  people, funerals by .A ban on foreign travel is in place from next week until at least June , meaning anyone caught travelling outside the UK for any non-essential reason faces being slapped with a £, fine. There is also an additional £ for failing to fill in a form declaring your reasons for travel.The travel ban does not apply to those going to the Channel Islands, Isle of Man and the Republic of Ireland - unless that is not the final destination. So you canapost travel to Dublin to catch a flight from there.  While such ban is due to last till the end of June the Government could speed that up when it considers a review of foreign travel next month. Stage three will start on May  and at that point all social distancing outdoors will be lted - but there will be a -person cap on gatherings.Youaposll be able to meet indoors providing you respect the rule of six or two households, although this may be increasedthe Government deems it safe to do so. While youaposll finally be able to treat yourself to the cinema as indoor hospitality venues can reopen. There will also no longer be a ban on indoor adult group sports and exercise classes. Weddings and funerals can be attended by a maximum of  people and other le events such as baptisms will also be allowed.

The petition, which appears to have been set up by a student at Batley Grammar School in West Yorkshire, said the teacher had pure intentions, adding: He is not racist and did not support the Islamiphobic [sic] cartoons in any manner. Liz Haste, whose daughter, , and son, , have been taught the religious studies course by the same teacher, told the Mirror: It is a vigilante hunt on . He shouldnapost be sacked. At the end of the day, I don’t even feel like he should have been suspended. He’s always been a popular teacher for both of my children. My daughter said he is a thought-provoking teacher, he wants you to engage. He’s one of the teachers that can get the most out of pupils. Him not being part of Batley Grammar is such a huge mistake. The Mirroraposs newsletter brings you the latest news, exciting showbiz and TV stories, sport updates and essential political information.The newsletter is emailed out first thing every morning, at noon and every evening. Never miss a moment by signing up to our newsletter here.  What has happened to him is atrocious. It’s affecting his family, it’s affecting his friends and it’s affecting the pupils as well. She added: Heaposs a young teacher in the prime of giving our kids a damn good education, and we’re struggling for teachers of his pedigree at the moment. The school is in a catch  . Theyaposre damnedthey do and they’re damnedthey don’t. How’s anyone supposed to tackle this  I don’t envy the head teacher at all because this must be a very dficult situation. The teacher is said to have received death threats and is now under police protection. The row began on Monday after the teacher allegedly showed a caricature of the Prophet Mohammed, deemed offensive to the Islamic faith, during a lesson on religious blasphemy to a group of middle school teenagers. It is said he warned the students before showing the image and told them it would be controversial and they would tell their parents. A charity claimed the image was one published by a Danish newspaper about  years ago and later republished by Charlie Hebdo. Twelve people were killed when Islamic terrorists attacked the French satirical magazine in  after printing a cartoon of the Prophet. In October last year, teacher Samuel Paty was beheaded by a teenage Islamist in a Paris suburb after showing Charlie Hebdo cartoons to youngsters. Following Mondayaposs lesson in Batley, word spread and descriptions of the lesson were posted online. By Wednesday evening, social media users were organising a protest at the school gates for Thursday morning. Angry parents approached the local Purpose of Le charity.Charity founder Mohammad Sajad Hussain told the : Weaposve been informed by parents from their children that they have been shown a picture of the Prophet, peace be upon him, who had a bomb in his turban.Fairly well respected members of the community have confirmed the same as well.  An image of the Prophet with a bomb in his turban was originally published by a Danish newspaper, Jyllands-Posten, in . It was republished by Charlie Hebdo as recently as September last year. Batley Grammar School, which has apologised, was forced to close on Friday morning and switch to online learning as a result of a protest attended by about  people as police looked on. Lizaposs son had to walk through the crowd of furious protesters to enter the school on Thursday. She said: The panic that I felt and a lot of the panic that a lot of other parents felt was awful. Nobody should have to deal with that.  I completely understand whereare coming from, but doing it in another way, a more peaceful way should have been more appropriate. There were kids as young as four-years-old . It must have been so intimidating and frightening for them. The petition claims the teacher was trying to educate his pupils and warned them before showing them the caricature. It states:was trying to educate students about racism and blasphemy. He warned the students before showing the images and he had the intent to educate them.  He does not deserve such large repercussions. He is not racist and did not support the Islamiphobic [sic] cartoons in any manner. This has got out of hand and due to this, students have missed out on lessons because of apospeacefulapos protestors. The petition claims the teacheraposs reputation has been unfairly tarnished and, as a result, he may struggle to find work again. It adds:has already apologised and has been suspended. Against all odds, students wish to make a statement and reinstate him back as a teacher in Batley Grammar School due to his pure intentions. Related video: Thursdayaposs protest  We aim to prevent the repetition of what has happened before. Education Secretary Gavin Williamson has condemned the protests in Batley, describing them as aposcompletely unacceptable. Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick said the protests were “not right” and said suggestions that the teacher was in hiding were “very disturbing”.Speaking to Sky News, Mr Jenrick said: “I was disturbed to see scenes of people protesting outside the school – that is not right.“We shouldn’t have teachers, members of staff of schools feeling intimidated, and the reports that a teacher may even be in hiding is very disturbing. “That is not a road we want to go down in this country, so I would strongly urge people who are concerned about this issue not to do that.” On Thursday, the schoolaposs head teacher, Gary Kibble, “unequivocally” apologised for showing “totally inappropriate” material to children, and said a member of staff was suspended pending an investigation. But the protesters have vowed toevery daythe teacher keeps his job. A protester speaking “on behalf of the Muslim community” read out a statement outside of the school on Friday, in which he said: “The teachers have breached the position of trust and failed their duty of safeguarding, and this issue must be addressed as a matter of urgency. “We do not accept that the school has taken this issue seriously, given that it’s taken them four days to merely suspend only one of the teachers involved.” He called on the entire British Muslim community to review the materials being taught in their children’s schools. One protester whose children attend the school, who only wanted to be identied as Mr Hussain, said: “What people are trying to convey here to the media and to the British public at large is we would not like any form of extremism, any extremist viewpoints, to be taught to children.” "},{"url":null,"title":"their voices live on incredible","story":"AdvertorialTheir voices live on - incredible project helps terminally ill people record songs in final daysNational Lottery players have raised £billion to help people across the UK during these unprecedented times, helping thousands of good causes just like The Swan Song ProjectmirrorShareByDave MastersDigital Commercial Editor:,  MAR Updated:,  MAR Advertorialthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soonCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news video the-swan-song-project-,customFields:,enableJWPlayer:true,jwPlayerSiteID:hPpIvH,jwPlayerMediaID:gfIGog,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : #

His young children were with him, joining in with the chorus of the song he had written to mark the end of his le. Ron was only in his sixties and dying from cancer. He was no musician but with the help of Ben Buddy Slack, founder of the Swan Song Project, Ron wrote and recorded a song dedicated to his le. “I worked with Ron, talking about a time earlier in his le and applying it to where he was now,” says Ben Buddy. “He performed the song again at a separate concert with Ronaposs family after he passed away, with Ronaposs children singing the chorus.” Ron’s we, Alexia said: “It was an incredibly painful and dficult time, but the song and song writing process was a form of therapy and healing for the whole family. The words that Ron and Ben wrote live in me always and give me hope.”  Ben Buddy Slackstarted the Swan Song Project when his Irish grandmother, Teresa passed away in . “She loved singing,” says Ben. “In the last days of her le she was barely conscious but when we sang her favourite song, The Black Velvet Band, to her, it visibly lted her spirits. It made me think about the power music can have when people are at the end of le or suffering bereavement.” Ben works with hospices in and around Bradford, offering songwriting and recording services, not only for those who don’t have long to live, but also for their grieving family so they can create a lasting tribute to their loved ones. He usually spends an hour a week over several weeks with each person, talking through ideas, writing lyrics and music before recording a song. “I recently worked with a young woman, Charlotte, who was in her mid-twenties. Her dad, Eddie, had created a family tradition that each of them would learn a new skill and showcase it on Christmas Day,” says Ben. “She worked with me to create a song - which you can listen to here - she could sing on the first Christmas Day without him. So instead of dreading that first Christmas without her dad she was actually looking forward to it as well as carrying on the tradition he had started.”Ben also feels writing a song is a great way of capturing the essence of a person. “I really feel there’s magic in music and people are much more musical than they admit. The writing process is very therapeutic. You really have to think about what it is you want to say and boil it down into just a few lyrics.” "},{"url":null,"title":"three ways you can freedom","story":"NewsThree ways you can get a ‘freedom pass’ to go to the pub as lockdown easesBrits will be able to prove their right to enter venues once lockdown lts by showing a jab certicate, proof of immunity or a negative test under plans being consideredmirrorShareCommentsByClaire Gilbody-DickersonNews reporter:,  MAR Updated:,  MAR NewsBrits will have three ways of gaining access to venues under plans being considered by the government \"Join the lockdown community for surveys on your viewsInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

As millions of Brits wait to receive their Covid vaccine, other tests are being considered to allow people to enter pubs and clubs as lockdown restrictions ease. Proof of a Covid vaccine, past infection or a negative test could give drinkers the green light to get into the pub. For those who havenapost had the vaccine, the Government is considering proved immunity from having previously contracted Covid- as a possible criteria for getting people a so-called freedom pass. A review into how the measures will work will be published next month, with plans looking at using an NHS app as a digital freedom pass.Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Wednesday evidence of antibodies in the blood could be enough to qualy for certicates which will allow you into pubs, restaurants, cinemas, stadiums and theatres.This comes after drinkers were told pubs could use vaccine passports to turn away un-jabbed customers. But the Government has stressed no decisions on any such schemes have been taken yet. An update on the hypothetical passport scheme will be given in April with a decision expected to be announced in June. Solutions being considered are an NHS app that would become a digital free pass butsuch plans were to implemented there would also be a paper pass for those without a smartphone. The scheme is expected to not be mandatory but business that adopt it may be rewarded by being allowed to relax social distancing in their premises thus admit more people.  Mr Johnson said on Wednesday the review into how Covid certicates could work will be published in around  days’ time. However he vowed the reopening of beer gardens on April  will still happen no matter what the findings of the review are. He said: No decisions have been taken at all. One thing I will make clear is none of this is obviously going to apply on April  when it will all be outdoors anyway.It comes as the first stage of the Governmentaposs four-step roadmap to exiting lockdown starts on Monday.Thataposs when the governmentaposs aposstay at home messageapos will be over and people will no longer be advised to leave their house for essential reasons only - although they should stay as local as possible.

Alice Gray contacted a shelter about a dog named Angel she had seen listed, writing: “I would love a dog that is active and enjoys running and hiking with me, as well as lots of cuddles and affection.” However, the shelter turned down Ms Gray immediately on the basis that they felt Angel was not suitable for long walks and exercise, telling her that even when she was no longer a puppy Angel would “have hated” the level of exercise they presumed was being suggested. Ms Gray stressed that she knew puppies needed less exercise and would be guided by Angel’s needs, but thought she would grow into a more active dog with encouragement. Do you have a view on this story  Let us know in the comments section below. The blogger and science writer posted the conversation on Twitter, saying she was “speechless” after the shelteraposs blunt response.Her original tweet has around , likes, and sparked a conversation on both sides of the debate. Ms Gray, , posted again assuring followers that she had read the description of the dog “very well”, and “no where did it say she doesn’t like exercise or needed limited walks”. “I wouldnapost apply for a dog that I wouldnapost be able to offer the right home to,” she wrote.  Several Twitter users sympathised with Ms Gray, noting that it can be dficult to adopt a dog due to the strict vetting process that some animal homes use. “We went through a similar process – -page application form, references, home visit etc,” one social media user said. “Ended up getting a dog through a dferent rescue, it was just too dficult.” Some people, however, took the side of the rescue centre, with one social media user saying: “This is good and should happen more often”, since not every dog will suit a potential dog owneraposs lestyle or exercise regimes.  Another said: “The rescue is right... matching you with an ideal dog decreases risk of . It might be worth it to try going to rescues with your wishlist and asking them who they have available that suits.” The shelter, which Ms Gray has not named, has yet to comment on her tweets.

One youngster told the Food Foundation mum is receiving those school meal vouchers because she tends not to eat so she has enough for me.” Another kid confided they were worried about their mumaposs job, telling interviewers she only eats a little”. Parents admitted fibbing they had already eaten to try to ease their kidsapos worries when they skipped meals, the charityaposs executive director Anna Taylor told the Mirror. The Food Foundation interviewed parents and kids aged between eight to  during the Christmas period. It comes as fresh government figures show one in five kids in low income households had already experienced going hungry just before the pandemic hit. The UKaposs  worst areas for child poverty - see the full list here The figures released yesterday revealed three quarters of Britainaposs kids in poverty are now in working families. They also show .million kids have experienced food insecurity. The data only goes up to last March when the UK coronavirus lockdown began before a tragic year of deaths, job losses, and ongoing illness. The Food Foundation estimates the food insecurity number is now far higher, putting it at closer to .million children in a report covering the six months to January . Ms Taylor told the Mirror nearly one in five of the kids the charity spoke to had experienced food insecurity. That meant that they had experienced skipping meals, had smaller portions, or missed out on nutritional options due to lack of money or food.  The official term also describes people who struggle to access food in apossocially acceptableapos ways - for instance families who are only saved from hunger by the generosity of food banks. What this looks like in reality for these families and their kids is not having enough food at home or not having enough nutritious food to meet their needs -like pasta or rice with nothing on it, Ms Taylor said. Children talk about seeing their parents not eating or having to make themselves less food because there wasnapost enough. Malnourishment affected childrenaposs learning - which could set them back as theyto school in the latest lockdown easing, Ms Taylor added. If they are hungry they are often badly behaved which means they be disruptive in school. The Food Foundationaposs report found children also spoke of hiding money struggles in the times before lockdown. Some said they were too busy to attend palsapos birthday parties being held at cafes rather than admit they couldnapost afford to go, Ms Taylor said. They donapost want to sat they donapost have the money as there is still a lot of stigma round it. Single and disabled parents and households on Universal Credittended to struggle the most during the pandemic, according to the charityaposs data.People struggled despite the furlough and self-employment help schemes and UC uplt, poverty campaigners warned this week. The Food Foundation was calling for more families to become eligible for free school meals, which Ms Taylor said only targeted the absolute poorest households despite many more families struggling on low incomes. The charity also urged the government to address benefits caps for larger families by scrapping the UC two-child limit. In one of the past yearaposs biggest sagas, the Tories were forced into a u-turn over feeding kids free school meals during holiday breaks under pressure led by footballer and child poverty campaigner Marcus Rashford.  The government was then slammed over free school meal contracting after fuming parents posted pictures on social media of poor quality parcels. Ms Taylor said Rashfordaposs confident and honest approach to opening up about his childhood struggles was inspiring more families to speak up. She believed Brits were growing more empathetic about poverty as previously comfortable earners lost jobs and accessed benefits for the first time during the pandemic. Those who volunteered with neighbours and at food banks over the past year also got an eye-opening look at how others lived, she added. The latest Department for Work and Pensionsfigures showing child poverty hit record levels last year are yet to lay bare the full impact of the coronavirus crisis on livelihoods.The data showed the number of children in low income families rising from . million to . million year on year. A total % of people in the UK were described as food secure. But those proportions dropped for children and people on Universal Credit. The statistics showed one in five of all kids living in households below the aposrelativeapos poverty line had experienced food insecurity in the year to March . The government defines the aposrelative low incomeapos line as households who bring in less than % of the median income. Its aposabsoluteapos poverty measure covers households earning % less than the  median income.  The latest child poverty figures showed Englandaposs North and Midlands recorded the highest rates, while London had the highest total number of kids living in low income households. As many as one third of all kids in Middlesbrough lived below the poverty line, followed by Oldham in Greater Manchester and Bradford in West Yorkshire. By contrast, all of the areas with the lowest poverty levels were Englandaposs South, largely around the Home Counties and wealthier London boroughs. Child poverty charities warned the figures put Boris Johnsonaposs aposleveling upapos  election agenda in question.  In response to yesterdayaposs figures, Work and Pensions Secretary Therese Coffey said families went into the pandemic with the highest household income growth levels in twenty years. Struggling households were targeted with aposunprecedentedapos welfare rescue packages such as the Universal Credit uplt, unfreezing benefits caps, and the furlough scheme, she added.

Despite this, there will always be relatives who have very strong opinions about names and might try and get you to change your mind. Usually, this wonapost cause too much trouble - unless they start overstepping boundaries.This is a situation one mum claims to have found herself in after discovering her mother-in-law had gone behind her back while she was unconscious and convinced her husband to alter the spelling of their babyaposs name on the birth certicate. The mum revealed all in a letter to Slateaposs Care and Feeding advice column and itaposs fair to say she was not happy.The parent, known only as Mama Bear, reveals she and her partner picked their sonaposs first name together, but she let him choose a middle name he liked - so long as they used a specic spelling. The middle name he selected was Finley and she wanted it to be written just like that, with an aposeapos instead of an aposaapos.However, two months after they welcomed their baby, the mum was horried to learn that her husband had gone back on their agreement and changed the spelling on the birth certicate while she was unconscious, recovering from a C-section.And she claims her mother-in-law is to blame for the change as she guilt-tripped him into doing it.  Her letter read: Dear Care and Feeding, my son is two months old, and I just discovered my husband spelled our sonaposs middle name as aposFinlayapos instead of aposFinleyapos on all his legal documentation. I, of course, am furious, because I told him I was fine with the middle name, but it had to be spelled Finley - and he agreed before our son was ever born. She goes on to reveal that she started to suspect something was up when her husbandaposs mother sent a Christmas card to her son, featuring the incorrect spelling. However, she only discovered what they had done when she was filing all her sonaposs paperwork away for safekeeping. He just let me keep believing for two months that our sonaposs middle name was spelt Finley when it legally isnapost, the outraged mum continued.  He says he regretted it as soon as the card came and has been afraid to tell me.Apparently his mother guilt-tripped him into doing this while I was asleep after my emergency C-section. Keep in mind she lives a few states away, so this was all over the phone. She tried to convince him to give our son a first name that I very much hated, saying that I would aposget mad, but get over itapos. My husband thought changing his first name was too much but apparently gave in to spelling his middle name the way his mum wanted. She thinks that aposFinlayapos is more masculine that aposFinleyapos.

Whether you celebrate the holiday for its religious sentiments, gt-giving , or just canapost wait for a long weekend, thereaposs one thing we can all agree on - the Easter Sunday roast dinner is undoubtedly the highlight of the entire day.Thankfully, Jeff Baker, Executive Development Chef at Farmison  Co, has revealed his top tips on how to perfect your lamb, and of course your roast potatoes, to ensure you donapost slip up when the pressureaposs on.The chef, who has even cooked for the Queen, has also shared the most common mistakes people make when cooking the meal and how to avoid them.  Choosing the right cut of lambJeff says the tender cuts from the saddle with the delicate covering of fat make for perfect grilled lamb cutlets and chops, whereas, the cheaper cuts minced make great burgers, meatballs and Koftas - and each need to be prepared dferently. He says to coat tender cuts with a little fresh rosemary, olive oil and sea salt before grilling for a few minutes each side leaves a perfect finish. Add a squeeze of lemon and some simple new season asparagus for a light Easter lunch. For the larger cuts, such as the shoulder  leg joints, Jeff likes to rub these in North African spices such as Ras al Hanout, garlic and olive oil and then slow roast for  to  hours until meltingly tender. He suggests serving it alongside a minted couscous salad and a dollop of Harissa for heat . But he says you need to remember not to overwork the flavours you’re using as the spring lamb meat is more delicate than later in the year and can easily be overshadowed by bold condiments. How can you tellyour lamb joint is cooked  Test with your finger The best way to tellyour lamb is cooked is to press the thickest part of the joint with your index finger,the joint is soft to touch it will be rare, the more firm to the touch the more well done the joint will be cooked. Test with a thermometer Before probing, ensure your thermometer is sterilised. To do so, dip the needle into boiling water for five seconds before and after immersing in the joint. Pierce the needle into the centre of the joint  hold for a few seconds, the temperature should read a minimum of °C before removing it from the oven, Jeff explains. Test with tongs You can also test with tongs by gently prodding it – rare is very soft, medium rare is soft, medium is springy but soft, medium well is firm and well done is very firm.  Common roast potato mistakes Buy fresh potatoes It may sound obvious, but having fresh potatoes to make roasties is the first step to perfection. You should never try to use old potatoes when cooking as they could be rotten which is sure to make you very, very ill. When you buy your potatoes, you should inspect them for any signs of damage and then store them in a dark and cool place, like a cardboard box or paper bag - this ensures the best ventilation. Make sure to check your potatoes before you go to cook them as some may become soft and shriveled and will, therefore, need to be thrown away. Know your King Edward from your Maris Piper By choosing the best potato for the job you can ensure that you will get the gorgeous crispy edges and fluffy middle that we all dream of. Jeff recommends using King Edwards or Maris Pipers, butyou canapost get your hands on them, he says standard white potatoes will also work. But he says you may need to give them a good shake in a sieve after par-boiling to fluff them up.

Poppy has racked up a staggering . million followers on TikTok, where sheaposs known as @poppycooks, for sharing simple-to-follow recipes and cooking hacks - but itaposs her hot cross lamb burger thataposs got people talking. In a video that has been viewed almost , times, Poppy explains how to make the delicious sweet and savoury concoction.

To the spiced bun, she puts lashings of mint sauce, lamb and a few roasties before putting the lid on.She said: For me, I could have hot cross buns for breakfast, lunch or dinner, and this is perfect for that Easter BBQ weaposre all going to have.

at the D Festival to celebrate the opening weekend of VA Dundee, NCR employees were involved at every stage of the festivities, thanks to a partnership organised through Arts  Business Scotland.The charity is responsible for bringing together business with arts organisations, not only for match funding but for the experience they can bring one another.In the wake of disastrous Covid- closures, it is introducing a new funding strand to open up those opportunities to longer and stronger partnerships.The new fund is an extension of the existing Culture  Business Fund Scotland , which is managed by Arts  Business Scotland but funded by the Scottish Government via Creative Scotland.This would usually only support partnerships where a business or public body is sponsoring arts for the first time or more than two years after having done so previously, but the new #COVID- Renewal  Recovery Strand# will be open to a much wider range of businesses, public bodies and culture organisations.The new strand offers three years of % match funding between £ and £, and is open to all, including those who have already received CFBS funding. It#s hoped that longer-lasting funding will bring more than just financial support and create a more rounded partnership.“There can be a perception that funding initiatives pairing the commercial and culture sectors is a white knight situation, where the arts, heritage or creative organisation is rescued by a business through solely financial support,# says David Watt, chief executive of Arts  Business Scotland. #With the Culture  Business Fund Scotland Covid Recovery  Renewal Strand this isn’t, doesn’t have to be and shouldn’t be the case.#Particularly now, after over a year of extreme uncertainty and ying degrees of isolation, businesses are looking at to how best to support staff and ensure the wellness of their workforce, and culture organisations can hold the key and provide erse solutions.#Tayside has been particularly successful in past Arts  Business Scotland awards, which have recognised events such as from the Royal Arch Project, which saw the much-missed structure reconstructed in cardboard on Slessor Gardens, a partnership between BAM Architects and creative producer Claire Dow.NCR#s sponsorship of the D Festival was matched by the CBFS and meant employees could be part of the weekend of events.#Becoming a sponsor meant our employees could be part of a major event within the city,# says Leigh Duncan, manager of the customer experience programme at NCR Financial Solutions. #The feedback was overwhelmingly positive as they felt they were deeply involved in the launch.#Arts  Business Scotland will be running a series of free online workshops to help potential applicants and beneficiaries understand how to make an application to the fund.

It gives me a chance to sleep for the weekend.#When joining the written press shortly after that, the Dundee boss cut a drained figure as he talked through his team’s performance.However, this week he revealed he wished he hadn’t talked about his disrupted sleep live on TV as he discussed the pressure of being a manager.Askedthere is a big dference now being the man in charge rather than a player, McPake replied: “The pressure is there to perform and for the team to win but it is dferent.“Every decision that’s made, people look at.“There is plenty of experience here at the club we can tap into, though.“It is a dferent pressure being a manager. This side of the game is completely dferent but would I change it  No.“It’s something I love and I’ve loved coaching ever since I got injured.“The pressure is part and parcel of the job.“I wouldn’t say as a player you don’t feel it after a defeat – I saw all of our players last week thinking they’d let the club down.“When you are a manager, you look over every decision. When we get beat, everything is wrong – should we have played him, we should have done this earlier or this dferent.“I think it just throws a whole load of questions your way when you are manager.“As a player you are thinking about how you did first and foremost.“But when you have a good bunch then everyone is pulling in the right direction and I believe that is what we have got – that’s why I knew there would be a reaction on Friday.“I could have looked pretty sillythere wasn’t but we showed up.”Seeing off the Wasps so convincingly on Friday, McPake was able to enjoy his weekend after turning the pressure on their rivals for the top four.With Dundee having already picked up three points, none of the rest of the top half were able to follow suit.That leaves the Dark Blues, Raith Rovers and Dunfermline all level on  points with Inverness now only three points behind alongside Queen of the South.This weekend McPake’s men take to the field after everybody , kicking off against the Pars at .pm.Raith are home to Morton, Inverness host Arbroath and Queens head to leaders Hearts ahead of the Saturday night kick-off.“The roles are reversed this week,” McPake added.“Last weekend we won and put pressure on others, this weekend teams can put pressure on us.“We have had a free week of planning to gear up for Dunfermline on Saturday and we saw them again on Tuesday night.“The most important thing, though, last weekend was getting three points on Friday night.“That’s what we are focusing on for Saturday.”‘Commanding and demanding’ #

workers for food delivery giant Deliveroo has been exposed by new figures revealing nearly % of Aberdeen drivers are earning less than minimum wage.The global online firm, which employs hundreds of workers across the Granite City, has come under fire following the release of new data showing a UK-wide pattern of poor hourly pay – with Aberdeen topping the list for underpaid staff in Scotland.An investigation led by the Bureau of Investigative Journalism shows that of  sessions worked for Deliveroo, staff were doing close to half those at a rate lower than the minimum rate of pay.In Aberdeen, around % of sessions worked fell below the UK national wage rate, while in Glasgow it was % and in Edinburgh the rate was %.The combined figures for Scotland show that of thousands of hours worked for the gig economy employer, % of sessions fell below the UK wage rate.North East Labour MSP Lewis Macdonald called on Deliveroo to pay workers appropriately and become a “responsible employer”.He said: “It is really shocking and disappointing in this day and age to find that employers in the economy exploit workers in this way.“The model of bogus self-employment that we see operating here is one that leaves the workers worse off and with no protectionthings go wrong.“I hope Deliveroo will set the example, which Uber have been forced to set, of changing into a responsible employer who pays wages and meets the legal requirements of employment.”Lockdown has helped the London-headquartered firm hit profit as its popularity has increased during the Covid- pandemic – with thousands of workers signing up across the UK.However, Aberdeen Deliveroo driver Shane Stephen claims he is often left making £ to £ an hour and says he believes the “majority” of drivers are being exploited.He said: “It’s hard on young folk and foreign workers because Deliveroo know that they’re not in a position to complain.“The company promises people that they’ll be making £ to £ an hour – but it doesn’t even come close to that, people are fighting over trying to get these orders.“I’ve had orders at the exact same time, place and destination and yet I’m getting a completely dferent price – it’ll be £. one day, £. on another and £ the next day, it makes absolutely no sense at all.”Deliveroo, whose chief executive looks set to net £ million through an upcoming stock market floatation, also operates in all of Scotland’s major cities, including Inverness.Martin Le Brech, a member of the Independent Workers Union of Great Britain and a part-time Deliveroo driver, said the new data displayed the “grim” situation for gig economy staff.He added: “This shows that Deliveroo needs to step up now and make sure that people are paid the minimum wage.“All the jobs that young people and students would usually do have been impacted by the pandemic, while at the same time Deliveroo is advertising more and more jobs.“In all the company’s advertising it is saying that people can potentially make a lot of money but these numbers show the opposite # it’s a blatant lie on the part of Deliveroo.”A spokeswoman for Deliveroo said riders have “complete freedom to choose when and where to work” and can choose “which deliveries to accept and which to reject”.She added: “, riders choose to work with Deliveroo, and thousands more people apply to work with us every week.“Our way of working is designed around what riders tell us matters to them most # flexibility.“Riders in the UK are paid for each delivery they choose to complete and earn £ per hour on average at our busiest times. We communicate with thousands of riders every week and satisfaction is currently at an all-time high.”Deliveroo has also stated during previous challenges on worker conditions that its business model has been #tested and upheld by the Courts in the UK on three separate occasions, judging riders to be self-employed#.A north-east Deliveroo rider has said protests like those against the firm in  could begin again following the release of damning new data on sht pay.An Aberdeen-based cyclist network of fast-food couriers warned two years ago they were on the verge of quitting the firm over concerns they were being penalised when Deliveroo introduced new sht pattern changes.The  protest centred around cyclists, who were previously able to pre-book themselves in to work certain shts in advance, finding that scooter and car users were being given priority for the most lucrative slots.Since its launch in Aberdeen five years ago, Deliveroo claims more than  restaurants have signed up to its online .The firm said it has created work for more than  people, with the majority of these being Deliveroo riders.Shane Stephen, a rider who took part in the sht protest, said: “Deliveroo are charging restaurants % commission for their riders and they’re charging % commission forthe restaurant uses their own drivers, so they’re getting all this commission from this, yet they’re still penalising us with lower and lower fees.“We need to get another protest up and running once Covid- is over.”For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles.

been the cornerstone of the shopping experience in Aberdeen.It put the city on the map, attracting other major retailers to Aberdeen as well as shoppers from out with the area.For many north-east shoppers, it was the main reason to visit the city centre and the ripple effects of this were shared by other retailers.Big names like Debenhams, BHS, Top Shop and Dorothy Perkins have already left the city in recent years but John Lewis’s departure is dferent and feels a lot more ominous.While all the previous store closures were chipping away at foundations of the city centre, are we going to look at this as the moment when our high street slipped away That’s why our politicians, business groups, customers, communities and Press and Journal and Evening Express must join together to make John Lewis bosses reconsider.Was there any discussion with the city council or the Bon Accord Centre ahead of the announcement  Was any attempt made to make John Lewis reconsider  Can anything be done financially to make Aberdeen’s store more viable We must explain to them that the repercussions of closing the store can’t just be measured in bricks and mortar.The John Lewis announcement also puts into stark focus the changes and challenges facing the retail sector.It’s no surprise that the internet has forever altered consumer habits, but coronavirus pandemic has rocket-fuelled that change.The combination of this change and the closure of stores means the discussion around the future of our city centre must be accelerated. The full repercussions of the Covid- pandemic are not yet clear, however, tinkering around the edges or small changes are not needed, we need a clear vision of what Aberdeen city centre will look like.Planning decisions from previous councils, stretching back decades, have been called into question about why our city centre is designed the way it is. All eyes will now be on the current administration to see what vision they put forward for the years and decades ahead.With homeworking now looking like it could become the norm rather than the exception, people will have less reason to go into the city centre so radical ideas will be needed to address the problems that will bring.That vision shouldn’t just be on the shoulders of the administration, it should also be discussed and formulated with the help of opposition politicians, business people and the community at large.For now, people’s voices need to be heard.

the Aberdeen store has prompted a flood of readers# letters.What do you think of the decision to close Aberdeen’s John Lewis  Have your say here ee.letters@ajl Sir, – When I moved to the north-east of Scotland more than  years ago, I was delighted to discover that Aberdeen has a John Lewis. Since then the shop on George Street has been my go-to place for quality clothing, homewares, electricals and much more. The customer service is excellent and staff are friendly, competent and very helpful.With the end of lockdown in sight I was really looking forward to a real le shopping trip to John Lewis for some much-needed clothing.Buying clothes online doesn’t do anything for me. I need to see the stuff, feel its quality and try it on – and then enjoy the satisfaction of carrying it home.I’m confident that I’m not alone in this. I also won’t be alone in my disbelief that the last remaining department store in the whole north and north-east of Scotland is going to be taken away from the people who live in the region.Above all my heart goes out to the  staff, and the staff of the seven other John Lewis stores earmarked for closure, who now have to fear for their jobs.The Aberdeen store was once described as successful. After lockdown ends shoppers, allowed and keen to leave their homes again, will .Please, John Lewis Partnership, can you grant your Aberdeen store a grace period until the economy has recovered post-Covid Regina Erich, Willow Row, Stonehaven.Sir, – I am devastated at the news that John Lewis is to close. It is my favourite shop. They fitted my lovely new kitchen in  and were so efficient. I buy my electricals there and other things.It will be a huge loss to the cityit closes. Please plead with them to reconsider.V C Holroyd, Peterculter.Sir, – I was shocked yesterday to hear about the proposed closing of the Aberdeen branch of John Lewis. It would be a devastating loss to the whole area and to Aberdeen city centre in particular.I very much appreciate the goods and services they have provided over the years. I was last in the store just before the Boxing Day closure and cannot imagine our city centre without it.Joyce Plenderleith.Sir, – Whenever I am in town and on George Street I normally visit John Lewis then I might venture to some of the other shops in the area.The same goes vice versa.If in another shop I normally look into John Lewis too. So what I am saying is that this will have a very big effect on the smaller shops in George Street.Donald McPherson, Bucksburn.Sir, – With the closure of John Lewis, the Aberdeen City Council might just as well close the city! There is no reason for visitors or residents north of the central belt to come here any more.With the crippling business rates, the council has overseen the demise of the city.Union Street used to be a lovely street on which to shop, but in the last few years it has deteriorated into an eyesore.Mary Skelton, Inchmarlo, Banchory.Sir, – I was very disappointed to hear of the intended closure of the John Lewis store in Aberdeen.I have been a customer of the store over many years and will miss the knowledgeable, helpful and pleasant staff especially in the electrical and domestic appliances departments – this being more of an issue in Aberdeen as there is now little choice of store where you can get such help and shopping online does not allow for gaining the personal knowledge of the staff.Furthermore with the closure of so many department stores in Aberdeen this would be yet another blow to residents of Aberdeen and the surrounding area.Jacqueline Henderson.Sir, – Like everyone, I was very shocked, saddened and angry at the news that the Aberdeen branch was to close its doors.The impact of this pandemic has been without doubt catastrophic for so many and extremely challenging to say the least. Aberdeen is a wonderful city but to be deprived of its last department store just doesn’t bear thinking about.Whilst online sales are booming, and I certainly do a fair share of my shopping in this way, nothing beats the experience of going into a store to actually see the products and there are plenty of people, particularly an older generation who do not use the internet, and their only option is to have the experience of a day out to the shops.There’s no doubt changes need to be made in many of these large department stores andthey are to try and keep up with the demands of online, they need to make it a really enjoyable shopping experience. John Lewis certainly could do with an overhaul, introduce more interesting brands rather than duplicate ones within their store that were already in standalone stores a stone’s throw away.Their restaurant on the top floor was not the best and did not deliver a high quality of food but could easily replicate the likes of Harvey Nichols, Selfridges or Harrods and introduce branded restaurants into the store, have a champagne drinks bar in another area, offer Prosecco with a manicure pedicure, great tea room with cakes and really just offer a similar experience albeit on a much smaller scale.The question that baffled many people was why Waitrose didn’t go ahead as that would have been a guaranteed success.Plenty to think about but meantime I sincerely hope that something can be doneto save our Aberdeen store and the jobs of all their wonderful staff.Julie Lefevre.Sir, – Yesterday I learned from your web page the sad news of the closure, which prompted me to email the store to ascertain the facts and to explain my disappointment.We have been supporters of John Lewis since the s, from my home city of Nottingham and finally to Aberdeen via London and we have, like many in the last  months, had to resort to online with the intention of ing to the store once le s to normal.The closure of this iconic store in the north-east of Scotland will have an impact on our purchasing as after normality it will not be to John Lewis online but to local retailers we will turn to.The reason is obvious as many products are best bought by sight and touch, coupled with product knowledge. Electrical products from lighting to freezers, clothing, where s become a burden when colours and texture don’t meet expectation, crockery, linen, tableware and cosmetics just to name a few.John Lewis management why did you not give us a chance toto the store before you axed it John Burrows, Pannanich Road, Ballater.Sir, – This is first time ever I have written to a newspaper – I cannot begin to express the devastation I feel at the loss of the John Lewis store.It opened when I was expecting my son and presents for all le’s celebrations, birthdays and Christmas have been purchased there.My -year-old mum died four weeks ago and my last outing with her was to John Lewis so she could buy Christmas gts and have a cuppa and a scone. Can Aberdeen council not be encouraged to provide financial support to this instead of wooden benches on Union Street This will be the nail in the coffin for Aberdeen city centre – please use your social media powers to get all behind this.Anne Boyd.Sir, – For years now shop staff have followed managerial guidelines to inform customers they’d get a better selection of lines online.Too many times have I been told that and replied they were providing nails for their coffin.Seems they have followed guidelines so far now that customers are using the internet to shop as instructed – and look at the high street downfall!Paul Collier, Scott Grove, Belhelvie, Aberdeen.Sir, – Where are our leaders  Are they hiding hoping that everything will blow over and no one will notice their lack of motivation I think so.They are still employed and receiving a wage. The money generated by John Lewis is pivotal in the economy of the city.Do they really think by hiding their heads in the sand that no one will notice their lack of leadership I don’t think so.They should be ashamed by their lack of action. Poor, poor aberdeen what a wonderful city it was.Anne Gibson.Sir, – The closure is a disaster. Along with the loss of Debenhams many of us have lost the opportunity to go to shops where,we are looking for a ‘special’ or just really nice outfit, we had a large range of styles, names and prices to look at, judge the quality of and try on.As we get older we do not have the confidence of the young to shop online for important items. We want to know we can go into a shop, browse and hopefully come out with what we want.As well as that we could have a day out in John Lewis with its massive range of goods and food areas.I cannot believe that there is no longer a single department store in Aberdeen and its greater area. It is so very disappointing.M A Farquharson.Sir, – I completely agree that the loss of John Lewis would be a real death nail to the city centre. We all hear that online shopping has killed the high street but other retailers like Primark are hugely successful without an online presence.I therefore suggest that it is not the case that people only want to shop online. The city centre of Aberdeen has seen a lack of investment for some time.It has not been helped by crippling cuts the city council has had to make due to huge underfunding by the Scottish Government. Business rates directly set by the Scottish Government have been an enormous challenge for business and has driven many previously successful businesses from the city.Karen Shirreffs.Sir, – This is the only department store left in Aberdeen and to close this is the end of our city centre.Helen Madigan.Sir, – Unfortunately the writing has been on the wall for the John Lewis store in Aberdeen’s George Street long before the pandemic came along.And like many other people who would like to save this retail store, the reality is that even more people are doing most of their shopping online because it is safer and more convenient andthe footfall vanishes from a retail store it is unlikely toto the levels of  or  years ago.When chain stores such as Debenhams and John Lewis are no longer viable then they just have to accept the reality and close down loss-making stores and compete online with the rest of the sector.It is a great shame for the hundreds of staff who will lose their jobs at the John Lewis store here in Aberdeen but even with a petition of ,+ signatures, including my own, it is unlikely to change the minds of their directors and management staff.Brian McLeod.Sir, – Though I was half expecting John Lewis Aberdeen to stop trading, it seems like the final nail in the coffin for Aberdeen.I have been a great supporter of the store since its inception being a member of the generation who did the shops every Saturday. Soon it will just be a memory along with EM’s, Falconer’s, Watt and Grant’s and other noble institutions.As a place to visit Aberdeen has been in decline since the s due to poor planning and council leadership.Keeping John Lewis open may just be the start of an upward surge in the retail sector.Liz Jamieson.Sir, – The news of the planned closure of the John Lewis Aberdeen store is devastating, not only for Aberdeen but for the whole of the north of Scotland.It means that there will be no department stores north of the central belt. Yet there will be two John Lewis stores within  miles of each other.Obviously the company will have committed large sums of money to the new store in Edinburgh but one wonders how much they have looked at the impact of the closure of the Debenhams stores in Aberdeen, Dundee and Inverness. It would have left them with a monopoly in the rest of Scotland, the often forgotten part of Scotland, lying outwith the central belt.The news is very disappointing and I will think hard before shopping with John Lewis online or in their remaining stores.There are other online options out there. Hopefully they will reconsider.Jill Miller.Sir, – The proposed closure of John Lewis in Aberdeen seems to be the end-game as far as this city is concerned.From once being a vibrant and busy centre, it has now become a rundown eyesore without any attraction whatsoever, and with the only true department store gone in Aberdeen, the city is slowly dying.From being a city which is richer now than in the s, I cannot understand how successive councils have allowed such deterioration to occur, other than having demanded totally unreasonable monies in rents which clearly is one of the major reasons the city centre is as it is today.If we are to avoid being reduced to a backwater, the council has to start thinking seriously about how to regenerate a city we can be proud of. And the first step is to persuade John Lewis to stay.Patricia Karlstad.Sir, – We now find another major store is pulling out of the city due mainly to lack of support from the community.It may be hard for some to accept this butyou do not support the local stores then they will not run at a loss just to remain in town.Over the years Aberdeen has been slowly declining due to lack of investment. The city council lack experience in attracting businesses to the city.They do not have the foresight to develop a strategy for recovery.Look down south at Newcastle after the demise of the shipyards and coal mining, they turned the local economy around.I appreciate they have in place projects such as Union Terrace Gardens but this will be another white elephant. The council needs to look around at the conditions in the city.We are no longer the oil capital of Europe, those days are long gone.A Riddel, Bridge of Don, Aberdeen.Sir, – John Lewis must stay open.This store has ious departments selling items not available in any other store in the city.If it closes it will also limit our choice for ious products such as electronic equipment, technical items, white goods and so on leaving only one other outlet with the monopoly for these items.These items can be bought online but I personally, like many others, like to see the items I am interested in.It would be a very sad day and a massive loss to the Aberdeen and surrounding communities.Helen Stevenson, Westhill, Aberdeenshire.Sir, – Aberdeen city centre has been dealt yet another disastrous retail blow with the announcement of the closure of the John Lewis store leaving many retail workers nowlooking for alternative retail work where closures are now sadly frequent.There is little doubt that online sales are increasing and encouraged by the Covid- pandemic but high rents and commercial rates have also taken their toll on major retail stores.Aberdeen is suffering this ongoing collapse in retail outlets as are all cities in Scotland but there needs to be a complete rethink of how commercial rates in Scotland have escalated to unaffordable levels and what alternatives need to be considered related to profits rather than property values.Dennis Forbes Grattan, Mugiemoss Road, Bucksburn.Sir, – Here is an idea, clear out the ground floor and install a Waitrose. This would increase foot traffic to the store, the men’s and children’s dept could be distributed throughout the remaining floors displacing some of the under performing sections.George Morrison.Sir, – Very sad to hear of the John Lewis closure. Glad to hear that you are on the case.Everyone with any ideas must come up with the best ideas to stop this now.You are best placed to know who can use their influence. Aberdeen needs to stand united.We need a big store here in Aberdeen for the people of the city and its surroundings.Good luck.Sheila Nicol.For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. vw, px\"  "},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2021/03/KFX-240321-01-09_38344761-scaled-e1616593099578-940x564.jpg ","title":"time is of the essence city taskforce to make last ditch effort to keep john lewis in aberdeen","story":".dct-cta@-webkit-keyframes dctSpinnertransform:rotate%transform:rotate@keyframes dctSpinnertransform:rotate%transform:rotate.dct-cta__title.dct-cta__content p.dct-cta__content p:not.dct-cta__content p:last-child.dct-cta__label.dct-cta__input.dct-cta__input::-webkit-input-placeholder.dct-cta__input::-moz-placeholder.dct-cta__input:-ms-input-placeholder.dct-cta__input::placeholder.dct-cta__label:hover.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__label:focus.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__input:hover,.dct-cta__input:focus.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__btn .stransition:all cubic-bezier .s.dct-cta__btn.dct-cta__btn:disabled.dct-cta__btn:not.dct-cta__btn:not:hover.dct-cta__btn:not:hover,.dct-cta__btn:not:focus.dct-cta__btn-text.dct-cta__btn:before .stransition:all cubic-bezier .s.dct-cta__btn-loadingborder-top:px solid #fffborder-radius:%width:pxheight:pxbox-sizing:border-box-webkit-animation:dctSpinner .s linear infiniteanimation:dctSpinner .s linear infinite.dct-cta--signup.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__title.dct-cta--signup__dialogs.dct-cta--signup__dialog.dct-cta--signup__dialog--success.dct-cta--signup__dialog--error.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__grid.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--subscribe.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__title.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__content@media only screen and @media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap@media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap+.dct-cta__content@supports or.dct-cta__flex:after.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--signup__dialog.dct-cta--signup__dialog--js-active.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap,.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__content@media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe--contained .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe--contained .dct-cta__image-wrap@media only screen and @supports or.dct-cta__grid:after.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label,.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__gridgrid-template-columns:fr minmaxgrid-gap:.rem .remAberdeen leaders will launch a taskforce in a last ditch effort to convince John Lewis bosses to rethink the closure of the much-loved city department store.High-level talks have taken place between the company’s management and local politicians who want to put “everything on the table” to preserve the retail space and save  jobs.It comes as the John Lewis Partnership confirmed that no final decision on the store#s fate has yet been made, and as a petition to save it was backed by more than , people.Aberdeen Chamber of Commerce chief executive Russell Borthwick warned that “time is of the essence”the city is to “come together as a community” and persuade decision-makers at John Lewis to change their minds.Mr Borthwick said: #We have a choice.#Do we accept the decision is a done deal, that the future of retail is online and pursue other long term uses for our city centre in the hope that the eco-system can still operate without one of its key components, or do we collectively come together as a community to engage with the decision-makers at John Lewis, to convince them to work with us to build a business model that works – I say, the latter.“What do we collectively have in our lockers that could be used to do this #Time is of the essence. Can we be successful in working with John Lewis to convince them to change their minds #Maybe not, butwe do nothing, we already know the outcome.#Special: Your thoughts on the plans to close John LewisCustomers could face six-hour round trip to #nearest store#Aberdeen branch shutsClosure of Illicit Still rubs #salt in the wound# of John Lewis#s planned departureLetter from the editor: Now is the time to make your voice heard and save our city centre tooThe John Lewis Partnership has said it will listen to proposals put forward by city leaders and politicians in an “appropriate consultation process”.A spokeswoman added it was “too early” to discuss details on any plans but said the firm was “actively having conversations with Aberdeen Chamber of Commerce, stakeholders and local politicians”.SNP candidate for Aberdeen Central, Kevin Stewart, also took part in talks with John Lewis management and called for the new taskforce to work to “ensure all opportunities” have been assessed.The proposals are understood to include a new retail space where in the city centre and the potential for a Waitrose supermarket to be added to the George Street space to increase footfall.Mr Stewart said: “The Scottish Government stand ready to assist in terms of redundancies, but as a city, we need to come together and put in place a credible, and politically neutral, taskforce to put everything on the table and ensure all opportunities have been assessed.#New figures show Aberdeen city centre footfall has fallen by more than % during the pandemic, while % of sales at John Lewis have shted online.Adrian Watson, the chief executive of business development group Aberdeen Inspired, said city leaders were “still fighting” to keep the high street giant.Aberdeen City Council co-leader Douglas Lumsden added: “Everyone needs do everything they can to get John Lewis to overturn this decision – I think it’s quite short sighted.“On Tuesday we had the huge announcement from the UK Government on the £ billion investment into the energy sector and the £ million that we’ve committed to the city centre and beach regeneration.“I would have liked to see John Lewis open the store again and seesome of these things would have an impact on the store.“You would like to think that our local economy will bounce back because of that investment.“But it’s clear from what John Lewis said that they are only really interested in the online market in the north-east, and that is regrettable and something we really need to keep on at them to seethey’ll change their mind.”For as

It therefore has a special responsibility to do all it can to advance the peace process.So, while calling for an end to violence, it is simultaneously supplying the weapons necessary to prolong the conflict.The shameful neglect of this leadership role and continued licensing of arms to facilitate Saudi-led offensives is unsustainable. It is a stance that leaves the UK increasingly isolated on the global stage, with countries including Germany, Italy and the Netherlands already banning the export of arms to Saudi Arabia.The UK government now faces a choice: to join President Biden and live up to its obligations as UN penholder by ending the UK’s involvement in the Saudi campaign, or to continue to act as both peacekeeper and warmonger, undermining any moral leadership it might claim.Alex Orr, Edinburgh.Sir,The SNP has voted to conceal Alex Salmond#s evidence to the parliamentary inquiry.The Scottish Conservatives brought a vote to the Salmond inquiry demanding that Salmond’s evidence, much of which is already in the public domain, be published.This would allow Salmond to give crucial evidence in person about the SNP#s botched handling of this case. All the SNP MSPs on the committee, however, voted against its publication, meaning it will not be released.The Scottish public deserves to know the truth of what happened and why £, of public money had to be paid to Salmond.Councillor Alastair Redman, Kintyre and the Islands ward.Sir,The personal testimony of the men and boys in the final independent report into non-recent sexual abuse in Scottish football # who have shown incredible courage # demonstrates how needed this independent review has been.The abuse young players have suffered in football is inexcusable and heart-breaking.

Options! There is only one possible and that should be obvious.When I first moved to Argyll, driving through Glen Croe was a beautul feeling that I had left the urban areas behind and come out into fresh country. No longer # it is a disaster zone and will remain so for a number of years, and possibly decades,a new  safe road is not built.With the elections in May for the Scottish Government, we should be calling on our  politicians to deliver a suitable road through Glen Croe and to do it soon, not  years  away with no firm plans to do it even then. Our politicians are in hiding and it is time they should deliver.The option should be for a new safe road well away from any landslide so that we, the inhabitants of Argyll, can get back to some normal le.Derrick Anstee, InveraraySir,The neglect of the A is a disgrace.It’s not just the long detour via Crianlarich when it rains heavily, it’s the potholes and ruts when we get a spell of cold weather.Three years ago we had a cold winter and the A became a dirt track. Emergency repairs had to be carried out. The Scottish Government said they’d solved the problem. Now we have another cold winter, and again emergency repairs are needed.Other trunk roads in Scotland don’t get closed when it rains or get all these ruts and potholes in a cold winter.We need serious money invested now to solve the A problems. Yet all we get from the Scottish Government is waffle about y public inquiries.We need money and action now to make the A as reliable as Scotland’s other trunk roads, not more cheap solutions.Councillor Alan Reid, Cowal wardMr Reid is the LibDem candidate for May#s Scottish parliamentary electionSir,With reference to theto school, I do hope that the pupils in Lochgilphead Joint Campus are kept in at lunchtime instead of being allowed to roam the streets like herds of wildebeast, with absolutely no social distancing or the wearing of masks.There is a perfectly good ing canteen restaurant in the school and or packed lunches.There is no need, at this time, for them all to be out and crowding supermarkets, fast food shops, cafes and chippies.This needs to be addressed by the Argyll and Bute education department as soon as possible.Name and address suppliedSir,In a leaflet delivered to every home in the Argyll and Bute constituency, Conservative MSP Donald Cameron claims that the #UK Governmentannounced the Argyll and Bute Rural Growth Deal worth £ million# and goes on to say that he is working with local councillors #including Alastair Redman# to #see what further action is needed#.The Rural Growth Deal, however, is a joint project involving £ million from the Scottish Government and a matched sum from the UK Government as well as more than £ million from other sources.In addition the deal has its origins in discussions between the Argyll and Bute MSP Michael Russell, then Scottish Government Finance Secretary John Swinney and the former leader of Argyll and Bute Council, Dick Walsh, in February . The UK Government only became involved some years later.This would be a very serious attempt at disinformation were it not so ludicrously self-defeating. Mr Cameron is standing to be a member of the Scottish Parliament yet he is trying to airbrush out anything Scottish about the largest investment ever in Argyll and Bute and its future.I hope it is merely ignorance of what has happened here that has led him to so severely misrepresent the truth of the issue, becauseit is political spin then he needs to apologise and withdraw the leaflet.Being pictured next to Alastair Redman won#t help him either, given that Mr Redman is best known for his regular letters to local papers attacking the very Scottish Government that is putting an extra £ million into this area.The Scottish Tories need to decide who they are working for # Boris Johnson in London, or the people of Scotland.Until Mr Cameron sorts his loyalties out, then he can#t be regarded as any sort of contender for the privilege of representing the people of Argyll and Bute.Michael Russell MSPSir,The SNP has committed £, to prepare for a second referendum within the next year.Instead of being focused on Scotland’s vaccination programme and protecting people’s jobs, the SNP’s priority is holding another isive referendum as early as this year.Setting aside this vast sum of money to help preparations for a referendum shows the SNP’s commitment toScotland to the politics of ision all over again.Councillor Alastair Redman, Kintyre and the Islands ward"},{"url":null,"title":"bobcast episode 20 the final tee","story":"The Oban TimesUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Not before time.I was supportive of the mitigation plan, using nets and catch pits, as the simplest and least expensive approach. It was certainly worth a try, but it is abundantly clear now # with reputedly £ million spent # that it is not working.The , tonnes or more poised to come down on the road may well be an underestimate, and recent closures of the OMR, despite the new bund, doesn’t say very much for the efficacy of the protection. So we need an alternative, and we need it soon, not  years away.Talk of #alternative traffic corridors# is just a distraction.There may well be a case for a bridge-and-tunnel approach. Such has been successful in Norway and # notably # both in Iceland and Faroe Islands, which have much smaller resource bases than Norway. But these would be long-term schemes, each requiring the completion of several major interlinked crossings, for the like of which Scotland’s roads authority has hitherto shown neither interest nor aptitude.The problem at the Rest is a local one which requires a local solution. It’s only a mile or so of road which is at issue there.The alternatives, realistically, boil down to three:Overhead protection might well be required over quite a long distance, as it’s not just the bit at the catch pits which is threatened. The slopes of the Cobbler have experienced slides too. Since the hillside ies it might not be possible to use standard prefabricated modules, and in any case installation work would close the A for some time.A tunnel through to Butterbridge could be driven quite quickly # particularlythe Norwegians did it # but the approach in upper Glen Croe would require protection just like the OMR. Sir William Lithgow’s proposal mentions this, but construction would also almost certainly close the OMR, leaving no ersion for that period.The construction of a new alignment up the south west side of the glen, however, either on or roughly parallel to the existing forestry road, would avoid interference with through traffic.Both the gradient and the transverse slope would be substantially similar to those of the existing A, though thewould be marginally greater, which is probably why the north east side was chosen when the #new# A was built.The core of the case for the third option, however, is that the south west side of the glen has experienced far less erosion, both historically and in recent years, than the north east one.Stand at the upper viewpoint, or better still a little way along the Lochgoilhead road, and look around. The slopes of Ben Luibhean on which the A runs show far more watercourses and gullies than any of the others in the vicinity.This indicates a lot more rainfall impacting that slope, probably by the prevailing weather being funnelled on to it through the pass at the top of Glen More. And that weather is becoming worse.There have been no major slips over the forestry road in recent years, despite a spate of them on the opposite slope. It may just be the trees. I don’t think so, but in any case the trees are there, while it would take some years for tree cover to established above the A.Going back a lot further in time, the pattern is the same. The burn in the floor of upper Glen Croe has been pushed, over the centuries, by slip debris coming down from the north east slope, and the depth of that debris can easily be seen in the gullies recently carved in it behind the new bund.There is also a fair number of impressively-sized boulders on the lower slopes on that side, which at some point rolled down the hillside. Some of these came from the Cobbler, and although most are below the road a few are not. There is nothing to say that more will not arrive.A further point is that while the lower slopes on each side of the upper glen are similar, those on the south west side ease off towards the top, while those on the NE slope do not.It is on these upper slopes that the small slips develop which can pick up more and more water and debris on their way down, hence the fan shape of the typical slip. There is, in other words, a lot less potential for the initiation of slips on the south west side.I think that this all points to the need for a serious look at the forestry road, and I fail to understand why the investigations a few years ago dismissed it as a viable alternative.It’s the existing A which isn’t viable. And why any of these solutions would take  years to complete also beats me. Local objections  There is only one house in upper Glen Croe, and in the rest of Argyll I have yet to meet anyone who doesn’t want a permanent solution.My suspicion is that the biggest dficulty is that Transport Scotland can’t yet find a way to explain how £ million could be spent to such little effect. I might, of course, be wrong in all this, but I wait to be convinced of it.Arthur Blue, ArdrishaigSir,Since the temporary repairs to the Rest are clearly getting nowhere and costing money into the bargain, I would like to suggest a radical solution to the problem, and that is to build a viaduct right down the centre of the valley, based on the design of the MillauFor those not familiar with this structure, it is well worth an internet search. I believe this is still the world#s tallest bridge and is a really beautul structure.Seen from a distance, the white deck and piers look quite unreal # moreBefore anyone asks where that sum of money is to be found, I would point out that Boris Johnson#s proposed tunnel to Northern Ireland may cost between £ billion and £ billion # nobody knows because it hasn#t been designed yet. Nevertheless, Alister Jack is extremely enthusiastic about the proposal, so clearly money is not a problem.Not only would this new viaduct solve the problem once and for all, I suspect that, like the Millau Viaduct, it would become a much-photographed tourist attraction.John McCall, LochgilpheadSir,In last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser, Councillor Alastair Redman criticises the SNP for setting aside £, of its own money to campaign for an independent Scotland.Not surprisingly, he fails to enlighten us as to the costs of  the Tory party#s #Union Unit# set up by the Prime Minister at the taxpayers# expense.David Hay, MinardSir,Due to the speed with which the NHS is carrying out its vaccination programme, there is hope that we can soon all get out again andto normal.We still, however, face huge challenges. The economy has suffered. The NHS faces a big backlog of cancelled operations. Our young people have a lot of schooling to catch up on.

The vaccination process carried out with great economy and efficiency # and entirely painlessly so that we really will have to stop calling it #the jag#.The real bonus was the warmth and good humour from everyone involved that made the whole process welcoming, so that you left with a smile on your face. Only after the event do you realise what a tremendous team effort it was from everyone involved and all of them deserve our thanks.I hope very much that the Mid Argyll area makes a near  per cent response to the vaccination invitation, because that is what this effort deserves and will demonstrate to those involved the very real, genuine appreciation we have for their work during the pandemic.Norman Rea, Kintallen, TayvallichSir,The rank hypocrisy of the Scottish Tories knows no bounds.While they are frothing at the mouth that the first minister should resign over allegedly misleading the Scottish Parliament, at the same time Prime Minister Johnson was proven to have deliberately misled the Westminster parliament.Standing up in the House of Commons, Mr Johnson stated that all Covid-related contracts were #on the record#.This was three days after the High Court ruled the government had acted unlawfully by failing to publish hundreds of such contracts, which somehow seemed to find their way to those with Tory party connections.Two weeks prior to this, the Health Minister Matt Hancock was found guilty of illegal activity by the High Court, refusing to resign or even apologise when the extent of illegal awarding of PPE contracts was revealed.Last year Tory Home Secretary Priti Patel was found guilty of breaching the ministerial code by being a bully and shouting and swearing at civil servant employees in the Home Office, recently reaching a £, settlement with the former Home Office Permanent Secretary.Compare and contrast that with north of the border, where the Tory party has demanded the resignation of the first minister even before the outcome of the enquiries into the handling of the Alex Salmond case by the Scottish Government has been published.Not a cheep from them demanding an apology, let alone a resignation, for the flagrant abuses by their Westminster colleagues. What hypocrites.Alex Orr, EdinburghSir,This Mother’s Day, school feeding charity Mary’s Meals would like to pay tribute to incredible women around the world.From the mums in the UK whose food has nourished us throughout our childhoods, including those who volunteer and fundraise for Mary’s Meals, to the women who cook and serve our daily meals for children in some of the world’s poorest countries, we celebrate them all.Mary’s Meals feeds more than . million hungry children in  countries every school day.That’s why I am asking your readers to send a Mary’s Meals gt card to the special women in their lives this Mother’s Day. For just £., it will feed a hungry child every day for an entire school year.And because the childhood meals our mothers made often stay with us, reminding us of being nurtured and loved, we have included a favourite childhood recipe from TV presenter Lorraine Kelly with each gt card.Please visit marysmeals.org.uk mothersday to purchase your gt card or digital gt.I know I’d love itmy three lovely children gave me this special present for Mother’s Day.Gillian McMahon, director of supporter engagement and income, Mary’s MealsSir,Launching its manesto ahead of the Scottish elections, the Stroke Association in Scotland is reminding people that stroke remains a clinical priority in Scotland amid the pandemic.Covid- has been tough for all of us. Thanks to the amazing commitment of some truly dedicated people working in the NHS and in social care, lives have been saved and people have been cared for. Stroke teams up and down the country have in many areas managed to continue to offer specialist care and treatment to patients throughout the pandemic. We cannot thank them enough.But the fallout from Covid- is going to pose challenges for everyone in health and social care. Our Recoveries at Risk report last autumn highlighted the real le impact of the pandemic on people recovering from a stroke.Emerging evidence of links between Covid- and stroke means that now, more than ever, a renewed national focus on stroke is needed in Scotland.Health officials have been working during the pandemic to review evidence and define what #a progressive stroke service for Scotland# should look like.This will include improved stroke care bundle figures, improved stroke prevention measures, a national thrombectomy service and stroke-specic, person-centred rehabilitation.The charity is pleased that people affected by stroke will be included in the development of this work.A draft paper will be with the Scottish Government in the next few weeks. Whatever the outcome of May’s election, the Stroke Association in Scotland expects the next government to push this work on, and for a new, improved, progressive stroke service to be implemented.Colin Oliver, public affairs officer, the Stroke Association in Scotland"},{"url":null,"title":"argylls abigail releases debut single","story":"Fiona ScottUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Keith also co-wrote and produced the single at his studio on the Isle of Lewis.Abigail said: #The single is about encouraging women to follow their passions and carve out a le that they can enjoy and be proud of.#The music video that we created doesn’t have me in it, I wanted it to showcase powerful women who are following their dreams in whatever field their passions and talents lie.#The ambition behind the single is for it to be inspiring and help others to find the courage and drive to fight for their goals, no matter what those are.#I have always recorded with my band Heron Valley, who are a traditional folk band, so recording something for myself has been really dferent. Firstly, due to the obvious genre dferences but also because I’ve always had the support of five other people to make key choices, so it’s been a big change making decisions by myself on how I want the music to sound.#I have really enjoyed the process and the musical independence recording the single has given me.#Originally from rural Argyll, Abigail grew up with music very much at the heart of her family learning fiddle from a young age, also being taught guitar and vocal stylings at home with her father. She joined Heron Valley in its infancy while also studying at Royal Conservatoire of Scotland Junior School.As well as touring extensively with Heron Valley, Abigail went on to graduate from The Royal Conservatoire of Scotland where she studied Scots Song and classical violin. Her unique music style and honest song writing make Abigail an exciting prospect for the Scottish music scene and Lady a much-anticipated release.Lady will be available to download and stream from Friday March ."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column march 12 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

As many examples as possible will then also be published in the Campbeltown Courier, Argyllshire Advertiser and Oban Times newspapers.The artwork, which must be created specically for this showcase, can be on any surface # as long as it can be photographed and submitted # but it is limited to one image per person. It is not a competition and none of artwork will be judged.Gigha-based youth work facilitator Kenny Wilson, one of the project#s organisers, explained: #As youth workers, we kept hearing the same phrases from young people, phrases like #My bedroom has become my classroom# and #I feel like the walls are closing in on me#. Young people were asking questions like #Where can we go # Nowhere. #Who we can meet # No-one. #What are we allowed to do # During lockdown, very little at all.#The idea is to give artistic young people something to do that#s not prescribed by the Curriculum for Excellence [Scotland#s education framework] or by the government to give them the freedom to choose what they want to do, to design whatever they want to design.#The reward will be seeing their artwork published online and in the newspapers. The purpose of the whole thing is to increase the wellbeing of young people, to give them a boost # it#s as simple as that.#He added: #It could well be that something catches the eye of someone in the wider artistic community and they could be put in touch with the young creator of the piece in question # but that would have to be arranged through the youth workers, subject to careful child protection measures, and with parents# consent.#Kenny explained that safeguarding is an essential part of all that youth workers do and, as such, the organisers have created a GDPR statement which reads: #We will ensure that all personal data that we collect will only be held until all the images have been showcased, and will be processed lawfully, fairly and in a transparent manner and only collected for the legitimate purposes of the showcase, and will never be passed on to any other organisation or third party without your explicit permission.#Those who would like to register an interest in taking part, can email ayelovetomake@gmail providing their first name and location. They are not required to submit their surname, full address or age, as long as they are within the  to  age range.When the project officially launches on Friday March , they can then send photographs of their artwork to the same email address so it can be uploaded to the project#s Instagram account, where it will be made visible to the public after the Sunday April  closing date.Kenny added: #If you are a young person with a desire to create, then go for it!#"},{"url":null,"title":"heathers treks renaissance ruins and ancient rock art","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

She has travelled and trekked throughout the world, walked across Scotland numerous times, climbed many of its peaks and now lives in Argyll amongst the scenery she loves.Lovely Kilmartin Glen is host to many wonderful historic sites and ancient monuments.Overlooking its northern reaches the renaissance remains of Master John Carswell’s Carnasserie Castle stand proud, its ruins eerily dramatic despite now being more home to crow than human.There are many ways in which to explore the area. This circular takes you through time from Carnasserie Castle in the east to the prehistoric rock art at Ormaig in the west, before wending southwards on the path used in bygone days to reach Old Poltalloch. Then, turning east, you come to Lady’s Seat, which offers lovely views down the glen, a brief respite before turning northwards toto the castle’s realm. Glimpses over to Loch Craignish and down Kilmartin Glen give one time to ponder the geology of the area swept by the glaciers of the last ice age.At the car park you will see a small path exiting the NE corner by the information boards. Turn left and head up the track towards the castle. You initially come to a turning left, you will take this shortly. Meanwhile the castle lies just ahead, through a gate and up a steep path to your left. Currently you can but admire its grandeur from the outside, either from here or the next section of the walk .Return to the track and take the turn on your right SW up through the trees and to a gate. Ahead you will cross the field for m, with the castle to your right, before re-joining the farm track. Follow it to a T-junction .Turn right and continue up the field and through a gate. A young forestry plantation lies to your left, pretty and convoluted little hills and glens to your right. Effectively the valley floor is the line of a dyke with the lumps, bumps and ides a mixture of limestone, igneous rock intrusions, sandstones, gritstones, conglomerates and folding doing much to create the complex NE SW flow seen in the shape of the hills and lochs all carved out by glaciers.Follow the track over the col past a gnarly old plantation on a knoll. The route descends for km towards Loch Craignish before veering sharply right to cross the Eas Mor burn at its western end. Note the main track you come on to. For those wishing to miss the path to Old Poltalloch you will need toto this point and keep following it south east to join up with the rest of the route.Cross the bridge over the Eas Mor. Ignore the small path to your right with a barrier and continue for m look out for the new track signposted up to the prehistoric rock art of Ormaig. After ascending m you will see the little paths to your right leading to the stones, a good place to pause and wonder at those who carved them.Return to the track below and south over the Eas Mor. At the sharp left-hand bend turn immediately right towards the sea. After just m, opposite a ruined croft, an easily missed path slips down to a wall. As soon as you are on it, it is obvious and now wends its way southwards towards Old Poltalloch through the ‘Big Wood’.The path is boggy in places with the odd fallen tree. After .km it reaches a forestry road turn left and follow this for m to a sharp left-hand bend. The path goes straight ahead at the bottom of the bend just below a turning point, again it is not obvious until you are on it. Continue to follow this all the way until you reach the road at Old Poltalloch, passing farmstead ruins and the old walled garden on your right. The house itself has now been renovated.Turn left. The track, which also leads to a jetty below, climbs upwards for nearly km before reaching the col leading to Kilmartin Glen. Ignore the two tracks you pass on your left .Descend for m and take the grassy forestry track to your right. After m a path leads upwards on your right to Lady’s Seat, a worthy detour for a grand view over the glen.Return to the track and turn right to descend to the main track below . Cross straight over, through a gate to the right of some sheep pens. Passing a track from your right after mzigzag down through the woods to a gate. The track does a sharp -degree turn right and, a little after, turn left to follow the tracks back to Carnasserie and your earlier outward route.Please note: Historic and Environment Scotland properties and sites remain closed due to Covid the castle can only be viewed from the outside at this time.

But two thirds of women are diagnosed late, when the cancer is harder to treat.This March, for Oian Cancer Awareness Month, I’m writing to ask your readers to take just two minutes of their time to learn the symptoms and spread the word to their families and friends.The main symptoms of oian cancer are: persistent bloating, feeling full or having dficulty eating, tummy pain, and needing to wee more often or more urgently.If you believe in a future where every woman diagnosed with oian cancer has the best chance of survival, please show your support and visit www.targetoiancancer.org.uk MarchSarah Greene, Target Oian Cancer PatronSir,We welcome the latest announcement from the Scottish Government that communal worship can potentially resume from March  with the possibility of up to  people in attendance, assuming physical distancing of two metres can be in place.Christians are Easter people we live with hope in all circumstances, and the church will be providing guidance to congregations to help them ensure that buildings are re-opened in a safe and responsible manner.While some congregations will adopt a cautious approach regarding the reopening of our buildings # and others won#t have the practical means to do so # everyone will be very glad at this news and will already be looking forward to how most appropriately to celebrate Easter .In whatever we do, we#ll be remembering that the God who raised Jesus from the grave has been faithful to us throughout the whole of this last year.Rt Rev Dr Martin Fair, Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of ScotlandSir,The first Citizens’ Assembly of Scotland has submitted its final report to the Scottish Parliament, with its  powerful democratic recommendations aimed at improving the wellbeing of Scotland#s people and governance.I personally would have loved to be a participant in this new democratic exercise, meeting and sharing with, speaking and listening to, a wide range of our people, many very unlike me and with very dferent perspectives, opinions and lived experience.To be informed by a range of expert, evidence-based perspectives, to explore and discuss implications and reservations, and to move towards a rough consensus on a range of key questions that will affect ourselves, our children and grandchildren, and that will shape the future of our country – that’s the exemplar of the active, responsible citizen of st century Scotland.There#s a climate assembly also currently working towards its conclusions, and I await its recommendations with interest and anticipation.Recommendation six of the first assembly is: #That in order to ensure that citizens can make informed decisions in relation to rebuilding their communities the Scottish government and parliament should: establish community-based citizens# assemblies to assess what is happening in our communities , identy gaps and recommend actions, including through digital technology, that can bring people together and make our communities more inclusive.#We have a Scottish election coming up in May, and I hope to see a good turnout as a good majority of Scotland’s electorate, from age  upwards, make sure to vote in this most critical exercise of our moment of power and responsibility.Subsequently, I hope to very soon look forward to a renewed interest in local democracy, as an Argyll and Bute Citizens# Assembly debates and decide the shape of Argyll and Bute#s future for the coming decisive decade.Perhaps that future will include enhanced interest and participation in some version of our current powerless and voiceless community councils.Mary MacCallum Sullivan, Ardrishaig"},{"url":null,"title":"longing for a rest","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

In this instalment, we spoke to Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross.Q. What is your party planning to do for the Borders, in particular A. We are very keen to see voices across Scotland heard, because I think after the last  years of the SNP being in charge we have seen decisions taken that suit the central belt of Scotland, but not the south of Scotland.Areas such as Peeblesshire have largely been ignored. I said when I became leader of the Scottish Conservatives, probably because I represent an area outwith the central belt, I want to make sure that the voices of communities that havenrsquot been heard are finally heard in the Scottish Parliament.With a local candidate like Shona Haslam, we have got an excellent local advocate who is passionate about the local community, who will drive for more local services to be delivered locally and more investment for local communities.I have done a lot about ensuring carer funding for local authorities, recruiting new teachers right across the country, investing in businesses to protect peoplersquos jobs and I think as we come out of this pandemic, itrsquos really important that the focus of the Scottish Parliament and every MSP is on recovery and rebuilding after the most dficult  months we have had ndash rather than the SNPrsquos plans for another referendum.Q. We have run stories about local businesses being hurt by the impact of Brexit. What assurances can you give them A. I donrsquot underestimate the challenge that businesses have faced and those who have raised concerns directly with me, I have treated them really seriously and wersquove got to resolve them.I welcome the fact that there was a compensation scheme, particularly for fishing.The pound million was important, but I said at the time that wonrsquot be enoughwe still have the underlying problems with added bureaucracy and delays in getting produce out to Europe.From the conversations I have had, there have been improvements, but there are still challenges that we have got to navigate.Thatrsquos why Lord Frost has been appointed to look at these issues in detail and get them resolved so we can have a far smoother process.That means reducing the number andof forms, the bureaucracy that there is and allowing businesses to do what they do best which is getting our great produce out and into the European Union market.Q. Scottish Borders Council has declared a climate emergency. What are the Scottish Conservatives doing in terms of the climate A. I think the climate  the environment  the green agenda will go through all partiesrsquo manestos over the next few weeks, because the UK is hosting the COP conference in Glasgow.Itrsquos a real opportunity for us to showcase to the whole world the s Scotland has gone to with renewable energy and the progress wersquove made in terms of development of new, renewable technologies and the investment we can make. We saw the budget a couple of weeks ago put in considerable investment.I think it was pound million into the north east for a transition from the traditional oil and gas into a green transition.Itrsquos important that we recognise the environment as a key issue in this election, for particularly young people, but voters of all ages and thatrsquos why the green agenda will be woven through our partyrsquos manesto and itrsquos a top priority for us going into these elections.Q. Why do you think your party, traditionally, hasnrsquot been as successful in Scotland as it has in England A. If you just look at the last few election campaigns, we have made signicant gains. In the  election we more than doubled the number of our MSPs and it was because the Scottish Conservatives more than doubled in size that we prevented the SNP from getting a majority and prevented them holding another independence referendum.Itrsquos absolutely clearwersquore to stop the SNP again, only by using votes for the Scottish Conservatives can people be assured of that outcome.We have made progress at every election in recent years, both at Holyrood, Westminster and local authorities and we are clearly the strongest challengers to the SNP right across the country.I donrsquot put a limit on my ambitions for the party. Wersquove got great local candidates like Shona [Haslam] and great representatives like David Mundell. People can see that the Conservatives deliver for the communities they represent.Readersrsquo questions Q. If everyone apart from you voted for the SNP, would you still refuse to back another independence referendum A. I am a Scottish Conservative and Unionist, so I will never support another independence referendum. I think the ision that caused in our country in  is still in our society right now. Itrsquos damaging.But we are still dealing with a global pandemic and we will be dealing with the effects of COVID- on our economy for years to come.It is the height of irresponsibility for the SNP to say they are going to push ahead with another independence referendum, rather than focus on our recovery rebuilding as a country and mending the ision that has distracted Scotland for so long.Q. What is your opinion of the allegations of lsquochumocracyrsquo over the awarding of PPE contracts by the UK Conservative government A. These things are all investigated by the Public Accounts Committee in the UK Parliament, which is chaired by a member of the opposition who will look into these details.The Cabinet Office will also look into it. I think overall wersquove got to look at how the country responded to COVID- and in terms of getting PPE into the country at a vital time and ensuring our NHS is not overwhelmed when we saw other countries in Europe such as Spain and Italy seeing their NHS overwhelmed.Wersquove seen an outstanding roll-out of the vaccination programme. Thatrsquos only been possible here in Scotland because the UK Government procured and developed vaccines at an early stage in the pandemic.And wersquove seen the support in terms of the furlough scheme to protect almost one million jobs in Scotland, the support for self-employed, and the support for businesses.All that has been possible because of the strength of the United Kingdom. Thatrsquos the area that most people focus on in terms of the COVID pandemic with me ndash just how we have all worked together during the most dficult  months where the sacrices people have made wouldrsquove been unimaginable a year ago.I think we can see light at the end of the tunnel and one day this will all be a very bad and distant memory.Q. As a Westminster MP, why are you calling for a vote of no confidence in the leader of another parliament [Nicola Sturgeon], when the UKrsquos [Conservative] home secretary has broken the ministerial code and the health secretary has acted unlawfully *Please note: Our interview with Mr Ross took place on Friday, March . Since then, a vote of no confidence in Ms Sturgeon has been held ndash it failed by - .

Welcoming the reportrsquos findings, Ms Sturgeon said: ldquoMr Hamilton has considered all of the allegations against me, and I am happy that his reportrsquos findings clear me of any breach of the ministerial code.A. Because I am the leader of the main opposition party in Scotland and itrsquos the role of the leader of the opposition party to scrutinise the conduct of the Scottish Government, ministers and First Minister.We have seen in the evidence to the parliamentary enquiry that Nicola Sturgeon has breached the ministerial code, she has misled parliament and there is no way anyone can continue as First Minister having misled parliament.Itrsquos my role as leader of the main opposition party to highlight that and I believe there is a strong case that Nicola Sturgeon should resign."},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus-peeblesshire-test-sites-operate-next-week","story":"THREE places in Peeblesshire will be among the next Borders sites offering tests to people without coronavirus symptoms.On March , NHS Borders announced that new community testing centres would be rolled out across the region.And on Tuesday , the health board revealed that fire stations in Peebles, Innerleithenand West Lintonwill be offering tests next week.:Heroin offences: Peebles man sentenced after admitting pair of drugs crimesNHS Bordersrsquo director of public health, Dr Tim Patterson, said: ldquoThe more we know about COVID-and where it currently is the better able we will be to contain it and limit its spread throughout our communities.ldquoAlthough cases in the Borders are low at present, there are still cases out there.

After the frosts are gone, they can be grown from seed outdoors, either in pots or beds.Since lettuce can be ready to eat within as little as six weeks from sowing, itrsquos a good idea to sow a few seeds every week or two to ensure a continuous supply of salad throughout summer.For more experienced young gardeners, round carrots are a relatively quick crop that grow well in pots. Varieties like lsquoParis Marketrsquo produce tasty snacks that can be harvested - weeks from sowing.A slightly longer crop but nevertheless very popular is the pumpkin ndash sow the seeds now and theyrsquoll be a fine size for carving lanterns and making pumpkin pie in the autumn. Once they begin to fill out, they are fascinating to watch as they grow almost visibly from day to day!The choice of flower seeds is too extensive to list here, so wersquove highlighted three of the easiest and most rewarding to consider.Nasturtiums are possibly the most popular amongst flower seeds for young gardeners. These large seeds are easy for children to handle, can be germinated indoors during early spring and planted outdoors in pots or borders when the risk of frost is gone.Flowering from June right through to October, the flowers and leaves can be used in salads. By removing dead heads, repeat flowering is encouraged. They produce seed very easily and itrsquos entirely possible that you might find nasturtiums unexpectedly popping up again next year!The ever-popular poppy is another favourite and our recommendation here are the lsquoLittle Ladybirdrsquo poppies ndash with their black-spotted centres on bright red flowers, you can almost imagine that they are a family of ladybirds!When thinking about flowers that can be easily grown from seed, itrsquos impossible to ignore sweet peas.Try creating your very own sweet pea tepee with a few bamboos and some twine. Plant the sweet peas around the base of the tepee , then train the plants up and around as they grow to create a tent with living walls. With endless fragrant flowers and a tepee to play in, itrsquos sure to be a winner for all the family!For many of todayrsquos gardeners, their own plot in the garden is where their love of gardening first began.Whilst not every garden has the space to have a dedicated kids area, therersquos often room to let children grow things in containers.Why not set them the challenge of finding the most unusual colourful imaginative container and see what they come up with  Old toys, kitchen containers or even old shoes and boots can be fun containers to grow plants in and could be decorated to produce wonderfully inidual planters. Just make sure that theyrsquore clean before you begin, that they have sufficient drainage so that the plants donrsquot become waterlogged and that they will remain intact when watered.If you donrsquot have a garden, perhaps you could let them experiment with houseplants or a window box With so much evidence about the benefits to our wellbeing of gardening, introducing children to this wonderful pastime is certainly worth considering. You may be launching a future horticulturalist or simply helping them learn how gardening can help them remain healthy and well but itrsquos certainly worth having a go!Although we are currently closed due to Government guidance, our plant team are here in the garden centre caring for the plants and can be contacted by email at info@merryhatton or telephonefor help and advice. Yoursquoll also find lots of information and can purchase your seeds on our website at www.merryhatton"},{"url":null,"title":"puppet-animation-festival-returning-east-lothian-easter","story":"This year it moves online due to the Covid- pandemic, replacing the performances and workshops for primary school children which usually take place in venues throughout the country.Organised by The Brunton in Musselburgh and East Lothian Councilrsquos arts service, the festival will feature two performances to watch through the theatrersquos website and two fun workshops to take part in via Zoom.The Incredible Tale of Robot Boy, by Theatre Rites, one of the UKrsquos leading theatre companies, will be shown on Saturday, April , at .am and pm for ages eight plus.In the most extraordinary high-tech laboratory, a team of the worldrsquos top scientists are attempting the impossible ndash to create a robot with a real brain.

Why were governments doing dferent things  Which policies would work  We didnrsquot know. And to answer those questions, we needed comparable information on these new policies, including school closings, stay at home orders, contact tracing and more.A few weeks later, we launched theOxford COVID- Government Response Trackerto help find these answers. It has now become thelargest repositoryof global evidence relating to pandemic policies.To date, more than  data collectors from around the world have helped us track  dferent categories of coronavirus response, including lockdown, health, economic, and now vaccine policies in  countries.We then group those policies into a number of indices, including the stringency index, which records the number and intensity of closure and containment policies on a scale of zero to . Fteen countries reached  on the stringency index, while seven never surpassed . The countries with the highest average stringency were Honduras, Argentina, Libya, Eritrea and Venezuela. Those with the lowest were Nicaragua, Burundi, Belarus, Kiribati and Tanzania.A year on, what  have we learned about how governments have handled the largest health crisis in memory One surprising observation is that similarities can actually outweigh dferences. During the first months of the pandemic, governments mostly adopted similar policies, in mostly the same sequence, at mostly the same time ndash thetwo middle weeks of March .This policy convergence contrasts with the uneven spread of COVID- around the world. In March , though the disease was already prevalent in some parts of Asia, and rapidly spreading in parts of Europe and North America, it had yet to reach a wide scale of transmission in many parts of the world. The global lockdown rush therefore contrasted with the ying epidemiological situations countries faced. This meant that some countries locked down too late, and others arguably too soon.But as the pandemic progressed, countries ndash and, in some parts of the world,statesandregionsndash began to y considerably.Some governments were able to contain the first wave and then preserve those gains with a mix of targeted closure and containment measures, extensive testing and contact tracing, and firm international border controls.Places likeChina,Taiwan,VietnamandNew Zealandall managed not just to flatten the curve but to keep it flat, albeit with a few small flare-ups. In our data, we count  countries that have only experienced one wave of disease, though limited testing and reporting systems, or government suppression of information, make it hard to determine the true number.Other countries have had less success, seeing second, third, or even fourth waves of disease. Some of these have been relatively small outbreaks, controllable with test and trace measures and targeted restrictions. For example,South KoreaandFinland, though not able to eliminate the virus, have largely kept it from stressing health systems.Rollercoaster countries\" alt\"East Lothian Courier: Many countries have seen more than one wave of the virus. \" class\"editor-image\"Many countries have seen more than one wave of the virus. Too many countries have been on a veritable rollercoaster of rising and falling infections with corresponding policy whiplash and tragic death tolls. TheUnited States,United Kingdom,South Africa,Iran,BrazilandFrancehave seen successive waves of disease and have phased in and out of restrictive policies.Though initially debated, thescientic literatureis now clear: COVID- restrictions work to break the chain of infection, with timely, sharper restrictions having greater effect than slower, weaker ones.But while clearly true on average, there is no guarantee this recipe will always work. Countries likePerusuffered rising disease despite restrictive policies, perhaps showing that compliance and trust are also key to effectiveness. Some evidence also suggests thatstronger economic support makes COVID- restrictions more effective.Money isnrsquot everything\" alt\"East Lothian Courier: Money isnt everything when it comes to tacking a health crisis. \" class\"editor-image\"Money isnt everything when it comes to tacking a health crisis. While we can identy patterns of successful response, it is also evident that none of the country characteristics that wereexpected to provide an advantagebefore the pandemic, such as wealth or autocracy, have clearly done so.If you ide the world into countries with above average and below average deaths, robust government responses and weak ones, you will find in both groups plenty of rich countries and poor countries, democracies and dictatorships, those ruled by populists and those governed by technocrats.Success and failure are moving targets. As the pandemic has evolved, so have government responses. According to our data, vaccines are now available in  countries and rising. Notably, some of the countries most swtly rolling out vaccination ndash Israel, the UK, the United States, the UAE ndash are places that have previously struggled to control the virus through restrictions and test-and-trace systems.Lessons for the future\" alt\"East Lothian Courier: Boris Johnson reflects on one year since the first lockdown. \" class\"editor-image\"Boris Johnson reflects on one year since the first lockdown. One year on, the pandemic is by no means over, but already our data suggests someimplications and lessonsfor governments.First, old ideas about what contributes to pandemic preparedness need to be updated. Some countries with formidable scientic and healthcare capacitystumbled mightily. At the same time, places with less capacity, includingMongolia,ThailandandSenegalhave managed to largely keep people healthy and the economy running.Second, learning from others, or even from past experience, cannot be taken for granted. In March  eastern European countries like theCzech Republic, Hungary, and Bulgariasaw what happened to their western neighbours and imposed restrictions before community transmission became widespread. They largely avoided the death tolls many western European countries experienced in the first wave.But then just a few months later some of the same eastern European countries did the exact opposite, waiting too long to reimpose measures as cases rose in the autumn, with all too predictable consequences.Finally, while our work has tracked inidual governmentsrsquo responses, it is clear that exiting the pandemic will require global cooperation. Until transmission is curtailed throughout the world with restrictions and vaccinations, therisk of new iantssending us back to square one cannot be ignored.In the first year of the pandemic we saw little cooperation between governments. In the next, we will need to work together to control this disease."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.comource srcset=/resources/images/9341746.jpg?htype=25\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"list-glasgow-shops-administration-lockdown","story":"Here we look at some of the businesses who will no longer be operating in the city and the ones under threat.Remnant KingsCity location: Howard StreetA total of  stafflost their jobs from the firmrsquos bases in Glasgow, Hamilton, and Edinburgh after the administrators were called in.The firm, which started in Glasgow in , said that although they were historically profitable, they have since suffered from declining turnover and trading dficulties in recent years caused by changing consumer habits.:Glasgow firm Remnant Kings goes into admistration resulting in job lossesOasis and Warehouse GroupCity locations past and present: Buchanan Galleries, Silverburn, Princes Square, and Glasgow Fort.The company behind Oasis and Warehouse went into administration in April when Deloitte was appointed as administrator.All stores haveclosed indefinitely whileonline sales have stopped.Reports say the fashion brands have been sold to restructuring business Hilco in a deal which includes stock but not the  stores or  concessions.Hash Ladha, chief executive of Oasis Warehouse, previouslysaid: ldquoThis is a situation that none of us could have predicted a month ago, and comes as shocking and dficult news for all of us.ldquoWe as a management team have done everything we can to try and save the iconic brands that we love.:Oasis and Warehouse who have shops in Glasgow fall into administrationCath KidstonCity location: Gordon StreetCath Kidston said they will not reopen their shops when lockdown ends.They called in the administrators in April with the closure of shops costing around  jobs.It is understood that the owner of the retro fashion brand has secured a deal to buy back the brand and its online operation.

That problem continues to pose concerns, not least over whether the sizeable gatherings outside Ibrox and in Glasgowrsquos George Square might be repeated, perhaps at the upcoming Old Firm match.I watched Celtic draw with Dundee United last weekend, a result which guaranteed the Premiership for Rangers. Football fans will perhaps understand that my first thought was that my team, United, now had virtually no chance of securing a top six place in the league, and thus avoiding a possible relegation battle. BRIAN TAYLOR:This is not a civil war in the SNP. This is more vicious and more visceralHowever, the wider consequences soon emerged as Rangers fans mustered to celebrate their teamrsquos success, in clear breach of rules prohibiting mass gatherings.Condemnation was swt from the First Minister, Opposition leaders and the police. While praising Rangersrsquo sporting achievement, they declared that the supportersrsquo actions were unacceptable and dangerous. They reminded us bluntly that closely packed crowds had the potential to spread disease and even death.Let us be clear. Parliament has the democratic power to prescribe rules. Within those rules, the police have a duty to proscribe behaviour which threatens the peace and, in this case, the health of citizens. Law and order must be maintained.The question is how. What is the truly effective way to prevent repetition  To do that, we need to understand the motivations underlying the behaviour we all witnessed.Otherwise, we risk making matters worse, we risk reinforcing a negative stereotype. To say this is in no way ndash I stress, in no way whatsoever ndash to condone the behaviour on display. It was dangerous and, potentially, deadly.Nicola Sturgeon has warned the Old FirmFirstly, I would broadly exculpate the police. You will hear it said either that they over-reacted or that they should have made far more arrests.The police did not create the situation. The fans gathered instinctively, emotively, no doubt prompted by social media. The police had to deal with events as they found them.An over-zealous response would have risked provoking the crowd, amplying the challenge to public order. Precisely the opposite of what the police were seeking to achieve.Secondly, consider the intrinsic nature of football support. We are dealing here with fans, or fanatics. For many, their le is defined by their vigorous adherence to their team. They exult in victory, they despair at defeat.This particular triumph for Rangers followed a decade without winning the league title a decade in which they had to rise from the lowest rank in Scottish football. In winning, they thwarted their greatest rivals.More generally, many fans regard their support for their team in an antithetical fashion to rival clubs, or even to society more generally. It is no accident that many supporters sing ldquonobody likes us, we donrsquot care. Their contrived self-image is as a beleaguered tribe, standing together against an external foe or an uncaring world.That is true of the most fervent of fans generally but it is particularly true of the Old Firm. Their adherents will often define themselves in contradistinction to the other side. Which can present a challenge for neutral observers or, indeed, for politicians seeking to intervene.Grimacing wryly, Nicola Sturgeon told MSPs this week that half of Glasgow presumed she was partisan for one side of the Old Firm while the other half presumed exactly the contrary. She was, she stressed, unconcerned about the colour of the shirt.It was also notable in Rangersrsquo official statement that they immediately drew attention to what they regarded as ldquoan unbalanced approach adopted towards their half of the Old Firm.In that same statement, Rangers insisted they had taken every step to pre-empt and deter such behaviour. It might be pertinent to note here that broader support for that analysis is distinctly limited. Further, eventhey were doing all they could, then those efforts demonstrably failed.Crucially, however, Rangers supporters will agree with their club. They will discern bias against them which others do not spot. Such a standpoint is not entirely unknown on the other side of the Glasgow sporting ide, nor indeed in football more generally. They are not known as fans for nothing. Once again, that does not remotely exonerate the behaviour we witnessed.However, it is also the case that there are many Rangers fans who will regret the scenes witnessed, who will seek to dispel any bad odour lingering around their clubrsquos remarkable success. As The Herald reported, supportersrsquo groups have raised thousands of pounds to repair damaged benches in George Square.Equally, though, those of us who are football fans need to reflect that many, perhaps most, people in Scotland are not. BRIAN TAYLOR:Sturgeonrsquos inquiry performance was thorough, respectful, controlled and capableRemember Brenda from Bristol  On being told that a further General Election was pending, she replied: ldquoYoursquore joking! What, another one !Translate that from Brendarsquos broad Bristol accent into Scots, and you have it pat. For many in Scotland, their reaction to another controversy in football is ennui. They find it weary, stale and flat full of sound and fury and signying nothing.In that light, we now need action which will be effective, rather than simply voluble. Perhaps a promise of substantial celebrations deferred, linked to the warning that the Old Firm game may have to be cancelled. Perhaps a reminder of possible sanctions by the European football authority.It will not be sufficient for that message to be delivered solely by politicians. Still less, by the police. That will not work with the truly zealous.Football leaders must douse their instinctive indignation and urge compliance. Consistently and without equivocation. In tandem with politicians and the police. It may be exasperating that such effort is required but anything  risks further failure.

If that is success, First Minister, I would hate to see what failure looks like.The Hamilton report, it is true, said Ms Sturgeon did not breach the ministerial code. But there was that memory lapse about a key meeting there was scope for political criticism of the way the allegations against the former First Minister Alex Salmond were handled and the claim that a complainerrsquos name was leaked by one of Ms Sturgeonrsquos staff was termed ldquocredible. Hardly the most glowing report card.The second report, from a Scottish Parliament committee, was openly critical of the First Minister and officials for creating a fatally flawed complaints process, misleading parliament, obstructing and delaying the inquiryrsquos investigation, and wasting public money by carrying on with a legal battle that was clearly lost early on.: Case closed but damage doneThat last error cost well in excess of half a million pounds of your money and mine. But let us not forget, as the committeersquos report concluded: ldquoThis is not just about procedures or public money. It is about ensuring that, in the future, anyone complaining about sexual harassment is not let down in the way these women have been.Exactly. At the centre of all this should be the two women civil servants who originally brought forward complaints against Mr Salmond. From then until now they have been treated almost as an afterthought. Collateral damage in the many battles waged between parties and among former friends. That says a lot about the woeful conduct of the Scottish Government, and the goings on at the committee itself, with the final insult to the two women the leaking of their evidence to a Sunday newspaper.The womenrsquos evidence says even more. First is the matter of where it is positioned. It takes until page  of a -page report to reach the testimony of Ms A and Ms B. They were the last to give evidence, so chronologically speaking it was correct to have them just before the annexes, but as a metaphor it is unfortunate to say the least.The evidence of Ms A and Ms B is also well worth exploring for what they have to say about the workings of a Government, and a civil service, in which the leading figures were, in the latter stages of events, women.: Verdict to trust most is that of Sturgeons peersIt is ironic but true that the main mistakes took place on the watch of Ms Sturgeon as First Minister and Leslie Evans as the Permanent Secretary to the Scottish Government, the nationrsquos most senior civil servant no less.This could simply be one of those coincidences that history delights in. It is certainly something that has not merited much,any, discussion, despite the hundreds of thousands of words expended on this saga.As the committee says earlier on in its report, it was right for the Scottish Government to review its procedures in light of the #MeToo movement, and crucial to get the process right.ldquoThese were the first complaints to be taken forward under this new procedure and they were signicant in terms of the person being complained about. It was imperative that everything was done to make sure that the procedure was robust and fair and, just as importantly, seen to be robust and fair.Robust and fair ndash remember that.Ms A and Ms B were highly critical of the culture that had been allowed to grow up and operate at the time of the alleged incidents. One said: ldquoLeslie Evans, as permanent secretary, talked about the concept that what you permit, you promote. I have always thought that that is quite a nice encapsulation of this, and I think that it is a sad indictment of what happened at that time that such behaviour was permitted and a blind eye was turned to it.What you permit you promote ndash remember that.: David Leask - this is a disinformation eventAs for what happened later, one witness said: ldquoI was quite taken aback by the lack of contact and support from the Scottish Government after the conclusion of its process. We were given regular updates over the period of the judicial review, but after that we were basically just dropped.Dropped ndash remember that.Now, it could just as well have been men at the head of Government and the civil service when these things happened. Moreover, women should never be blamed, or have to apologise for, the actions of men. But equally when they get things wrong they should accept responsibility.Ms Sturgeon has indeed said sorry to the two women who came forward, and to the wider Scottish public, when she gave evidence to the Holyrood committee. Yet her contrition amounts to little in comparison to the way she has reacted to criticism in general. In parliament this week she accused opponents of trying to bully her out of office. How do you bully the head of a Government  Holding a Minister to account is not bullying.Sometimes the best thing for a leader to do is own their mistakes and move on. Yet I do not think we are about to see that idea in action as the election campaign takes hold, which is a pity.From the start of this business I have worried about its impact on girls and women thinking of coming into politics or seeking high office. Scottish politics has been left looking a gladiatorial arena in which only the strong survive, and where might ultimately poses as right, even when it is wrong.For the record, I believe that Ms Sturgeon and Ms Evans acted with the best of intentions. But mistakes were made. Huge, costly, hurtful mistakes. Yet everyone keeps their job, their high salaries, and their gold-plated pensions. Whether it was women in charge, or men, that cannot be right or fair."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/12444555.jpg?type=article-full","title":"linda-bauld-no-lockdown-baby-boom-scots-birth-rate-declines-lockdown","story":"Declining birth rates are part of a longer term trend, but studies from the US and Europe suggest that the coronavirus crisis may be making this worse. Births in Italy reduced by % at the start of this year and in Spain by %. The NRS figures are the first sign that this is happening here. Speculation that lockdown might leave couples with little to do than spend time in the bedroom now seems a bit far fetched.Has the pandemic affected fertility rates, and will this drop continue To understand this better, I spoke to Professor Michael Anderson who for the past  years has studied the population history of Scotland. I asked him about this reduction and where it fits in with what we know about the factors that influence population projections. LINDA BAULD:How likely are we to catch coronavirus outdoors Professor Anderson, working with Dr Esther Roughsedge from National Records Scotland, recently reviewed some of the data. Looking at trends back to , their analysis shows that there were signicant reductions in births during both world wars followed by baby booms.Since the start of the th century there has been a general downward trend with some fluctuations, including a surge in births during the s economic boom. The recession that began after the   global credit crunch also affected birth rates. Separate analysis of that period across Europe found that poor economic conditions were associated with fertility declines, particularly in countries that experienced higher levels of unemployment.It is plausible that the drop in births in Scotland over the last few months was caused by the consequences of lockdowns. Despite furlough and other efforts by governments to support families, there has been a rise in unemployment, particularly among the young. Surveys show that levels of depression and anxiety have risen, and couples considering starting a family will have felt a lot of uncertainty. For those living together, being at home with their partner on a daily basis might have been an appealing prospect at first, but less so as the weeks and months of restrictions continued.Other factors might have contributed. Ante-and post-natal care has continued throughout the pandemic, but women may have been concerned about accessing health services. Some may have decided to delay a pregnancy on that basis. Access to fertility clinics and IVF reduced in the early months of the pandemic. Dating and forming new relationships was much more challenging. Maintaining intimacy between couples who live apart has been badly affected because we werenrsquot able to visit other peoplersquos households during lockdown restrictions.The economic, emotional and social upheaval that the coronavirus crisis have caused all suggest that the recent further decline in births may be the start of a real trend.But Professor Anderson urges caution. One assumption ndash that women may have delayed a pregnancy to avoid needing to access maternal health services ndash isnrsquot reflected in recent figures. He and Dr Roughsedge obtained data from Public Health Scotland for the number of women booking for antenatal care up to November . There was a small decline of between -% since May that year but nothing signicant.Migration may also play a role. Over the last year, the number of non UK-born workers resident here has fallen by more than K based on the Labour Force Survey. Migrants particularly from Europe are often employed in the sectors that have been badly affected during the pandemic. For many, especially those who have arrived recently, the choice would have been to stay here, with no job, less or no money, and pay for relatively expensive rented accommodation orhome to family. This may have affected birth rates.The number of births fluctuates between months and years and it would take a large and sustained drop to have a big impact on Scotlandrsquos long term population projections. But there are things governments can do to support people in Scotland to have children. One of the main reasons why the last recession had a less damaging impact on birth rates in the UK compared to where in Europe is because the UK government slashed interest rates in the winter of -.They fell from % in the summer of  to .% by March . This reduced mortgage payments and gave couples more confidence that they had enough funds to start a family. LINDA BAULD:Vaccines are giving us hope ndash and a cautious route out of this pandemicA study by economists at the Bank of England found that each percentage point drop in UK interest rates increased births by %, resulting in an overall increase of .% in the UK over the next three years. In Scotland births still declined ndash but to a lesser extent than the longer term trend, suggesting that these measures might have made a dference here also.As we emerge from the pandemic we need to consider the best policies to support parents, families and children.

So, of course, would reversing Brexit. Or reforming the monarchy or the House of Lords.For decades more moderate unionists have always thought they way to assuage Scottish nationalists was to offer more powers, more devolution, by changing how Scotland was run. Only rarely do they talk about reforming how Britain is governed, by suggesting federalism. And it is almost unheard of for supposedly English unionists to ask themselves what,anything, they can change about themselves to make small-n Scottish nationalists stay.This week a Conservative think tank called UK Onward produced the latest of a spate of reports from ious bodies on \"the state of the union\". England, it seems, has started to fret a little about Scotland.The work was based on a survey of attitudes across the four nations. They, well, ied.ldquoIt is clear the centre ground of Scottish politicsis very dferent to the wider UK and in particular, to England, tweeted James Kanagasooriam, who sits on the board of Onward.ldquoIt suggests that to be successful the unionist side has to meet the Scottish electorate on its own terms, not by obsessing about the impact on institutions most Scots donrsquot think will be affected or by allowing unionism to be identied with Englishness or Conservatism. \"The lsquowar on woke being prosecuted is a clear and present danger to the union.So what would English unionists sacrice for Britain  The flag  The monarchy  What Mr Kanagasooriam calls the \"war on woke\", the endless culture wars in which England-Britain struggles to come to terms with its dficult past Well, nothing, reckons Ailsa Henderson, professor of political science at Edinburgh University.Ms Henderson knows the mood in England better than most.

Back in  some people thought it was settled. In reality the No vote ndash and then Brexit ndash posed another question, the British Question: what is the UK  Unionism is struggling to answer that .Right now the old unionism of Britain as a nation of nations is in crisis, eroded by the exodus of so many of its followers to the Scottish nationalist cause.A new rhetorically stronger but politically weaker unionism ndash sometimes called neo-unionism ndash is on the rise. For this movement, Britain is a nation-in-itself.Some of its adherents can sound asbeing Scottish were some kind of  consciousness asnational identity was created by the SNP rather than the SNP being the product of national identity seeking a political outlet.And so some of the more banal of these neo-unionists are looking for ways to make Scots more British. That is where all those extra flags come in.The older, more comfortable, more successful unionism did not feel the need to do this. After all, its supporters were quite comfortable with ying and overlapping national identities.Many voted for unionist parties ndash such as Labour ndash eventhey did not even feel British at all. Perhaps other issues were more important than identity, including flags. Or maybe being part of the UK was just a transaction, not something in which they invested any emotion.

Aside from the odd dental appointment or trip to an opticianrsquos not one pupil has missed a day of lessons.It is a remarkable figure considering that for much of that time children were learning on-line, but to head teacher David Hicks it is highly signicant because it suggests that pupils are both happy and engaged in their studies.Happiness and wellbeing says Hicks are the foundation of learning and at Fairview that ethos forms the central approach to a system that is focused on bringing out the best in every child.Fairview opened its doors just under two years ago and it offers an International Baccalaureate education as a candidate school for the Primary and Middle Years programmes.In the coming years, the school is also planning to extend this to senior pupils for whom an IB Diploma is a globally-recognised qualication, but, for now, this approach benefits all from the youngest cohort upwards through IB Primary and Middle Years programmes.The emphasis in this setting, which there is a policy of inclusion, is on providing a breadth and richness to education, finding ways in which subjects relate directly to real le and making knowledge seem relevant to every-day experiences.At the heart of the process is ensuring the development of each attribute of the IB learner profile in every child, not only those to which each child relates to most closely.These attributes are a set of character traits and social motivations, such as lsquocommunicatorrsquo or lsquocaringrsquorsquo that reveal how children relate to the world around them and which influence the way in which they approach learning.ldquoAt Fairview we have an exceptionally strong curriculum but we consider that attributes such as lsquobalancedrsquo and lsquoopen-mindedrsquo are every bit as important as lsquothinkerrsquo or lsquoknowledgeable.rsquoBehind this philosophy is a determination to support the natural sense of enquiry with which children are born while at the same time fostering a spirit of acceptance of those whose backgrounds or ideas may be dferent from their own.ldquoWe teach them to recognise thatthey are right it doesnrsquot mean that someone  is therefore wrong. It is about seeing the world through the eyes of someone  and realising that a dferent perspective may produce a dferent outcome.Hicks, who spent nine years working in the state system in the UK before spending a further  years heading up international schools across the Middle East, believes firmly that an international school can give pupils a broad view of the world. ldquoIt provides an understanding of a wider value set and the parents who send their children here want that experience for them.It also, he believes, has much to teach the wider educational community as it seeks to recover the ground lost during the events of the last year. While the vaccine may eventually put an end to the current crisis, says Hicks, the only certainty about the future is that it will bring more change and uncertainty and so the key to preparing children for what lies ahead is not just fixed knowledge, but the skills to respond to whatever challenges they face.ldquoWe call these the four Crsquos ndash critical thinking, creativity, communication and collaboration. But even these are not enough in themselves. I believe that children also need to learn the qualities of care, compassion, resilience and adaptability.Itrsquos a view that has been set out by IB Director General, Dr Siva Kumari, who speaking to TESin , said: ldquoEducation cannot carry on as before, but must become more skills orientated rather than just knowledge based.And within the current crisis, where exams have been cancelled for the second year in a row, may ultimately lie the key to the way forward, a way in which pupils no longer study just to pass exams but instead embark on quest for learning.ldquoA revived focus on continuous assessment is a step in the right direction, says Hicks. ldquoThe traditional emphasis on a final, one-stop examination does not reflect le beyond schools and university in our modern, ever-changing and currently uncertain world.Along the way he would like to see greater importance given to creative subjects and to physical education, which both have an important role to play in helping young people to thrive and he recognises that sometimes, in a world in which a mastery of technology is the gateway to knowledge, it is the children themselves who have become the educators.ldquoWe have discovered during the pandemic that they are already more skilled in navigating the technological landscape than many of their parents and in some cases their teachers.It is a revelation that sits happily within a school that likes to take a fresh approach to learning.International connections offer unique perspectiveFAIRVIEW International School may be relatively new to Scotland, but it is in fact part of a network of six schools, five of which are in Asia.At Bridge of Allan, as in all Fairview schools, the emphasis is on building a community, not just amongst staff and pupils but also through the involvement of parents in the le of the school.The international status of Fairview offers continuity for families ing to Scotland after living overseas, as well as for local parents who want a dferent school experience for their children.Later this year Fairview will also begin to offer boarding places for children in year seven upwards, either full time or on an occasional basis, providing a warm and nurturing atmosphere at a school where pastoral care is already very high up the curriculum.ldquoWe do have leaders in pastoral care but in fact it is implicit in the way that all of our staff interact with our children, says head teacher, David Hicks.Once restrictions on movement are lted then it is expected that numbers at this young school will grow quickly, when families who have had their plans put on hold finally have the chance to move to Scotland.ldquoLike so many other schools and organisations, our ambitions to grow the school have had to take a back seat to the measures to control Covid infection, but during this period our team of fantastic teachers has done a wonderful job in working with pupils and keeping them engage in learning.As befits its roots in Asia, Mandarin is the second language of the school and every pupil takes lessons.ldquoWe celebrate and develop an interest in international language and cultures, but we believe that Mandarin is a language that is set to become increasingly relevant to the next generation of school-leavers."},{"url":null,"title":"conservatives-set-mini-manifesto-under-funded-north-east","story":"The Scottish Conservatives have drawn up a mini-manesto for the North East ndash focusing on improved funding for local councils and rebuilding the economy as Scotland emerges from the pandemic.The Tories have also revealed figures showing that over a five-year period in the lead-up to the pandemic, businesses in the North East paid pound million more in business rates than the area got back from the SNP Government.Mr Rossrsquos blueprint includes setting up a new North East enterprise agency, helped by pound billion over the next decade, upgrading key roads including dualling the A between Aberdeen and Inverness and improving the A at Laurencekirk and Ellon.:Douglas Ross confirms plan to be double-jobbing MP and MSPThe Conservatives want to push forward plans to reopen local railways, like the Formartine and Buchan Railway and Brechin and Newtonhill stations,they will drive local economic growth.The party are also stressing a need to improve broadband and mobile phone signal by rollout our full fibre broadband across Scotland by .

Nicola Sturgeon and her fellow nationalists used the generational phrasemany times during that campaign, and it was in the SNPrsquos lsquoWhite Paperrsquo. Wrenching constitutional change should surely not be put to the electorate on a regular basis, with the losing side entitled to a re-run every time. A period of constitutional stability would help our recovery from covid and encourage investment in Scotland, and only  per cent of respondents told Survation that constitutional affairs and independence should be a lsquotop threersquo priority.As well as the generational point, though, there is a more immediate reason for the UK Government to avoid being pushed into discussing a new vote: most people in Scotland do not want another referendum in the short term.It is reasonable to suggest that a referendum campaign could be run within two years, and some nationalists seem to believe it could be done much more quickly. We should, therefore, look at whether Scots have an appetite for another vote within that timeframe.Savanta ComRes has asked several times in  when another referendum should be held, and the lsquowithin two yearsrsquo option consistently achieves support of  per cent to  per cent - a signicant proportion, but a long way from a majority. Meanwhile, Opinium recently asked about referendum timing in a iety of scenarios: even in the scenario of the SNP winning a majority at Holyrood, only  per cent chose the two-year option.Nationalists may seek comfort in higher figures for longer-term horizons, such as five years. However, an intriguing aspect of polling on this question is that since  people have never seemed to want another referendum in the short term, even before the current pandemic has made recovery an urgent issue. The two-year barrier is remarkably resilient. In September ,  per cent of respondents told Ipsos Mori that there should be a referendum within two yearsfast forward to March , though, and the proportion answering lsquowithin two yearsrsquo in a Survation poll had dropped to  per cent. Recent research for think tank Onward showed that more Scots think a referendum should be held after  or neverthan support a referendum this year or next .Of course, nationalists tend to want an earlier referendum, and people who want to remain part of the UK do not, but some nationalists seem prepared to wait. More recently, the pandemic is probably a factor, but the data show the two-year barrier was there before covid-.My hypothesis is that people see five years as a long time in politics, but two years as the relatively near future. Many Scots do not necessarily oppose another referendum in theory, with lsquofive years awayrsquo still feeling quite theoretical, but the majority are reluctant to support one within a time horizon with more certainty. Further evidence for this is that when a lsquowithin a yearrsquo option has available in polls, the proportions supporting it have been lower still.Another clue to peoplersquos reticence is in the Survation results from March:  per cent said another referendum would make Scottish society more ided, and only  per cent said it would not. Perhaps most people, having lived through the rancour of the  and  referendum campaigns, are simply unwilling to go through that again soon.If the SNP, and their nationalist partners in the Scottish lsquoGreenrsquo Party, do well enough in the coming election, they will doubtless claim a lsquomandatersquo for another referendum, whatever polls show the majority want. However, people vote for parties for a iety of reasons, and the polling evidence described above is stark. If nationalists demand another referendum, and the UK Government responds with lsquonow is not the timersquo, current evidence suggests it will be the UK Government better reflecting the will of the Scottish people.lsquoOnce in a generationrsquo is a valid argument, but consistent polling on the two-year option adds another reason not to give in to nationalist demands. The Scottish Government should not make any referendum preparations until there is clear and sustained evidence that people in Scotland have changed their minds about timing, and the UK Government should continue to protect us from the ision and distraction which another referendum would bring.Alastair Cameron is a Director of pro-UK campaign group Scotland in Union"},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/11810486.jpg?type=article-full","title":"alex-salmond-alba-party-candidates","story":"The Alba Party will campaign for Scottish Independence and will be seeking to attract voters to its cause - potentially away from the SNP and the Scottish Greens.So far, Mr Salmond said that party will field candidates across Scotland on four of the eight regional lists, seeking to enter Holyrood through proportional respresentation.This would allow the party to gain an MSP in each region it stands in, it secures around ten per cent of the vote - Each addictional member regionseven MSPs each.Alex SalmondWhat is the Alba Party It has been reported that the party was founded in January this year by former TV producer Laurie Flynn, and was registered in February  by the Electoral Commission.At its launch the party said its aims were: \"National Independence for Scotland as an immediate necessity, and overwhelming priority, achieved by democratic means through a vote of people resident in Scotland.\"Its website states thatthe party should getaround half of the SNP list vote this would result in- Alba MSPs.

Let me reiterate that this is not the time for another isive referendum to turn our communities against one another, public health has to come before political ambition.It was a rocky start to the Alex Salmond party, as it will inevitably be called, rather than its official name ldquoAlba. It was a bit Rocky Horror Show too as Mr Salmond emerged from a gloomy set with ghoulish under lighting. The former First Minister stared into space as livestreamed journos delivered questions which were not relayed, initially at least, to the viewing public. As a press conference, it broke new ground in giving the answers but no questions.Alba is being cast as a vehicle for Alex Salmonds ego, which it obviously is ndash all successful politicians are egoists. Its practically a job requirement. But he remains a formidable speaker as he made clear once the technical people got their act together. His campaign launch was a joke, but he is anything but. And Nicola Sturgeon will not be laughing.:What is the Alba Party and who are its candidates This is not Plan B for independence so much as Plan Alex. The idea is to field candidates only on the Holyrood list seats, which are elected on a regional basis from party lists. Owing to the dHondt method of PR used in the Scottish Parliament, the party most successful in the  constituency seats ndash currently the SNP ndash is most unlikely to win many places on the remaining  ldquotop up list seats.Mr Salmond says he is supporting Nicola Sturgeons SNP for the constituency ballotand is only seeking to enhance the independence majority by delivering supportive seats from the list. He talked of helping deliver a ldquosuper-majority of  seats or more. This he believes could force the UK government to relent and allow a referendum, or even independence itself.Its not totally daft. As Mr Salmond pointed out, the UK government has in the past granted independence to colonies and protectorates when their peoples have spoken with a clear voice. The super-majority would, he says, be unanswerable.But what is also unanswerable is that Alex Salmond has emerged from the Holyrood Harassment inquiry with his character stained and his reputation rubbished. Mr Salmond was found innocent of any wrongdoing by a jury, but that is not going to stop journalists, and his former party, repeatedly asking whether he has apologised for his inappropriate behaviour towards women, or suggesting he is not fit for public office.This new venture may do nothing more than perpetuate the civil war in the SNP and split the independence movement in two. Alba may deliver some extra seats, but a house ided is still a house defeated.I have to admit there was a part of me that thought things were about to settle down a bit. The inquiries were over, Nicola Sturgeonrsquos position is much more secure than it was a few weeks ago, and the SNP got their election campaign off to an excellent start with their -per-cent pay rise for health workers.:Alba Party internet address hijacked within hours by internet prankstersBut no. Alex Salmond wasnrsquot finished yet. Quite the opposite: he has announced the launch of a new independence party and, although it had been rumoured for a while, it is still an extraordinary move.

This new party is led by the alpha male of independence with a proven track record for campaigning. That makes a big dference.So what could it do, and what does it mean  First, it is the first proper challenge to the idea that the SNP is the only real party of nationalism and the only serious conduit to independence. Second, it underlines the fissure in the party, with Salmond on one side and Sturgeon on the other. And third, it has the potential to do well, particularlyit attracts signicant support from nationalists who are fed up with what they see as Sturgeonrsquos easy-does-it caution and prefer Salmondrsquos crockery-smashing confidence.The longer-term possibilities are also intriguing. Mr Salmond suggests that his party offers the chance of a super-majority in favour of independence made up of a number of dferent parties. But Irsquom not so sure. A clear-cut, big majority for the SNP would give clear authority to demand another referendum to that extent, the cause would be united. But a pro-independence majority made up of dferent parties, two of which are led by former friends who are now bitter enemies, would be much more fractured and fractious. In other words, campaigners who are busy fighting with each other arenrsquot best placed to win the bigger campaign of independence."},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"March ,  at : pmThe permanent closure of two Orkney household waste recycling centres has been recommended by officers at Orkney Islands Council .

According to the First Minister yesterday, they will remain in the dark for a further ‘few weeks’”.Mr McArthur asked why consultation is only happening now, and why it has presented islanders with a binary choice.In response, the First Minister argued that the nature of the virus and its risk of spreading due to people travelling underpinned this dficult decision, which she therefore wanted to make in partnership with the islands.Commenting after the exchange, Mr McArthur said: “The First Minister has put islanders between a rock and a hard place.#After making clear what the rest of the country can expect, she is offering island communities a stark choice.  Either we remain in Level Three with some prospect of travel to and from the Scottish mainland, or we move to Level Two with severe travel restrictions but still limited opportunity for even small household gatherings.“It’s hard to see how this is consistent with the First Minister’s promise to base decisions on the data and science.  On that measure, Orkney would presumably face a choice between sticking in level  and moving to Level One or even Level Zero.“There is also no mention of the part that pre-departure testing could play in providing added reassurance.  Health Ministers insist plans for such testing are being taken forward, but there is no sign of them being factored into decisions about easing restrictions.“As for the government’s much-vaunted consultation, it’s hard to understand why this didn’t take place before last week’s announcement.

It was then that the first serious air-raid of World War II began, as The Orcadian reported on the following Thursday.#The thunder of the heavy anti-aircraft guns shook Kirkwall houses, rattled windows and domestic utensils. The blast in some cases blew open the wooden shutters of windows, the sashes of which had been opened to avoid being broken by the concussion. The ground quivered when bombs fell considerable distances off.#At least  German aircraft attacked Scapa Flow and HMS Sparrowhawk, the airfield on the outskirts of Kirkwall, but the worst effects of the raid were felt in Stenness. The German claim that airfields at Kirkwall and Stromness were attacked lends weight to the theory that the civilian airfield on the Stromness side of the Bridge of Waithe, used by Gandar Dower before the war, was mistaken for a military target.The eye-witness accounts published in The Orcadian and Orkney Herald, although clearly reworded by the journalists, gives a vivid picture of the evening when everyday surroundings became so terryingly strange.The Bridge of Waithe, which carries the Stromness-Kirkwall road over the sea entrance to the Stenness Loch, gave its name to the little cluster of buildings around the nearby junction with the Orphir Road. The building on the corner became famous after the war as Orkney’s night-club, the Golden Slipper, but in  it was Willie Farquhar’s cobbler’s shop. Like many cobbler’s shops in Orkney, it was a place where men would gather in the evening so Willie and his mother Ellen had begun to sell lemonade, cigarettes and sweets. A young family lived at the other end of the little row: James and Lily Isbister with their three-month old son Neil. Another young family, Alfie and Cathy Linklater with ten-month old Freddie, lived in the house just behind them, at right angles to the road. Isa McLeod was in the house on the other side of the road.The Orcadian interviewed Mrs Ellen Farquhar just a few days after the bombing . . .For the rest of this story, see the current edition of this week#s The Orcadian, or visit Patrica’s website, www.aboutorkneyPatricia Long is a tourist guide based in Stenness, with a particular interest in social history. copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

It is a depressingly all-too familiar sight.“Stagnation” was the term Mr MacKinnon used, and he was spot on.As lives become ever more disconnected from the land, it’s quite understandable why people no longer have the inclination, or time, particularly when there is no great financial . But how it must frustrate those desperate to work the land to see all these crofts going to waste.Survey after survey has demonstrated a huge interest from people wanting to get a foot on the ladder, but they can’t because the traditional avenue of family inheritance is not open to them.The croft tenancies that do come on the market go for astronomical sums, way beyond the reach of young families and completely out of kilter with agricultural potential.And this is the problem, the reason that so many people hold onto non-working crofts is because they can see the pound signs they can see what it might fetch in terms of its housing potential, with estate agents only too happy to downplay the fact that every croft tenancy sale and every de-crofting application has to be approved by the Crofting Commission. It’s not proved too much of an impediment in the past.In fairness to the commission, they have made improvements. As much as the law enables, they do now try and prevent housing speculation – although one recent case in Lochalsh suggests there may be still some way to go. And they have at least made the right noises about dealing with neglect, which has prompted an increase in formal sub-leases and tenancy transfers.But as Mr MacKinnon noted, it is dficult for them to really stamp their authority without the proper resources.So an impasse remains, young families are unable to get access to land while countless crofts go to waste.But there is a solution, evenit will make for an uncomfortable journey: remove the ability to trade tenancies on the open market and at the same time get rid of the right to buy a croft. At a stroke, those motivated purely for monetarywill disappear their incentive gone. Then arm the commission with the necessary resources to properly tackle neglect —rather than the current practice of gentle encouragement without force — and those who have crofts but can’t do the work will have to quickly find a solution. Step forward new entrants.Granted, the opposition to such an approach will likely be signicant. Denying people the opportunity to do with an asset what they please will be seen as anti-libertarian, a curb on personal freedom, and you can easily predict the outrage.But the responsibility of a crofter is not to do as you please. You are part of a unique system of land tenure which was established nearly  years ago to keep people and communities alive. That is still very much of relevance today. Denying those fortunate enough to have crofts from lining their own pockets and ensuring everyone lives up to their duties doesn’t seem an unreasonable expectation in that context.It is expected that, Covid recovery depending, the new term of the Scottish Parliament willto the matter of crofting reformand there is an opportunity here for a proper radical approach which addresses the needs of crofting today but, crucially, with the principles of old at its heart.It will require politicians and leaders of strength and conviction who are able to make a compelling case in the face of undoubted opposition, who can the see the vision that a new, radical approach will bring and who can reject pressure from all sorts of vested interests. The trouble is: there is precious little evidence of that calibre of inidual in Scotland’s political landscape of today.IT SEEMS like only yesterday I was talking about preparing for the winter and here we are with spring on the horizon.

As a result of that, the advice is to constantly use dferent ones and I probably wasn’t as meticulous in this as I should have been, although I know that others too have had increased problems with fluke in the early part of the winter – and it was horrendously wet in November through to December.So the dry, hard frost of a couple of weeks ago was a godsend and it was on such a bracing but beautul morning that we gathered for the scanning, the ground underfoot like uneven concrete.

In the past  months many thousands of people across the U.K. have died of Coronavirus. Tuesday rd March marked the first anniversary of the U.K. lockdown. A National Day of Reflection co-ordinated by Marie Curie was organised and this brought the U.K. together to stop, reflect and remember those who lost their lives to Coronavirus. Volunteers from Broughshane and District Community Association decided to organise their own tribute. Chairman Lexie Scott told the The Ballymena : “Valued members of Broughshanes local community, our voluntary groups, cultural organisations and places of worship came together and laid flowers at our ‘National Day of Reflection’ site at Broughshane’s old police station in remembrance of everyone who had died during the past year”. Mr. Scott continued, “We were overwhelmed by the support we received from so many families and community organisations who came to pay tribute and offer their support by laying dozens of freshly cut bouquets of flowers. So many of us were unable to attend funerals in the past  months, Tuesday gave those a chance to stop, reflect and pay their respects to all those we couldn’t mourn”. Broughshane and District Community Association spokesperson, Sandy Wilson went onto say, “There are still tough times ahead but with the successful rollout of the vaccine across Northern Ireland we in Broughshane, ‘The Garden Village of Ulster’ and across the Braid Valley look forward to much brighter days ahead”.

The book, due out on April , is a series of  interlinked stories set in a caravan on the north Antrim coast. The stories were commissioned by BBC Radio  and combine Jans dark sense of humour and social observation.They’ve been described as charming, eye-opening and sometimes painfully sad as we see each tenant of the caravan park struggle with their own private dramas. The Last Resort observes the dynamics and ersity of the Ireland we live in today, with Jan exploring complex family dynamics, ageing, immigration, gender politics, the decline of the Church and the legacy of the Troubles throughout the stories. Jan wrote short stories on the back of postcards for one of her last short story collections. During the pandemic, she began this practice again, and sent stories to isolated members of the community. Through this, she has struck up a friendship with an elderly man, living and isolating alone in Belfast. These stories eventually became The Last Resort, making him the first reader. Jan says: “The ten part short story series, The Last Resort, ran fon BBC Radio . “I’m probably more proud of this wee series than anything I’ve turned my hand to before. It was not the easiest thing to write. “All ten stories were written in less than eight weeks, at the height of Lockdown, in isolation, very far from the coast. “I was extremely grateful to receive inspirational help from a bunch of wonderful artists who posted me hand drawn pictures of the caravan park I was writing about. “I don’t think Seaclfwould ever have come to le in my head,I hadn’t mapped it out on my dining room wall. “Once I’d finished writing, Michael Shannon, , bust a gut, under less than ideal circumstances, editing, tweaking, sourcing the most amazing crew of Northern Irish actors and recording in-studio, with strict social distancing measures in place. “I loved these stories before the actors got their hands on them. They’re little slices of the North coast I grew up with. I hope they’re familiar to a lot of you. “They help me navigate the weirdest summer and feel a little less alone. When the final recordings came back, I was absolutely blown away by how the programmes had turned out. “It’s a really humbling experience to sit back and listen to ten strangers take your ideas to a place where they seem richer, realer and a hell of a lot funnier, than they were inside your head. I think the actors made something truly remarkable out of these stories, and I want to make sure they get due credit for their creativity. “These are all brilliant, talented and lovely to work with people. Please send lots of work their direction.“Whilst it’s absolutely run of the mill, to watch or listen to UK-wide BBC programmes where every accent is an English accent, it is almost unheard of, to encounter a series which solely showcases Northern Irish talent. I’m particularly delighted to have brought a couple of pure Ballymena accents to the production.”Jan Carson is a writer and community arts facilitator based in East Belfast. Her debut novel Malcolm Orange Disappears and short story collection, Children’s Children, were published by Liberties Press, Dublin.

PA FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueAnd they will have noted the vastly dfering house prices of the areas, with Magherafelt#s lower house prices a likely selling point. Margaret CanningTwitterEmailMarch   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailThe judges of the Sunday Times Best Places to Live list took housing into account as part of their criteria.And they will have noted the vastly dfering house prices of the areas, with Magherafelt#s lower house prices a likely selling point.But back in the housing boom of the years up to , Magherafelt#s Mid-Ulster region had higher prices than Holywood#s North Down.According to the Ulster University#s house price report, in quarter three of , when the market peaked, the average house price in Mid-Ulster was £,, compared to North Down#s £,.The rising prices of the housing market at that time affected every part of Northern Ireland. Locations like Magherafelt were marketed on the basis of their relatively manageable commuting distance to the city.Ulster University#s report now puts the average price in Ards and North Down at £,, while Mid-Ulster#s price is £,.The data from TwentyCi used by the Sunday Times cites an average sale price of £, for Holywood, with an average monthly rent of £.Magherafelt#s is £,, with a monthly rent of £, while Strangford#s is even higher than North Down at £,, but with a lower monthly rent than both other locations - £ per month.Economists are closely watching the housing market to note the continued effect of the pandemic. It defied predictions of a crash with an annual increase of .% to an average of £,, according to the house price index from Land and Property Services. The new world of remote working could enable people now living in Belfast to move to larger, more affordable homes in places like Magherafelt, while still working for businesses in the city. Such a trend could mean even greater price increases for those areas.Tim Palmer, Best Places to Live judge and writer, said: The trend towards working from home opens up all kinds of opportunities for people who#ve had to stay close to Belfast or Londonderry Derry.That could mean gravitating towards Strangford Lough or Ballycastle, or looking for value in a place like Magherafelt, which has plenty to offer beside reasonable house prices. He added: Affordability is an issue all over the UK, but the way to deal with it is not for places to keep their strengths hidden or even hold back from reaching their true potential. Instead it#s to make sure that we#re building enough affordable and social housing so that local people aren#t ever priced out of the places they think of as home.Even though Ards and North Down borough isn#t the most expensive council area to buy a house, Holywood still has some of our priciest homes. That#s led to the North Down area often being referred to Northern Ireland#s #Gold Coast#.For example, a four-bed detached home in Magherafelt#s Derramore Heights costs £,. But a similar four bed detached Old Holywood Road in Holywood is £,. There are plenty of homes in the area with a £m price-tag, too - something which isn#t too frequent in other parts of Northern Ireland.Belfast Related ContentPlayNorthern IrelandRevealed: Three best places to live in Northern Ireland according to Sunday Times guideIt#s well-loved by inhabitants but it hasn#t necessarily been high up on any outsider#s list of desirable places to live - until now, that is.PlayNorthern Ireland Premium#Magherafelt is a small place that#s big in heart and atmosphere#Bursting with independent businesses, home to the best school in Northern Ireland and situated in the heart of Mid Ulster - there#s certainly lots to love about Magherafelt.

Magherafelt is a new entry, lauded by the judges as supremely practical. Holywood, however, with its languid coastal glamour and frequent trains to Belfast, has graced the list before.The guide is released online today and will be available in the newspaper on Sunday. Mark Bain, honorary Magherafelt man and former editor of local paper the Mid-Ulster Mail, said it#s a close-knit town where he#s known as the boy from the Mid. But he said its recognition was surprising, in a way, because it tends to be one of those forgotten towns. One of the best things,you#re in Magherafelt, is you#re halfway between Derry and Belfast. You have all the countryside around you but you#re not in the countryside. You do have all the big town facilities and you#re only  minutes from Portrush and Portstewart.You can have town le, city le, country le, all rolled into one, which is something people around here like.Read More#Magherafelt is a small place that#s big in heart and atmosphere#Mid-Ulster houses once topped North Down for pricesSailing, trainspotting and llama trekking all on offerMr Bain, now our education correspondent, added: You also have two of the best schools in Rainey Endowed and St Mary#s, which are constantly top of the ladder and produce excellent results year in year out.The town also had a friendly attitude and was more laid back than Belfast. You also have all the rolling hills and countryside of the Sperrins, and the new A road has been great and takes  minutes off the journey to Belfast. You have great local retailers like Cuddys department store and JC Stewarts grocery store. The town#s Secrets Nightclub has also drawn younger people, he said. While it does have a KFC, he says you have to visit Antrim or Cookstown for a McDonald#s or Burger King. It#s untouched by those big companies and you have a lot of independent, locally-owned stores - which is a wee bit like Holywood.Mr Bain, who is from Lisburn, said: Lisburn  or  years ago is like how Magherafelt is now because it does still have that friendliness and personal touch.Sunday Times property editor Helen Davies acknowledged Holywood seems to be unshtable as NI#s premier address.

FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueFormer first minister Alex Salmond has been unveiled as the new leader of the Alba Party. By Katrine Bussey, PA Scotland Political EditorMarch   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailScotland’s former first minister Alex Salmond is seeking to make a dramaticto Holyrood, as the leader of the new pro-independence Alba Party.Mr Salmond confirmed he will be standing for the party on the North East regional list section in May’s Scottish Parliament election.Launching the new party in an online event, the former SNP leader said: “Today Alba are hoisting a flag in the wind, planting our Saltire on a hill. In the next few weeks we will see how many will rally to our standard.”The launch of his party comes after a turbulent period for the SNP and the Scottish Government, led by Mr Salmond’s successor Nicola Sturgeon.He accused senior figures within the SNP of mounting a conspiracy against him, after he successfully challenged the way the Government handled harassment claims made against him by two women.A Holyrood inquiry into the Government’s botched handling of those complaints was critical of both Ms Sturgeon and her administration, as it concluded the two complainers were “badly let down”.Mr Salmond was last year cleared after a criminal trial of a series of allegations, including a charge of attempted rape.He insisted on Friday that after the series of court cases and inquiries, it is now “time to move on”.“I have wanted to talk about the future of Scotland for the last three years. Now I have got the opportunity thanks to the Alba Party,” he said.“That’s what I intend to do, and I intend to do it in an entirely positive way.”He said the party has been set up to win seats using Holyrood’s regional lists.\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk b .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_aca-be-f-af-afdabdd_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk b .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_aca-be-f-af-afdabdd_embedded w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeClose\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk b .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_aca-be-f-af-afdabdd_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk b .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_aca-be-f-af-afdabdd_embedded w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"Alex Salmond was cleared of a series of sexual assault charges after a trial at the High Court in Edinburgh, which concluded in March last year. PA FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueAlex Salmond was cleared of a series of sexual assault charges after a trial at the High Court in Edinburgh, which concluded in March last year. The proportional representation system at Holyrood sees MSPs elected from constituencies, with additional members elected from eight regional lists in a bid to ensure each party’s total number of MSPs is in proportion to the percentage of votes it receives.While the SNP has been successful in winning constituency seats, Mr Salmond said his former party could end up with no MSPs at all from the regional section of the ballot.The latest opinion polls suggest the SNP on the lists “would win no seats whatsoever, despite having the best part of a million votes”, he said.This would mean these votes are “totally wasted”, he said.Mr Salmond continued: “The Alba Party is a list party, we are standing only on the list, we’re not challenging the SNP in the constituency.“Indeed we are saying vote SNP or for an independence party on the constituency section, we are giving that support.”He said his new party will help “reinforce the momentum behind the independence cause”.The Alba Party has said it will field at least four candidates in each of the regional lists.Alex Salmond Statement https:t.co wIATOmfuv— Alba PartyMarch , Chris McEleny, who was voted in as an SNP councillor in Inverclyde, has resigned from Ms Sturgeon’s party to stand in the West of Scotland for the Alba Party.Mr Salmond said: “Over the next six weeks we will promote new ideas about taking Scotland forward, giving primacy to economic recovery from the pandemic and the achievement of independence for our country.“We expect to field a minimum of four candidates in each regional list and we’re hoping to elect Alba MSPs from every area of Scotland.”Mr Salmond said the aim of the party is to work towards a “successful, socially just, environmentally responsible, independent country”.The launch of the party comes days after Mr Salmond announced plans to take legal action over the “conduct” of the Scottish Government’s top civil servant Leslie Evans.He said the Permanent Secretary failed to take “real responsibility” for failings highlighted in two reports this week about the Government’s investigation of harassment complaints against him.PAMost ReadClosure of NI jewellers Shannon#s leads to auction of diamond rings and luxury watches West Belfast funeral subject to PSNI probe for potential Covid restrictionsRevealed: Three best places to live in Northern Ireland according to Sunday Times guideOrange Order pulls out of cross-border project as anger over NI Protocol mounts#Brits# forced my ancestor to flee Ireland: Joe BidenTop VideosPlayMagherafelt rated one of Northern Ireland#s top places to livePlayVideo: #You#re absolutely right# - MP Sammy Wilson#s apparent response to #get the ethnics out# commentPlayHealth Minister warns of potential for third virus surgeLatest UKBrian May’s driver in court on child sexual abuse chargesLatest weekly Covid- rates for local authority areas in EnglandMan jailed for murdering friend by running him over after argument in pubOutdoor sports clubs in England brace for influx of players from MondayNon-essential retailers able to open until pm when rules ease, says JenrickLatest from Belfast Judge spares man prison over attack outside Belfast wine barAlex Scott hopes WSL TV deal can ‘plant seeds’ of future generation of playersCommission clears France of complicity in Rwanda genocideMarcus Rashford and Bukayo Saka out of England qualiersJonny Bairstow insists England will continue to be aggressive and hit maximums,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Minister Dodds was responding to an Assembly question from McLaughlin, asking the minister to confirm her support for the commitment to Magee campus expanding to , students in the New Decade, New Approach agreement. In her response Minister Dodds said expansion at UU’s Magee Campus is already in motion, not least through the Executive’s decision to progress and fund the UU Medical School project as well as other actions proposed by the University. She insisted that further expansion is not something that can be delivered overnight but would be long-term in nature and dependent on a number of factors. googletag.cmd.push Minister Dodds added: One of the biggest challenges faced in such long-term planning is the overall funding situation of the University Sector within Northern Ireland, which without additional funding support from the Executive Support will constrain the University’s ability to grow further and get to anappropriate regional balance across all of its campuses. The absence to date of long-term budget settlements and lack of sightline on additional long-term funding to the Northern Ireland University sector is a further impediment on the ability of the University, and DfE, to work in partnership to deliver what we all wish to see which is expansion of the University within the context of attaining such regional balance. googletag.cmd.push New Decade, New Approach was the agreement that enabled Stormont to get back into operation a year ago. Sinead McLaughlin said: It contained a specic commitment to the Magee expansion, which was inserted at the insistence of the SDLP. I am appalled at the failure of minister Dodds to confirm her support for this. But I am sadly not surprised, as it is consistent with other recent comments from the minister. It is essential that ministers adopt policies and programmes that enable commitments in NDNA to be implemented, she added. McLaughlin meanwhilewelcomed the Pivotal think-tanks report proposing an expansion of higher education provision, which was positive of the Magee expansion.     McLaughlin commented: The Pivotal report confirmed what the SDLP has been saying repeatedly for decades - that it is essential that the number of university places in Northern Ireland is increased substantially. We have a brain drain which damages the economy, deprives our society of people who would make our society a better place and which separates families. What is more, we need those extra student places in Derry, where we have a much smaller proportion of university students to the rest of the population than other cities across Ireland. A big increase in student population in Derry would be the basis for the positive transformation of our city that all of Derry wants.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The Derry  Commemoration Committee has encouraged all republicans to attend the annual Easter Commemoration in the city this year. Comprised of ‘inidual republicans opposed to the occupation of Ireland’, the group has invited people to gather on Monday, April , at the gates of the City Cemetery. The event will take place two weeks before the anniversary of Lyra McKee. It comes a week after Saoradh announced that it would hold an online National Easter Commemoration, as it did last year. googletag.cmd.push It also follows a controversial search and arrest operation in Creggan where political representatives and community groups criticised ‘heavy handed’ police tactics. In a statement, the  Committee said: “While Saoradh and the Derry  Commemoration Committee are not inexplicably linked, Saoradh will lend their support to the event on Easter Monday. “Join with us to honour those who gave their lives in Ireland’s freedom struggle and rededicate ourselves to the ongoing struggle for a  County Socialist Republic.” It added that due to the ongoing Covid pandemic it encourages all those attending to wear face coverings. DUP MLA for Foyle, Gary Middleton, believes the decision to hold the event is a ‘clear challenge’ to police by dissident republicans and an announcement via press release that the group intends to ‘break the law’. googletag.cmd.push He said: The Covid regulations on public gatherings are very clear and they will be in place over the Easter weekend. “I will be speaking to PSNI in the city about how they intend to respond to this event. “There have been repeated attempts by these groups to impose themselves across the city and even in recent days they have been behind rioting and disturbances. “There must be a clear and united response from all political representatives in opposition to their attempts to drag Northern Ireland backwards. Speaking to the Derry News, SDLP MLA Mark H Durkan said he intended to raise the issue during a meeting with the PSNI.     “I would have concerns in terms of its compliance with Covid regulations and the potential risk it poses to the wider community,” he explained. “I also have concerns, given the fact that tensions are undoubtedly high in that area after events last week when the police certainly didn’t cover themselves in glory, I would hope that this change of plans isn’t an attempt to antagonise. “Could it actually increase tensions in the area. That’s the last thing anyone wants, especially people living in Creggan. “The police service needs to be sensible in the way it approaches this as well. “But I think efforts should certainly be made to make the organisers and proposers of this event to see a bit of sense. “A lot of people have had to change how they do things over the past year and maybe they should be mindful of how they might be able to do that themselves.” Chief Superintendent Darrin Jones reminded the public that Coronavirus regulations remain in place and include restrictions on movement and on gatherings. “We will continue to engage, explain and encourage compliance with the Regulations, and where and when necessary move to enforcement,” he added. Meanwhile, a spokesperson for Derry City and Strabane District Council, which owns the cemetery, said compliance with the restrictions put in place by the NI Executive is a matter for the PSNI. “Council continues to advise and encourage all users of the cemetery to comply fully with the government regulations and are hopeful that anyone intending to visit the Cemetery over the Easter period would be mindful of the regulations and their responsibilities to keep the public safe during this pandemic,” she added.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Your th birthday is always supposed to be a special one, a memorable one, where you celebrate in a way you wouldn’t celebrate any others – just to prove to yourself that you’re still quite young, when the truth of the matter is that your best days are probably behind you. This time last year I had taken a week’s holidays in honour of my big day, and I had plans, big plans – but they were wiped out by something none of us has never experienced before, and I’m not talking about a warm day in Derry or a job offer with WWE. googletag.cmd.push Covid- had arrived a few days earlier and we were all living with the fear of the unknown. We weren’t allowed to visit our friends or family, we were only allowed a certain distance from our own houses and we were advised to start wearing masks. It was scary stuff at the time. So instead of going for a day away, planning a two-hour massage, or even going to the cinema , I was sat on the sofa playing FIFA . I was in the middle of winning the Champions League, and breaking Barcelona hearts yet again, when my phone rang. The long and short of that call was this – I was put on furlough for ‘six weeks’. googletag.cmd.push This was devastating to me as, mingled with the fear of the virus, everything was collapsing around me – It was easy to catastrophise in that moment, and I did suffer for a few hours, thinking my job was gone – what a th birthday present. As a sports reporter, I knew I was up against it. How could I do my job when there was no sport to cover  Yet for it to all happen so quickly took me by surprise and I was shocked and hurt by the sudden change in my circumstances, professionally and personally. Something I have learned over recent years however is that it’s all about mindset. We only give power to our thoughts depending on how we react in any given situation. It is natural to be upset, and afraid, butwe can bounce back quickly, we are all the better for it.     If we can stop those irrational thoughts in their tracks and look at situations more realistically, we have a better chance of coping with bad news. It is dficult, but a healthy habit to get into. Talking to a friend, a partner, a family member – anyone really, about how you feel can help massively, evenyour instinct is to hide away and let those thoughts carry you away. Talking is what I did, and with supportive words from a few good friends, I faced the situation head on. Those six weeks, which ultimately turned into three months, were some of the best weeks I have had in years. It is easy to forget how to live these days. If we’re not rushing to leave the wains at school, we’re rushing to work, worrying about bills and running errands of all sorts – we tick all the boxes of how we’re all supposed to spend our daily lives.Having three months off with no deadlines, no pressure, no work-related stress was alien to me, so I did something I hadn’t done regularly in years. I walked. Remember the weather in the first lockdown  It was perfect. So I took a book off my neglected bookshelf, and I walked the back roads around Sherf’s Mountain. Every time I told someone I was out walking reading they thought I was mad and that I was a cert to be plowed down by a passing carI wasn’t careful. That didn’t stop me – I took my sweet time about it, and I read as I walked and I walked as I read. I spent hours on those roads, getting fresh air that I hadn’t experienced in years, and catching up to something I have loved all my le in reading. I would find a nice spot and sit in the sun and read and then I would walk some more.  The Covid circumstances aside, it was perfection. And I’ll tell you another thing. When Covid hit I was in agony with my leg and hip, so much so that it was a real struggle to get up off the sofa or walk up a set of stairs. It had only been getting worse. Within a few weeks of walking every day – and I’m not talking ridiculous miles here – the pain had gone completely and I was like a new man. I may have looked like a hobo with a multi-coloured beard, but I was feeling better, physically and mentally, than I had in literally years. I remember saying it then and I’ll repeat it now – it felt like my le was on hold, and I was all the better for it. I know people will empathise with that. I had been putting too much focus in the wrong areas and I was suffering because of it. My priorities were all wrong. We’ve all heard of self-care, but do we understand what it means  For me it was walking, reading and fresh air, something that I could have realistically done every day. I had just forgotten how to do it, or more accurately, that I needed to do it. I felt like Morgan Freeman at the end of the Shawshank Redemption – walking those Maine roads as he fulfilled his promise to his friend Andy – I felt the freedom that only a free man could feel. And I was free – for the time being. If I wasn’t walking with my book, I was walking with my wains, and it I wasn’t doing either of those things, I was walking with friends, social distancing of course. I knew I would get the call toto work, and I knew I would be devastated when I did. That came in June and I was back at it – but I was back at it with a new attitude- evenit took me a while to get fully back at it – I can still have pride in my work and do a good job without making it the be all and end all. If Covid has taught us anything, it is the importance of ourselves, of our family, and of friends we’ve lost and friends we still have. Those are really the only things that matter.  I started this piece aiming to reflect on the dficulties of a sports reporter working in a world with no sport. That has been hard – but it has also been rewarding. So many local teams have gone above and beyond to help out in the community, and their creativity in keeping themselves fit and active over the past year has been inspiring. That team spirit has never wavered despite the lack of competition, and there have been so many examples of the importance and the power of sport in our lives. Sport itself is self-care. Training is self-care. Being with team mates is self-care. Covid has tried to take that and so much more away from us, but, as we see a small light at the end of a long tunnel, we know that it has only strengthened us. For me, that strength came simply from rediscovering something which I had lost. For you it could be music, running, painting or swimming. Whatever it is, when this finally comes to an end, please make room for it. Please remember what it is about le that you actually enjoy. It’s not a race to get the bills paid or the wains to bed so you can relax for a few hours. It’s about making time for yourself, doing what’s right for your mind and your body and enjoying ourselves while we’re still young. I’m back at work a while now, but I am still making time for walking – it really clears the head and blows the cobwebs of a day aside. I’m now , but as long as I can walk those roads and read my book , I’ll be doing myself a massive favour. Take care of yourself, every day. No one  is going to do it for you.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

To get on a Derry team from the city, you need to have that belief in yourself and Brian Óg had it.” Brian Óg in action as captain of Derrys U Development squad. McLaughlin recalls his charm and charisma and how he instantly changed once he crossed the white line. “The first thing I think of when I think of Brian Óg was the wide smile he had...he had a smile that would disarm you,” McLaughlin proudly states. “He knew what he was about and was a brilliant relationship person. He seemed to get on great with everybody, until he walked onto a pitch and this warrior turned up.” At Carnhill, McLaughlin had an unwritten rule. Pupils were only allowed out for soccer gamesthey also played Gaelic football. It was a two way street and Brian Óg committed to the soccer team. His sheer athleticism saw him break into the starting  as a dynamic winger. But GAA was always his number one. “He roamed all over the pitch,” McLaughlin said of Brian Ógs role between centre back and midfield. “That was him, giving his everything in every minute of every game. He had an energy about him, boys would connect with it and it would help drive them on as well.” As a  year-old, he played on the Steelstown minor side that reached the A championship final. “He was great in the semi-final against Bellaghy and in the final against Dungiven, despite being so young,” recalls Neil Forester. He marked Richard Ferris on his senior debut. Ferris, who managed Derry minors in what wouldve been Brian Ógs final year, placed a Derry flag on his grave on the morning of their championship clash at the nearby Celtic Park. Michael McLaughlin, a Sean Dolans man, recalls the club banter hed have with Brian Óg. Hed tease Brian Óg about Steelstowns lack of titles. “Who wants to be playing junior football,” Brian Óg would jibe back. Carnhill needed the loan of Dolans minor kit for a game with St Pauls Kilrea. After coaxing Brian Óg to wear the jersey, McLaughlins next struggle was getting him to stand in the team photo. “Eventually he did, with his hand over the Dolans crest,” McLaughlin laughs. “It was one of Brian Ógs best ever games and I told him it was because of the kit.” By that stage, Brian Óg was emerging into development squads and hed later captain Derry at U level. His reputation and energy on the run made him a marked man. That day the Kilrea boys were hopping off him as he carried the fight for underdogs Carnhill. McLaughlin can still see one such tackle. After riding one challenge he was met by two more opponents before going to ground. Picking himself up and arms aloft, he gave a huge roar letting everyone know he still had the ball. “We were six down,” McLaughlin states. “The Kilrea boys were looking at him like he was mad, our boys were looking at him like he was mad.” That was the energy everyone around him fed off. For Brian Óg, it was always about the battle. Every year since , McLaughlin hosts an U school blitz in his memory, hosted at Steelstown with the McKeever family putting up the medals and food. It was fitting when Carnhill won it in the first year. *** Kevin Francis grew up around the corner from McKeevers. They were best buddies and it was Brian Óg who coaxed him into Steelstown. “Anything we did revolved around the ONeills ball,” remembers Francis. After school theyd hop over the fence and into the nearby Templemore Sports Complex. “Brian Óg would be in his shorts and t-shirt no matter what the weather was. To do otherwise would test his masculinity,” Kevin remembers. Theyd walk home under the shadow of darkness. To and fro the ball zipped. Kick-pass after kick-pass in search of perfection. Every minute of the evening was squeezed out. Kevin Francisbeside Brian Óg on a winning Steelstown team. “Ógie always said we had to do  kick passes in a row andyou dropped the ball youd start again,” Kevin recalls. The target climbed to  and then . No matter how far the count rose, their stubbornness would crush the score to zero. Getting close wasnt an option. Brian Óg was captain of their club team as it moved up the grades. He fostered a siege mentality into the camp, that country boys saw them as soft because they were from the city. “We had to go out of our way to prove that wasnt the case...he hammered that into us. He always had those leadership characteristics.” he added. Off the pitch, Kevin describes him as witty and mad. He wasnt a follower and would never break character. “If you were wearing a pair of jeans or a shirt that was in anyway flamboyant, hed make a point of telling you,” he jokes. “He had this reputation of being an upcoming star, but even outside the Gaelic circles he was popular around the streets. He made a point of not letting anybody walk over him or his teammates.” Those he stood up to in the blue of Steelstown, were his team-mates for Derry as he took his leadership to another level. *** Pier jumping in Buncrana on a Saturday afternoon was another piece in Brian Óg McKeevers puzzle. It was there, on the beach, he met girlfriend Clare Duffy. “He was a bit more romantic than his Gaelic friends knew. That was a bit of him that nobody really knew, he was a big softie,” Clare states. Brian Óg and girlfriend Clare Duffy. “He would have been very much into holding hands...its strange now , he was so young and old fashioned.” McKeever, as she called him, wangled a job in the red tourist buses in Derry. Hed save his money and buy Clare gts, with their friend Aoe Moore among his fashion advisers. “He wouldve been very generous,” Aoe remembers. “The rest of the girls would almost be waiting for a Monday morning at school in Thornhill, looking on with envy at outfits, jewellery and shoes.” Clares mother approved of Brian Óg. He didnt drink and had the discipline required to pursue a footballing career. Her daughter was safe in his hands. “He had wee funny one liners, a very naturally funny person, but he was signicantly more sensible than me,” Clare adds. “We got to go to Oxygen and festivals together. I was only goingBrian Óg was there and we went on holidays together.” In April , he was diagnosed with Leukaemia. After two rounds of chemotherapy, he got out of hospital for his brother Colms st birthday. Radiotherapy followed and in August, in another throw of the dice, his other brother Niall turned out to be a match for a bone marrow operation. At first it seemed to be a success. Joe Brolly had visited him in hospital and arranged tickets to that years All-Ireland football final in Croke Park. Brian senior fondly recalls the enjoyable day out at Croke Park, with a meal on the way home. Days later, a routine check broke the worst news possible. Brian Ógs system was beginning to shut down and he had just six weeks to live. “He was told he was going to die, he was very selfless in the things that he did,” Clare said. “He was a real old soul, it is hard to believe he had the attitude that he did.” Aoe remembers how they arranged a rota of sorts among his friends to support Brian Ógs family in the hospital. “We never wanted him to be alone on any of the days,” Aoe remembers. “He was so thoughtful. Even when he was sick, hed make sure we were all okay,” Clare adds. She was by his side every Wednesday afternoon and all weekend. It coincided with weighing up their career choices and someone remarked to Clare that shed make a good nurse. She followed up on the advice and is now working as a nurse. Because of Brian Óg. “I now work with people in the same situation and am giving something back. Now I know what I know from where I work, its hard to believe he did the stuff he did.” On the day Mickey Harte broke his arm after a car crash, he was in the McKeever home later that evening and Clare speaks of them reciting the rosary together. Brian Dooher, also a past pupil of St Columbs Derry, brought the Sam Maguire Cup to the house. Brian Óg was selfless, rarely letting his guard down during his suffering. Instead, he was on the one with the smile, assuring everyone hed be fine. There was always a concern for others. None more so than two weeks before his death. Against advice, he attended Clares school formal. He was never going to miss it. Complete with spats, tuxedo and a white scarf, he dressed as Frank Sinatra and danced the night away. It was Clares night and he was going to be there for her. Returning home, his energy was spent. After struggling up the stairs, it would be his last outing. Brian Óg passed away at home surrounded by his family. While there is sorrow in his loss, he leaves a considerable imprint. In his  years, he brought so much joy to the many he met. Steelstown await the day they translate their three narrow intermediate final defeats into the elation of a first title. The number five jersey retired in his memory will be absent, but Brian Óg will be looking down on them. And smiling. Son. Brother. Footballer. Friend. Legend. He will forever be remembered.\",\"keywords\":\"Steelstown,GAA,Derry,Brian Óg McKeever,Gaelic football\",\"articleSection\":\"Home\",\"publisher\":,\"image\":,\"description\":\"Brian Oacuteg McKeever wouldve turned  last Saturday.

Reporter: Michael McMullan::  Mar   addthis, Brian Oacuteg McKeever wouldve turned  last Saturday. Tragically, with the prospect of a stellar football career and le in front of him, he was taken far too soon, after losing his battle with leukaemia at the age of . His memory lives on in the Steelstown club named in his honour and by those who knew him. Michael McMullan writes...There were two sides to Brian Oacuteg McKeever, both fusing to leave a lasting legacy. The flame-haired warrior took his football extremely seriously, yet, on the flip side, didnt take himself too seriously off the field. Among Steelstowns founder members was Derrys first ever All-Star, Anthony McGurk.In the days after Brian Oacutegs death, Steelstown chairman Michael Heffernan sat in the kitchen of Brian and Maacuteire McKeevers home, tabling a proposal to rename the club as Steelstown Brian Oacutegs. Its just one testament. But its a fitting one. There is immense pride in their voice, as his parents speak of Brian Oacuteg, the brother of their older sons Colm and Niall. Losing a family member shakes hard, especially one with so much left to give. googletag.cmd.push From chatting to Brian Oacutegs friends, the memories effortlessly flood back. The goosebumps rise on the neck as glowing tributes and stories roll off the tongue. His popularity is an immeasurable legacy. More than any medal collection. Brian Oacuteg McKeever wouldve turned  last Saturday. Childhood friend and neighbour, Kevin Francis, said he wouldve rather risked a broken jaw in the Steelstown cause than face Brian Oacutegs wrath for pulling out of a tackle. As a leader, he inspired those around him. Michael McLaughlin, who taught and coached him at St Brigids Colaacuteiste Bhriacutede Carnhill, considered it an honour to be asked to speak about Brian Oacuteg. googletag.cmd.push Aoe Moore, one of his closest friends, said he was like nobody she ever met. A comedian, an agony aunt and a loyal friend, all rolled into one. “He was very much his own person,” Aoe highlights. “Teenagers try to like other things and be like others. He wasnt like that, he lived his le in Celtic tracksuits and GAA gear.” Brian Oacuteg wasnt a follower. Anything but. While others spent their Friday and Saturday nights tippling on a bottle of cider or a bag of cans, Brian Oacuteg refrained. Football was more important. Conor McGoran, who played on the same Steelstown teams, said that in the simplest of terms Brian Oacuteg was the main man. A warrior, with an innate ability to make people laugh.     Another close friend Cathal Meehan was the brunt of many of Brian Oacutegs jokes. Brian Oacuteg discovered Cathal English, as he was known, sleepwalking during a family holiday in Nice, roaring over him in the middle of the night. Brian Oacuteg freaked out and demanded he tie himself to the bed for the rest of the holiday. The list of stories is endless. His girlfriend, Clare Duffy, is now a nurse specialising in cancer care. Brian Oacuteg is the reason. He shaped the direction of her le. An old-fashioned romantic, hed hold hands and walk ahead to open a door. How many budding sportsmen have a stamp collection  Brian Oacuteg did. Hed have turned up to a dance night in Derrys Nerve Centre with a tracksuit on. It wasnt about blending in. Long hair and shirts, he said, made you look soft. He was a short back and sides man. He loved hooped football socks and wore them up to his knees. Hed tell everyone it was the Gaelic boys style. Nearly everywhere he went, an ONeills football would be under his arm, not exactly the fashion accessory of choice in Derry city. The thud of the bouncing ball wouldve been heard around the corner before his wide, mischievous grin would come into view. He loved dressing up at Halloween, as Willy Wonka or a Gladiator, with his mother Maacuteire fashioning the costumes. He laughed like a hyena. While he lived in the city, he had a country head on his shoulders with an unquenchable thirst for GAA. He was a gaeilgeoir and attended Bunscoil Cholmcille. During his illness, he sat and achieved a grade A in his Irish A-Level Oral exam in hospital. Hed go to mass every Sunday, not the norm for everyone his age. On the Saturday nights in, during his illness battle, and with karaoke often the pastime of choice, hed belt out Coldplays Fix You. There was so much behind the bravado of Brian Oacuteg the footballer, something for everyone to learn from. He was a gt to everyone lucky enough to have known him. *** The St Brigids Colaacuteiste Bhriacutede teams trained at Leafair, which is far from a GAA stronghold. Just off Derrys Glengalliagh Road, it comprises two council soccer pitches. Michael McLaughlin remembers Brian Oacuteg, as the sole first year coming across from the Irish part of the school to join the school GAA team. He can still see Brian Oacuteg walking past an abandoned car rammed into the goalposts. There was a strut and a determination about him. McLaughlin was sorry to see him leave Carnhill after fth year, but taking his game to the next level in the MacLarnon Cup with St Columbs Derry was the right move. Brian Oacutegs number five school jersey still hangs in the Carnhill entrance hall. He was deemed too young for the Derry minor  when still an U and the following year he was tipped to make the . He had battled his way back from glandular fever that kept him out of the MacLarnon group stages. His coach Eamonn Burns remembers Brian Oacuteg playing a stormer after coming on as a sub in their semi-final and held his place for the final. Burns speaks of his pace with a great ability to read the game. His brain was a step ahead allowing him to beat an opponent to the ball. Within a month of his heroic display in a two-point final defeat, Brian Oacuteg was diagnosed with leukaemia and missed out on the Derry minor squad. “He wouldve played minor and definitely wouldve made the Us,” Michael McLaughlin states before pondering to himselfhed have made the breakthrough to inter-county senior level. “In my heart and in my head...I would say yes. To get on a Derry team from the city, you need to have that belief in yourself and Brian Oacuteg had it.” Brian Oacuteg in action as captain of Derrys U Development squad. McLaughlin recalls his charm and charisma and how he instantly changed once he crossed the white line. “The first thing I think of when I think of Brian Oacuteg was the wide smile he had...he had a smile that would disarm you,” McLaughlin proudly states. “He knew what he was about and was a brilliant relationship person. He seemed to get on great with everybody, until he walked onto a pitch and this warrior turned up.” At Carnhill, McLaughlin had an unwritten rule. Pupils were only allowed out for soccer gamesthey also played Gaelic football. It was a two way street and Brian Oacuteg committed to the soccer team. His sheer athleticism saw him break into the starting  as a dynamic winger. But GAA was always his number one. “He roamed all over the pitch,” McLaughlin said of Brian Oacutegs role between centre back and midfield. “That was him, giving his everything in every minute of every game. He had an energy about him, boys would connect with it and it would help drive them on as well.” As a  year-old, he played on the Steelstown minor side that reached the A championship final. “He was great in the semi-final against Bellaghy and in the final against Dungiven, despite being so young,” recalls Neil Forester. He marked Richard Ferris on his senior debut. Ferris, who managed Derry minors in what wouldve been Brian Oacutegs final year, placed a Derry flag on his grave on the morning of their championship clash at the nearby Celtic Park. Michael McLaughlin, a Sean Dolans man, recalls the club banter hed have with Brian Oacuteg. Hed tease Brian Oacuteg about Steelstowns lack of titles. “Who wants to be playing junior football,” Brian Oacuteg would jibe back. Carnhill needed the loan of Dolans minor kit for a game with St Pauls Kilrea. After coaxing Brian Oacuteg to wear the jersey, McLaughlins next struggle was getting him to stand in the team photo. “Eventually he did, with his hand over the Dolans crest,” McLaughlin laughs. “It was one of Brian Oacutegs best ever games and I told him it was because of the kit.” By that stage, Brian Oacuteg was emerging into development squads and hed later captain Derry at U level. His reputation and energy on the run made him a marked man. That day the Kilrea boys were hopping off him as he carried the fight for underdogs Carnhill. McLaughlin can still see one such tackle. After riding one challenge he was met by two more opponents before going to ground. Picking himself up and arms aloft, he gave a huge roar letting everyone know he still had the ball. “We were six down,” McLaughlin states. “The Kilrea boys were looking at him like he was mad, our boys were looking at him like he was mad.” That was the energy everyone around him fed off. For Brian Oacuteg, it was always about the battle. Every year since , McLaughlin hosts an U school blitz in his memory, hosted at Steelstown with the McKeever family putting up the medals and food. It was fitting when Carnhill won it in the first year. *** Kevin Francis grew up around the corner from McKeevers. They were best buddies and it was Brian Oacuteg who coaxed him into Steelstown. “Anything we did revolved around the ONeills ball,” remembers Francis. After school theyd hop over the fence and into the nearby Templemore Sports Complex. “Brian Oacuteg would be in his shorts and t-shirt no matter what the weather was. To do otherwise would test his masculinity,” Kevin remembers. Theyd walk home under the shadow of darkness. To and fro the ball zipped. Kick-pass after kick-pass in search of perfection. Every minute of the evening was squeezed out. Kevin Francisbeside Brian Oacuteg on a winning Steelstown team. “Oacutegie always said we had to do  kick passes in a row andyou dropped the ball youd start again,” Kevin recalls. The target climbed to  and then . No matter how far the count rose, their stubbornness would crush the score to zero. Getting close wasnt an option. Brian Oacuteg was captain of their club team as it moved up the grades. He fostered a siege mentality into the camp, that country boys saw them as soft because they were from the city. “We had to go out of our way to prove that wasnt the case...he hammered that into us. He always had those leadership characteristics.” he added. Off the pitch, Kevin describes him as witty and mad. He wasnt a follower and would never break character. “If you were wearing a pair of jeans or a shirt that was in anyway flamboyant, hed make a point of telling you,” he jokes. “He had this reputation of being an upcoming star, but even outside the Gaelic circles he was popular around the streets. He made a point of not letting anybody walk over him or his teammates.” Those he stood up to in the blue of Steelstown, were his team-mates for Derry as he took his leadership to another level. *** Pier jumping in Buncrana on a Saturday afternoon was another piece in Brian Oacuteg McKeevers puzzle. It was there, on the beach, he met girlfriend Clare Duffy. “He was a bit more romantic than his Gaelic friends knew. That was a bit of him that nobody really knew, he was a big softie,” Clare states. Brian Oacuteg and girlfriend Clare Duffy. “He would have been very much into holding hands...its strange now , he was so young and old fashioned.” McKeever, as she called him, wangled a job in the red tourist buses in Derry. Hed save his money and buy Clare gts, with their friend Aoe Moore among his fashion advisers. “He wouldve been very generous,” Aoe remembers. “The rest of the girls would almost be waiting for a Monday morning at school in Thornhill, looking on with envy at outfits, jewellery and shoes.” Clares mother approved of Brian Oacuteg. He didnt drink and had the discipline required to pursue a footballing career. Her daughter was safe in his hands. “He had wee funny one liners, a very naturally funny person, but he was signicantly more sensible than me,” Clare adds. “We got to go to Oxygen and festivals together. I was only goingBrian Oacuteg was there and we went on holidays together.” In April , he was diagnosed with Leukaemia. After two rounds of chemotherapy, he got out of hospital for his brother Colms st birthday. Radiotherapy followed and in August, in another throw of the dice, his other brother Niall turned out to be a match for a bone marrow operation. At first it seemed to be a success. Joe Brolly had visited him in hospital and arranged tickets to that years All-Ireland football final in Croke Park. Brian senior fondly recalls the enjoyable day out at Croke Park, with a meal on the way home. Days later, a routine check broke the worst news possible. Brian Oacutegs system was beginning to shut down and he had just six weeks to live. “He was told he was going to die, he was very selfless in the things that he did,” Clare said. “He was a real old soul, it is hard to believe he had the attitude that he did.” Aoe remembers how they arranged a rota of sorts among his friends to support Brian Oacutegs family in the hospital. “We never wanted him to be alone on any of the days,” Aoe remembers. “He was so thoughtful. Even when he was sick, hed make sure we were all okay,” Clare adds. She was by his side every Wednesday afternoon and all weekend. It coincided with weighing up their career choices and someone remarked to Clare that shed make a good nurse. She followed up on the advice and is now working as a nurse. Because of Brian Oacuteg. “I now work with people in the same situation and am giving something back. Now I know what I know from where I work, its hard to believe he did the stuff he did.” On the day Mickey Harte broke his arm after a car crash, he was in the McKeever home later that evening and Clare speaks of them reciting the rosary together. Brian Dooher, also a past pupil of St Columbs Derry, brought the Sam Maguire Cup to the house. Brian Oacuteg was selfless, rarely letting his guard down during his suffering. Instead, he was on the one with the smile, assuring everyone hed be fine. There was always a concern for others. None more so than two weeks before his death. Against advice, he attended Clares school formal. He was never going to miss it. Complete with spats, tuxedo and a white scarf, he dressed as Frank Sinatra and danced the night away. It was Clares night and he was going to be there for her. Returning home, his energy was spent. After struggling up the stairs, it would be his last outing. Brian Oacuteg passed away at home surrounded by his family. While there is sorrow in his loss, he leaves a considerable imprint. In his  years, he brought so much joy to the many he met. Steelstown await the day they translate their three narrow intermediate final defeats into the elation of a first title. The number five jersey retired in his memory will be absent, but Brian Oacuteg will be looking down on them. And smiling. Son. Brother. Footballer. Friend. Legend. He will forever be remembered.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The -year-old made his senior debut in the defeat to Longford last Saturday, coming on as an th minute substitute for Will Fitzgerald on a memorable night for the teenager and his family. Caolan’s dad Jim passed away four years ago, and the young forward admits he wouldn’t be where he is today without the support of his parents, Michelle and Jim, and stepdad Conor. “Unfortunately there were no fans and no family there which was disappointing but they were all back home watching and as soon as the match was over I got the texts from my family,” he explained. googletag.cmd.push “My father passed away a few years ago so hopefully I did him proud. “He played a big part in me growing up. When I was younger he coached me in the younger teams so hopefully he would have been proud. “My mammy over the years took me to training every day, while my stepfather takes me to training now because my mammy has a new baby here. “My parents have taken my everywhere and given me everything that I need or want from football, so it’s good to pay them back in that way, making my debut because my family is the main thing.” googletag.cmd.push Caolanadmits he never expected to be called from the bench last Saturday, but was determined to enjoy every minute once he realised he would play the final ten minutes plus stoppage time.  “The feeling I had was indescribable,” he admitted. “Being a mascot at the Derry games to actually being one of the players is a dream come true. “I was sitting on the bench wonderingI was going to get on and I was told to warm up twice before I got the call from Decky. When that happened I just got this feeling in my belly, like butterflies.     “Whenever I was coming on it was a really proud moment for me and my family. “I was never expecting to get on. I’ve only been in training full time this year, but I’ve come in and got the head down. It shows the manager trusts me which is good. “I’ve known Decky now a while because I was up in Club NI with him. He obviously knows what kind of player I am and what kind of person I am, so hopefully I can play more minutes. That’s my goal this season, just to get on as much as I can and play more minutes and get more experience under my belt.” Caolan is one of a number of young players hoping to make their mark on the first team this season. Patrick Ferry and Ronan Boyce broke into the team last season as manager Declan Devine continues to give young players their chance at the club. His debut was a bittersweet moment for Caolan in that he suffered a defeat in his first senior game, but he is now looking at the bigger picture and what he can go on to achieve in the  season. “It was always hard coming on in a match like that,” he continued. “I just tried to get a few touches and after I did that I felt comfortable.

The -year-old made his senior debut in the defeat to Longford last Saturday, coming on as an th minute substitute for Will Fitzgerald on a memorable night for the teenager and his family. Caolan’s dad Jim passed away four years ago, and the young forward admits he wouldn’t be where he is today without the support of his parents, Michelle and Jim, and stepdad Conor. “Unfortunately there were no fans and no family there which was disappointing but they were all back home watching and as soon as the match was over I got the texts from my family,” he explained. googletag.cmd.push “My father passed away a few years ago so hopefully I did him proud. “He played a big part in me growing up. When I was younger he coached me in the younger teams so hopefully he would have been proud. “My mammy over the years took me to training every day, while my stepfather takes me to training now because my mammy has a new baby here. “My parents have taken my everywhere and given me everything that I need or want from football, so it’s good to pay them back in that way, making my debut because my family is the main thing.” googletag.cmd.push Caolanadmits he never expected to be called from the bench last Saturday, but was determined to enjoy every minute once he realised he would play the final ten minutes plus stoppage time.  “The feeling I had was indescribable,” he admitted. “Being a mascot at the Derry games to actually being one of the players is a dream come true. “I was sitting on the bench wonderingI was going to get on and I was told to warm up twice before I got the call from Decky. When that happened I just got this feeling in my belly, like butterflies.     “Whenever I was coming on it was a really proud moment for me and my family. “I was never expecting to get on. I’ve only been in training full time this year, but I’ve come in and got the head down. It shows the manager trusts me which is good. “I’ve known Decky now a while because I was up in Club NI with him. He obviously knows what kind of player I am and what kind of person I am, so hopefully I can play more minutes. That’s my goal this season, just to get on as much as I can and play more minutes and get more experience under my belt.” Caolan is one of a number of young players hoping to make their mark on the first team this season. Patrick Ferry and Ronan Boyce broke into the team last season as manager Declan Devine continues to give young players their chance at the club. His debut was a bittersweet moment for Caolan in that he suffered a defeat in his first senior game, but he is now looking at the bigger picture and what he can go on to achieve in the  season. “It was always hard coming on in a match like that,” he continued. “I just tried to get a few touches and after I did that I felt comfortable. We were all disappointed because we lost, but at the same time I was sitting in the corner and I was buzzing. “It was hard because I didn’t really want to show that because everyone was disappointed with the loss but it’s all about kicking on now and playing a few games.” Waterford visit the Brandywell next week and Caolan is hoping that he can again feature as the Candystripes hope to get their season up and running with a home win. “Three points is everything in this league because they are always hard to come by,” he agreed. “Three points in the next game will stand us in good stead for the upcoming games and help us climb up the league.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The scheme has been agreed in partnership with Derry City and Strabane District Council as part of the Covid recovery process. Measures include the introduction of a one-way system from Carlisle Road, through Ferryquay Gate into The Diamond. The existing parking area at the quadrant outside the former Austin’s department storewill be removed to create more public space. A priority system for traffic is to be introduced at Shipquay Gate which will allow a new footway to be created under this historic gate. googletag.cmd.push New spaces are also to be created on Bishop Street to facilitate outdoor trading opportunities for cafeacute-type businesses. Making the announcement, Infrastructure Minister Nicola Mallonsaid: “The Covid pandemic has brought many changes to how we conduct our daily lives and as we move towards a recovery phase I want to play my part in the transformation that our society deserves. This means creating a greener, cleaner more sustainable environment with less reliance on motor vehicles and a renewed focus on those who wish to walk, wheel and cycle. Once completed these measures will transform the Derry cityscape, providing safe spaces for all who work and live there to meet, shop and travel. googletag.cmd.push “I am also committed to working with other local councils, stakeholders and local people so that we can shape our future together and deliver similar changes across our villages, towns and cities.” Mayor of Derry City and Strabane District Council, Cllr Brian Tierney, welcomed the introduction of the new measures saying he hoped they would facilitate the reopening of businesses once restrictions were lted and help encourage the public back into the city centre to socialise and shop in a safe environment. “These temporary interventions willredesignthis important urban space and create a more attractive and accessible town centre that will help restore customer confidence and drive footfall so we can rebuild our business, retail, tourism and hospitality sectors as they prepare to reopen.”      --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The dog and its owner had been enjoying a walk on Benone Strand when the pet swallowed discarded fishing tackle. A hook became embedded in the animal’s throat and another lodged in the woman’s hand as she tried to remove them. Following some quick thinking to prevent any further harm, the dog is now recovering at home after going through a procedure at the vets. The Mayor of Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Council Alderman Mark Fielding urged anyone fishing in public areas to leave no trace. googletag.cmd.push “We know lots of people enjoy a visit to our beaches with their families and pets and there’s an expectation that these are safe places to walk and explore, he said. I was very disappointed to hear about what happened to this dog which could have been killed due to the careless actions of others. “Any litter left in our beautul open spaces is a disgrace, but items like hooks, lines, weights and bait pose an extra risk due to the injuries they can cause to both pets, wildle and children. An x-ray showing the fishing hook lodged in the dogs throat. googletag.cmd.push “We should all adopt the ‘leave no trace’ motto and ensure that we take litter home or leave items in a bin. “If you fish along our beaches, or from boats, please ensure you collect all your belongings including waste items, and make sure they are properly disposed of. “This was a very traumatic experience for this lady and her pet, and I hope they both make a full recovery. “We need everyone to work together to ensure Causeway Coast and Glens is a safe and clean place for all, and with the approach of the brighter months when our open spaces might be even more attractive, this message has never been more important.     “Across the Borough, we’re fortunate to have many volunteer litter pickers whose actions, along with those of our own cleansing staff, help to keep our road sides and green spaces looking their very best. Their actions are an example to us all and you can support them by making sure to always dispose of your rubbish responsibly. Anyone with concerns or who wish to report any cases of littering can contact Environmental Health by ringing    or emailenvironmentalhealth@causewaycoastandglens.gov.uk.You can also get in touch via Facebook and Twitter.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The occasion saw the launch of a new -plus seat auditorium and multi-al space at Studio  and marked the completion of the Department of Education’s Voluntary Youth Capital Funding Scheme of  which provided capital grants across the voluntary youth sector in Northern Ireland to allow successful organisations to invest in refurbishment, extend or rebuild premises. Mr Weir said the refurbishment would benefit the young people of the Ballyarnett area.

Magherafelt has been included in the regions top three, alongside Strangford Loch and outright winner, Holywood, both in County Down. Expert judges behind the Sunday Times guide assessed a number of factors in making their decision, from schools, air quality, transport and broadband speed to culture, green spaces and the high street. They looked for improving towns, villages or city centres, for attractive, well-designed homes and locations bursting with community spirit. Magherafelt was selected as a supremely practical choice for families thanks to its convenient central location, rapidly improving town centre and excellent schools. googletag.cmd.push Local grammar school Rainey Endowed, which recently won the Sunday Times School of the Decade award, was singled out for praise. Judges were also impressed by the sports facilities at Meadowbank Multi-Sports Arena and Moyola Park Golf Club, as well as the towns choice of hairdressers, beauty salons and coffee shops. Sunday Times Property Editor, Helen Davies, said this had been a good year for small towns. “This guide has never been so important. The pandemic has taught us just how much we rely on our homes, our communities and our surroundings,” she said. “With working from home now common, it’s no surprise that many of us are reassessing our priorities and thinking hard about where we really want to live. googletag.cmd.push “Our focus for this year has been community, countryside and convenience. It hasn’t been a year for big cities or small villages. “Instead it is small towns that have shone: big enough to have everything you need within walking distance and small enough for everyone to feel connected.” Local councillor Darren Totten said the announcement was no surprise to him as a Magherafelt man. The focus of the experts is on amenities, location, educational and sporting facilities - which this study rightly shows to be amongst the very best available, he said. For me, though, the very best of Magherafelt is that we have a great community in the town and main ingredient in any community is the people.     The people of Magherafelt have proven many times in recent years that when anyone is in need, its all hands to the pump regardless of who it is needs help.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

It was part of Specsavers Something to Smile about campaign and Tafu, who regularly watches his mum play for City of Derry rugby club, was one of four lucky rugby fans across the island of Ireland who got to virtually meet an Ireland rugby hero. Specsavers are the official opticians and audiologists for the IRFU and to mark this year’s Guinness Six Nations they asked parents and grandparents to nominate their young rugby mad fans to be in with a chance of winning a surprise one-to-one video call from Keith Earls, Jordan Larmour or Garry Ringrose. googletag.cmd.push Tafu, whose family live in Coleraine, was nominated by mum Joanna and dad Tane and after his chat with Keith about all things rugby, Tafu decided to dedicate an episode of his very own YouTube channel ‘Tackling with Tafu’ to his sporting hero Keith. Tafu created Episode  ahead of the Ireland V England game and after the match said: It was an amazing game. Keith Earls’ try was brilliant and I think he got some advice from Tackling with Tafu. Tafu was thrilled when he realised that Keith had watched his previous YouTube videos and he definitely wants to continue making more episodes and is really looking forward to going back to playing mini-rugby at Ballymoney RFC along with younger brother Lotu. googletag.cmd.push As well as chatting about the Six Nations, Tafu asked Keith what his favourite game of all time was and Tafu wasn’t surprised when Keith answered, Beating New Zealand in ’, one of Ireland’s most famous games. As well as being an Ireland superfan, Tafu is an avid supporter of his mum Joanna and her teammates at City of Derry Women and he’s keen to get back to watching the ladies play when grass roots sport gets back on track. Mum Joanna said: We’re a rugby mad family and love being involved at club level as well as following the international games.     My husband Tane played rugby professionally but has retired due to injury and now enjoys being involved with our respective clubs and following the boys’ mini-rugby teams. Specsavers optometry director Judith Ball congratulated Tafu on winning such a special Zoom meeting. It was brilliant to be able to celebrate our IRFU partnership and put a smile on young rugby fans’ faces like Tafu and giving them a rare opportunity to speak to their sporting heroes. The Specsavers ‘Something to Smile About’ campaign celebrates the positivity and delight that a simple smile can bring and this story is an example of just that. To see the surprise Zoom video between players and fans, visit Specsavers Ireland’s Facebook page.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Bishop McClay and Dean Hull celebrated a simple service of Holy Communion before walking prayerfully from Saul to the Cathedral.Meanwhile, pilgrims at home were invited to take a virtual prayer pilgrimage with Glynis Matchett with a short film premiered on social media.The pilgrimage is inspired by Patrickrsquos journey from slave to missionary and reflects on his faith and passion for the gospel.At noon Dean Hull welcomed viewers to a live broadcast from Down Cathedral, with the Bishop leading the service.The guest speakers included Patrick Regan and singerndashsongwriter and Andy Flannagan who also joined in via video.Conscious that the past year has seen many thousands of people face traumatic situations and signicant mental health issues, the diocese had chosen the theme lsquoWhen Faith Gets Shakenrsquo for the service.Patrick Regan is the author of a book by the same name and founder and chief executive of mental health charity Kintsugi Hope which aims to create safe and supportive spaces for those struggling with emotional and mental health challenges.He is also the founder of urban youth work charity XLP and the author of five books. Patrick has travelled widely working with and on behalf of the poorest communities and is a regular contributor on radio and television on issues of poverty and justice.Andy Flannagan is a Lutonndashbased, Irish singerndashsongwriter who was previously a hospital doctor.His campaigning song writing drew him into the political arena, and he is Executive Director of Christians in Politics. One of his driving passions is to see a just rewiring of the global economic system.Drawing on their own experiences, Patrick and Andy encouraged people to be honest with God in lament and to trust that he brings beauty from their brokenness.Andy sang two pieces ndash Fragile and a song of complaint based on Psalm , while soloist, Ruth Thompson, sang two songs ndash What Grace is Mine and Christ Be Beside Me ndash accompanied by Cathedral organist Michael McCracken.Following the service, clergy gathered at St Patrickrsquos grave for a socially distanced wreath laying ceremony.And in keeping with the focus on mental wellbeing, the wreath was laid by Mr Jackie Breen, a senior mental health nurse based at Finneston House in Downpatrick..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/24March2021-Chief.jpg","title":"Chief denies Finneston House closure claims  ","story":"THE districtrsquos most senior health chief has categorically dismissed rumours that a key facility based in Downpatrick is to close at the weekend.Finneston House mdash run by the South Eastern Trust mdash is based at the Ardglass Road on the outskirts of the town and provides an acute mental health community service.Last week, a number of councillors posted on social media that they had been made aware of reports that the facility, which has a long history as a base for mental health services, was to close at weekends with services moved to Belfast.Dispelling the rumours during a special briefing with local politicians on Monday afternoon, Mr Seamus McGoran said there were ldquoabsolutely no plans to close Finneston House which, he said, was line for a pound, investment to support the continued delivery of mental health and other community services.Mr McGoran, acting chief executive of the South Eastern Trust, said he was more than happy to set the record on the future of the mental health facility.ldquoThere are absolutely no plans at all to remove the weekend mental health service from Finneston House and relocate to Belfast, he declared.He said he was ldquosomewhat irked that some councillors had chosen to put out a statement on social media last week saying that he had received ldquodisturbing reports that the health trust was going to transfer the service.ldquoThis is absolutely not true and I would preferany of you [councillors] have issues or concerns that you would ask the Trust about them, continued Mr McGoran.ldquoWhat happens is your hear rumours and treat them as fact and start making statements on the back of that. We have an obligation to communicate responsibly with the public and we have an obligation not to create anxiety with the very people who need to access our mental health services.ldquoFinneston House will continue to be there andthere is more demand for the service it provides we will put more resources into it. That will be how we deliver the service, he said.ldquoI donrsquot know where these rumours came from and I would make a plea to please talk to us before starting putting stuff on social media.

In fact, it creates anxiety where there is no need.Confirming the planned pound, investment at Finneston House, Mrs Roisin Coulter, the health trustrsquos director of planning and performance, said that a decade ago there were plans to dispose of the facility.She said that since then, services provided there had grown and it now played an important role..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/24March2021-East.jpg","title":"East Down community rejects plans%2C claims PFA  ","story":"THE Downpatrick and East Down community rejects plans to merge three local post-primary schools together, a parentsrsquo opposition group has claimed.The Red High Parents and Friends Associationndash the parent body of St Patrickrsquos Grammar School ndash has made an th hour call on the Education Minister to leave the school as it is and instead merge St Maryrsquos High School and De La Salle High School.The call comes as the public consultation process ends on Monday into the proposed closure of all schools by September next year and the creation of a new voluntary grammar school comprising of all three schools.Red High PFA spokesperson Cormac Artt has been at the front of the parentsrsquo opposition to any merger of the grammar school over the last few years.He said that the association remained ldquosteadfast in its opposition to the development proposal agreed by each schoolrsquos trustees, the De La Salle Congregation, and the Education Authority.Mr Artt stressed the local opposition to the amalgamation of the three schools remained strong.ldquoOver this past two months, our volunteer parentsrsquo group has canvassed opinion and debate from across the locality to ensure all voices are heard in response to this proposal, he said.ldquoHundreds of parents have been in touch and it is evident the biggest shake-up in post primary education in this area for a generation has ignited our communityrsquos collective agreement this proposal falls at so many hurdles.ldquoJudging by the sheer number of contacts our parentsrsquo group has had to answer, this community firmly rejects this proposal and calls on the Minister for Education to do the right thing and scrap it.He said his group had engaged with local politicians who now fully understand the impact of development proposal and said that they had cross-party support ldquowith only a minority ignoring the facts or refusing to engage directly with parents.He continued: ldquoAs a representative parent group for St Patrickrsquos Grammar School, we fully support our Board of Governorsrsquo statement and that of our school management team. The closure of a fully sustainable school does not make any sense whatsoever and our friends at both St Maryrsquos and the De La Salle recognise this also.ldquoThis is a town plan, not an area plan as the proposal purports to be, and does not surprisingly address post primary schools in Crossgar or Ballynahinch, a move, we would suggest, to a future proposal for those schools.ldquoBut more importantly, the inequality this will create across a raft of issues, from admissions, transport, gender equality, SEN and rural needs, renders this proposal nothing less than detrimental to education in this area.ldquoWe call on the Minister for Education to retain St Patrickrsquos Grammar School in its current form and amalgamate St Maryrsquos and De La Salle Schools..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/24March2021-CDiary.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C March 28%2C 2001  ","story":"NEWCASTLE ndash A major review into the future of primary education provision in the greater Newcastle area could lead to the merger of up to three local schools.A review into the primary controlled sector, involving Castlewellan, Newcastle, Clough and Dundrumrsquos Downshire Primary Schools, has been launched by the South Eastern Education and Library Board.Although the investigation will not be complete until next year, principals at the smaller schools have been informed that amalgamation at a brand new green field site is a possibility.Central to the Boardrsquos thinking is continuing decline in enrolment at Downshire and the urgent need to replace Clough primary which is working to full capacity. It is understood the Board is leaning towards a merger of these two schools.DOWNPATRICK ndash A major stumbling block to the development of a new cinema in Downpatrick has been removed.Dunleath Estates has given permission for part of Dunleath Park to be redeveloped as a cinema complex, ending months of speculation about the future of the ambitious project.Proposals for the multi-screen cinema at Dunleath Park have faced delays over the past  months as the Down Council awaited legal clearance from Dunleath Estates.But at Mondayrsquos meeting of the councilrsquos Client Services Committee, it was revealed that representatives from the estate have agreed to all the land to be used for the complex, subject to restrictions.This means Dunleath Estates will remove a restrictive covenant which species that the area can only be used for recreational and leisure purposes.KILLYLEAGH ndash British Legion officials in Killyleagh have expressed concern that funding they were promised to provide a new War Memorial in the town will not be made available.Officials claim they received a letter from Down Council indicating it would ensure pound, was included in its capital programme for the new financial year, paving the way for the memorial to be provided at the top of High Street.However, Legion officials say the money has not been included in the local authority budget and are ldquodeeply disappointed at its decision, but they hope the cash will be made available next year to help them relocate the memorial, which is currently located at the side of Killyleagh Castle.Down Council has already agreed to provide the Legion with a plot of land to house the new structure, but has confirmed it cannot give a guarantee at this stage that that pound, Legion officials require will be made available.SAINTFIELD ndash All-day parkers in Saintfield have been asked to be more considerate to the townrsquos traders.The call came last Wednesday night when all day parkers were urged by Saintfield Town Committee not tothe town to what was once a major problem.Locals who attended the annual meeting, in Saintfield library, claimed that as result of people parking in Main Street for several hours each week day, traders were losing out on valuable business.Speaking after the meeting, which was also attended by local councillors William Dick and Robert Burgess, the committeersquos newly elected chairman, Mr Sam Spratt, said parking in the town had ldquogreatly improved in recent years, but warned that motorists were starting to ldquoslip back into old habits.CROSSGAR ndash The Department of Regional Development is to be asked to carry out repairs to what has been described as one of the worst roads in the Province.Down councillors have backed moves calling on the Department to have repair work carried out at the Killyleagh Road outside Crossgar which was dug up recently to allow the laying of a new sewer pipe.The work was part of a poundm scheme to allow the pumping of sewage from Crossgar for treatment in Killyleagh. But the quality of the road repairs has been called in to question by local residents and Rowallance councillor Miss Margaret Ritchie.She first raised the problem on the eve of a major report published recently by the Northern Ireland Audit Office into road openings by ious utilities, including the Water Service, Roads Service, British Telecom and ious gas companies.SEAFORDE ndash A planning decision refusing to allow the replacement of derelict buildings in Seaforde with a new housing development,has been deferred by Down Council.Councillors and Planning Service officials are to hold an office meeting to discuss the plan to demolish premises at Main Street and replace them with seven townhouses and four apartments.Planners had initially ruled that no ldquoexceptional reason had been given to justy the demolition and suggested thatallowed to proceed, the new development would be out of keeping with the general charter of existing premises in Seaforde.Planners also claimed the scheme would be contrary to rural landing policy and thatpermitted, the design, layout and landscaping of the scheme would be unacceptable.They also ruled the development would harm he privacy of adjoining residents.The building was originally listed, but it was confirmed at last weekrsquos monthly council meeting that it has since been delisted.DOWNPATRICK ndash Talks seeking a new base for Downpatrickrsquos weekly market are set to take place tomorrow morning, but stallholders are angry they have not been invited.Traders are outraged they have been excluded from the meeting between Down Council officials, the Department of the Environment and the Down Lisburn Trust, who all own part of the Lower Market Street car park where the Saturday market is currently held.It is understood the meeting is to discuss whether the weekly market can retain its current site, or have to move to free up vital spaces for visitors to the new St Patrick Centre.Traders have become increasingly hostile towards the council, claiming news of the decisions were a complete surprise as the council recently told them the market was not going to be moved.The current mood among stallholders is one of confusion and anger at the councilrsquos apparent disinterest in their welfare.ARDGLASS ndash As tougher restrictions are introduced by the European Commission in an effort to rejuvenate depleted fish stocks, one local skipper has warned that the industry is at rock bottom.Speaking just hours before the government introduced legislation banning fishing on vast stretches of local waters until April , Ardglass fisherman Paul Wills said things could not get any worse.The ban introduced at midnight on Friday was expected to be further extended yesterday during a special meeting at Stormont when the government was due to discuss a tie-up of all vessels as part of the overall cod recovery programme.Although the Ardglass industry is prawn-based, Mr Wills said local fishermen rely on their by-catch of white fish at the time of the year and said the economic consequences of the current restriction were great.Mr Wills, who skippers his own vessel, said he earns half today what he would have earned  years ago.CROSSGAR ndash The birth of the Free Presbyterian Church in Crossgar  years ago was celebrated in the village last week.The highlight of the week-long series of events to mark the

night and may see some action in a friendly against the United States on Sunday.Northern Ireland manager Ian Baraclough had admired Hazard for a long time and knows what Hazard is capable of.Baraclough was formerly manager of the Northern Ireland U-  side and made Hazard team captain.Itrsquos been quite a time for Hazard, whose career had gone from strength to strength in the last few months.Hazard made his first team debut for Celtic against Lille in December as the Hoops won - in the Europa League. He kept a clean sheet against Kilmarnock a few days later and a string of good performances resulted in him being picked for the Scottish Cup final against Hearts.It was a fairytale match for the Downpatrick man as he saved two spot kicks in a penalty shoot-out to seal a historic fourth consecutive treble for Neil Lennonrsquos side.His exploits were rewarded when he signed a new two-year contract with the Parkhead club a few weeks ago.Hazard has made seven appearances for Celtic this season, his last coming in a - draw with Livingston in January.He said: Just playing seven games altogether this season has given me a great boost in my confidence.

He said she declined.ldquoThis scheme has been shovel ready for some time, the MP continued.ldquoIndeed, all the geotechnical surveys, public consultations and the legal stages have been complete and in order many months ago. Yet the Minister refuses to sign-off on a commencement order.ldquoThe failure to even provide a detailed, logical explanation as to why she has not yet signed off on this scheme has created a growing fear in the local community that she is inexplicably stalling on this eagerly awaited project.The MP said that once again last weekend Ballynahinch suffered chronic congestion, with cars queued for miles to get through the town on Sunday evening as people ed home from visiting the area.Mr Hazzard warned that this will be a scene repeated each and every weekend and in the opposite direction each weeknight as commutershome from work outside Ballynahinch when Covid- restrictions ease again in the time ahead.Slieve Croob councillor Cathy Mason, who is also calling for a start date for the bypass, said the ldquotimely delivery of the long overdue roads scheme would be a great boost for both the local economy and the wellbeing of the community.She added: ldquoThe Minister must bring this issue to a speedy conclusion as soon as possible, sign the commencement order and announce a date for construction to commence. Nothing less will be acceptable to the local community.A Department for Infrastructure spokeswoman said Mrs Mallon previously announced her commitment to fund the continued development of a number of strategic road improvement schemes delayed by the collapse of the Assembly for three years.She said these included the Ballynahinch bypass as part of a plan to aid economic recovery and community transformation, while addressing regional imbalance.ldquoThe Ballynahinch bypass scheme is now at an advanced stage of development and a review of the environmental reports has also been completed. The Minister intends to provide a further update on the scheme shortly, said the spokesperson.ldquoThe Minister is committed to moving ahead with the Ballynahinch bypass scheme.Major progress has been made over recent years to advance the scheme to link the Newcastle and Saintfield roads with the bypass designed to alleviate chronic town centre congestion in Ballynahinch and along the main approach roads to the town.Major new roundabouts are proposed at the Belfast Road junction with the Saintfield Road and at the Newcastle Road junction with the Downpatrick Road, with a new bridge constructed over the Moss Road.Overtaking lanes stretching almost  metres are proposed at either end of the bypass where the major new roundabouts are to be constructed, with the scheme also including a shared footpath and cycle lane.The bypass, which is expected to take  months to construct, is the single biggest road scheme ever proposed for the district, with roads officials insisting that the scheme will reduce journey times and improve road safety..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/24March2021-Quoile.jpg","title":"Quoile access set to be upgraded for anglers  ","story":"CONCERN about access to the Quoile River in Downpatrick for disabled anglers is to be addressed by a leading government department.The Department for Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairshas confirmed that the Environment Agency is to be asked to approve the possible installation of disabled angling stands beside the two designated disabled parking bays at a redeveloped car park beside the riverrsquos floodgates.The Department mdash which has also agreed to meet with local anglers mdash saidthe new stands are provided, they will reduce the need for those with mobility issues to have to make their way to an existing stand around a quarter of a mile from the car park.Anglers have expressed concern that a new barrier erected on a wall which separates the car park from the waterway now prevents disabled anglers from fishing at this location.They say it is over a year since they were informed that new stands for those with mobility issues was being discussed by civil servants, calling for their immediate implementation.DAERA insists that the riverside car park was never designated either as a specic angling area or one for the use of disabled fishermen, conceding that local anglers disagree with this point which is why a meeting with them to discuss the issue is necessary.In a letter to anglers, the Department confirms that neither they nor Disability NI were consulted about the work at the car park as it would not restrict or remove disabled angling facilities. Itrsquos a point that anglers disagree with.DERA explained the work on the banks of the river created two dedicated disabled parking spaces in the car park where previously there had been none.ldquoThere was no legal requirement to consult on the proposed improvement works and therefore the consultation undertaken went beyond what was required, to specically noty as well as seek comment and feedback from site users, said a departmental official.He also confirmed that notice of DAERArsquos intention to carry out improvement work was clearly displayed at the Quoile site in advance of it being undertaken.The official also confirmed that consultation on the car park investment was initiated with Newry, Mourne and Down Council and a number of local councillors who were contacted by telephone about the proposed investment.DAERA confirmed that regular tree inspections are carried out at the Quoile River and that after storms, areas of the Quoile Nature Reserve are checked by staff for fallen trees and branches that may have come down.In addition, it says this area is subject to regular visual inspections by staff and where any concerns are identied, advice will be sought from qualied tree surgeons or arboriculturists any necessary work carried out.In his letter to anglers, the DAERA official said he appreciates that it was not satisfactory for disabled anglers to make their way to access current angling facilities a quarter of a mile from the car park, confirming plans for two new educated stands to meet the needs of those with mobility problems.A spokesman for Downpatrick anglers said they have never suggested that there was a dedicated disabled fishing stand at the car park before it was redeveloped. He said fishermen could fish in the river at the car park from their wheelchairs as there was a small wall in place.ldquoSince the car park was redeveloped, a barrier has been attached to the wall which now makes it impossible for disabled anglers to fish from this location. As a result, they have to make their way, along with all their gear, to another stand which is a quarter of a mile away, he said.ldquoThis is highly unsatisfactory. Would it be proper to tell someone with mobility issues who stops in a car park to be told that the shopping centre, GP surgery or disabled toilet that they needed to visit was half a mile away  I suspect not.The spokesman added local anglers have been told about plans for disabled fishing stands at the car park for some time now and that the Environment Agency is being asked for its view.ldquoWhat we want to see is delivery for disabled anglers. They have rights which must be recognised, he said.The spokesman added: ldquoWe remain in the eye of a pandemic and mental health is a major issue for many health professionals who are concerned about the fall-out from the impact of the coronavirus. Fishing is very therapeutic and we would strongly argue that the provision of new disabled angling stands on the banks of the Quoile should be a priority and will be of tremendous benefit.Anglers have also expressed concern that the redeveloped car park on the banks of the river has become a magnet for anti-social behaviour are are thankful that no one was injured when a large branch fell to the ground several weeks ago.

The Irish Sea border is here to stay because Boris Johnson agreed it, either because he did not understand what he had agreed or because he was cynically prepared to ditch his  pledges to the DUP about his opposition to any internal UK barrier.The disastrous scale of the border became clear in January, but that is only the start to an ever widening gap between NI and Great Britain as grace periods endandthe UK and EU erge in coming years.   \" fill\"#ea\"  to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

It is possible, of course, to support Northern Ireland being part of the UK and, in trade, in an all Ireland. But that is such an extreme constitutional set-up as to be akin to supporting London-Dublin joint authority of NI. It is not a stance that could be described as ‘unionist’.Lord Frost said yesterday the Protocol needs to have cross community support. It won’t, and unionists must say so.While the DUP has been put in an impossible position, it did agree a regulatory Irish Sea border in early October . Almost all the current trade disruption would have come to pass had that DUP-Tory plan proceeded. The DUP agreed it after years of extreme pressure including being accused of delaying Brexit. It got key concessions such as the requirement of Stormont pre-approval before implementation and NI staying fully in UK customs. But Mr Johnson then abused that extraordinary unionist offer as a stepping stone — to make MLA approval retrospective in , remove cross party consent and leave NIin the EU customs zone. However understandable the  DUP agreement, the situation that has emerged after that is very bad for unionists.The party is being criticised for playing the current situation both ways. Its position on implementation does seem confused and it has a decision to make. Is it, as Arlene Foster told Sky News last year, opposed to the border but accepting of its reality  Or is it only prepared to accept its removal ——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

People are booking shows for the end of the year.   \" fill\"#ea\"  to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

[Not playing live] changes how you write songs and how people interact with albums, no one is getting to hear the stuff live in the room with you.”The band did a live stream on Friday from the Nerve Centre to launch the album.Lyndsey said: “Looking out to nothing is the most bizarre experience. It’s just another skill you have to learn.“We’re dying to get back to gigs. Evenpeople are just staring at you blankly at least there’s a reaction.”The songs on the band’s debut album The Seed, The Vessel, The Roots and All were all written before lockdown, but the pause gave them the chance to hone their music, re-recording many of their tracks.Throughout their debut album, New Pagans challenge past and present issues surrounding relationships, equality, history, and gender.The latest single from the album is Harbour, capturing the experience of childbirth from all angles – the sickness, the joy, the frustration and the resilience and strength of women.Lyndsey said: “It was what I was going through at the time when I wrote the song. I was pregnant with my first child.“I started writing the lyrics, it just came out, I didn’t over think it.“When I’m singing it I always transport back to being pregnant. “Most women aren’t pregnant very often in their lives.“It’s a very unique, interesting period. There’s things that are positive and negative about it.“I think the song captures that. It’s about Maisie and I, growing a wee le inside you.“There’s a lot of negativity around pregnancy and labour and childbirth. I found it a really empowering time in my le. Instead of feeling vulnerable I felt strong. I wanted to reflect that as well.”Lyndsey’s daughter Maisie is now three and she has a two-year-old son called Odhran.Their father, and Lyndsey’s husband is Cahir O’Doherty, formerly of Jetplane Landing and Fighting With Wire, and also a member of New Pagans.As a collective they offer a wealth of artistic scope from Lyndsey’s skills in Irish embroidery and her deep historical knowledge, to bassist Claire Miskimmin’s visual artistry and talents as a director, and the musical experience of guitarists Cahir, Alan McGreevy and drummer Conor McAuley.Despite the global crisis,  proved to be a breakout year for New Pagans. They first started turning heads in the spring with the release of their Glacial Erratic EP. In addition to Steve Lamacq’s continued support, the band have also received regular plays from BBC  Music, Radio  Kerrang Radio and Radio X. New Pagans then closed the year by winning the award ‘Best Live Act’ at the NI Music Prize  cementing them as one of the most exciting and interesting rising acts, both sonically and visually. New Pagans is Lyndsey’s first band: “I went to art college where I got interested in the local music scene. “I’m proud to be a part of it now and not a spectator as I had been.”A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

Boris Johnson advised public buildings, including theatres, to close and mass gatherings to stop.This week,  months on, campaign group We Make Events Cymru, reflects on the impact of Covid- and how the lockdown restrictions has had a devastating effect on their industry.The impact of the announcement back in March last year meant that the UK event sector came to an outright standstill, resulting in events being cancelled, theatre and music shows could not be staged and thousands of Welsh event professionals could not work.We Make Events Cymru, , has spent the last  months lobbying the Welsh Government to highlight the need for continued sector support in order for the events organisers, iniduals and supply chain to survive Covid- restrictions.After a year of campaigning, We Make Events Cymru continues to push for opportunities to re-open the sector in light of the Welsh Government Coronavirus Control Plan , which does not allow gatherings of more than  people in Tier .As a result of many conversations with the Welsh Government, We Make Events Cymru has created a survey to gather the much needed data to evidence the number of people involved in the sector and the contribution they make to Wales and its economy.Stephen Burkitt-Harrington, Director of Production  one of Walesrsquo leading Creative Events Companies, said: ldquoThe Welsh Government has been saying all along that it could not reopen events of any kind without industry specic data. We were surprised to learn that they were not collecting this information though.\"This is why we have put together the biggest survey of our industry ever undertaken in Wales. Companies big and small, venues, events, and every inidual involved in even the smallest way can contribute now.\"By giving us as little or as much as people are prepared to contribute, we can then provide the government with the much talked about data they say they need to see how valuable our wide ranging industry is to the Welsh economy, and how important it is to get it open again as soon as it is safe to.Alongside the survey, the group have also recently launched their own website which gives sector colleagues access to wellbeing and financial advice, access to a database of Welsh event organisers, suppliers and iniduals, as well as a forum to chat and exchange ideas ndash resources that the team believe is vitally important during the pandemic.MORE NEWS:We Make Events Cymru is in regular dialogue with Welsh Government to lobby, and is part of the working party preparing for Covid-safe outdoor and indoor test events. These test events are an integral stepping-stone to get the industry in Wales back working again .Sarah Hemsley-Cole, Director of Cardf based SC Productions and the Lead Coordinator for the campaign said: ldquoWhilst we have to accept large mass gatherings are not possible in  ndash it is essential that we keep up the pressure on Welsh Government to allow covid safe cultural activities in the Summer of .\"We are a creative and innovative sector, and by working with Welsh Government to develop appropriate guidance and to generate factual data and evidence from the test events, we can get performers, artists, technicians and the eco system back to work and audiences back to what they love.Working alongside partners such as Equity, Creu Cymru, BECTU, Cardf Music Board, Cult Cymru, Freelancers Make Theatre Work Freelances Task Force, What About Weddings and The Musicians Union ndash We Make Events Cymru has helped give the industry and events people a crucial voice during these unprecedented times.Following on from the recent budget announcement, We Make Events Cymru acknowledge the essential package of support already received from the UK and Welsh governments, and is pleased to hear of the further support expected with the extension of furlough, additional SEISS grants ndash which now includes newcomers to the industry who started their businesses in the   tax year, as well as the Cultural Recovery Fund.We Make Events Cymru are now waiting to hear about additional financial aid and get a better understanding of how long this relief money is expected to last business and iniduals in Wales. There are still thousands across the country who have been excluded from any kind of financial support ndash these people need to be recognised and also offered funding.The campaign group is also calling for the events industry to be considered on a par with other industries like hospitality and the Film and TV sector for things such as insurance and financial schemes.The UK is internationally recognised for delivering impressive cultural events. Within it, Wales plays a signicant role with its tremendous highly skilled workforce, many of whom have now had to ersy to work in other jobs.The impact of the lockdown will be felt within the Welsh events industry for many years to come.

Lots of these people feel they may neveras the risk is too great, which is devastating, and the impact on their metal health as a result of this is hard to hear.He added ldquoThe huge number of people falling through the gaps not receiving funding is something that needs to be addressed as a matter of urgency to ensure the future of our industry.The COVID- pandemic has caused many events around Wales and the UK to be cancelled or postponed due the government-imposed restrictions on large gatherings. Among the most prominent events to be affected in Wales in  have been the National Eisteddfod, the Royal Welsh Show, Hay Festival, Abergavenny Food Festival, Cardf Half Marathon, Llangollen International Eisteddfod, Green Man and Ironman.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThe road would link Sycamore Cross on the A with Junction  of the M. A -week public consultation last year raised concerns about the impact on the environment and local communities.Responding to those concerns, the Vale of Glamorgan council has now said transport planners must analyse further how the road would fit in with the new context of Covid- and the climate emergency.In a report to the councilrsquos cabinet, which meets on Monday, March , detailed responses were given to the main concerns raised in the consultation. The cabinet will be asked to approve further analysis, before moving on to writing up a full business case for the road.The case for the road is to improve transport across the region, including to Cardf Airport, St Athanrsquos Enterprise Zone, and new housing developments. It would likely cost around pound million to build, and is dependent on funding from the Welsh Government.However, the proposals have drawn criticism from villagers in Pendoylan whose houses would be knocked down, cyclists using country lanes which could be blocked off, and Coed Cymru which has warned ancient woodland would be felled to make way for the road.Two options for the new road were consulted on: one to the east of Pendoylan and one to the west. The report revealed transport planners are edging towards the western route, as it is better value for money than the eastern one.As well as suggesting further analysis, the cabinet report addressed the main concerns including the impact on the climate, environment, walkers and cyclists, and uncertain future of the financially struggling Cardf Airport.On cycling, the new road would include a segregated lsquoactive travel routersquo for cyclists and walkers, the report said. Country lanes blocked off could have bridges or underpasses for walkers and cyclists to cross the new road.     MORE NEWS:The report said: ldquoThere is currently poor infrastructure and local connectivity by walking and cycling through the study area, and there is potential to implement new cycle connections. An active travel route is an integral component of the concept options.ldquoShould a preferred option progress to the next stage of assessment and a need to block the lanes confirmed, access for non-motorised users to safely cross under or over the bypass would be accommodated as part of the design.On climate change, campaigners raised concerns a new road would increase private car journeys and carbon emissions.Both the Welsh Government and the Vale council declared a climate emergency in , pledging to reduce carbon emissions in an effort to prevent catastrophic increases in global temperatures.A big part of the plan to reduce emissions in Wales is changing how people travel: fewer journeys in private cars and more by walking, cycling and in public transport.The report said further analysis would include a lsquocarbon assessment and climate resiliencersquo report, and would explore how to reduce the carbon impact of the road.It did not mention what these methods could include.Several areas of ancient woodland would have ldquovery large adverse impacts according to the report. But further assessment would examine the exact effects of the loss of that woodland.The report said: ldquoThe environmental assessment would examine the loss of woodland in terms of its use in flood retention, water quality, social value, carbon capture, landscape value and cultural heritage value, as well as its value to bioersity.If the ldquovery large adverse impacts canrsquot be avoided by redesigning the road, new trees could be planted where to compensate for the loss of ancient woodland.This would include moving and replanting some of the old trees and soil.The next stage would also include a wider, detailed environmental impact assessment, and recommendations on how to mitigate potential impacts on the environment surrounding the proposed road.Another concern raised has been the uncertain future of Cardf Airport, which was recently bailed out by the Welsh Government with a pound. million grant.But transport planners pointed to plans to make it easier to get to the airport on foot, by bike, bus, train, and in private motor vehicles.The cabinet report said: ldquoWhile recognising that the basis of future studies would increasingly need to consider the emerging trends and patterns resulting from Covid-, it is understood that the long-term vision of the airport remains at this present time.Responding to the report, campaigners have renewed calls for the Vale council to scrap the plans for the road altogether.A spokesperson for Vale Communities for Future Generations said: ldquoWhy the Vale of Glamorgan council is persisting in wasting public money on keeping this outdated road plan alive is hard to understand. The sheer volume of recent objections to the proposal clearly indicates the public has other priorities.ldquoThe original  Vale council assumption was that the road was needed for better vehicle access to Cardf Airport mdash which was denied by the airport management.ldquoSince then the airportrsquos passenger numbers have shrunk, millions of pounds of public money has been spent by the Welsh Government on propping it up financially and the future of air travel globally is uncertain post Covid  pandemic.ldquoThese are hardly the circumstances under which to continue promoting an expensive and environmentally destructive road building plan that was developed before the Vale of Glamorgan council and the Welsh Government declared a climate emergency in .ldquoIt is time for this plan to be recognised as a prime example of outdated thinking, and finally scrapped so that Vale of Glamorgan council can prioritise spending on environmentally sound projects. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

While the SNP has been successful in winning constituency seats, Mr Salmond said his former party could end up with no MSPs at all from the regional section of the ballot.The latestopinion polls suggest the SNP on the lists ldquowould win no seats whatsoever, despite having the best part of a million votes, he said.This would mean these votes are ldquototally wasted, he said.Mr Salmond continued: ldquoThe Alba Party is a list party, we are standing only on the list, wersquore not challenging the SNP in the constituency.ldquoIndeed we are saying vote SNP or for an independence party on the constituency section, we are giving that support.He said his new party will help ldquoreinforce the momentum behind the independence cause.The Alba Party has said it will field at least four candidates in each of the regional lists.Alex Salmond Statement https:t.co wIATOmfuvmdash Alba PartyMarch , Chris McEleny, who was voted in as anSNP councillor in Inverclyde, has resigned from Ms Sturgeonrsquos party to stand in theWest of Scotland for the Alba Party.Mr Salmond said: ldquoOver the next six weeks we will promote new ideas about taking Scotland forward, giving primacyto economic recovery from the pandemic and the achievement of independence for our country.ldquoWe expect to field a minimum of four candidates in each regional list and wersquore hoping to elect Alba MSPs from every area of Scotland.Mr Salmond said the aim of the party is to work towards a ldquosuccessful, socially just, environmentally responsible, independent country.The launch of the party comes days after Mr Salmond announced plans to take legal action over the ldquoconduct of the Scottish Governmentrsquos top civil servant Leslie Evans.He said the Permanent Secretary failed to take ldquoreal responsibility for failings highlighted in two reports this week about the Governmentrsquos investigation of harassment complaints against him..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: Alex Salmond s to politics as leader of new Alba Party article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.
