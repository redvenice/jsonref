Philip Alston, UN special rappoteur on extreme poverty and human rightsHe said the Department of Work and Pensions appears to be \u0027designing a digital and sanitised version of the 19th Century workhouse, made infamous by Charles Dickens\u0027.The government hit back, saying the report lacked proper research and was politically biased, prompting Professor Alston to accuse ministers of being in \u0027total denial of a set of uncontested facts.\u0027In his latest report, which analyses the effect of climate change on extreme poverty and human rights, Professor Alston said the world faces \u0027a climate apartheid.He predicts the wealthy - who are largely to blame for climate change - will pay their way out of trouble in the future, leaving the poor and least responsible to suffer. He also warns that \u0027climate change threatens to undo the last 50 years of progress in development, global health, and poverty reduction.\u0027Alston\u0027s report, which will be presented to the UN Human Rights Council next week, cited previous research that climate change could leave 140 million across the developing world homeless by 2050.         However, he does point to several developments which he sees as positive, including the Extinction Rebellion protests\u0027Perversely, while people in poverty are responsible for just a fraction of global emissions, they will bear the brunt of climate change, and have the least capacity to protect themselves,\u0027 Alston said.\u0027We risk a \u0027climate apartheid\u0027 scenario where the wealthy pay to escape overheating, hunger and conflict while the rest of the world is left to suffer.\u0027The expert noted that despite global alarm bells ringing over the threat of climate change, the issue remains a \u0027marginal concern\u0027 within the human rights community.He specifically criticised the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights for not devoting enough attention and resources to the issue.\u0027As a full-blown crisis that threatens the human rights of vast numbers of people bears down, the usual piecemeal, issue-by-issue human rights methodology is woefully insufficient,\u0027 he said.         Greta Thunberg, the activist who inspired a school protest movement over climate, was also praised in Alston\u0027s report         World governments have no done enough to tackle the problem while human rights organisations, including the UN, have also fallen short, he said (pictured, a forest fire in Germany this week)However, he did note some positive developments in recent years - including the activism of Greta Thunberg and the school protest movement she spawned, the Extinction Rebellion movement in the UK, and a growing number of legal cases in which people are suing states over their use of fossil fuels.Alston also calls out Trump - one of the few world leaders named in his report - as an obstacle to tackling the problem.He has placed former lobbyists in oversight roles, adopted industry talking points, presided over an aggressive rollback of environmental regulations, and is actively silencing and obfuscating climate science,\u0027 he wrote.All special rapporteurs are independent experts who do not speak for the UN but report their finding to the world body."},{"url":null,"title":"Barack Obama George Clooney look dressed business sail boat Italy","story":"Share this articleGo bold in an orange floral Gucci dress like AmalThe Obamas are visiting the Clooneys in Italy, and the power couples set off for dinner on board a boat.

He describes a place of such “godforsaken loneliness” that people who stayed there too long found themselves “emotionally disturbed”.It sounded fantastic, but there were no boats running. I could only gaze across the brown waters of the River Alde towards the installations in the distance: black pagodas like temples to strange, dark gods, and concrete bunkers humped against the imminent prospect of a nuclear war. It’s easy to see why Sebald talks so often about combustion and destruction.Even if I’d made it across the water, I could never have followed him. He explores a dreamlike landscape, wandering around as if after an apocalypse: “Where and in what time I truly was that day at Orford Ness I cannot say, even now as I write these words.”I walked under grumpy grey skies across Dunwich’s empty heath, which Sebald says “lies forlorn above the sea”. Trudging through that great emptiness I drifted into dark thoughts that echoed his. Sizewell nuclear power station lurked in the distance, “its magnox block a glowering mausoleum”.Sebald gets lost on Dunwich Heath, suffering nightmarish visions of mazes that seem to resemble cross-sections of his brain. Eventually he is “dead tired and ready to lie down anywhere”. He has walked too far.I may have been driving as well as walking, but my day in Suffolk was enough to make clear the physical element of Sebald’s journey. He really put the miles in. Aside from that brief moment of exhaustion on Dunwich Heath, fatigue is barely mentioned. I was intending to follow him on foot across the old railway bridge between Walberswick and Southwold, but when I realised just how far Sebald tramped to get there I had to turn back to the car.Arriving in Southwold, the lighthouse was still as white and bright as Sebald describes. I headed up to Gun Hill, where on 28 May 1672 residents witnessed a sea battle – or they watched “acrid, yellowish smoke creeping across the entire bay” while in its midst thousands of men lost their lives. Looking out over the flat, grey sea, it was hard to imagine it had swallowed so many.Back on the sea front, the Sailor’s Reading Room provided some refuge. Originally intended as a booze-free place for local mariners to while away their hours on land, this maritime retreat remains just as Sebald describes it: “On the walls hang barometers and navigational instruments, figureheads and models of ships in glass cases and in bottles … apart from the muffled sound of the sea and the clicking of balls there is nothing to be heard.” (Actually, there was also the loud ticking of a repeater clock, but let’s not split hairs.) It felt like the only things that have changed since he was there are the newspaper headlines.We’ll never know what Sebald would have made of Boris Johnson’s bid to become prime minister, but those headlines did make me think how difficult it would be to write a book like The Rings of Saturn now. To get lost in the past when the present is so rudely screaming for attention. To be a German living in the UK, but have no need to mention it except in passing, because who would care? To walk through the flatlands of Suffolk and barely mention global warming or the startling inequalities between struggling Lowestoft and chi-chi Southwold. Maybe the fact that it now feels like it’s set in a vanished world is entirely fitting for a book so caught up in destruction and whose very last clause describes a glimpse of a landscape “now being lost for ever”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/226df2a16ca230829f4adf5b959cc28eb6eda5b9/0_0_4256_2554/master/4256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2bf87e0080cde4eed80615ecead114b7","title":"bmw electric hybrid sales eu rules","story":"Carmaker to have 25 electrified models on sale by 2023 as strict new EU rules loomBMW is accelerating its push away from the internal combustion engine towards battery technology, as the German carmaker seeks to double the number of electric and hybrid vehicles it sells in the next two years.The company will have 25 electrified models on sale in 2023, two years earlier than previously planned, it announced on Tuesday. More than half of the vehicles will be fully electric.The step up in BMW’s electrification efforts comes as European carmakers face an unprecedented challenge to their profitable business model as major markets, from the UK to the rest of the EU to China, plan to decarbonise road transport.For German carmakers including BMW, Volkswagen and Daimler, the race to move away from fossil fuels is particularly urgent. Under strict EU rules due in 2021, manufacturers must ensure average emissions from new cars are below 95g of carbon dioxide per kilometre driven or face huge fines. BMW’s models averaged carbon emissions of 128.9g per kilometre in 2018, according to the data company Jato Dynamics.The carmaker is launching a slew of models in Munich on Tuesday, including an all-electric concept sports car and the BMW Vision M Next. Before the event, Harald Krüger, the chairman of the BMW management board, said: “We are moving up a gear in the transformation towards sustainable mobility, thereby making our company fit for the future.“We will offer 25 electrified vehicles already in 2023 – two years earlier than originally planned.”BMW currently only sells one fully electric model, the i3, but this will expand to five within two years. The fully electric Mini, which will be made at BMW’s Oxford plant, will launch next month."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b02a6bf9cc506f043b6d27abb628111821791a56/0_285_6586_3951/master/6586.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7996190ef952c1602a978fc100d0b36d","title":"no deal brexit cost uk car manufacturing extra 70m day","story":"SMMT also warns car price will go up by average of £1,500 if UK leaves EU with no agreementThe cost of car manufacturing will go up £70m a day if the UK leaves the EU without a deal, making the British automotive industry more vulnerable to closures, the industry has said.It also warned for the second time this year that car prices will go up by an average of £1,500.“Leaving the EU without a deal would trigger the most seismic shift in trading conditions ever experienced by automotive, with billions of pounds of tariffs threatening to impact consumer choice and affordability,” said the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) at an industry conference in London.“The end to borderless trade could bring crippling disruptions to the industry’s just-in-time operating model. Delays to shipments of parts to production plants are measured in minutes, with every 60 seconds costing £50,000 in gross value added – amounting to some £70m a day in a worst case scenario,” it added.The warning comes as Boris Johnson continues to be the frontrunner to be the next prime minister.In a ‘no deal’ scenario, the UK would leave the single market and the customs union immediately with no ‘orce’ arrangement in place. The European Court of Justice would cease to have jurisdiction over the UK, and the country would also leave various other institutions including Euratom and Europol. The UK would no longer be paying into the EU budget, nor would it hand over the £39bn orce payment. There would be no transition period. Free movement of people into the UK from the EU27 would stop.Trade between the UK and the EU would be governed by basic WTO rules. The UK government has already indicated that it will set low or no tariffs on goods coming into the country. This would lower the price of imports - making it harder for British manufacturers to compete with foreign goods. If the UK sets the tariffs to zero on goods coming in from the EU, under WTO ‘most favoured nation’ rules it must also offer the same zero tariffs to other countries.WTO rules only cover goods - they do not apply to financial services, a significant part of the UK’s economy. Trading under WTO rules will also require border checks, which could cause delays at ports, and a severe challenge to the peace process in Ireland without alternative arrangements in place to avoid a hard border.Some ‘No Deal’ supporters have claimed that the UK can use Article 24 of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) to force the EU to accept a period of up to ten years where there are no tariffs while a free trade agreement (FTA) is negotiated. However, the UK cannot invoke Article 24 unilaterally - the EU would have to agree to it. In previous cases where the article has been used, the two sides had a deal in place, and it has never been used to replicate something of the scale and complexity of the EU and the UK’s trading relationship.Until some agreements are in place, a ‘no deal’ scenario will place extra overheads on UK businesses - for example the current government advice is that all drivers, including lorries and commercial vehicles, will require extra documentation to be able to drive in Europe after 31 October if there is no deal. Those arguing for a ‘managed’ no deal envisage that a range of smaller sector-by-sector bilateral agreements could be quickly put into place as mutual self-interest between the UK and EU to avoid introducing or rapidly remove this kind of bureaucracy.In a new report, the SMMT said the imposition of tariffs for trade in passenger cars along would be £4.5bn, a “knock out blow” to the sector’s competitiveness.The industry has already seen the loss of two big names in the past year with the closure of Honda in Swindon in 2021 and the axing of the Ford plant in Bridgend in Wales with the loss of thousands of jobs.While neither Honda nor Ford cited Brexit as a cause, the industry fears Britain’s competitiveness and unstable political environment will deter future investment by global car manufacturers.“We are already seeing investment stall. As a manufacturer you constantly invest in machinery to make sure you are more efficient, make sure you are competitive.“When the big investment decisions come with a new model, that’s when you are competing with other plants, that’s when you need to be at your most efficient and if in the previous two or three years you have underinvested it makes it much harder,” said Mike Hawes, SMMT chief executive.Few car companies want to go public on their fears over Brexit because of the backlash in the media and some political interests, sources say.Hawes said today’s analysis was based on facts, on industry and government data and warned his pleas were not fearmongering.“We are not making claims that the entire industry will close doors overnight, this industry is adaptable and agile, but it can only do so much if the barriers are particularly high, he said.He warned the industry would decline with a “death by a thousand cuts”.The car industry has little to no warehousing capacity to stockpile in the event of no deal with production based on just-in-time and just-in-sequence systems.“We have 1,100 vehicles a day coming into the UK with parts, components, we need them to move seamlessly. If we have delivery delays, that means production stops,” he said.Some component manufacturers have also been hit by the Brexit uncertainty, Hawes said, including one company in south Wales."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/acfb7c31d0dcd2f2e1d20e32661250e296fbe61c/0_362_5472_3286/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9b198bccbefa3f689dbf4e567f8c7664","title":"gold six year high geopolitical tensions trade iran fca woodford bubble business live","story":"Rolling coverage of the latest economic and financial news, as retailers report that conditions are weaker than a year agoSpeaking of cars..... the UK auto industry has sounded another warning against a no-deal Brexit.The SMMT has repeated its claim that car prices will go up by an average of £1,500 if Britain left the EU without a withdrawal agreement.It also fears that a hard border would push up costs by up to £50,000 every minute! That’s because the delicate just-in-time production systems, and complicated cross-border supply chains, would become gummed up.Here’s the full story:Britons also cut back on new car purchases this month.That suggests people are being cautious about making big-ticket spending decisions.The FT blames Britain’s poor summer for the decline in shopping.UK retail sales were hit by unseasonably cold weather in May and the trend seems to have continued in June, according to a closely watched survey.The CBI survey registered a retail sales balance of minus 42 per cent, after 16 per cent of the retailers surveyed said sales volumes were up on a year below in June, while 58 per cent said they were down.The balance was the lowest since the financial crisis and worse than markets expected.Here’s Reuters’ take on the decline in UK retail sales this month:British retail sales plunged this month at the fastest annual pace in 10 years, in part reflecting a surge in sales in June last year which were spurred by hot weather and the men’s soccer World Cup, a survey showed on Tuesday.  The Confederation of British Industry’s monthly retail sales balance fell to -42 from -27 in May, below all forecasts in a Reuters poll that had pointed to an improved reading of -10.“This month’s drop in sales should be taken with a pinch of salt, given the backdrop of last June’s heatwave and the start of the World Cup,” CBI economist Alpesh Paleja said. “But even accounting for both factors, underlying conditions on the High Street remain challenging.”The CBI found that grocers were the largest contributors to the fall in sales volumes. That backs up the idea that Britons spent more on food and drink a year ago, as they picnicked in the sun or held World Cup parties.Hardware \u0026amp DIY stores also posted declines -- perhaps it was just too wet to buy a new barbeque or ourdoor decking.Andy Bruce of Reuters isn’t convinced that this month’s slump in retail sales can be disregarded, just because June 2018 was so rosy.Economics professor Danny Blanchflower reckons Brexit uncertainty is hurting the high street:That column will be online shortly....Worryingly, many UK retailers are pessimistic about their prospects in July, and are cutting back on orders.Here are the key points from the CBI’s gloomy assessment of UK retailing:Economists are disappointed by the slump in retail sales this month:British retail sales plunged this month at the fastest annual pace in 10 years, as wet weather hurt the high street.The CBI’s monthly retail sales balance (which asks firms if sales were up, or down compared to a year ago) has plunged to -42 from -27 in May, dashing hopes of a rise to -10.However, the CBI points out that June 2018 was particularly warm - encouraging people to a) buy summer clothes and furniture, and b) splash out on food and drink as they enjoyd the Men’s football world cup.CBI chief economist Alpesh Paleja says we shouldn’t panic: This month’s drop in sales should be taken with a pinch of salt, given the backdrop of last June’s heatwave and the start of the World Cup. But even accounting for both factors, underlying conditions on the High Street remain challenging. Retailers are having to continually compete for the attention of value-conscious shoppers, in the age of digital disruption.“The new Prime Minister must help support retailers by reducing the high cumulative burden of costs they face. This should start by urgently reviewing the dire business rates system, which is unfairly impacting UK high streets and deterring much needed investment.” Of course, this year has brought the Women’s World Cup, and the Cricket one, so we’re not being starved of sport. However, the weather certainly hasn’t been as good as last year.It’s time to break away from parliament, as some alarmingly weak UK retail sales figures just landed!More to follow!Q: Shouldn’t Neil Woodford be forced to stop drawing management fees, having blocked investors from taking their money out.FCA chair Andrew Bailey says it would be “a good thing” if Woodford stopped claiming these fees, although on the other hand Woodford is managing the fund more than ever!Bailey adds that the regulator will also probe Hargreaves Lansdown over the fee reductions it negotiates on its favourite funds.

Local campaigner Ciarán Ferrie says they tried to find out who was responsible for the decision but says the bus operators, the Gardai (police), the city council and the National Transport Authority “were pointing the finger at each other”.“They have to have a better plan than to close off one of the best cycle lanes in the city during rush hour,” he says.As the international cycling conference Velo-City returns to Dublin this week for the first time since 2005, campaigners claim a “spate of improvements … plastic wands, orca iders and fresh paint” have appeared on cycle routes close to the conference venue.Ferrie likens it to the Irish tradition of having a “good room” in the house to show visitors. “There is growing disquiet among cycling advocates that the conference is being used to present a less than accurate picture of the state of cycling infrastructure in the city,” he says. “There is sense delegates are being hoodwinked in a way Potemkin would have been proud of.”Arriving at Dublin Port by ferry and cycling some of the city’s worst roads between huge lorries, tram tracks and lakes of standing water, it is not hard to see why local cyclists are fed up. Just before the conference centre a pavement cycle lane appears – but even that weaves around and occasionally spits riders out into the path of buses.The 2013 recession was a major blow to cycle development in the city. With council funds for transport schemes gobbled up by Dublin’s new tram, the Luas, just a small part of the promised 2,400km cycle network has been built. The rest is just faded lines on maps.“We had great aspirations and plans but unfortunately no willingness to prioritise cycling during the downturn,” says the former Fine Gael councillor Paddy Smyth. “It’s a city that’s relatively dry, it never snows, there’s never any ice on the road. Dublin has the perfect climate for cycling, less precipitation than Amsterdam, less snow than Copenhagen, and they are cities of comparative density.” It’s also mostly flat.Thanks to congestion, Dublin also has the slowest city centre of any European city, with traffic speeds dropping as low as 6mph.The council says it remains determined to roll out the 2013 network, and some routes have been built, including the 7km Canal Way, 3km of the Sutton to Sandycove route and 1km on Campshires South Quay. There are plans for a cycle route from the ferry port.Plans for a cycle path on the one-way main roads either side of the River Liffey have been seven years in the making. In places two lanes of motor traffic have been reduced to one, adding an extra bus lane, but cycling here remains unpleasant: “advisory” cycle lanes stop and start, used by loading vehicles, crossed by buses and disappearing to leave people on bikes in part-time bus lanes with general traffic.With a pedestrian boardwalk added to the riverside, councillors have finally agreed on a redesign – but it will be another two years before work on that starts.Brendan O’Brien, who is in charge of transport in the city, says he is “as frustrated as anyone”. “It’s actually only really this year that we have seen any significant funding allocated for cycling,” he says. “What we have been able to do … is not as much as anybody would have hoped.”It’s not just for lack of funds. In 2016, Smyth, then a councillor, proposed a “quietway” to link neighbourhoods and schools in Rathmines, south Dublin. Frustrated by delays, Smyth began organising public meetings to push the plan, but misinformation quickly spread.The proposals never even made it to consultation.But there is growing pressure to act. Dublin’s economy is booming and recent EU elections increased the number of green councillors in the city from three to 10. “Being seen with a bike has become the new kissing babies,” Ferrie says.The Green party has a plan setting out a new focus on sustainable transport. Although proposals to make public transport free have not been successful, the pedestrianisation of College Green remains on the table. There’s also pressure from the multinational tech companies that have made Dublin their European base – among them Facebook, Google, LinkedIn, Groupon and Twitter. Google is among a number of businesses that have signed up to a campaign calling for the 2013 cycle network plan to be funded.The council is also ramping up enforcement of bike lanes, and tripling the number of tow trucks with a specific target to keep bus and bike lanes clear. The problem is many cycle lanes, with dotted lines, are “advisory”, meaning drivers can legally park for 30 minutes to load – a rule O’Brien says “clouds the issue”. He says the city is looking to convert as many bike lanes as possible to “mandatory operation”, with solid white lines so parking is banned at all times.Copenhagen’s former “bicycle mayor” Klaus Bondam said ahead of this week’s conference that becoming a cycling city by 2030 is within Dublin’s grasp, but it will take “political courage, consistency and significant investment” to reallocating road space from cars to bikes. Whether Dublin will deliver remains to be seen.Speaking at the opening of the Velo-City conference, the chief executive of Dublin council, Owen Keegan, admitted his city had not done enough to protect cyclists and promote sustainable transport, but said he hoped investment was coming.“We’ve lost our way with the private car over the last 50 years,” he said. “I hope we find our way back.”Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d30f8d9468c50022feb393cfc0aa296da6bc3d6a/0_91_4324_2594/master/4324.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c63759f9b17a84f05a58ed125349b7ea","title":"britain remain brexit tory party","story":"The frontrunner’s domestic squall on Thursday night has acted as a lightning-flash illumination of the democratic fraud unfolding before our eyes. Had this tiff happened on Love Island, at least every citizen would get to vote. If a despairing lethargy hung over the prime ministerial contest, this fracas has electrified the preposterous nature of the non-choice, and our total exclusion from it. Pinch yourself: is this really be happening in a democracy? This is now a remainer nation, held hostage by extreme no-dealers.Remember, this has never happened before. It was bad enough when MPs chose the sitting prime minister – John Major, Theresa May, Gordon Brown – but for the first time the Tory party’s misbegotten 1998 rules see our fate fixed by the votes of a tiny self-selecting oligarchy. This novel experiment in non-democracy couldn’t come at a worse time, with the ruling party seized by no-deal Brexit mania, forcing all candidates to abandon truth to woo the membership’s worst delusions. Only one, Sam Gyimah, represented anything approaching the British remain majority, but he couldn’t scrape eight nominations to get into the contest: that’s the nature of the Tory beast.Look at the “choice”, between two hard-Brexiters ready to drag the county into the no-deal abyss. The Sutton Trust and Social Mobility Commission’s report lands today with perfect timing, showing that private schooling and Oxbridge still govern every British commanding height. How apt, with a “choice” between an Etonian ex-president of the Oxford Union or an admiral’s son, head boy of Charterhouse and president of the Oxford University Conservative Association.They are not Britain, these members who booed Iain Dale for asking Johnson to explain the shouting from his partner’s flat, loud enough to be heard from the street with her yelling “Get off me!” and “Get out of my flat!” Women want to know. And though the old, male Tory members may think it’s irrelevant, they may note that Johnson’s lead with real voters fell eight points in a day.Yet the UK is in mortal danger of being dragged into a no-deal Brexit against its will, with no vote, no say. Where is the rebellion against this democratic outrage? Instead we get dishonesty about obeying a long-defunct “will of the people” plus Hunt’s surprisingly frank confession on the Radio 4 Today programme that there will be no election as it would put Jeremy Corbyn into No 10. A referendum is resisted for the same reasons: Brexit would lose.Labour’s shadow cabinet today debates its miserable non-position again, as the admirable Another Europe is Possible campaign has already galvanised 300 local associations to send motions to conference demanding a switch to a “remain, reform, revolt” referendum stance. Corbyn was consulting trade unions yesterday: YouGov shows trade unionists overwhelmingly back a remain referendum. (Except Labour’s biggest donor, Len McCluskey of Unite.)Labour’s failure to take the strong remain stand that growing numbers of its shadow cabinet, and most members, support leaves an empty chair where Labour should be. How profoundly depressing that Corbyn-backing Momentum has proposed 10 conference motions but not a single one refers to Brexit. Nicky Morgan’s “alternative arrangement” yesterday was an imaginary side-deal between the UK and Ireland to let food travel freely across the border: it too was instantly exposed as balderdash by trade experts. Both Hunt and Johnson boast of magic EU negotiating tactics and wizard border wheezes neither has yet been stripped naked of such nonsense by relentless grilling. Now Theresa May says the next prime minister can avoid scrutiny by the Commons until September.Labour should be ready for an election soon, as both Tory remain rebels and StandUp4Brexit MPs from the European Research Group pledge to pull down a Johnson government if he deviates either way. Nigel Farage yesterday proposed a pact with the Tories that would deliver a devastating hard Brexit crash-out. This could see the remain majority crushed by a minority ToryFarage Brexit machine. The only salvation would be the remain parties knocking all heads together to fight as an anti-Brexit alliance.

The people holding those top jobs, in politics, the media, the judiciary and business, are five times more likely to have been to private school than the general population.It is not surprising, though it is depressing. I have often lamented the deference that so many of us still seem to feel towards those who embody this well-established pipeline from prep to parliament, who walk the walk and talk the talk of the old aristocratic elite – Boris Johnson’s continued rise, despite little evidence of talent or integrity, being the most pertinent recent example. There seems to be more than a little bit of Downton-ish forelock-tugging, “they were good to us up at the big house”, feeling of residual inferiority about it. Why the continued respect where there should be scorn and suspicion for those who buy themselves advantages in life and then coast through, seemingly answerable to no one?Well, I don’t respect it. I’m polite about it, as you can’t blame an inidual child for the circumstances of his or her birth whether rich or poor, but I won’t pretend I think any of those privately educated people who dominate Britain are better than you or me (because the chances are you went to state school, too. Most of us did, after all). I’m always going to be more impressed by a kid from a council estate and a struggling comprehensive who gets four As at A-level than I am by someone with the same grades who has been spoon-fed Latin their whole education before being shepherded to repeated Oxbridge interview roleplay sessions.The question is: why aren’t Oxbridge interviewers impressed by this? Oxford and Cambridge are improving their intake, but progress is slow, and despite the laughable fears of some independent schools that their pupils are being discriminated against, not enough is being done. In 2018 the Sutton Trust accused Oxford and Cambridge of being so socially exclusive that they recruited more students from eight top schools than almost 3,000 other UK state schools put together. That’s simply unjustifiable. Furthermore, it’s a plucky state school child that would stride willingly and confidently into such an environment.Yet the off-putting aspects of a group – whether at university or in the world of work – dominated by private school pupils is never talked about. Our continued delusion that we live in a meritocracy masks any dissenting view. Could it not be argued that a dominance of private school and Oxbridge workers is likely to block innovation, creativity and vision in many industries? That it perpetuates a sort of parochial, small-c, conservativeness – a dullness. It’s so boring. People will hire in their own image, and then they all have dinner parties with each other, have the same in-jokes. It’s cliquey and exclusive, overwhelmingly white, rife with nepotism, profoundly uncool and unexciting.The social confidence afforded to the privately educated is always cited but never challenged, despite Hugh Grant forging an entire early acting career from a posh, bumbling inability to talk to women. Is it really acceptable to recruit so many men from single-sex boarding schools who struggle to look women in the eye? (The same problem exists in reverse too, of course, though fewer of these women will be in managerial positions). Any state-educated woman in a top industry will recognise this. At first it’s amusing, then baffling, then infuriating. It undoubtedly halts women’s progress in the workplace.I’ll be attacked for this, as I always am when I write about our revolting, outdated class system. Nevertheless, recruiters need to open their eyes to the potential downsides of candidates who are privately educated, and instead of looking at a woman’s date of birth or a person of colour’s surname and, despite it being illegal, tossing that CV into the wastepaper basket. “Oof,” they could say, “went to Eton. Might be a bit unimaginative, probably not very good at managing teams with women working on them, could be a bit blinkered by privilege.”This is not to say that privately educated Oxbridge graduates are bad people or don’t have anything good to bring to the table – just that perhaps we need to stop focusing so much on what’s fair and instead look at what’s most interesting and imaginative. I have a friend who worked for an organisation that claimed to be at the cutting edge of culture, philosophy and ideas. They wouldn’t look at a CV unless it had an Oxbridge college on it. I’m sure there were some excellent candidates, but let’s not pretend that anything particularly transgressive or exciting is going to emerge as a result of such hiring policies.Companies and organisations need to be more transparent about their hiring policies. Just as we had a gender pay gap audit, so should we have a class audit. It could take into account multiple factors to account for the full picture of class today. All companies should have to publish the results. They should do more outreach, too, so that students feel that they are wanted, regardless of a disadvantaged, or even normal, background. More mentoring schemes would also be beneficial, more affordable training, too. And, as always, more opportunities outside of London.There are practical steps that can be taken, but the more psychological shift of facing up to the fact that a private school education doesn’t always make a better candidate is something that I fear will take many generations to unpick."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f857caab081a06e58ebf6bb3cf8028626b4d0934/0_36_2150_1291/master/2150.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c259d76acbdcd679aba87e5e82252a29","title":"your pictures share your photos on the theme of needle","story":"Wherever you are in the world, this week we’d like to see your pictures on the theme ‘needle’The next theme for our weekly photography assignment, published in print in the Observer New Review is ‘needle’.Share your photos of what needle means to you – and tell us about your image in the description box.The closing date is Wednesday 26 June at 10am.

The former House of Cards actor Kevin Spacey supported her following the death of her husband, Michael Williams, in 2001.In 2018, it was alleged that Spacey invited the actor Anthony Rapp to a party at his home in 1986, when Spacey was 26 and Rapp was 14. Rapp alleged that Spacey lifted him on to his bed and tried to climb on top of him.Spacey responded to the allegations at the time saying he did not remember the incident, but apologising for it nonetheless.In an online statement, he said: “I honestly do not remember the encounter, it would have been over 30 years ago. But if I did behave then as he describes, I owe him the sincerest apology for what would have been deeply inappropriate drunken behaviour, and I am sorry for the feelings he describes having carried with him all these years.”Spacey has since faced other allegations about sexual misconduct. Following the claims, a special Emmy award that was due to be given to Spacey was revoked. The Old Vic, where Spacey was artistic director between 2004 and 2015, expressed its dismay at the allegations against him.Dench was one of the first celebrities to publicly denounce Weinstein after claims against him, saying she was “horrified” by his alleged behaviour.Weinstein was removed from the board of his company and stripped of many accolades after dozens of women came forward to allege that they were sexually assaulted or raped by him.He was indicted on charges of rape and a criminal sexual act in 2018 but pleads not guilty to the claims against him, and has denied any non-consensual sex.In a wide-ranging interview, Dench also spoke to the Radio Times about losing her eyesight and having to stop driving.“I can’t read the paper now, I can’t do the crossword, I can’t read a book,” she says, “but, you know, you cope. I’ve got people who read to me and coach me with my lines,” she said.She dismissed the discomfort, putting it down to being part of her job: “On a film set you learn where everything is. It’s OK if you can get away with it. It’s all acting, after all. Fooling people. It’s what I do.”But she described the realisation that she would have to stop driving as traumatising.“It was absolutely appalling,” she said. “But I just know I’ll kill somebody if I get behind the wheel of a car now.”Dench does not know what will happen to her eyesight but said she feels more comfortable not knowing the prognosis.“I don’t want to know,” she said. “There’s nothing you can do. You adapt to it. So I ignore it altogether.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/36499a88967eacb539dbf179f3f9167009cf446a/0_224_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bf0057641597e46837f947c0f9bb4a6c","title":"forest schools more marketing than outdoor education","story":"Some UK schools have merely jumped on the bandwagon of the popular Scandinavian idea, a new book arguesAsh trees rustle in the breeze while beneath them muddy children run free, collecting leaves and searching for bugs in the shadows. This must be a forest school. Or is it?According to academics in a book, Critical Issues in Forest Schools, to be published next month, there is a high probability that it is not a forest school as, it says, large numbers of nurseries, primaries and secondaries are falsely claiming claim to be one.The forest school movement, introduced to the UK about 25 years ago, has taken off in the last decade, partly as an alternative to the formal, test-driven infant and primary curriculum. It is seen as a way of getting children outdoors, in touch with nature and away from their phones and computers.The concept was inherited from Scandinavian outdoor kindergarten lessons and has grown in the UK into a distinct approach to teaching and learning. The lessons are outdoors, usually in wooded areas, and are learner-centred, and play-based.But some schools and nurseries, in both the state and independent sectors, are using the term as a marketing tool. Parents are being misled because the term is being widely used to describe general outdoor “getting muddy” activities, or one-off environmental sessions.The authors of the book, themselves involved in forest schools, say the idea should be about discovery learning over an extended period, with children involved in meaningful and challenging activities. These should entail some risk – lighting fires, or learning to use knives, for example.Taking children outdoors to go pond dipping, or to learn about the Vikings, doesn’t make your school a forest school, says Mark Sackville-Ford, a lecturer in education at Manchester politan University (MMU) and co-editor of the book. “Forest school sets children free to follow their curiosity, it is slightly subversive, an antidote to the results and test-driven classroom,” he says.The book, a collection of papers from academics and teachers, defines the essence of forest schools, the processes by which children learn in the sessions and the challenges for practitioners.Elizabeth Irvin, headteacher of St Mary’s primary in Stockport, which is a forest school, and a contributor to the book, says not all schools are in it for the right reasons. “The saddest comment I heard was by a headteacher who said ‘I can’t afford not to do it because every other school around me is doing it and it looks good on your website’,” she says. At St Mary’s, the principles of forest school are embedded for each year group.Businesses have been set up offering “forest school experiences” and training, claiming they improve pupils’ self-esteem and promote healthier lifestyles. Even companies selling products such as rubber boots and waterproofs are jumping on the bandwagon, with one telling teachers that all they need to do to become a forest school is “simply take your lesson outdoors”.Mel McCree, a lecturer in early childhood studies at Bath Spa University, has coined the terms “FS full-fat” for forest schools that follow the principles, “FS lite” for ones that try but don’t succeed, and “FS ultra-lite” for those that are forest schools in name only.The Forest School Association (FSA), the professional body in the UK, promotes six principles on which sessions should be based.Not all of its 2,000 members will be leading a full forest school, says Gareth Wyn Davies, its chief executive. There are forest school leaders who are trained and committed but cannot deliver because their schools don’t have the money, or won’t devote the time to it, he says.“In addition, the term ‘forest school’ has taken on a life of its own. People are calling anything outdoorsy a forest school when it should be something held over a long period of time, be about child-centred learning and be engagement with the natural world,” he says.“It focuses on children being guided by their own curiosity rather than completing tasks set by the teacher. They are learning through play and discovery, collaboration and risk taking, climbing trees and using knives.”Forest schools should be offering children another way of learning, says Sackville-Ford. “In the education system at the moment when all that seems to matter is the Sats score, being a forest school gives legitimacy to other things.”What stands out in his memory is a 10-year-old boy who had little status in the classroom with his more fortunate peers. “It was quite a prosperous area and he was less successful academically and dismissed by many of his peers. In the forest school environment, when he could shin up a tree and light a fire in seconds, his peer group suddenly changed their approach to him,” he says.However, despite the anecdotal evidence of the benefits, there is a lack of formal research findings, says Mark Leather, a lecturer in outdoor education at the University of St Mark and St John, in Plymouth. He conducted a study of forest school research and reports in his paper – A critique of forest school: Something lost in translation – that he found no reliable evidence that it improved pupils’ confidence and self esteem.“I’m a great fan of the forest school movement and the way it seeks to provide a badge of quality but the commodification of it has created problems, including the tendency to make claims for the benefits that overreach the available evidence,” says Leather, a founder member of the British Education Research Association’s new Nature Outdoor Learning and Play special interest group.Done properly, the benefits are there for all to see, says Helen Davenport, a lecturer in primary education at MMU and a co-author of the book.“Being sat around a fire, being fully immersed in whittling a spoon, erecting a shelter or seeing a pupil in a new light can all fuel romantic thinking about alternative approaches to education,” she says. “You see children building a shelter with tarpaulins, sticks and ropes or making face paint out of nettles and some making bracelets out of saplings. It’s so calm. It’s magical.” On the other hand, she knows of sessions where what goes on inside is brought outside: “I’ve see written work from the classroom brought outside with worksheets and, on one occasion, desks as well,” she says. “That is not forest school, nor is it when the children come out to find laminated posters stuck to trees with number challenges and marker pens.”Critical Issues in Forest Schools by Mark Sackville-Ford \u0026amp Helen Davenport is published by SAGE.

They also learned to take responsibility for looking after them.”Classrooms across the UK house a wide range of school pets: hamsters, fish, guinea pigs and even tortoises. But though they teach children about nature it is not always a happy story, animal charities say, and it might be teaching children the wrong lessons.In some schools, animals are left alone for long periods, over-handled and farmed out to different homes at weekends. Some die because the school cannot afford vets’ fees, the charities say. They are calling on schools to find other ways of teaching about nature and taking responsibility, perhaps by creating their own wildlife areas instead.The eggs at Derby High came from a company that provided detailed instructions on how to care for the ducklings and took them back to rear, but the service costs money not all schools can afford.Classrooms can be noisy and frightening places for some animals, the RSPCA and the charity Peta (People For the Ethical Treatment of Animals) say. Peta says it hears complaints that animals have died after being forgotten during school holidays, or through accidents in pupils’ homes. “Many teachers who keep classroom pets do so with good intentions. But a classroom simply isn’t a suitable home for an animal, and there are many factors that kind teachers need to consider before bringing one into theirs,” says Elisa Allen, the charity’s director.“The sleep-wake cycles of nocturnal animals, such as mice and hamsters, are disrupted by bright classroom lights and by pupils who disturb sleeping animals by taking them out of their cages and handling them,” she says.The Potteries Guinea Pig Rescue, based in Stoke-on-Trent, has taken in a number of guinea pigs from schools in North Staffordshire that have found themselves unable to care for the animals.“We have taken in many pairs of guinea pigs from schools that were originally classroom pets,” says Helen Chadwick, its founder and rescue manager. “The school thought it was a good idea until the animal experienced health issues and they had to pay for vet treatment. Any pet in school sets an example that caring for animals is part-time. To promote responsible pet ownership we want to see all pets treated as part of the family unit, with their needs catered for 24 hours a day.“It’s vital in an age still so contaminated with animal neglect and cruelty that our generation set an example to children,” she says. “I can’t imagine many things worse than being limited to a cage stuck in a noisy classroom all day.” At Derby High, Holmes says it’s important for children to learn how to care for animals. “Actually seeing the ducklings hatch brings nature to life and makes the topic much more meaningful and purposeful. They absolutely loved having them in class and would check on them regularly making sure they had plenty of food and water.”However, Debs Howe, a former biology teacher who runs Eggucation, an ethical egg hatching company, says that, done responsibly, looking after animals can be an experience children don’t forget. “It inspires them to learn more about the natural world. For children who may have issues accessing the curriculum, often due to autism or emotional or behavioural issues, the hatching of chicks has an incredible effect.“It’s also a fantastic way for children from inner-city schools, who may never have seen farm animals or the countryside, to experience animals and nature and learn how to care for them.”Despite concerns, many schools continue to use animals to teach children about nature and as therapy. The guinea pig Snowball even won praise from Ofsted inspectors at Upton primary, near Halifax, West Yorkshire. Their report said: “Opportunities to look after Snowball, the school pet, inspire pupils to consider their actions and help them understand the importance of being calm and caring.”However, the RSPCA says: “We would discourage educational establishments from attempting to keep and look after animals themselves. We believe that children can be taught about animals without keeping pets in the classroom. Unfortunately, it is not uncommon for pets intended to live at a school to require rehoming.”Some schools have solved the problem by using dogs belonging to staff members, parents or friends of the school. Kings Hill primary, in West Malling, Kent, for example, has two dogs – Charlie a therapy dog and Duke, a reading dog.“Children who struggle find it easier to read to Duke, our American cocker iel, because he doesn’t correct them and they then start to enjoy the story and are reading for pleasure,” says Georgette Williams, the head of inclusion. “It is our most successful intervention.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9c9d2fd9a92931351f08c529db5ed88154495bbc/0_0_3000_1801/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=316ace8d5b227cccef13791770c6e88d","title":"how we made candyman virginia madsen tony todd bee sting","story":"The director and star of the horror classic remember acting with swarming insects – and using hypnosis to get a deeper performance from Virginia MadsenHorror was considered a debased genre in the early 90s and people were looking for a new direction. I found a story in Clive Barker’s Books of Blood collection that I thought had potential: The Forbidden, about a middle-class women fascinated by a Merseyside housing estate. I knew Clive a little, so he gave me a free option. After the nightmare he had had on Hellraiser, where it was redubbed into American English, I decided to set the film in the US.They wouldn’t let us go there at first without a police escort. The social ide was really extreme compared to anything in a Liverpool housing estate. But despite its reputation, most people there were just getting on with their lives. The fear people had of walking around there was the very essence of racism – it is ultimately based on the fear of the other, or the unknown.We only shot for a week in Cabrini-Green, to do the wide shots and the exteriors. The rest was done on a set in Los Angeles. I tried to listen to the black actors and not fall into the Hollywood trap of imposing racial stereotypes and to make people rounded characters, not ciphers or caricatures. Kasi Lemmons, who plays the lead character Helen’s friend – and later directed Eve’s Bayou – was very helpful with details.I was watching Johnny Carson’s show when it featured a professor of entomology, Norman Gary, who had an act where he would play the clarinet covered in bees. He had synthesised queen-bee pheromone and would cover himself in it so they wouldn’t sting. Immediately, I knew this was how we would do the scenes where the bees engulf Candyman and Helen. We worked on those scenes for days. It was difficult and stressful. Gary was breeding immature bees in hives on the studio roof – they don’t have any venom, so we tried to use those. After every shot, he would vacuum them up into a little soft pouch and take them back to their dressing room. All Tony had was a dental dam to prevent them going down his throat. He was very courageous – it’s such an unsettling and stunning image when the bees emerge from his mouth.I’m also a blues musician, and all blues artists can trace their pain to the slavery fields of the Mississippi Delta. Anyone who’s a fan of jazz and blues can hear that howl. I consider this film a direct descendant of that. Bernard and I hung out in Chicago for a few days while he did location work. I wasn’t worried about him being a white English guy, we were like lost siblings who had found each other. I trusted his intellectualism and my own instincts. I knew I wasn’t going to create a caricature and that I wanted to root the character deep in the history of slavery in America.I negotiated a bonus of $1,000 for every sting during the bee scene. And I got stung 23 times. Everything that’s worth making has to involve some sort of pain. Once I realised it was an important part of who Candyman was, I embraced it. It was like putting on a beautiful coat.I’ve done 200 movies, this is the one that stays in people’s minds. It affects people of all races. I’ve used it as an introductory tool in gang-intervention work: what frightens you? What horrible things have you experienced? Let’s see what Jordan Peele produces with his sequel. They’re planning to shoot entirely in Chicago, where Cabrini-Green has been torn down and gentrified – the new film will explore all that.• Bernard Rose’s Samurai Marathon, is at Edinburgh film festival on 25 and 26 June."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8d8383447539046bf230adeeb2093497c66ce364/0_1806_4776_2864/master/4776.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=da2b344a8b4d246c863dd46e3cc3c97d","title":"nigel slater squid with pea and coriander chutney recipe","story":"Tender squid rings in a piquant spicy green chutneyChop 75g of coriander leaves and stems and put them in a blender.

Sarri returned the club to the Champions League with a third-placed Premier League finish and won the Europa League.Chelsea are ready to pay a compensation fee of £4m to Derby for Lampard and they could unveil him this week.Lampard enjoyed an encouraging first season in management at Derby, taking them to the Championship play-off final, which they lost to Aston Villa. His impact has been profound, particularly on the players, who have admired his professionalism and enjoyed working with him. He has transformed the team’s style of play.In their hearts, though, the players have known it would be difficult for Lampard to turn down Chelsea, for whom he scored a record 211 goals in 649 appearances over 13 years, and Lampard’s return to Stamford Bridge looks like a formality.Lampard’s managerial inexperience is well-documented and, in other circumstances, the Chelsea hierarchy might have preferred to have waited for him. But he came to be their No 1 candidate, as other targets – including Massimiliano Allegri – proved out of reach. Allegri has announced that he will take a year out from football after stepping down from the Juventus job.Lampard’s appeal is obvious on a romantic level and it is clear that he will galvanise a Chelsea fanbase which grew frustrated with Sarri’s sometimes ponderous football. But more practically, with the club set to serve a Fifa transfer ban for breaches of the rules regarding the registration of under-18 foreign players, it is expected that Lampard will embrace the necessity of promoting academy products.Lampard worked productively at Derby with Mason Mount and Fikayo Tomori, who were on loan from Stamford Bridge, and he knows that he will most likely have to lean on other talents such as Reece James and Tammy Abraham – together with Callum Hudson-Odoi when he recovers from achilles surgery.Lampard would like to bring his Derby assistant Jody Morris – another former Chelsea player and Under-18s coach – to Stamford Bridge, along with the fitness coach, Chris Jones.

But there is not a hint of doubt in his voice. “The only thing missing from him was what I did best, scoring headers. He didn’t get many goals with his head. Everything else, complete: left foot, right foot, power, ability, magic! He had everything. In training it was better than the weekend. He was a phenomenon.”With Ronaldo and Roberto Baggio hogging the No 9 and No 10 jerseys at Inter, the Chilean had to improvise. “The sporting director, Sandro Mazzola, told me to pick a number that added up to nine. I said: ‘Can I add a plus sign?’ He told me not to. I said: ‘How come? Request permission.’ I spoke to the president, Massimo Moratti, who asked the Italian federation. So I played with 18, 1+8, and I didn’t lose the No 9.”Despite scoring 34 goals in 69 games for Chile, Zamorano never won a trophy with the national team. Over an international career that ned three decades, he often led the line with Chile’s other star, Marcelo Salas, yet the players behind the front two were not quite at their level and success eluded them. Chile have been blessed with a more complete set of players in recent years and Alexis Sánchez, their current leading man, has overtaken both Zamorano and Salas to become the country’s all-time top scorer.Coming off the back of a difficult season in Manchester, Sánchez has recaptured his form at the Copa América with two goals in his first two games. “Manchester use him in a different way than he is used for the national team,” says Zamorano. “When he pulls on the Chile shirt, Alexis always responds. For Chile he defends less and has more freedom, but in Manchester he has to track back.”Unlike a lot of United fans, Zamorano believes Sánchez will eventually enjoy success for the club – just as he has in two other red shirts. “I’m convinced that at some point Alexis will blow up in Manchester and will be the same player he was at Arsenal and the same player who impresses for the national team. It takes time. The first year at United was difficult, with many injuries and pressure. It will take a little time for him to explode.”Yet Zamorano has been unimpressed by the style of football on show in the tournament. He has high standards, having played in some wonderful attacking teams – including the Real Madrid side that won La Liga in 1994-95 playing a swashbuckling brand of football under Jorge Valdano. Zamorano says that was the best season of his career. “I was top scorer, champion, best player. It was with Jorge Valdano – a coach who was very important to me. He had been World Cup champion and a coach who makes you grow as a player.”Zamorano’s complaints about the tournament echo those of his former manager. “There are interesting things and not-so-good things,” he says. “Coaches need to risk a little more so we can see better football. The teams play very defensively. Football lovers want to see a game with more goals, more great games. There are many teams that try to play better than others. Colombia is one that tries to play. Chile try to play.”“Brazil try, but they do not have the ability to make a difference on the pitch. There are now questions about Brazil not having Neymar, but when he got injured some people said: ‘Brazil play better without Neymar.’ I don’t see it like that. On paper, we see that some teams are better than others, but today you don’t win anything with your shirt or with history.”Brazil may or may not miss Neymar but Zamorano is certain that none of their current players measures up to his old teammate Ronaldo. Without the injuries, could he have been the greatest of all time? “Ronaldo is among the best. Pelé, Maradona, Beckenbauer, Cruyff, Messi, Cristiano, Ronaldo ... he’s on this list of the 10 greatest players ever. Injuries are something that no player wants, but when I see a player who has the ability to recover from what happened to his knees, he deserves credit. A lot of people said he didn’t work hard or have that desire. But I was close to him at the time of his knee injury. He said: ‘I’m going to recover.’ He worked like nobody else and came back even better.”• Yellow \u0026amp Green Football are on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter• Joshua Law, Tom Sanderson and Bruno Freitas are on Twitter"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9ea599d5415b8c8face814e517160e4ad76aa5fe/21_136_3394_2036/master/3394.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=657b7e518d3975359dcb43fb4b5e65ad","title":"rafa benitez departure newcastle mike ashley","story":"Just over three weeks ago, there was a palpable though repressed gasp of relief on Tyneside as news began to surface that an investment firm in the Middle East was on the brink of taking over Newcastle United. Just days earlier, a feeling of optimism had coursed through the streets of the city after promising contract discussions between the much-adored manager, Rafa Benítez, and the woeful owner, Mike Ashley.The masterly and reassuringly calm presence of the Spaniard looked increasingly likely to stay, as his boss – though more often than not, adversary – appeared finally to be on his way out. There was therefore a sense of astonishment that accompanied news on Monday that Benítez, after three and a half years of unrelenting graft and unrewarded loyalty, was to depart the club. A disagreement in vision between Ashley – an owner sculpted in the vision of a footballing Scrooge – and the manager was the cause for the split.While many fans knew it was always a possibility that Benítez would leave – 12 years of Ashley has desensitised us – few were truly braced for what came, and nor too was Benítez, supposedly. Such is obvious from the utterly deflated atmosphere in the city, the response from club legends Alan Shearer and Robbie Elliott, and the mood, dare I say it, on social media.When good things come to an end, it seems fitting that you look back on their beginnings. And there is no doubting that Benítez’s arrival on Tyneside was special. Having won trophies including a Champions League, two Uefa CupsEuropa Leagues, two La Liga titles and an FA Cup, you would be forgiven for thinking Newcastle United was an outlier on an otherwise glittering CV.The truth is – and this is exactly what endeared him to so many – he saw the value in the project, the fans, the unrealised potential of a club that had been cut adrift for too long. The aim was not to compete with clubs such as Manchester City or Chelsea – the ambition Ashley constantly ascribes to the fans – but to return some modicum of pride to a club that had for too long been paralysed by underinvestment and short-sightedness.For more than three years he battled to realise that ambition, lifting an honest and downtrodden team back from the Championship and, with minimal investment, defying expectations to twice keep them in the Premier League, with an overall net spend of minus £11.2m. His gritty style earned famous victories against Manchester United, Manchester City, Spurs, Chelsea and Arsenal arguably no manager has done more with less.Carrying on the charity work he was known for at Liverpool, Benítez has forged a deep connection with the community in Newcastle. From supporting the NUFC Foodbank and the Sir Bobby Robson Foundation, to attending the disabled supporters’ association the day he signed a new deal, the man was a class act on and off the pitch. The city stands to lose so much more than a managerial hero.However, Benítez’s departure is conceivably the worst thing that has happened here, supplanting Robson’s sacking and both of Keegan’s resignations. We were an established Premier League club then, challenging at the right end of the table. Without a manager like Benítez, we run the risk of going and never coming back.Already, odds have been massively shortened for the club to go down which, and when you look at some of the names being mentioned as Benítez’s successor in the media, such as Avram Grant and Michael Appleton – yes, you are reading that correctly – it is unsurprising.That Benítez, who embodied the undying spirit and resilience of the club, has been allowed to leave sends the clearest message yet that this regime has been, and will continue to be, guided by unscrupulous avarice and self-serving pig-headedness. It sends a message to the hundreds of thousands of doting supporters whose hard-earned money has been spent on following their team up and down the country, across Europe and further afield, that they simply do not care. At best, they are downright ignorant as to what is in front of them.Barring a journey across the Tyne and a few miles south to Sunderland, whatever Benítez chooses to do next, he will have the full support of Newcastle fans. I would like to think few would fault him for his departure – a dignified refusal to play the puppet Ashley wanted of him – and he will for ever, regretfully, be remembered as the one that got away.If there were to be one silver lining in the thick dark clouds that have hung over Newcastle United over the past 12 years, it is that the man who oversaw these evidently catastrophic renewal talks with Benítez may well be following him out of the door soon enough. Ashley supposedly remains in talks with several potential purchasers, including the Dubai-based billionaire Sheikh Khaled bin Zayed al-Nahyan of the United Arab Emirates.That said, the club arguably derived so much of its present value – what Ashley deems to be £350m – from its manager and what he represented he was the pride of the club, upon whom our survival in the Premier League has been reliant, and upon whom our imagined future rested. With Benítez gone, it’s plausible the investors’ interest will drop off.And in the wings, the fans will be left, as they often have been under this regime, with a sense of nothingness. Pre-season starts in 10 days: no manager, no signings, no hope.• @HAJSavill is editor of The Spectator’s View"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/766b4cf4311b77d1db9c6e2f3a9da7bae290eca7/0_43_2568_1541/master/2568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=741de04e8562c9a4cdf40c76a8787c9f","title":"womens world cup usa france uswnt quarter final","story":"Arguably the two best teams at the World Cup will meet in the quarter-finals. And the reigning champions got the test they perhaps needed against Spain on MondayThe US are through to the quarter-final of the World Cup after a less-than-convincing 2-1 win over Spain. It wasn’t pretty for the Americans, and the reigning champions finally look vulnerable. Here are the key takeaways from Monday’s round of 16 match.From the moment the World Cup draw was made, everyone seemed to be talking about the possibility that the host nation, France, could face the No 1-ranked team, the US.Now it’s really happening. Not only will the match send a favorite packing, it should be a brilliant display of two top-quality teams with massive fan support squaring off.For all the talk of Spain being a technical team, their gameplan on Monday seemed to be more about pestering the US, and the favorites never looked settled. Alex Morgan in particular was the target of an extra little dig every time she challenged for the ball, and by the end of the game it appeared all those knocks were catching up. “We were trying to tell the ref that, especially with Alex, it was upper back every single time,” Rapinoe said of Spain’s fouling. At one point, Morgan could be seen counting to the ref, apparently showing how many times she had been kneed in the back. That’s why the penalty that Rose Lavelle earned was so surprising. If there was contact, it was minimal – but public opinion from pundits and fans on social media has been split. “I got kicked in the shin,” Lavelle said when asked if she felt the call was correct. “A foul’s a foul, so I guess it’s a penalty, yeah.”VAR hasn’t exactly shone in this tournament, and those who disagree with the penalty will be annoyed the referee didn’t overturn her decision. But if “clear and obvious” is supposed to be the standard, perhaps VAR worked better in this match than others – with opinion ided as to whether Virginia Torrecilla made contact with Lavelle, it was probably best to let the on-field call stand.France, who await in the quarter-finals, are a much stronger and more athletic team than Spain, and if they go after the US players like Spain did, it could be a tough match for the champions.USA’s utter dominance of their group games led many pundits to declare that the Americans would stroll to the final. But winning a World Cup is never going to be cushy all the way through, and it was unclear how the Americans would cope with adversity.The US response against Spain wasn’t all that convincing. But it may be that they needed a tougher match to fortify their resolve. Becky Sauerbrunn said as much after the Spain game. “It was good to know we could grind out a victory and if we needed to win dirty, we could win dirty,” she said.The Americans have the oldest squad in France, but they do have a slew of players – such as Lavelle, Samantha Mewis, Lindsey Horan and Abby Dahlkemper – making their World Cup debuts. The newbies gained valuable lessons on Monday.“When you get to the knockout round, it’s so much more pressure and it’s so much more tense out there,” Rapinoe said. “Everything matters, every play matters, and every wave of the game is important. Halfway through the second half it was like, ‘We need to take this up a notch.’ There’s quite a few of us that have been there and realize those moments, and that experience was good for us today.”Who was at fault for Spain’s goal? Was it goalkeeper Alyssa Naeher for playing the ball to Becky Sauerbrunn, who had her back turned to her opponent? Or was it Sauerbrunn, who didn’t respond quickly enough to the pressure from forward Lucia Garcia?Sauerbrunn accepted the blame after the match, saying she tried to play through the pressure rather than clear the ball. She also fielded questions about Naeher, insisting that the doubts about the goalkeeper were more about building narratives in the media than anything else.She may be right, but it doesn’t mean those narratives are going away. The scariest moment of the group stage for the US was a Naeher gaff on a Chile set-piece that would have resulted in a goal without the offside flag. And Spain’s goal, of course, came from an error too.Rapinoe, however, said mistakes will happen – it’s all about how the US respond to them. “Those things are going to happen,” she said. “Obviously we don’t want them to happen but when they do, we can’t be, ‘Don’t do that!’ and dwelling on it – it’s like, ‘No shit, don’t do that.’ Just stay in it and have each other’s back.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/34241d7a958a24bc0a52be6a3ba502580b55aae8/0_341_5120_3072/master/5120.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=29099b8b43e65da8f49d78a88564c97f","title":"tell us about the one lifestyle change that worked for you","story":"As part of a series exploring how one change can make a profound personal impact, we want to hear from youWhat is the most impactful lifestyle change that you have made that has improved your health and wellbeing?

Fifty years after the Stonewall Inn in New York became the symbol for a new wave of gay activism, the three horsemen of the gay bar apocalypse – gentrification, assimilation and technology – have hollowed out their numbers.Rising rents have shuttered gay bars more straight venues are “accepting” of gay patrons and dating is something people now do with their phones. Even the term “gay bar” looks a little tired as the LGBTQ community finally comes to terms with its many rainbow stripes.But across America – and especially in less progressive states and communities – the gay bar is as vibrant and vital as it has ever been. It’s a rallying point in times of trial and celebration. It is the pumping heart of a community that, as the Trump administration rolls back its rights, needs its own space more than it has in years.You can find Wonderlust, the only gay bar in Jackson, Mississippi, on the northern edge of town, just past the Piggly Wiggly supermarket and the duelling discount stores Dollar General and Dollar Tree. Housed in a long, black, squat building, Wonderlust is marked by panels painted in a sort of rainbow flag. The colours are off – hospital green, shop-soiled peach, sun-bleached eggplant – as if picked from a paint store’s remainder bin.It’s not much to look at, but a bar on this spot has been a haven for Mississippi’s LGBTQ community for more than 25 years.Mississippi is one of the most conservative states in the US. A majority still disagree with same-sex marriage – one of just two states – the other is Alabama – to still hold that view. A few years ago, a Mississippi pastor even brought a horse in a wedding dress to the federal courthouse to protest against gay marriage. State law means businesses can deny service to queer people if doing so would conflict with their “sincerely held” religious beliefs.Gay people here are mostly discreet. Either that or they leave the state. So Wonderlust has become the one public place where they feel safe to be themselves. “There’s a lot of hate in the world,” says Jodi Sullivan, a trans woman and a Wonderlust regular. “It’s either come here or sit at home.”“It’s the Bible belt. Everybody isn’t as accepting of us as other places,” says Drew Gully-Luckett, who, along with his husband John-Corey, is in the process of taking over the bar.Even going out for dinner together in Jackson can have its issues. “If we sit on the same side of the booth, people will look at us funny,” says Gully-Luckett. “We don’t hold hands.”A few years ago, protesters picketed the bar. “It wasn’t a large group,” he says, casually. “Just” 10 to 12 men outside in jacked-up trucks, one with a Confederate flag, “yelling Bible verses and telling us we are going to hell, and if we talk to them we’ll be forgiven”.I tell him that sounds terrifying. He shrugs: “If you just ignore them, there’s nothing they can do.”There are no protests tonight, but as we walk in, a man approaches us asking that we not take his picture or identify him. A prominent sign on the door says the  is filming and interviewing people. He’s a government worker in his 30s. “They don’t know I’m out,” he says.Inside, everyone is out – at least for a good time. Wonderlust is a riot of inclusivity. The crowd is young, old, black, white, Hiic, trans, straight, gay, lesbian, undecided. The music is pumping, there’s a drag show, dancing, laughing, more drinking, pool tables. By 11pm on Saturday, there isn’t a space left on the car park.If there’s a better time to be had for a hundred miles, good luck finding it.But there’s also a layer of sadness draped over this southern charm. Mississippi is stuck in the past. Many of the patrons said they would move if not for financial or family ties.“Being black and gay in the south – it’s rough,” says Michael Johnson, a regular who drives close to an hour to come to Wonderlust. And yet he’s hopeful about the future. “The south has come a long way,” he says. “I see a change. It’s slow, but it’s a change,” he says. “But it’s hard.”He continues: “When I first discovered Wonderlust, it was like a burden was lifted off. It gave me a place to come where I could really let go and be myself. It was a place where I felt comfortable enough to be myself and in this damn time you need that.”The LGBTQ community has achieved major victories in recent years, but Curt Sullivan-Ellis, a tall, handsome bearded man in a checked shirt who is also the drag queen London DuMore, says life has got worse under Trump.Legislators in Mississippi have felt empowered to chip away at hard-won rights, he says, and that message has not been lost on the haters.“I feel sometimes I could be attacked,” he says. “I see a lot more hatred. Especially on Facebook. These feelings, they’ve had them forever but now they can come out and talk about it.”Not here, he says: Wonderlust “gives us a place to be without fear or judgment”.Back in 1986, when Gary Miller and Alan Pierce first started working at the Round-Up Saloon in Dallas, same-sex couples were not allowed to dance together.“If the police came in, everybody would stop dancing and hang out until they left,” Miller remembers. People were afraid to park their cars close to the bar cops would take people’s license plate numbers and turn them in to their employers – which, back in the early days, would mean an automatic termination. How things have changed. At least at Round-Up.Today, the club holds dance classes almost nightly. People from across the state – and the world – come to watch cowboys do the Texas two-step. “Cowboys can be gay too,” says Miller, with a twinkle in his eye.So strong is the pull of the bar that Lady Gaga visits  pretty much every time she’s in town. (“We have a madhouse that night,” says Miller.) Willie Nelson pops in from time to time.And if you’re not fazed by celebrity sightings, the huge country-themed bar has something for everyone. Handsome Stetsoned bar staff sling tequila and beer to a mixed crowd of all ages, ethnicities and orientations to a soundtrack of country and dance music. Patrons pop in to watch Ru Paul’s Drag Race, stay for karaoke, country dancing, a drag show. Big businesses come by the busload to sell Dallas as an inclusive place for their workers. “There was a battle to be fought – and we won,” says Miller.At Round-Up, maybe, but for queer people, Texas is still not easy.“Small-town Texas … there are two religions: football and Jesus. And if you don’t agree with either of those, you are going to hell,” says the drag queen Sable Scities as she beats her face before the night’s performance. Scities grew up in rural Texas and says for many outside of the big cities little has changed.“I snuck up here when I was 17 and snuck into the clubs because this is where you feel accepted. You’re not going to find that at home a lot of times. Maybe Christmas and your birthday.”Texas is still a difficult state for LGBTQ people. Trans women of colour are being murdered, even in Dallas. Gay couples are still being kicked out of bars for dancing together.Coming out here “is never going to be an easy road”, says Pierce, Round-Up’s co-owner and Miller’s partner. “There’s progress, but there’s always that hatred.” The bar’s owners organize charity events and back initiatives aimed at tackling the alarming rates of suicide and addiction in the community.Outside the Round-Up and its surrounding gayborhood, Texas conservatives are still fighting the “good” fight, trying to pass a “religious freedom” bill that would allow businesses to discriminate against the LGBTQ. Little wonder, then, that gay people travel from across the state to spin their spurs at the saloon.After 33 years at the bar, Pierce and Miller are thinking of hanging up their hats. They have their eye on a place in Mexico. Miller’s son, who is straight, will take over. “But it will always be a gay bar,” he says. “He knows not to mess with a good thing.”Smoove Gardner and Nicci Boroski won’t forget the night of 8 November 2016 in a hurry.The owners of The Back Door, Bloomington, Indiana’s radical queer bar, had organized a huge party for what they thought was going to be the election of the first female president of the United States. There were beanbags on the floor and hundreds of people sat around, sometimes going outside to smoke and relieve tension.“And then, as things started to go south, people started to get very drunk and very sad,” says Boroski, who identifies as gender queer and uses the they pronoun. “It was just piles of people cuddling and weeping together by the end of the night.”Trump’s election was an especially bitter blow because it ushered in Mike Pence, Indiana’s former governor, as the vice-president. Pence, who once said it was “God’s idea” to stop same-sex couples marrying, has a long history of working against pro-LGBTQ reforms. (Trump once joked Pence would like to “hang” gay people.)And so the fight was on. The election helped radicalize the queer community. “It matters now. You being active and paying attention. It matters,” says Gardner.Established in 2016 as a politically minded queer venue, The Back Door is tucked down an alleyway behind a car park. A Golden Girls mural adorns its exterior. Inside, the venue is a cosy, crazy den-like space, with wallscovered in zebra stripes and campy unicorn paintings. The gender neutral bathrooms the walls read: “NO MERCY FOR THE PATRIARCHY, BE A SLUT, DO WHATEVER YOU WANT, BURN THE ICE VANS PLEASE …”The Back Door could come across as a little serious if it weren’t for the owners’ determination to have fun. “I feel like this space is part community center, part entertainment center – because there is so much crap happening right now that sometimes you just need to come dance and forget about it,” says Gardner.“Living joyously is a radical act in a broken world, especially in an unjust world. For people to come here and be their most fabulous selves and let go is an act of resistance,” says Boroski.On the night we visit, the bar is having a benefit for sex workers. A zaftig tattooed woman who bills herself as “Virgin Mary” poledances to Hozier’s Work Song in a jacket that reads: “Make Nazis Scared Again” as a queer crowd collects cash for National Abortion Fund and Red Light Legal. It’s all very woke David Lynch.The Back Door is not a space for everyone, and that’s the point. One patron complained online that they didn’t feel safe in the bar and worried there might be a riot – “or a massacre”, laughs Boroski.“We don’t want everybody here,” they say. “There are plenty of venues for heterosexuals.” And if someone doesn’t like the vibe? “I’m like, fantastic! See you never! Tell Google!”As for the future of LGBTQ rights, huge issues remain, Boroski says. Gay people – and especially white gay men – have made great strides since Stonewall, but even in the gay community, transphobia and racism are still issues.It’s a bitter irony that 50 years after Stonewall, while Marsha P Johnson and Sylvia Rivera – two trans women of colour and two of the main actors in the Stonewall riots – are being celebrated, trans people are still being “thrown under the bus”, and trans people of colour are “being killed left and right – and nobody gives a shit”, says Boroski. “And that’s a fucking problem.” If Indiana cracked down on the queers, The Back Door is exactly the sort of place where a riot could start, says Gardner.“In remembrance of Stonewall, keep a brick in your pocket,” says Boroski. “Don’t get complacent. But also live joyously, because that is a radical act.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e372b443c67047f8bfab73f549c880e83b3a545f/0_0_1748_1049/master/1748.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bbaa07fb5594b3a71d60e2bc4f762642","title":"no coventry is not basically birmingham the unwritten rules of the west midlands","story":"One local explains how to navigate Elephant City with some insider tips and tricksCoventry. A city that is unfortunately so near to Birmingham that it is often forgotten about, but also fortunately just far enough away that we don’t speak with that accent. In fact, “we speak with an accent that’s exceedingly rare!” At least that’s what the Coventry City fans sing every week, whether it’s at the Ricoh Arena or at away games up and down the country – or that season we played our home games in Northampton, but we don’t talk about that.Luckily, due to our location on one of the country’s most central rail lines, it’s incredibly easy for us to get to just about anywhere in the UK, whether it be for football, shopping, boozing, sightseeing, or … what else is there?And if you’re coming to us by rail (TIP: London Northwestern Railway has FREE wifi in every carriage), there are some unspoken things you should know about us lot, located smack bang in the middle of England.No, Coventry is not basically BirminghamThis assertion is lazy geography. We are 20 miles away from Birmingham. Sunderland is barely 15 miles away from Newcastle upon Tyne but you wouldn’t say “Newcastle is basically in Sunderland”, unless you wanted to get banished from the north-east forever. Solihull is a town that is “basically” Birmingham. We are our own city, with enough cathedrals to spare (more on that in a minute).Coventry – and its spirit – is indestructibleDue to our extremely central location – Meriden, the traditional centre of England is just 8 miles away – we’ve often found ourselves in the middle of some heated situations. The most notable of which was the Coventry blitz, which took place on the night of the 14 November 1940. It was the single most concentrated attack on a British city during the second world war. It lasted for 11 hours as the Luftwaffe essentially attempted to knock Coventry off the map, being one of the UK’s major centres for war production. The old cathedral was mostly destroyed during that raid, but its remains now serve as a phenomenal event space.We also have a rich history of cathedralsWhile the old cathedral was destroyed, as mentioned, we had an old, old cathedral that Henry VIII ordered to be destroyed during the dissolution of the monasteries in the early 16th century. What remains of it is still standing and open to the public in the Priory undercrofts, which was dug up by Tony Robinson for a Time Team special in 1999 on Channel 4. Side note: There is a Nando’s right next to the Priory gardens, so you can make a decent afternoon of history and chicken.Enjoy flying abroad? You have us to thank for thatIf we are honest, we aren’t the greatest at making a big deal about the things we’ve done in the past. For a city that was essentially the beating heart of the country’s motor industry, we should at least talk about it as much as Brummies like to talk about how they are the second city.But more impressive than that is Coventry’s very own Sir Frank Whittle. No, it’s not just the name of a school in Walsgrave – Sir Frank Whittle was the genius behind the modern jet engine, which effectively changed the world.When Sir Frank first brought forward his plans to the UK’s Air Ministry in 1929, his blueprints were called “impractical”. Just eight years later, in 1937, his Whittle Unit engine roared into life, and by 1941 jet-powered planes were heading to war. The rest, as they say, is history.If you call it the Phoenix or the Kasbah, we know you are a studentClubs change names, that’s true, but we never forget – or stop calling them by – their older names.That club on Primrose Hill Street in Hillfields is The Colly (or Colosseum for the more formal among you) not the Kasbah, despite what it says above the doors. Those who really know their history will recall a brief period in the early 90s when it was called the Tic Toc, and played host to Blur and Ocean Colour Scene amid Britpop fever. The Phoenix? That’s the Colin Campbell or the Campbell to those who grew up here. And the building with the domed roof opposite? Before it was a Cov Uni building it was an old Odeon theatre.We still really hate Aston VillaIt’s been nearly 20 years since both clubs were even in the same ision – the 200001 season of the Premier League – but we still despise the Birmingham club, with a passion.

Over time this evolved into “process of baking” to “event of baking” to “the set of things baked” and eventually to a “set of things”, ie a batch. And these bread rolls would be baked in batches too.

The company’s 4.2 millioncustomers will each receive £61 off their bills – £17 in 2020-21 and £11 in each of the following four years.The Environment Agency said it was pursuing its own criminal investigation into Southern Water, which began in 2016. “The environmental aspect of the investigation is ongoing and we expect to commence court proceedings soon.”Ofwat found Southern Water failed to operate a number of sewage treatment works properly, including not making the necessary investment, which led to equipment failures and spills of wastewater.It also found the company, which operates in Kent, Sussex, Hampshire and the Isle of Wight, manipulated its wastewater sampling process and misreported the performance of several sewage treatment sites.The regulator’s chief executive, Rachel Fletcher, said: “What we found in this case is shocking. In all, it shows the company was being run with scant regard for its responsibilities to society and the environment.“It was not just the poor operational performance, but the coordinated efforts to hide and deceive customers of the fact that are so troubling.”Southern Water said it was “deeply sorry” and added that the costs of the penalty would not be passed on to customers in the form of higher prices. The company is owned by the Greensands consortium of infrastructure investors and pension funds.The chief executive, Ian McAulay, who was appointed in January 2017, said in a statement: “We are deeply sorry for what has happened. There are no excuses for the failings that occurred between 2010 and 2017 outlined in Ofwat’s report. We have clearly fallen far short of the expectations and trust placed in us by our wastewater customers and the wider communities we serve.”He admitted on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “It is perfectly reasonable to say there was dishonesty”. He added: “That is incredibly disappointing and not the standard we want to have in this business and I was brought in to make sure that could not happen again.” He dodged a question about whether there should be criminal sanctions, saying: “This was a small number of people.”It is understood that Southern Water has dismissed several people. McAulay said the company had overhauled its governance, invested £100m in new IT systems and £26m in wastewater assets, and vowed to invest several billions of pounds over the next five years.Rebecca Long-Bailey, the shadow secretary of state for business, energy and industrial strategy, said: “Today’s eye-watering fines and forced customer rebates demonstrate clearly just how broken our water system is. Despite failures, chronic underinvestment and exorbitant customer bills, many water companies continue to pay out hefty idends to shareholders.”Ofwat said the package of penalties and payments was the biggest it had ever imposed, proportionate to the size of the business. It would have been larger had Southern Water not cooperated with its investigation.

The DJ reveals why he teamed up with the director to capture 2,000 years of the island’s wild, strange historySuperstar DJ Fatboy Slim was recently thinking about – and questioning – what it is he does. “I’m just a middle-aged man playing a lot of loud squelching noises to young people, waving his arms around in the air. What really is that?” he asked himself.But then it does make them dance and smile, and he, Norman Cook, still enjoys doing it. “It’s not what I would have chosen to be doing at this age” – 55 – “but I’m loving it so much. It’s the best job in the world because I love music, and my love of music involves sharing it with people.”Is it not boring, doing it sober and drug-free, which he has been for a decade now? “I’m a bit like a vampire. I vicariously get my kicks, but instead of suckling the blood of the young, I absorb their sweat. My secret of eternal youth is being around young people having fun. It’s a kind of serotonin-adrenaline-pheromone mix they give off.”And he taps into it? “I think so. I just lose myself. When I’m in that moment, I’m quite intoxicated. I call it euphoric recall: I tap back into my previous misdemeanours, become in that moment with them but without the hangovers and self-loathing.” Is he happier, sober? “It makes my life way more manageable. It means I can cope as a father.”Cook has two children with Zoë Ball, from whom he’s now separated. Nelly, who’s nine, is into Little Mix, but has also been to Café Mambo in Ibiza with her dad and appreciates he has a cool job. Woody, 18, “is too cool to admit my music might be cool. He’s into drum’n’bass.” I ask if he’s discussed alcohol and drugs with them, but he doesn’t want to talk about that.Now, instead of loathing himself, Cook can loathe golf instead. “Every moment I’m not playing golf is to be cherished.” Does he play? “No.” Will he ever? “Hopefully not.” Golf equals death.When we meet in the breakfast room of a posh London hotel, Cook looks youthful and healthy. He’s wearing a bright short-sleeved shirt, like a man permanently on holiday. Mornings are easier – and longer – than they were before, 10 years ago. Now Cook is branching out from DJing and producing, trying to get respectable jobs on the side, like the film Ibiza: The Silent Movie, a collaboration with director Julien Temple.Temple is due to join us for breakfast but he’s stuck in traffic on a erted bus. The film is a history of the mythical Mediterranean island – not just the past 30 years, Cook’s era, but 2,000 years. Before the ravers there were Phoenicians and Moors, Romans, dada poets, beatniks, draft dodgers, fascists. It wasn’t always all smiley faces and euphoria, and if someone had their hands in the air it might have been because they didn’t want to get shot. Twenty-one Ibizan priests weren’t smiling when they were executed during the Spanish civil war nor Raoul Villain, the French nationalist who died slowly on the beach in 1936 nor this pig being slaughtered and butchered. There is blood in Ibiza’s ochre soil – though actually probably not from the pig. This is La Matanza, the traditional Spanish way to slaughter a pig, with hardly any waste everything is chopped up and used.Temple has chopped up the history, mixing ancient legends with modern mythology, the vandalism of Romans with vandalism by 1980s holiday developers, dadaists grooving out to jazz in an old windmill with the ecstasy fuelled masses at Ku, Pasha and Amnesia. It’s witty and playful. There’s a delightful cameo – Bes the Phoenician God of Dance is played by Bez the Madchester God of Dance (no, really, isn’t that perfect, and he kept his trainers on). It’s hard to categorise.Temple calls it “the loudest silent movie ever made” – because it’s only silent in that there’s no speaking. The chopped-up bits are threaded together by a score – curated, produced and mixed by Fatboy Slim, of course. The soundtrack doesn’t have to dip and fade to allow for the spoken word this is a film that can be danced to – as they hope it will be when it opens this week at Cineramageddon, Temple’s giant postapocalyptic drive-in at Glastonbury festival.Cook, a fan of Temple’s since he saw his Sex Pistols film The Great Rock’n’Roll Swindle as a teenager, says they have similar methods of working. “The way he puts a film together is very similar to the way I put a record together – a kind of collage of found items, juxtaposing things.”For Cook, peak Ibiza was probably around the millennium, the years of Manumission’s super-parties and its live sex shows. “There were a couple of years that felt like they were the last days of the Roman empire,” he says, not unwistfully. It’s where he met Ball, “allegedly saying ‘How do you fancy not going to bed with me”, he tells me, though the memories from the time are patchy.He helped fill Temple in on Manumission, Space and DC-10, but Cook had known very little about what had happened on the island earlier. It’s been fascinating discovering “these recurring themes of people coming to the island to escape – repression or the draft – or reinvent themselves, or disappear, bringing with them differing styles of music, alternative lifestyles and fashions. It’s a story of people not invading the island but sort of annexing it.”Ah, here is Temple, hot off the bus, very apologetic, cross about politics. (He wants to set up the Republic of Remainia in Britain: “We should be Remainian refugees in our own country.”) He shares Cook’s feelings for golf. “I hate golf, I hate what it represents. I’m glad Donald Trump enjoys it,” he says.Ten years older than Cook, and pleasingly lugubrious, he is less Balearic raver, more Glasto man. Long before filming there, he was showing up at Worthy Farm in 1971, with no shoes or money, and saw David Bowie at dawn. Different drugs back then. “My generation took acid I guess. I did a lot of things I wouldn’t necessarily now,” he says.Presumably, like the men squabbling over who should lead the country, Temple deeply regrets it? “No, I’m proud. I think my way of making films has something to do with the acid I took. I did start to see things differently as a result of doing that. Young people take drugs to discover what our relationship with the world and reality is, and if there’s a point to it.”Temple wasn’t sure he wanted to make an Ibiza film because clubbing is not really his scene, and because there have been other films. Then he hit upon his silent-movie angle, and the idea of telling the whole story of the island, what makes it a strangely mythic place for generation after generation. And a tragic place, too – not only because of unfortunate priests and pigs, but because of themagic disappearing under dodgy property developments, the water running out, more and more planes disgorging loutish tourists who in turn disgorge the contents of their stomachs on to the streets of San Antonio. Or the more recent move towards the VIP bottle-service brigade who have money but bring no magic. What was once the poorest place in Europe has become one of the most exclusive.Enlisting Fatboy Slim sealed the deal for Temple. The soundtrack might be different, but the project isn’t much different from his 2006 Glastonbury film, he says. “Connecting the past through music of the past and archive, the collision of things that are not necessarily meant to be together is a very fresh way of entering the past of a place and explaining its relevance to the present.”Cook also has much previous Glastonbury experience (and he’ll be doing a set following the Cineramageddon screening). He thinks Ibiza and Glastonbury aren’t such a long way apart, except perhaps meteorologically. “Glastonbury is a slightly damper, colder version of the same exercise – escaping to freedom and seeing what happens when you remove the shackles, of having to do a job, get up at any given time, adhere to the norms of society. Then interesting and strange and wonderful things can happen.”Right here, right now, he’s got norms to adhere to, another interview to do, with BBC Radio 6 Music over the road. And Julien Temple has a bus to catch."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1add93994c186ed09ddca3cca0da5883d6dadf3c/473_0_5054_3033/master/5054.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=53c515a63905a7a1166cef4bec2d2af8","title":"the new left economics how a network of thinkers is transforming capitalism","story":"After decades of rightwing dominance, a transatlantic movement of leftwing economists is building a practical alternative to neoliberalism. By  Andy BeckettFor almost half a century, something vital has been missing from leftwing politics in western countries. Since the 70s, the left has changed how many people think about prejudice, personal identity and freedom. It has exposed capitalism’s cruelties. It has sometimes won elections, and sometimes governed effectively afterwards. But it has not been able to change fundamentally how wealth and work function in society – or even provide a compelling vision of how that might be done. The left, in short, has not had an economic policy.Instead, the right has had one. Privatisation, deregulation, lower taxes for business and the rich, more power for employers and shareholders, less power for workers – these interlocking policies have intensified capitalism, and made it ever more ubiquitous. There have been immense efforts to make capitalism appear inevitable to depict any alternative as impossible.In this increasingly hostile environment, the left’s economic approach has been reactive – resisting these huge changes, often in vain – and often backward-looking, even nostalgic. For many decades, the same two critical analysts of capitalism, Karl Marx and John Maynard Keynes, have continued to dominate the left’s economic imagination. Marx died in 1883, Keynes in 1946. The last time their ideas had a significant influence on western governments or voters was 40 years ago, during the turbulent final days of postwar social democracy. Ever since, rightwingers and centrists have caricatured anyone arguing that capitalism should be reined in – let alone reshaped or replaced – as wanting to take the world “back to the 70s”. Altering our economic system has been presented as a fantasy – no more practical than time travel.And yet, in recent years, that system has started to fail. Rather than sustainable and widely shared prosperity, it has produced wage stagnation, ever more workers in poverty, ever more inequality, banking crises, the convulsions of populism and the impending climate catastrophe. Even senior rightwing politicians sometimes concede the seriousness of the crisis. At last year’s Conservative conference, the chancellor, Philip Hammond, admitted that “a gap has opened up” in the west “between the theory of how a market economy delivers … and the reality”. He went on: “Too many people feel that … the system is not working for them.”There is a dawning recognition that a new kind of economy is needed: fairer, more inclusive, less exploitative, less destructive of society and the planet. “We’re in a time when people are much more open to radical economic ideas,” says Michael Jacobs, a former prime ministerial adviser to Gordon Brown. “The voters have revolted against neoliberalism. The international economic institutions – the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund – are recognising its downsides.” Meanwhile, the 2008 financial crisis and the previously unthinkable government interventions that halted it have discredited two central neoliberal orthodoxies: that capitalism cannot fail, and that governments cannot step in to change how the economy works.A huge political space has opened up. In Britain and the US, in many ways the most capitalist western countries, and the ones where its problems are starkest, an emerging network of thinkers, activists and politicians has begun to seize this opportunity. They are trying to construct a new kind of leftwing economics: one that addresses the flaws of the 21st-century economy, but which also explains, in practical ways, how future leftwing governments could create a better one.Christine Berry, a young British freelance academic, is one of the network’s central figures. “We’re stripping economics back to basics,” she says. “We want economics to ask: ‘Who owns these resources? Who has power in this company?’ Conventional economic discourse obfuscates these questions, to the benefit of those with power.”The new leftwing economics wants to see the redistribution of economic power, so that it is held by everyone – just as political power is held by everyone in a healthy democracy. This redistribution of power could involve employees taking ownership of part of every company or local politicians reshaping their city’s economy to favour local, ethical businesses over large corporations or national politicians making co-operatives a capitalist norm.This “democratic economy” is not some idealistic fantasy: bits of it are already being constructed in Britain and the US. And without this transformation, the new economists argue, the increasing inequality of economic power will soon make democracy itself unworkable. “If we want to live in democratic societies, then we need to … allow communities to shape their local economies,” write Joe Guinan and Martin O’Neill, both prolific advocates of the new economics, in a recent article for the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR) – a thinktank previously associated with New Labour. “It is no longer good enough to see the economy as some kind of separate technocratic domain in which the central values of a democratic society somehow do not apply.” Moreover, Guinan and O’Neill argue, making the economy more democratic will actually help to revitalise democracy: voters are less likely to feel angry, or apathetic, if they are included in economic decisions that fundamentally affect their lives.The new economists’ enormously ambitious project means transforming the relationship between capitalism and the state between workers and employers between the local and global economy and between those with economic assets and those without. “Economic power and control must rest more equally,” declared a report last year by the New Economics Foundation (NEF), a radical London thinktank that has acted as an incubator for many of the new movement’s members and ideas.In the past, left-of-centre British governments have attempted to reshape the economy by taxation – usually focused on income rather than other forms of economic power – and by nationalisation, which usually meant replacing a private-sector management elite with a state-appointed one. Instead of such limited, patchily successful interventions, the new economists want to see much more systemic and permanent change. They want – at the least – to change how capitalism works. But, crucially, they want this change to be only partially initiated and overseen by the state, not controlled by it. They envisage a transformation that happens almost organically, driven by employees and consumers – a sort of non-violent revolution in slow motion.The result, the new economists claim, will be an economy that suits society, rather than – as we have at present – a society subordinated to the economy. The new economics, suggests Berry, isn’t really economics at all. It’s “a new view of the world”.In the excitable but often intellectually becalmed world of British politics, the arrival of a significant new set of ideas tends to generate certain responses. Events about it are packed out. Ambitious young researchers gravitate towards it. Adventurous older thinkers are intrigued by it. New intellectual institutions are created around it. Mainstream journalists initially dismiss it.Over the past year, the left’s new economics has acquired this status. Jacobs, who is nearing 60, spent the New Labour era trying, and largely failing, to persuade centrist politicians that the economy needed drastically reshaping. “But nowadays,” he told me, “I’m thinking: ‘Oh God, we finally might be able to do it.’”Like all the new economists I met, he talks very fast, cutting short sentences as if there is too much to explain in the time available. A longstanding environmentalist, he describes the emerging network of new economists as “an ecosystem”. Like the one that produced Thatcherism in the 70s, this network may involve only a few dozen people, whose polemics and talks and policy papers are being followed by an audience in the hundreds, but there is an intoxicating sense of political and economic taboos being broken, and of a potential new consensus being born.“There are British and American websites that publish a lot of our stuff, like openDemocracy, Jacobin and Novara. There are people producing stuff while freelancing for thinktanks – or setting up new thinktanks. And social media means the ideas spread, and collaborations happen, much faster than when leftwing economics was just about meetings and pamphlets,” Jacobs says. “It’s slightly incestuous, but it’s rather thrilling.”This ferment is beginning to solidify into a movement. The New Economy Organisers Network (Neon), a NEF spin-off based in London, runs workshops for leftwing activists, to learn how “to build support for a new economy” – for example, by telling effective “stories” about it in the mainstream media. Stir to Action, an activist organisation based in Bridport in Dorset, publishes a quarterly “magazine for the new economy”, and organises advice sessions in left-leaning cities such as Bristol and Oxford: Worker Co-ops: How to Get Started, Community Ownership: What If We Ran It Ourselves?“There’s a totally new impulse to activism about the economy now,” says the magazine’s editor, Jonny Gordon-Farleigh, who was previously involved in anticapitalist and environmental protests. “The movement has gone from oppose to propose.”Others in the movement are more bullish. Last autumn, a widely circulated article by Guinan and O’Neill in the leftwing journal Renewal claimed that McDonnell could be planning nothing less than a “transformation of the British economy … a radical programme for dismantling and displacing corporate and financial power in Britain”, in favour of the less privileged. Guinan told me: “John McDonnell is extremely intellectually curious. I haven’t seen another political figure at that level of seniority whose doors are so open to new thinking.”James Meadway, until recently one of McDonnell’s key advisers, is now writing a book about “an economy for the many”. Between 2010 and 2015, Meadway worked at NEF, where his reports and articles sketched out many of the new economists’ arguments. Several NEF staffers told me that since McDonnell became shadow chancellor, the usual relationship between leftwing thinktanks and Labour had been reversed: instead of desperately trying to draw the party’s attention to their proposals, they were struggling to keep up with Labour’s appetite for them. “They’re virtually asking, ‘Have you got anything else at the back of your cupboard?’” says one delighted but slightly perplexed NEF veteran. “We scrabble around, and give them anything we can come up with, as quickly as we can.”Last July, NEF published a report advocating a sharp increase in the number of British co-operatives. On one of its later pages, with almost no fanfare, the report also proposed that conventional companies be required to give their employees shares, to create what NEF called an “inclusive ownership fund”. In September, with a few modifications, the proposal became Labour party policy. “I’ve never seen anything like it, from thinktank idea to adoption as policy!” says Mathew Lawrence, one of the report’s authors. This month, a version of the policy was also adopted by the US presidential candidate Bernie Sanders.And yet, outside McDonnell’s circle and the transatlantic radical left, the new economics has gone largely unnoticed – or been casually derided. The black holes of Brexit and the Tory leadership contest are partly responsible, sucking attention away from everything else. But so is the radical nature of the new economics itself. Transforming or ending capitalism as we know it – the new economists differ as to which is the goal – is a difficult idea for most British politicians and journalists to take on board. After half a century accepting the economic status quo, they associate any leftwing alternatives to it either with out-of-date postwar social democracy – aka “the 70s” – or with leftwing authoritarianism, with present-day Venezuela or the Soviet Union.However often McDonnell says in interviews that he wants to see a democratic economy, the adjective most frequently applied to him is still “Marxist”. “The new economic thinking is almost like a frequency that can’t be heard,” says Guinan.But with neoliberalism ailing, and the right bereft of other economic ideas, as the Conservative leadership contest is currently demonstrating, the left’s new economics may have a long fut ure – whether or not McDonnell and Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour party wins power. To borrow a line from Thatcher, there is now an alternative.The dream of a democratic economy has flickered on the margins of leftwing politics for at least a century. During the early 1920s, the British socialist theorists GDH Cole and RH Tawney both wrote fresh, provocative books arguing that workers should manage themselves, rather than submit to employers or shareholders – or to the state, as more orthodox Labour thinkers envisaged. In economic life, as in politics, Tawney argued in 1921, “men should not be ruled by an authority which they cannot control”.This empowerment of the workers was intended to be the first step in a larger transformation. “The real aim,” wrote Cole in 1920, should be “wresting bit by bit from the hands of the possessing classes the economic power which they now exercise”, in order to ultimately “make possible an equitable distribution of the national income and a reasonable reorganisation of Society as a whole”.Yet Cole was vague about how this overturning of the traditional order would happen. He ruled out a revolution, and a general strike, on the grounds that workers did not have the necessary access to weapons, or the economic resources to beat their employers in a protracted industrial struggle. A bold Labour government could, in theory, pass the necessary legislation but the Labour administrations of the 1920s and 30s were cautious, and did not last long.When Labour did acquire the confidence and time to reconfigure the economy, during the premierships of Clement Attlee in the 40s and Harold Wilson in the 60s, the party chose to do so through Whitehall plans and bureaucracies, such as Wilson’s Department of Economic Affairs (DEA), rather than by democratising the economy. The results were mixed: the DEA lasted only five years.It was not until the 70s that a powerful Labour politician became interested in democratising the economy. Unusually for a Westminster grandee, Tony Benn paid close attention to the decline of deference and growth of inidualism during the decade. “More people want to do more for themselves,” he wrote in 1970. “Technology releases forces that permit and encourage decentralisation … It must be a prime objective of socialists to work for the redistribution of power.”In 1974, Wilson made Benn secretary of state for industry. The economy was struggling. Benn oversaw and subsidised worker-run cooperatives at three ailing large businesses: the Scottish Daily News, a Glasgow newspaper Kirkby Manufacturing and Engineering, a Liverpool maker of radiators and Meriden, a producer of motorcycles in the West Midlands. The challenges these co-operatives faced – a lack of previous investment, and strong foreign or domestic competitors – were made worse by unsympathetic, economically conservative civil servants in Benn’s department. An even-handed 1981 report on the cooperatives by the leftwing magazine New Internationalist described them as doomed from the start – they were “crippled giants”.The Scottish Daily News cooperative lasted five months. The Kirby cooperative did better. Eric Heffer, a minister working for Benn, found trade union shop stewards there “transformed by their experiences” of helping run the business. They became “real worker-managers”. The cooperative made it through the mid-70s recession. But soon after the 1979 election, Margaret Thatcher’s incoming government terminated the experiment by cancelling Kirkby’s subsidies. Meriden survived the change of government, and another recession in the early 80s. But it went bankrupt in 1983.Benn himself lasted only a year in the industry department, before he was removed by Wilson, who had never completely accepted his radicalism. Benn never held such a pivotal economic post again. Just as significantly, the saga “undermined the co-operative option in Labour party policymaking circles for decades to come,” says Gordon-Farleigh.From Benn’s demotion in 1975 until Jeremy Corbyn’s election as leader 40 years later, the Labour hierarchy broadly accepted that the economy should be based on profit, competition, and top-down management. The attempts by Benn and others on the British left during the 70s to establish what they sometimes provocatively called “workers’ control” were largely forgotten, or remembered as just another of a derided decade’s failed utopias. The chance for a democratic economy seemed to have gone.Yet during the lean years that followed for the British left, another experiment in democratising the economy began – across the Atlantic, in a country less associated with revolts against capitalism. It was more local, but also more thorough than Benn’s backing of a scattering of vulnerable co-operatives, and it sought to mobilise the power of consumers rather than producers.Gar Alperovitz is an 83-year-old American economist and activist. Since the 60s, he has doggedly promoted economic innovations that put social before commercial goals. Often, he has been a fringe figure, but intermittently he has attracted wide attention. In 1983, he featured heavily in a Time magazine cover story about the future of the economy. In 2000, at the University of Maryland, he co-founded the Democracy Collaborative, a centre for research about how to revive the political and economic life of declining parts of the US, which gradually expanded into an activist body as well.“Troubled American cities are in a more advanced state of decay than their British equivalents,” says Guinan, who has worked for the Democracy Collaborative for a decade. “But American local government also has greater powers. So you have the ability to create radical new models from the ground up.”In 2008, the Democracy Collaborative began working in Cleveland, one of America’s poorest big cities, which had been losing jobs and residents for decades. The activists followed an Alperovitz strategy called “community wealth-building”. It aims to end struggling local economies’ reliance on unequal relationships with distant, wealth-extracting corporations – such as chain retailers – and to base these economies around local, more socially conscious businesses instead.In Cleveland, the Democracy Collaborative helped set up a solar power company, an industrial laundry, and a city-centre hydroponic farm growing lettuces and basil. All three enterprises were owned by their employees, and some of their profits went to a holding company tasked with establishing more cooperatives in the city. All three enterprises have succeeded, so far. The goal of the project was summed up in blunt, almost populist terms by one of the Democracy Collaborative’s co-founders, Ted Howard, in 2017: “Stop the leakage of money out of our community.” Yet “community wealth building” also has a more subtle purpose: it is a concrete demonstration that economic decisions can be based on more than neoliberalism’s narrow criteria.Howard was speaking at a new economics conference in England, which had been organised by McDonnell. The two men are on first-name terms. Last year, McDonnell introduced Howard at another Labour event, in Preston: “We bring him across on a regular basis now, to explain the work that he’s done.”McDonnell has long been interested in decentralising and democratising the economy. He frequently cites Tawney, Cole and Benn in speeches. During the 80s, McDonnell was deputy leader and effectively the chancellor of the Greater London Council (GLC), which pursued Benn-style experiments with state-backed co-operatives, with similarly mixed results, until it was abolished by Thatcher in 1986.Contrary to his usual portrayal as a statist ogre, McDonnell believes there are limits to how far the left can increase taxes and government spending. In his view, many voters are unwilling, or simply unable, to pay much more tax – especially when living standards are squeezed, as now. He also believes that central government has lost authority: it is seen as simultaneously too weak, short of money thanks to austerity and too strong – too intrusive and domineering towards citizens. Instead of relying on the state to create a better society, one of McDonnell’s close allies argues, leftwing governments, at both the municipal and national level, “have to get into changing how capitalism works”.In recent years, with McDonnell and Corbyn’s encouragement, and guidance from the Democracy Collaborative, many of the principles of “the Cleveland model”, as it is reverently known in transatlantic leftwing circles, have been adopted by the Labour-run council in the small, ex-industrial city of Preston in Lancashire. The regeneration has been promoted as a foretaste of Britain under a Corbyn government.Preston’s hilltop city centre, which had been fading for decades, now has a refurbished and busy covered market, new artists’ studios in former council offices, and coffee and craft beer being sold from converted shipping containers right behind the town hall. All these enterprises have been facilitated by the council. Less visibly, but probably more importantly, the city’s large concentration of other public sector bodies – a hospital, a university, a police headquarters – have been persuaded by the council to procure goods and services locally whenever possible, becoming what the Democracy Collaborative calls “anchor institutions”. They now spend almost four times as much of their budgets in Preston as they did in 2013.The council leader is Matthew Brown, an intense, angular 46-year-old who was partly inspired to enter politics by seeing Benn on television as a teenager. “What we’re doing in Preston is common sense, but it’s also ideological,” Brown told me, when we met in his sparse office. “We’re living through a systemic crisis of capitalism, and we’ve got to create alternatives.” By doing so – especially at a time when local councils are supposed to have been hugely weakened by government cuts – Preston is in small but visible ways undermining the authority of neoliberalism, dependent as it is on the insistence that no other economic options are possible.I asked whether he had any doubts about a city with a population of less than 150,000 acting as a model for reshaping the whole British economy – and by implication, economies beyond. “No,” he said. “I’m quite strong-minded.”There is a confidence about the new economists, which comes as a surprise after all the left’s defeats during the 80s and 90s. But with capitalism less effective and popular than it was then, the new economists believe they are now engaged in what the political theorist Antonio Gramsci – a big influence on them and McDonnell – called a “war of position”: a steady accumulation of alliances, ideas and public credibility. Berry describes this process as a “transition” that can lead to a different economy. McDonnell told me in 2017 that he wanted “a staged transformation of our economic system”. If enough other Labour councils copy Preston – and quite a few are interested – then even without a Corbyn government, let alone any kind of socialist revolution, the British economy will have moved leftwards, both in the priorities it chooses and the interests it favours.He offered no more details. But the “inclusive ownership fund” policy adopted by Labour shows the potential of the new economic ideas. The funds are intended to be Trojan horses: inserting into a company’s ownership structure a group of shareholders – its employees – who are more likely to favour higher wages and long-term investment. “The funds are meant to tip the balance,” says Lawrence, “towards a different kind of corporate culture.” Or as the writer and activist Hilary Wainwright, one of the Labour left’s shrewdest thinkers since the 70s, puts it: “Radical change, when it destabilises the status quo in the right way, creates further opportunities for change.”Before NEF, Fahnbulleh worked for the cabinet office and the 10 Downing Street strategy unit. She predicts there will be Whitehall resistance to the new economics: “Whitehall hates big change – every time.” Jacobs, who has longer experience of government, is slightly more optimistic. “Some of the younger Treasury people will probably be quite excited by a new economic approach. Some of the older ones will think it’s all wrong. And others will just implement whatever the government asks.”He has helped run seminars for McDonnell and his team about what to expect from Whitehall, and how to respond. “My advice is, ‘If you want to do something new, set up a new unit, and recruit. You’ll get people joining who want to do new things.” But Benn’s experience at the department of industry suggest that outflanking Whitehall’s conservatives may not be that simple.And then there is the business establishment. Since Thatcher, it has become accustomed to deferential governments, to getting its own way over other interest groups, and to profits and share prices trumping other measures of a company’s economic or social value. The intention of the new economists to end these imbalances has not gone down well. “The Confederation of British Industry (CBI) really hates inclusive ownership,” says one McDonnell ally. “You can feel the chill whenever we bring it up.”When I asked the CBI for their thoughts on the new economics, there was a week-long silence, and then, after I chased them, a terse statement: “Labour seems determined to impose rules that display a wilful misunderstanding of business.”The new economists say they are not intimidated. “We in the movement need to be absolutely frank about this,” says Guinan. “A democratic and an exploitative economy are fundamentally incompatible. We should mount a straightforward, left-populist attack on these business interests. We should say to them: ‘Off you go to Singapore!’ The left shouldn’t be afraid of a little creative destruction”, he says, cheekily borrowing a phrase usually used by free-marketeers. Jacobs agrees: “Exploitative companies can go to the wall.”That might sound like a reckless leftwing fantasy. But the new economists argue convincingly that hugely disruptive change is coming to the British economy, anyway – thanks to Brexit, automation and the climate emergency. “Brexit alone will require a very interventionist state” to help the economy adapt, says Lawrence. “It will make it much harder for a civil servant to say, ‘You simply can’t do that.’”But what do the new economists want to come after neoliberal capitalism? In Preston, after Brown had spoken evangelically to me about the virtues of “local businesses” and “local jobs”, I asked whether his council was actually saving capitalism in the city – by making it more socially sensitive – rather than supplanting it. For once, he paused. “We’ve got to be pragmatic,” he said. “We are still in a free-market environment. And I don’t see local businesses as big capitalists, anyway. The vast majority only have one or two people working for them. There’s almost no one to exploit. Shareholders are not involved.” Not everyone on the left would see small businesses – often keen supporters of rightwing parties and austere social and economic policies – in such benign terms. But Brown went on: “The Labour party, nationally, is getting away from the old pro-businessanti-business argument. Creating social value is what matters.”Later I asked McDonnell, too, whether his approach risked saving rather than replacing capitalism. He smiled, and went into the gnomic mode he adopts when talking about tricky issues. “Who incorporates who ...” he said. “That’s the debate!” Then his smile turned more mischievous. A Corbyn government, he said, would “welcome” business “into our warm embrace”.The McDonnell ally I spoke to said that whenever the question of the economy’s long-term trajectory came up in Labour discussions, “We avoid that conversation. There is no consensus in the party.” Then he added: “Personally, I’d be quite happy if Britain ended up as Denmark.”McDonnell often cites Germany as another country where capitalism is more benign. Wainwright, who has known McDonnell for decades, has a usefully flexible prediction about what might happen to Britain’s economic culture if he becomes chancellor. “En route to a socialist society,” she says, “there might be moments when a different capitalism emerges” – ie, a more benign one.Yet the problem for the left with settling for “a different capitalism”, however temporarily, is that it may simply enable capitalism to regroup, and then resume its Darwinian progress. Arguably this is exactly what happened in Britain during the last century. After the politically explosive economic slump of the 1930s – the precursor to today’s crisis of capitalism – during the postwar years many business leaders seemed to accept the need for a more egalitarian economy, and developed close relationships with Labour politicians. But once the economy and society had been stabilised, and rightwingers such as Thatcher started making a seductive case for a return to raw capitalism, the businessmen switched sides.Another difficulty for the new economists and their political allies is to persuade voters – brought up with the idea that profit and growth are the only economic outcomes that matter – that other values should matter more from now on. Even saving the environment is still a hard sell. “The effect of economic growth on the planet is not an issue that’s talked about nearly enough on the left,” admits Berry. “As for de-growth” – the current green term for dropping growth as an economic objective – “the Labour party won’t touch it with a bargepole.” McDonnell’s ally agreed. “De-growth,” he said, “is just appalling labelling.” Guinan says the problem is not just presentational: “a politics of de-growth has not yet been invented that will carry the public.”Instead, Labour have recently begun promoting a version of the Green New Deal: an enticing but still largely theoretical scheme advocated by steadily more leftists and environmentalists in Britain and the US over the past decade. It aims to address the climate emergency and some of capitalism’s problems simultaneously, by a huge increase in government support for green technologies and the highly skilled, hopefully well-paid jobs needed to create them. In a speech this week, McDonnell said that this project needed to be Britain’s biggest peacetime undertaking since the Attlee government’s conversion of the economy from war to peace during the 40s. In April, the shadow business secretary Rebecca Long-Bailey, a McDonnell protege, wrote a  article advocating a “green industrial revolution”, including “deep-water turbines in the North Sea”, which “could provide four times Europe’s entire electricity demand” and “could be built and delivered from the UK”. It was quite a thrilling vision but the turbines were the only potential new technology the article mentioned.Another enormous issue that the new economists often skirt is whether many of today’s workers really want more of a voice in their workplaces. When “industrial democracy” was last a popular idea on the left, in the 70s, work was arguably more fulfilling and central to people’s lives than it had ever been before. Office jobs were replacing factory jobs, work was a strong engine of social mobility, and membership of powerful trade unions had accustomed the majority of British employees to being consulted, of having some agency in their working lives. But in 2019, empowering experiences at work are less common. For more and more people, however well-qualified, employment is short-term, low-status, unrewarding – barely part of their identity at all.Gordon-Farleigh has spent years trying to interest people in forming co-operatives, and not always succeeding. “Contemporary capitalism has produced a pacified, passive workforce,” he says. “A lot of people even like to feel a bit alienated by capitalism – to not really understand how it works. They need to be reskilled, politically. Then we have to look at what economic powers they actually want.”In April, after waiting for a pause in the seemingly endless winter of Brexit arguments, Mathew Lawrence launched a new economics thinktank, Common Wealth, which aims to draw all the strands of the movement together, with an evening event in London. After an uplifting but slightly too slick film about Common Wealth’s mission had been shown on a big screen – which was similar in tone and content to a recent Labour party political broadcast called Our Town – Lawrence was introduced to the audience by Guinan. In the speech that followed, Lawrence covered so much ground that his voice became a mutter, too fast for anyone unfamiliar with the new economics to follow. During this formal bit of the evening, Common Wealth risked feeling like a project for insiders – just another London thinktank, with the former Labour leader Ed Miliband on its board.Yet the rest of the launch felt different. The hired room was in the East End, far from the usual thinktank belt around Westminster, and it was packed, and loud with earnest talk. Almost everyone was in their 20s or 30s, many of them with scuffed Dr Martens shoes and austere modern haircuts – the now-familiar sight of British millennials gathering to discuss changing the world. Two hours after the start of the event, people were still arriving, and hardly anyone had left. When I did, just before 11, the lights were still on in the nearby office towers of the City of London, which overshadows the East End, and the economy of the whole country beyond. But walking away from the buzzing room, especially after a bottle of the Common Wealth craft ale that had been made for the occasion, it was possible to believe that the bankers’ best days might be numbered, and that the new economics would tell us how.• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, or sign up to the long read weekly email here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2c06f29fa20e080f7368c82a7910bf0a4a09158c/0_242_5197_3118/master/5197.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=27ecde46a36e8e1799c217f3959b53d3","title":"hmrc pushes massive vat increase for new solar battery systems","story":"Homes hoping to shrink their carbon footprints by installing a solar-battery system face a steep VAT increase from October under new laws proposed by HMRC.Meanwhile, home coal supplies will continue to receive the lower VAT rate.The Renewable Energy Association (REA) said the rise “contradicts the government’s commitment to tackling climate change” only weeks after parliament declared a climate emergency.It also warned that the move would push back the take-up of solar-battery systems by years even as the UK works towards becoming a net zero carbon economy by 2050.Nina Skorupska, the REA’s chief executive, said the increase would “create a barrier to British homes and businesses who are seeking to take action on climate change and reduce their bills by installing solar with battery storage”.She said the government “should be doing all it can to install these technologies rather than enacting barriers”.HMRC has blamed EU tax laws for the planned rise because they rule out lower VAT rates for energy saving equipment under state aid rules.The European court of justice ruled in 2015 that energy saving materials should not have been receiving the reduced rate of tax. This led to an increase in VAT for solar systems installed at new-build homes in 2016, but did not affect the majority of houses which would require retrofitting. Those houses will now be affected by the higher rate.The REA has called on HMRC to cancel the latest increase, which would come into effect as the UK prepares to leave the EU. Any rise should be cancelled as soon as possible after Brexit, the trade group added.The calls have won the support of more than 11,000 members of the public who have signed a petition by the green energy supplier Good Energy to call off the increase.Juliet Davenport, Good Energy’s chief executive, said the rise was “possibly the worst way to respond to a climate emergency”.“The government should be seeking to be a world leader in renewable technologies, but it’s damaging our successful solar industry and putting green jobs at risk. We urge the Treasury to listen to the thousands of petitioners who want to play their part in fighting climate change,” she said.HMRC brought the secondary legislation to parliament on Monday after carrying out an industry consultation on the plans in April and May this year. It has said it is offering as much tax relief as possible for home renewable energy systems while ensuring the UK is in line with EU law."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ac3550757ff1699ffa33584d643be1b1a4ddb0cf/0_240_4907_2946/master/4907.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6089a260aa8f9791a57eb20f9fd2741d","title":"housing policy england strategy building homes skewed","story":"English housing policy has one objective: build more. The country needs extra, and better housing. Right? On the surface, it might seem an obvious objective. But where? And should better housing always mean more homes, rather than renewed homes and revitalised communities?In short, England’s housing strategy is so partial it hardly passes for a policy, still less a plan to address whole swathes of the country. After 62 of the 73 local authority areas of the north voted to leave the EU three years ago, Theresa May promised a radical agenda in which “no community is left behind.” Yet what has emerged, in housing, is an unequal funding formula.With national and local government hollowed out after nine years of austerity – and the abolition of regional development agencies, government regional offices and the effective scrapping of a national regeneration agency – it was heartening to be reminded at the conference, organised by the Town and Country Planning Association, that local endeavour can work wonders. Inspiring stories from two small Northumberland towns – Wooler and Amble – caught the imagination. A community trust in the former has assets of almost £3m, owns high street shops, has delivered 18 affordable homes, and runs a large community hub incorporating a library and much more. Similarly, another trust in Amble, once a coal port, has bought and renewed shops, created a new town square, and built a “harbour village” with a variety of shops and cafes. People – yes, from the south – have moved in.Until 2010, places like Wooler and Amble could count on the support of (now abolished) regional bodies. Northumberland, for instance, had a strategic partnership, funded by the county council and the local regional development agency. A dilapidated pier in Amble was rebuilt 20 years ago by the (then) national regeneration agency, English Partnerships.About time, then, for a government policy reappraisal to make renewal in our kept-behind towns, cities and communities as important as new house-building. • Peter Hetherington writes on communities and regeneration and is former chair of the TCPA"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2702df10384f89e9815f05bc8974cdc6c4ef33d2/257_50_3243_1946/master/3243.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0cd68e5a5032523b07b8c00ade7fc3a5","title":"leicester tigers put up for sale in wake of cvc premiership investment rugby union","story":"Leicester Tigers have announced plans to sell the club.

Or something along those lines. Smith tries to go large over long-on, gets about half of it, and Archer runs in from the rope to take the catch.45th over: Australia 248-5 (Smith 38, Carey 8) Wood again, fast again, singles again. England loving this again. Neither batsman can get a full swing at Wood. Carey hares back for a second run after driving wide of long-off, and that’s the productive stroke of the over. 44th over: Australia 242-5 (Smith 36, Carey 4) That’s better for Australia. Five singles from Woakes, just dropping and nudging the ball into the manifold gaps in the field. Everything in the ring is a gap, really. Then Woakes bowls too short to finish the over, and Smith clobbers him for four.“Someone on the radio just said a batsman has ‘an average of X against pace and Y against spin’” emails Simon Gates. “What does that mean? The batsman would face both pace and spin in an innings, so what does an average against one of them mean?” Well, you can still count the runs scored against a certain kind of bowling, ided by the dismissals. Same theory as general averages. 43rd over: Australia 233-5 (Smith 30, Carey 1) England will be loving this. A wicket here and a wicket there, and Wood’s over goes for only five. The projected score is being revised down as we speak. Where are all those English pessimists who were emailing me earlier? Reveal thyself!42nd over: Australia 228-5 (Smith 27, Carey 0) Alex Carey in then, who has been a good dasher at the close. Mind you, Matthew Wade just hit the fastest ever List A hundred by an Australian during the Australia A tour a couple of days ago.Ridiculous stuff! Smith works a single to Bairstow at long leg. Stoinis turns and starts sprinting back for a second. Smith not only doesn’t want it, he’s not even thinking about it. He has his back to Stoinis, bat down, not wanting to know. Stoinis would be able to see Smith not moving, surely, but keeps running anyway. And even runs his bat in at the non-striker’s end, next to his teammate, before continuing to walk straight off without looking back. Buttler clips the bails off with Stonis about 30 yards away and growing.41st over: Australia 222-4 (Smith 22, Stoinis 7) Australia have struggled in this World Cup to turn some big starts into big finishes. Can they go big through the last ten, or can England haul them back? Stoinis gets a very crisp drive away from Wood to the cover boundary. Seven from the over. 40th over: Australia 213-4 (Smith 21, Stoinis 1) Slow starter is Stoinis. Can be explosive, but can also leave his team in deficit after gobbling up a lot of deliveries. He takes his time against Rashid to begin with here, before nudging off the mark. Ten overs to come.“I would have thought that the slope benefits the top spinners,” writes Hugh Swanborough. “Being able to maximize zip off the pitch and get a bit of movement is a nice surprise delivery to have up your sleeve.”39th over: Australia 213-4 (Smith 20, Stoinis 0) Marcus Stoinis to the middle now, to face Wood with his tail up. 94 miles an hour is the reading on one delivery, as Wood pitches full. Then back of a length to have Stoinis pulling away from the ball, startled. That’s some over.Ouch. Maxwellball was short and furious today. Wood bowls short outside off, Maxwell tries to uppercut, and feathers it through to the keeper. Here comes the frustration at not watching an entertainer at work. We should have an exhibition game one day: Maxwell, 10 overs, unlimited wickets. 38th over: Australia 212-3 (Smith 19, Maxwell 12) Archer steaming in to Maxwell, and... that is absolutely creamed by Maxwell! What a shot! Length ball with pace aplenty, but Maxwell just launches through the line of it and hits it almost 100 metres over the leg side and into the crowd. Next ball? Same shot, one bounce in front of the rope for four. Tucks a single next ball. Exhilarating, against England’s most dangerous bowler. 37th over: Australia 200-3 (Smith 18, Maxwell 1) This is about the first time in this World Cup that Maxwell hasn’t been off the mark with a four or a six. He drives Wood nicely, but straight to mid-off, then takes a sensible single to square leg. He’s got 14 overs to face today, unlike the five or so he’s had in some other matches. Smith drives Wood dead straight for four, then glides fine through third man for another. Like brushing crumbs off his trousers. 200 up.“The slope at Lord’s will indeed help Rashid turn his googly, if he’s bowling from the pavilion end. Are there any other international grounds with a similar slope?” Hampstead Cricket Club? Not at the top level, that I can think of. Birmingham is a bit of an inverted saucer, isn’t it?36th over: Australia 190-3 (Smith 9, Maxwell 0) How’s that for an eventful over? Finch’s hundred, and his beaming celebration, arms spread to the dressing room. Finch’s fall the next ball. Archer’s follow-up, a leg-side pie that Smith glances for four. Then Archer’s follow-up to the follow-up, a snorter at Glenn Maxwell that leaps at his grille and is fended away in the air with a flinch.Ton and done! The very next ball, Finch hooks at Jofra Archer, and the Wizard down there at long leg gets a chance at redemption. He takes the catch off the top edge. A misfield at long leg from Woakes, and Finch gets back for his second run. That’s 15 ODI tons for him, behind only Warner, Gilchrist, M. Waugh and Ponting for Australia.35th over: Australia 183-2 (Finch 98, Smith 4) Stokes takes us up to the drinks break, with Finch knocking a single and Smith steering a couple.“Omens are bad for England today,” writes Dave Seare from the dark tent where he crouches over his chicken bones. “Australia have brought a truckload of good luck (along with their skill). To compound this they’ve finally selected Nathan Lyon and are denying England a turn at the Zampa buffet. Crucially I’ve run out of milk for brews too.”What... kind of brew has milk in it? Is this a kind of stout? Magic pudding? Wombat stew?34th over: Australia 178-2 (Finch 96, Smith 1) Archer back into the attack immediately. Is that a pre-set rotation, or does Morgan want him to bowl at Smith before the batsman is set? If so, it doesn’t work, because Finch sprints back for a second run to start the over, then cuts a single at the end to keep strike. 33rd over: Australia 175-2 (Finch 93, Smith 1) You don’t really mind the wicket, do you if you’re Australia? Because it brings Steve Smith to the crease, and he’s exactly the hard-running accumulator you’d like at this stage of an innings. He gets off the mark by driving to deep cover for one. Straight through him! No footwork from Khawaja, he just stood up and drove half-heartedly at Stokes and the ball zips through the gate to take down off stump. Big celebrations from Stokes, surprise surprise. The bowling change comes off.32nd over: Australia 173-1 (Finch 92, Khawaja 23) Gorgeous from Finch, who is threatening to score another hundred. Rashid gives a lot of flight, the ball drops on a full length, and Finch is there waiting for it like a wolf at the door, licking his chops. He drives it through cover dreamily. 31st over: Australia 166-1 (Finch 88, Khawaja 20) I’m liking this Stokes change. It’s opened up a contest. Finch square drives him gorgeously for what should be four, but Archer does well on the rope to save. Then Stokes zings through a bouncer that Finch can’t get near on the hook. Willing. 30th over: Australia 162-1 (Finch 85, Khawaja 19) Rashid from the Pavilion End, where I suppose the slope would help his googly? Tell me if you know more about this weird angled ground than I. Khawaja is quick to sweep again when the opportunity presents, for a couple more runs.I’m sensing a certain theme in Kanishk Srinivasan’s correspondence.“At the risk of attracting a lot of hate and online boos, I’m really hoping Australia win this as a neutral (so not really neutral). But England losing here would open the doors ever so slightly for Bangladesh to pop them to that fourth semi-formal spot, which would be amazing. Plus, I think Australia have gone through some self-induced extremely difficult times, so maybe getting to the semis would do them some good. And then they could placate their haters by crashing out by losing to Bangladesh. What say?”29th over: Australia 158-1 (Finch 84, Khawaja 16) Stokes is back, giving Moeen a break. And perhaps seam is England’s better option just now, with three prodded runs, a couple of miscues, and a ball that jags and beats Finch in a more menacing fashion than anything Moeen sent down. Finch is very capable of monstering spinners on a good day. 28th over: Australia 155-1 (Finch 82, Khawaja 15) Missed stumping! That was a straightforward one for Buttler. Rashid hung the ball up there, drew Khawaja forward, beat his push, and dragged his back foot out. The ball skipped through but hit the heels of Buttler’s hands and bounced back. I don’t think he even really reacted to that ball in time. Khawaja celebrates his reprieve with the exuberance of a man released from prison, reverse-sweeping a four immediately.27th over: Australia 148-1 (Finch 81, Khawaja 9) Eight more from Moeen’s over, as Finch ends it with an edge to third man for four. Moeen has conceded 42 in 36 balls.26th over: Australia 141-1 (Finch 76, Khawaja 7) England’s spinners rattling through the overs, as must I. Lots of great emails coming in, thank you all. Rashid concedes a single, then a brace thanks to Root’s misfield.25th over: Australia 138-1 (Finch 74, Khawaja 6) Singles, singles, the Finch clouts Moeen straight for six! That was such a casual easy swing of the bat. It looked like long-on might be in play for a minute, but the ball sailed over his head. Finch makes it looks simple. 24th over: Australia 129-1 (Finch 67, Khawaja 4) A quiet over from Rashid, with Khawaja sweeping a couple. He does love the sweeps, in all their forms. Big fan of Dick van Dyke. “At the risk of betraying both of my cricketing prejudices,” warns Brian Withington, “the only Australian bowler I want to have a good one today is Peter Siddle at Chelmsford.” The great Pierre Siddel. Back him in every time.  23rd over: Australia 125-1 (Finch 66, Khawaja 1) So an eventful over, that one. Finch whacks a couple to cover, then blasts a six over midwicket via his meaty slog-sweep. Loves that shot, getting his front foot well forward, dropping his knees and blasting through the line. Then Warner’s wicket falls, and Usman Khawaja comes out at first drop. Played well last time out against Bangladesh, needs to do it again.Thanks Martin! And thanks Moeen, who finally gets reward for England. It was the bounce wot did it, Your Honour. Width outside off, Warner looks to cut, but the ball leaps on him and takes the top edge, looping tamely to point. The Big Bad Wolf is out, and gets a fair razzing from the crowd as he leaves. Either that or they’re saying “Rooooooooot” for the catch.22nd over: Australia 114-0 (Finch 56, Warner 53) Rashid with this over. Just a couple of singles, but one of them moves Warner from 499 runs to 500 in this edition of the World Cup. Ridiculous numbers really. 21st over: Australia 112-0 (Finch 55, Warner 52) Finally a quiet over for England, as Moeen starts looping his deliveries up, and Finch decides he’s content to be watchful for a few deliveries. Two singles in the end.Martin Sinclair is halfway out the door. “This has been a difficult morning and I’m wondering whether we’re watching the wheels coming off the England wagon. Yes, we can beat anyone on our day, but we can also lose to anyone and we all know about England’s fabled mental fortitude and ability to grind out wins under pressure. Er... Having followed the morning’s play obsessively up till now, I feel I have to take a break in case it it is my close attention that is jinxing us. I’ll check back in later when hopefully the score is around 1546. See you then!”Come come, Martin. What happened to that famed Britannia spirit engendered by blue passports or somesuch? I don’t know the details, I’m not from around here. 20th over: Australia 110-0 (Finch 54, Warner 51) The run twins are at it again, with a drive for one from Rashid. Matching fifties, and in such an adorable shade! They look cute.So is Thomas Taylor. “Is there anything better than staying up ‘til half four in the morning to watch England vs. Australia in a bar in Mexico with your Spanish girlfriend asleep in your arms?”I can’t speak specifically to that experience, Thomas, but I can say that a lot of people have fallen asleep watching cricket with me.19th over: Australia 106-0 (Finch 52, Warner 49) A couple more runs out to deep midwicket, and Finch has his fifty. In this World Cup he has 66, 6, 36, 82, 153, 53, and now 52 not out. And that 36 he was smashing it but got run out. If you want something more sedate, here’s our county cricket live blog.18th over: Australia 100-0 (Finch 48, Warner 47) Double spin change, with Adil Rashid’s leg-breaks from the Pavilion End. And Warner goes after him immediately. This must be a plan. First ball, tonked over mid-off for a couple. Third ball, pulled for four. Fifth ball, driving hard past a ing Moeen at mid-off. Ten from the over, all to Warner, and that’s the eighth century partnership in ODIs for this pair, and their third in this World Cup. Australia cruising.17th over: Australia 90-0 (Finch 48, Warner 37) Moeen versus Warner. This match-up has some history. England’s off-spinner starts up from the Nursery End, fittingly given he and his wife have just had a baby daughter. Warner drives a couple out into the deep, then gets two bonus overthrows from a nudge for a single, as Morgan’s throw is wild to Buttler. A couple of sedate singles, seven from the over, and Australia continue to cruise.A round of applause for Porus Patwari, everyone. “Long time lurker, first time poster here.” See, we’re not so scary.“On the subject of Morgan saying that it would take time to earn trust for the famed duo, I would like to insert the case of Mohammed Amir (as I like to do in any cricket conversation I can). My clear bias and love for him aside, I think he is a shining example of how one can turn the tide on even the most vocal of critics by good behavior, penchant for repentance and of course, searing pace when bowling. His redemption arc should be taught in schools. I think I might have digressed but yeah, you get the gist. I am sure Rob would agree.”I would never dare speak for Rob, he would flay me with a horse-hair switch for my insolence. But yes: keep being good at cricket, and keep playing with a smile on your face. Of course, it probably makes a difference when you’re a teenage player being led astray by an older crooked leader rather than being the... err... older crooked leader.

There is a perception of a mummy’s boy as being weak, somehow less masculine. But I think our relationship is one of my greatest strengths.

Being masculine and being close to your mum are perfectly compatible – just look at mafia bosses and Andy Murray.When my mum started dating, she was looking for a partner however, I was searching for a stepdad. Getting introduced to them was exciting – they were keen to impress me, they knew the power I wielded. Each one was different – one guy supported Chelsea, one loved trains, another inexplicably called the remote control a “channel changer” – but I rarely gave them a hard time as long as they made my mum happy. I mainly saw them as a new person to show off to I would proudly perform my magic trick of making a pound coin disappear and they would pretend they didn’t see me throw it up my sleeve. None of them were good enough in my opinion, not one could lay a full patio on soft ground in under 60 minutes while Titchmarsh was banging on about begonias.It may seem weird that I watched my mum go out dating, but that was just my normal. Some mums run the PTA and some go to Café Rouge with a stranger every Thursday. Each time a man came to pick her up, I’d peek through the lounge curtains to assess whether he looked good enough for her (the answer was always no), then I’d wait patiently with the babysitter for her to return so we could do the post-date analysis. This was my favourite bit. She’d sit on the armchair, me on the sofa, and I’d fire questions at her – “What was he like?” “What did he do?” “Can he erect trellising on a sandstone wall?” My mum would offer a PG retelling and I would deliver a final verdict, like Caesar giving a thumbs up or thumbs down. As a result, I’m now an expert in what 45-year-old women want in a man – so in 16 years’ time I’m going to clean up.The hardest bits were the breakups. Seeing my mum upset was tough and sometimes I felt frustrated that I couldn’t help. I’d make her a cup of tea and be on my best behaviour while occasionally mentioning that Tommy wouldn’t have treated her this way.I wrote the show because I wanted to tell a positive story about growing up in a single-parent family. The media still stigmatises single parents, but I never felt that was true of my experience and I figured other people must feel the same, too. I also wanted to tell my mum how brilliant I think she is, but telling her face to face seems strange. Writing this, I realised it’s not actually a show about mum finding a man, it’s a show about family. With hindsight, I can see the only men mum was truly interested in were the ones my brother and I were going to become.Mum’s coming to see the show for the first time in Edinburgh. I hope she likes it. But most of all I hope Tommy Walsh turns up so I can show him my magic trick."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fc62777de46c7a280f22b26e5743fdf5da97ec97/0_245_7443_4466/master/7443.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0a8ec359fdc0f9f3a7800d96885616b7","title":"rylan clark neal i knew i had to be the gay stereotype i played the game","story":"The broadcaster found fame after his hysterical performance on The X Factor, but he has gone from national joke to national treasure – even if celebrity isn’t all it was cracked up to beAt his home in Essex, Rylan Clark-Neal has an assortment of flatscreen TVs all tuned to his current favourite reality TV show. No, not Love Island – BBC Parliament.“It’s such a load of bollocks, I love it!” he says. “Have you ever sat there and watched it on a Wednesday? It’s hil-air-ious ... how prime minister’s question time is not a show on terrestrial TV I have no idea. I’ve never seen more liars in one room!”Channel controllers take note – after all, nobody understands reality TV quite like Clark-Neal. The 30-year-old first came to most people’s attention in 2012 as an outrageously camp contestant on ITV’s The X Factor who couldn’t really sing, but had a talent for annoying the judge Gary Barlow (and charming viewers in the process). A triumphant turn on Channel 5’s Celebrity Big Brother followed, which led to a presenter’s gig on the spin-off show, Big Brother’s Bit on the Side, then a stint as a showbiz reporter on ITV’s This Morning. Having completed a remarkable journey from national joke to national treasure, he can be heard in our front rooms in the Saturday afternoon BBC Radio 2 slot previously occupied by Zoe Ball. He says he has to pinch himself daily.“Yesterday I went to interview Madonna tonight I’m going to the Spice Girls, because Geri got me a ticket,” he says, by way of explaining his dreams coming true. Or, to put it another way: “Basically, 10-year-old me is having a wank.”Today we are sitting in a quiet meeting room overlooking Regent’s canal in London. Clark-Neal, who admits that he spent the photoshoot grilling the photographer about who would be interviewing him (“I needed to check you weren’t an arsehole”), gleams so brightly that you worry about staring directly at him: not just because of the bright-white veneers, which cost him £25,000 in 2013, but thanks to the brilliant-blue eyes, too. He is funny – outspoken and outrageous. Yet there is a steeliness and seriousness to him (not to mention a sweariness). After years of doing staged showbiz interviews full of made-up anecdotes, there is a sense of catharsis to his conversation: “It’s nice to be honest for a change,” he says, before talking about his early years being bullied, the time off he took at the end of 2017 and the dawning realisation that fame hasn’t turned out to be all he had hoped.Recently, he has turned his attention to another serious matter, one that may surprise those who know him best as the X Factor contestant who had a histrionic meltdown when Nicole Scherzinger told him she was putting him through to the live finals. “I’m obsessed with Brexit,” he says. Then, to prove his political knowledge, he performs an unlikely impression of the Labour MP Dawn Butler telling the Tory front bench to shush (“She’s my favourite she lets the MP mask slip”).So, what is his analysis of the Brexit impasse?“That all roads lead to shit. Every single possible outcome will cause riots. Whatever your position, whatever you voted, even if you get what you want, it’s still gonna be shit.”Could he do a better job?“I often think I could do a better job. Honestly, there are harder decisions to make during a series of Celebrity Big Brother than the ones they’re having to make.”Clark-Neal credits his time in Big Brother with changing the public’s perception of him – “they realised I was normal” – and his adoration goes so deep that he has modelled his house on the set. Apparently, there are Big Brother “eyes” above each door and the garden has been landscaped by people who worked on the show. Sadly, he says: “The only place I’ve ever felt safe is the Big Brother house.” His house even has a diary room for him to sit in. What does he do in there?“Think,” he says. “And talk.”“I can make someone listen if I want to.”“I can set it up so other people in the house can listen ... if I want them to.” He looks slightly bashful. “I live in quite a smart home. I built it from scratch, so I thought of everything ... a lot of my doors are automatic the whole house is voice-activated.”The other day, his wifi went down. He is a little embarrassed to admit that he had forgotten how to turn on the lights like a normal person. “I was pressing random buttons and screaming for Alexa to help.”As if to prove his hi-tech credentials, his watch suddenly starts buzzing to tell him his stepson, Cameron, is trying to call – in 2015, Clark-Neal married Dan Neal, a former police officer and Big Brother contestant, whose 19-year-old son now lives with them. “Do you mind?” he says, reaching for his phone. There follows an amusing conversation revolving around Cameron trying to access the house’s steam room. “If you go for a swim, be careful of the robot – it’s on a cleaning cycle. Oh, and dry the floor after yourself!”How does he find being a stepdad?“It’s the same as being a normal dad. He rinses me dry, I slap him about when he’s naughty ... no, I don’t, obviously … but it’s the same as being a biological dad. He lives with us. I moan at him to clean up, he cleans up ... he cuts the grass, I give him some money ... it’s just very normal.”Clark-Neal describes himself as the man in the middle – there are 10 years between he and both Dan and Cameron – but the closeness in age helps him with some difficult conversations. “I don’t like to talk about sex with Cameron, but I can,” he says. “But I do warn him – if you make me a grandad at 30, I’ll cut it off.”Would he like more children?“It’s not something I really talk about – although it always ends up in the papers anyway. But Dan’s done it all now, whereas I haven’t. So … I don’t know.”Clark-Neal was born Ross Richard Clark in 1988, raised by his mum and his nan in a council house in Stepney Green, east London. He says his childhood was a happy, normal one, but he was bullied: “Of course I was – I was a chubby, ginger, gay kid: all I needed was a set of glasses for the full fucking set.”There was a real community spirit on his street, but his mum moved the family to Essex after he was attacked at a local playground and put in hospital with a fractured skull. “Probably because they thought I was gay, although I don’t remember any of it. One minute I was on the rope swings, the next I was on the floor.”Seeing two women bloodied and beaten in the news recently after an attack on a London bus, alleged to have been motivated by homophobia, didn’t surprise him: “I saw all the statuses saying: ‘I can’t believe this is happening in 2019,’ but every day on my Twitter feed I’ll get: ‘You’re gay, you’re a cunt, people like you should be killed because you’re gay.’ Will things ever change?”In his teens, Clark-Neal dabbled in modelling, changing his name from Ross to Rylan to be more recognisable. He performed in boyband tribute acts, then signed up to The X Factor. But he doesn’t like looking back on that period of his life.“I played a character when I was on there,” he says. “I knew I had to be the gay stereotype that was on the front of the papers every day. And I did my job well. I played the game.”Does this mean that his hysterical crying in front of Scherzinger was all an act?“No, that was true,” he says. “But only because we were drinking in the pool until about 7am and it was 50-degree heat and I’d had an hour’s sleep. I knew I only needed a week on the live shows to earn a bit of money and set myself up for a while. But you only saw a bit of the crying. It went on for 45 minutes and they had to call a paramedic. I couldn’t breathe!”Clark-Neal says he watches the infamous clip once a year, just to remind himself how much it all means. He loves his job and he has worked ridiculously hard for it – possibly too much, at times. He recalls the day his nan died. They were incredibly close, but he still chose to present Big Brother’s Bit on the Side that night. “It was either that or sit indoors crying,” he says. “So I cried, went into work, had another cry, did an hour’s live show, then cried and went home. It’s just how I am ... always at work, never stop.”Does he worry that he is using work to deal with deeper stuff?“One hundred per cent. But I know my nan would have said: ‘Go to work.’”When Clark-Neal first found fame, he lived the celebrity cliches – even buying a customised Range Rover with the silver lettering changed to Range Rylan. But, he says, he misjudged what fame would bring. Even interviewing Madonna, he says he found himself getting mobbed more than the queen of pop. “Not because I’m more recognisable. I’m not under any illusion that I’m an A-lister I don’t think I’m even on the alphabet scale. But I’m in people’s houses every day – I’m there when they wake up and there when they go to bed. So people think they know who I am. And, to a certain extent, they do.”Listen to his show and it is clear why strangers view him as a friend: he is warm, witty and gets his mum to phone in and natter on about ham and cheese toasties. Still, isn’t it a bit rich complaining about fame when he went all-out in search of it?“In the early days, it was all I ever wanted, more than the job,” he says. “I wanted people to know who I was. But now, much as I’m grateful for it, it’s the one thing I wish I didn’t have. Because I don’t leave my house. If I walk down the street, people will come up. And I can’t just go: ‘Get lost,’ because I’m not an arsehole.”He recalls a family wedding the other week – lovely people, great conversation. Then the evening approached. “That’s when it started,” he says. “People who’d been there all day started asking for photos. It’s that constant reminder that: ‘Oh shit, you’re Rylan.’ I’ve lost a lot of friends over it. Especially in telly, I’ve got one handful of people I can cry down the phone to and know it’s between us.”The Range Rylan had to go – too many eagle-eyed drivers started driving alongside him with cameras out, causing him to panic at the wheel. But he blames himself: “I sold my soul,” he says. “I went on X Factor and sold my soul … to the beast.”I wonder how he feels about reality TV in today’s climate, in which The Jeremy Kyle Show has been axed and Love Island heavily criticised after people who had starred in the programmes had mental health problems and even killed themselves. Clark-Neal thinks the main problem is the way fame ends suddenly once you leave the shows. “The second you walk out, you are on your own. I was very lucky. After the X Factor tour, I went back home … it was the first time I’d been in a room on my own for eight months, without anyone watching me. I remember waking up at 4am and thinking: ‘It’s over.’ If the phone hadn’t rung with the Big Brother job a few weeks later, I don’t know what I’d have done.”In fact, he has worked so much that at the end of 2017 he stepped back from his gig on This Morning to look after his mental health. He says he was getting up at 5am most days and not getting home until 2am. He was also struggling to deal with other problems, particularly his mum’s worsening health as a result of Crohn’s disease. Yet the decision drew criticism from some. “I remember seeing tweets from people saying: ‘Who do you think you are? I’ve worked for the NHS for 25 years and I’m not in a position to have time off.’“But then other people will say: ‘I never knew your mum nearly died, or was linked up to an IV drip six nights a week because she can’t digest food any more.’ And that’s because I don’t go on telly and every magazine going: ‘Poor me, my mum’s not well, now give me a tenner for the interview.’“Life is complicated,” he concludes, “but I’ve got a set of veneers that I smile through on morning TV.”After sharing his feelings about always being on duty, I feel guilty when the interview ends and I, too, ask for a favour. But my wife’s grandma, who has been ill, is a huge fan, so … if he wouldn’t mind … could he just do a little video message?“I’d love to,” he says. “What’s her name?”Mildred, I say.“Of course it is.”He whisks my phone from my hand and starts recording: “Hi Mildred, it’s Rylan, I hope you’re well. A little birdie tells me that you listen to my radio show. Thank you, because it’s nice to meet one of the three listeners. I hear you’ve had a few little issues, so I’m sending you all my love. And whenever you want to come to visit Radio 2, let me know.”It is nothing special, really, just a video message for someone he has never met – one of dozens he will no doubt do in the next few days. But it is so effortlessly sweet that I realise why he can’t walk down the street without being approached. And I think: whatever it was he sold to the beast, he definitely kept some of it back."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c30bd7848a3d86f22a3855a08b40c80b533508d6/0_20_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7ed1392594edbc2ffe57b200b9538703","title":"iran says us sanctions on supreme leader means permanent closure of diplomacy","story":"Minister says Islam forbids such a move as country prepares to breach nuclear dealIran will never pursue a nuclear weapon, its foreign minister has claimed, saying Islam prevented the country from doing so.Iran has previously said it is ideologically opposed to acquiring nuclear weapons and only seeks nuclear power for civilian purposes. But in the current unpredictable climate it is possible that Donald Trump could pick up Javad Zarif’s remarks as a signal to talk.The White House is pursuing a twin-track strategy of seeking talks while trying to throttle the Iranian economy through sanctions which block trade with Europe and oil sales, and freeze the assets of political and diplomatic leaders.Iran has said it will breach the uranium enrichment limits set out in the 2015 nuclear deal on Thursday, but that does not imply the country is on the path to building a nuclear weapon.Zarif pointed to the past use of nuclear weapons by the US and to recent comments by Trump that he had called off a military strike on Iran because it would have killed 150 people. “You were really worried about 150 people? How many people have you killed with a nuclear weapon? How many generations have you wiped out with these weapons?” Zarif said on Tuesday.“It is us who, because of our religious views, will never pursue a nuclear weapon.”Earlier on Tuesday, Iran said the US’s decision to impose sanctions on its supreme leader and other top officials was “idiotic” and had permanently closed the path to diplomacy between Tehran and Washington.Trump imposed new sanctions on Monday against the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and top military chiefs, in an unprecedented step designed to increase pressure on Iran after Tehran’s downing of an unmanned American drone. Khamenei is Iran’s utmost authority who has the last say on all state matters.Washington said it would also impose sanctions this week on Zarif, who negotiated the 2015 nuclear deal with the US and other major powers and has spearheaded Iranian diplomacy since.Iran’s president, Hassan Rouhani, described the White House as “afflicted by mental retardation” and said the sanctions against Khamenei were “outrageous and idiotic”, especially as the 80-year-old cleric has no overseas assets and no plans to ever travel to the US.Tehran said the US had spent weeks demanding that Iran match America’s diplomacy with its own diplomacy, rather than military responses, but was now trying to immobilise its chief diplomat. “Imposing useless sanctions on Iran’s supreme leader and the commander of Iran’s diplomacy is the permanent closure of the path of diplomacy,” the foreign ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi said in a tweet on Tuesday. “Trump’s desperate administration is destroying the established international mechanisms for maintaining world peace and security.”Speaking in Israel, Trump’s national security adviser, John Bolton, insisted the president remained open to real negotiations and “all that Iran needs to do is walk through that open door”.Iran’s decision to breach the nuclear deal is a response to US sanctions and Europe’s failure to provide economic protection. It is due to be followed by more serious breaches on 7 July. This places the EU in a dilemma since France, Germany and the UK are desperate to keep the deal alive but cannot find a route to de-escalate the crisis between Tehran and Washington.The three European countries issued a statement on the margins of the UN security council on Monday urging Iran to stay inside the deal, saying: “It is in everyone’s interest to show restraint and avoid any actions that would undermine this vital pillar of the non-proliferation regime and of our collective security.”They also insisted they were working hard to implement their commitments to Iran – a reference to setting up financial mechanisms to help Tehran trade with Europe without the threat of US sanctions – and condemned recent attacks on oil tankers in the Gulf of Oman.The UK foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, warned Iran not to breach the uranium enrichment limits, saying in the Commons: “It is absolutely essential they stick to that deal in its entirety for it to preserve and for us to have a nuclear-free Middle East.”He also ruled out British involvement in military action. “The US is our closest ally. We talk to them the whole time but I cannot envisage any situation where they request, or we agree to, any moves to go to war.”He again called for de-escalation, saying: “Neither side wants war, but it is very important for there to be ladders for people to climb down so discussions can take place.”Trump is due to raise the issue of tightening maritime security in the Gulf at a G20 summit starting on Friday in Japan. He wants Asian countries including Korea and Japan to contribute more to defence of shipping in the Gulf especially the strait of Hormuz.Analysts said the impact of the fresh US sanctions on an already heavily sanctioned country would be limited. “The newly announced Iran sanctions are symbolic,” said Jarrett Blanc, a former senior state department official now at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.Trump said he was willing to pursue dialogue with Tehran without preconditions, but the sanctions appeared to make such talks even less likely.The Iranian ambassador to the UN, Majid Takht-Ravanchi, said: “No one in clear mind can have a dialogue with somebody who is threatening you with sanctions as long as that is still there, there is no way we can have a dialogue.”The ratcheting up of tensions between the two countries comes in the wake of the Gulf of Oman tanker attacks, when two vessels were damaged by explosions. The Trump administration blamed Iran for the attacks, but Tehran denied responsibility.Then last week a US drone was shot down by Iran, further escalating the crisis. The US president responded by ordering an attack on Iran, before pulling back and opting for stronger sanctions instead.Tensions with Iran have been mounting since Trump withdrew the US from the 2015 nuclear deal last year and began applying pressure on Tehran through economic sanctions."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b9a660d479102915b89ac74321eed7b08647b2f1/0_23_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=be46830b8a02a6a545d31fe4c0990814","title":"jared kushner economic blueprint palestinians boycott derision","story":"Trump son-in-law’s plan, which ignores the key political issues, is dismissed as ‘a fantasy that is completely orced from reality’A US-designed economic blueprint for Israeli-Palestinian peace will be launched in Bahrain on Tuesday, without the participation of either Palestinian or Israeli officials.The Palestinians are boycotting the conference and a late decision was taken not to invite Israelis. A relative handful of Palestinian business leaders are expected in Bahrain, for what is widely seen as a “vanity project” for Donald Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner.Kushner’s “peace to prosperity” plan envisages $50bn being spent on investments in the occupied territories and neighbouring countries. The plan includes a $5bn transportation corridor joining the West Bank and Gaza.Kushner told Reuters on Saturday the plan would create a million jobs, halve Palestinian poverty and double the size of the Palestinian economy.However, the whole plan is contingent on a political solution to the seven-decade conflict between Israelis and Palestinians, which looks further away than ever. The Palestinians have rejected the US as a broker because of the Trump administration’s unequivocal support for Israel, and in particular the rightwing government of Benjamin Netanyahu.“We have realised that this economic workshop in Bahrain is going to be really nonsense. It is just simply a theoretical piece of work calling for $50bn,” Mohammad Shtayyeh, the Palestinian authority prime minister, said.The Gaza-to-West Bank transport link idea has a long history, but it has never got off the ground largely because of Israeli political opposition. In general, critics of the plan said, the projects are meaningless as long as the Palestinian economy is under an Israeli stranglehold.“They know very well what’s been hindering Palestinian economic development and investment in the occupied territories and that’s simply the occupation,” Hassan said. “They can’t control the borders. They can’t guarantee that they can export or import or that they can get the raw materials in that they need. They can’t send people out for training … the simple basic things they’re not allowed to do.”The Bahrain conference will be attended by Gulf Arab states as well as Jordan and Egypt, while Israel is expected to send a business delegation.Gerald Feierstein, a former senior state department official, said most of those attending were there for cynical reasons.“Some businesspeople will almost certainly see this as an opportunity to cash in on the proposed $50bn windfall that Kushner has suggested,” Feierstein argued. “But the Gulf governments are motivated more by the need to curry favor with the Trump administration, and the desire to demonstrate support for Trump’s son-in-law on his favorite vanity project, than by any expectation that this will advance the cause of peace in the Middle East.”“In fact, the Kushner document is not a plan at all. It is more like a wishlist of all the economic projects that have been or could be proposed in a world where there is no Israeli occupationsiege and where there is virtually unlimited funding,” said Khaled Elgindy, the author of Blind Spot, a history of US-Palestinian relations. “It’s a fantasy that is completely orced from reality.”"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"TD says \u0026lsquothe entire Waterford organisation needs to be stood down and reviewed\u0026rsquoHarris says decision to strike on Wednesday before Labour Court talks is \u0026lsquoextraordinary\u0026rsquoMorning bathers at Sandycove report seeing \u0026lsquoorange slick\u0026rsquo in water on Tuesday morningFire safety and other construction issues have dogged Irish apartmentsReferees\u0026rsquo society condemns \u0026lsquoepidemic\u0026rsquo of poor treatment of match officialsIrish businessman claims he is a non-resident as he is based in MaltaPatients to be briefed on contents of report before it is publishedDeath of two pregnant patients prompted outside investigations into St Luke\u0026rsquos Hospital, KilkennyEntire Killarney system backed up last year causing sewage to flow into a local riverCompany to tell TDs it can do rollout much cheaper than \u0026euro5bn National Broadband PlanProf Kinsella will suggest the introduction of new \u0026ldquofiscal stress tests in order to better prepare for a downturnHeavy rain to be replaced by sunshine this week, with temperatures to reach up to 27 degreesDutch cycling expert measured air pollution in Dublin at three times Utrecht levelDisabled parking bay is the first of four planned spots, with two more due to open before SeptemberNo major complaints from teachers about Monday\u0026rsquos examsGovernment facing budget deficit if UK crashes out of EUTrio who were working as gamekeepers convicted over animal\u0026rsquos death in Co WaterfordTributes paid to \u0026lsquoleading light\u0026rsquo in Irish motorsport"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3936900.1561461740!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"swimming bans result of lack of investment says irish water","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA view of the water at Sandycove in Dublin on Tuesday morning. Photograph: Flossie and The Beach CleanersFacebookA swimming ban is in place at several Dublin beaches following overflow discharges of wastewater is the result of years of underinvestment in treatment facilities and pumping stations, according to Irish Water.The utility’s regional operations manager John O’Donoghue said the underinvestment had left Irish Water “playing catch up” and led to incidents such as the overflow of wastewater into Dublin Bay on Monday.The swimming ban is in place at several Dublin beaches for the second time in recent weeks. Mr O’Donoghue told Newstalk Breakfast that Irish Water was dealing with an antiquated system.It would take a “huge amount” of investment to bring the system up to speed, he said.A status yellow rainfall alert last weekend led to a “controlled overflow discharge” from the Ringsend wastewater treatment plant. This was “the lesser of two evils”, said Mr O’Donoghue.Swimming bans are now in place around Dublin Bay in Dollymount, Seapoint, Sandycove and the Forty Foot pending further tests.Mr O’Donoghue said he hoped the ban will be lifted as soon as possible once tests have been carried out.Morning bathers in Sandycove were treated to an unsightly “orange slick” when they arrived for their dip on Tuesday.Harriet Donnelly who, along with her daughter Flossie, runs the charity Flossie and the Beach Cleaners, said she arrived for a morning swim only to find that even the harbour’s jelly fish were orange.“It didn’t smell,” said Ms Donnelly, who nevertheless decided not to swim there today. Instead, she took some pictures and posted them on the Flossie and the Beach Cleaners Facebook page with the caption: “No plastic this morning . . . just poo! Sandycove this morning...fancy a dip, even the jellyfish have changed colour.”Ms Donnelly said it was worse than the most recent spill from the Ringsend Treatment Plant. She said it was disappointing this level of pollution was happening on a regular basis.Local Fianna Fáil councillor Cormac Devlin paid tribute to Flossie and the Beach Cleaners. He said he too had seen the orange slick at Sandyycove and was disturbed by its appearance “at the height of the tourist season”.“We have to get a grip on the problem, this just has to stop,” he said."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3936296.1561408437!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"donohoe to table tight budget as cash set aside for no deal brexit","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMinister for Finance Paschal Donohoe: there will be limited room on budget day for any additional spending or tax measures beyond those already signalled. Photograph: PA   A no-deal Brexit would push the Government towards running an overall budget deficit next year as opposed to a small surplus if the UK leaves the EU in an orderly fashion.Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe will outline the consequences of a no-deal Brexit on the State finances alongside forecasts in the case of Britain leaving the EU with a deal when he publishes the summer economic statement on Tuesday, one of the initial steps in the annual budget process.Government sources said a no-deal Brexit will turn an expected surplus into a deficit in the “range” of “up to” 1.5 per cent for next year.It is expected there will be roughly €2.8 billion in extra money to spend in the budget, of which some €2 billion-€2.2 billion has already been committed in capital spending, public sector pay rises and demographic changes.This means there will be limited room on budget day for any additional spending or tax measures beyond those already signalled.The budget will be delivered on October 8th and the UK is due to leave the EU on October 31st. It is also before a possibly crucial EU summit on October 17th and 18th, which may decide on the Brexit issue.While Taoiseach Leo Varadkar is expected to make a decision in September on whether a deal or a no-deal exit is more likely, the budget will be framed to fit both outcomes.Too generousThe Government want to avoid introducing measures that are too generous and would have to be rescinded if Britain crashes out of the bloc.The other scenario Mr Donohoe is said to be keen to avoid is having a second budget, which is seen as sending a signal of uncertainty. The intention is to table a tight budget that would leave money for increased supports in sectors such as agriculture if there is a no-deal Brexit.Michael McGrath, the Fianna Fáil finance spokesman, who will negotiate the budget with Mr Donohoe, said there was a need to “hold some resources in reserve” and that a “cautious approach” was needed.He said a no-deal Brexit would require “targeted intervention to support certain sectors of the economy that are most exposed”."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3936275.1561411055!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"eir says it can install rural broadband for less than 1bn","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tCarolan Lennon, the company’s chief executive, will tell the Oireachtas communications committee that “it is clear to us that we can build rural fibre infrastructure at a lower cost than is currently envisaged in the plans”. Photograph: Gareth ChaneyCollins Eir will today tells TDs and Senators that it could complete the National Broadband Plan for less than €1 billion, just a third of the sum the State has agreed to invest in the project and a fifth of the estimated final cost. Carolan Lennon, the company’s chief executive, will tell the Oireachtas communications committee that “it is clear to us that we can build rural fibre infrastructure at a lower cost than is currently envisaged in the plans”.“Eir could complete the NBP, based on Eir’s approach to the 300k rural rollout, for under €1 billion,” she will tell the committee, which is holding a series of hearings into the plan to connect some 540,000 rural properties to high-speed internet. The 300k reference is to eir’s current project which aims to make broadband available to more than 300,000 rural homes on a commercial basis. She will also say in her statement that the removal of these 300,000 premises “should have led to a reduction in the overall subsidy” for the National Broadband Plan.Despite reservations among senior civil servants about the affordability, the Cabinet last month approved the plan, which, when private investment is included, is expected to cost some €5 billion. The State is investing up to €3 billion in the plan. Successful bidderMs Lennon will also question whether the gap funding model used by the Department of Communications to deliver the plan is appropriate. This model will see the successful bidder for the contract, a consortium led by Granahan McCourt, rather than the State take ownership of the network at the end of the process. She will say that the model “failed to deliver a competitive outcome” for the procurement process and that “this need not have been the case had different choices been made along the way”. Other models could have delivered broadband “faster and cheaper than the existing process”, Ms Lennon will say. Eir withdrew as a bidder for the contract in January of last year citing “significant commercial issues and a complexity within the tender process”. ‘Driven up costs’Committee members will be told that Granahan McCourt has decided not to use the infrastructure eir built for its 300k plan but to “duplicate” work it has already done which she says “has driven up the costs and associated subsidy”. Ms Lennon will tell the committee that after eir withdrew from the process, its then chief executive Richard Moat wrote to then minister for communications Denis Naughten “outlining our reasons for leaving the process but also offering to discuss with the department alternative ways of achieving the Government’s stated policy objectives”. In a statement in response to Ms Carolan’s comments, a Department of Communications spokeswoman said: “There were two draft bids received in September 2017 at an advanced stage in the NBP procurement process - one from Eir and one from National Broadband Ireland (who were appointed preferred bidder). Both bids were broadly similar in terms of the level of State subsidy sought, with Eir’s bid coming in as multiples of €1 billion.” "},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/05/17/TELEMMGLPICT000147339863_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfy2dmClwgbjjulYfPTELibA.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"judges given new expenses policy telegraph discovers judiciary","story":"The Ministry of Justice approved expenses including shampoo and crockery.  Lord Chief Justice, Lord Ian Burnett, pictured, claimed for multiple journeys to and from his homeMinistry of JusticeThe judiciary are to be given a new expenses policy after The Daily  found that Britain\u0027s most senior judges have claimed for crockery, shampoo and a taxi to transport ceremonial robes on taxpayer-funded expenses.Expenses data released under the Freedom of Information Act shows how some of the most high-profile members of the judiciary in England and Wales have had claims for everyday items as well first-class trains approved, even though they receive a salary of at least £180,000.At present, judges are encouraged to follow the expenses policy for Ministry of Justice (MOJ) civil servants, and the judiciary has also set out specific guidance relating to travel, accommodation and relocation....To continue reading this articleAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per weekRegister for freeRegister or subscribe to continue readingAlready a subscriber?Newsletters and daily briefings30 days free, then £2 per weekUnlimited access to Premium articlesExclusive subscriber events and rewardsThe daily newspaper on your smartphone or tabletAlready a subscriber?Ministry of JusticeBoris Johnson refuses to deny \u0026#39staged\u0026#39 picture with Carrie Symonds was six weeks old in radio phone-in - Tory leadership latest newsComment: Make the most of Jean-Claude Juncker.

Wangige is hardly Helmand, nor, by his own admission, did counterinsurgency work particularly well in either Afghanistan or Iraq.Ex-major Wayne Hennessy-Barrett, 46, served in Afghanistan, Bosnia, Kosovo and Iraq before founding 4G in 2013 in KenyaYet the traditional “microfinance” model of lending to the poor was not working either, Mr Hennessy-Barrett reckoned. Once a buzzword in development circles, microfinance has been hailed by its proponents as a powerful tool in fighting poverty. Tony Blair and Bill Clinton were both fans.The idea was simple enough. Many poor people in the developing world eke out a living as petty traders, but rarely have access to the credit needed to grow their businesses.Microfinance was meant to give them that access through  small loans and low-cost banking services, setting them on the path to self-sufficiency. The model has gone global in recent decades: more than 200m people round the world have been the recipients of “microcredit”.The miracle has largely failed to happen, however. While disagreements about the impact of microfinance abound, studies have suggested that the model has largely failed to lift the poor out of poverty. Many, indeed, have been left worse off because they have been plunged into debt.Mr Hennessy-Barrett reckons the problem largely lies with the model used by most microfinanciers. To keep overheads down, many companies lend through mobile phone apps and have little interaction with their clients or knowledge of what the money is going to be spent on.Wayne Hennessy-Barrett at a market in WangigeOften cash is borrowed to cover unexpected crises, such as funerals and medical operations. Reflecting a growing problem in Kenya, loans to cover online gambling are also increasing, according to government officials.Lacking a sufficient or regular enough income to pay back the loans, many default. More than one million people have been blacklisted by the country’s two main credit ratings, sometimes over loans of less than £5.Credit alone, Mr Hennessy-Barrett realised, was likely to do more harm than good. Only if people borrowed sensibly, and understood how to turn loans into larger incomes, would they have a chance of escaping poverty rather than being sucked deeper into it.“Just shoving money at people is not enough,” he said. “Having a loan to solve a problem is not enough. What you need is a livelihood where you can use credit for leverage. When it it just to live it is a recipe for poverty.“Cheap debt pushed carelessly at poor people keeps poor people poor.”Valentine Nasila, Operations Manager at 4G Capital\u0026#39s head office, speaks with a clientThere was no question in his mind that microcredit was still the key to fighting poverty. In a country where formal jobs are few and far between, three in four working Kenyans are self-employed, scratching a living by selling goods to other poor people.Yet if poor borrowers were to have a chance of success, he concluded, they would need much more face-to-face support from trained professionals who understood the needs and challenges of their clients.It was in attempting to meet this need that Mr Hennessy-Barrett drew on his army experience. In Afghanistan, the British army’s counterinsurgency operations were designed to deny insurgents ground by protecting communities, creating the conditions to let them live normal lives and speaking to people to understand their needs and reassure them.Such skills could also be deployed in peacetime environments, he felt. From the time of its foundation in a small office in Wangige in 2013, his company, 4G Capital, would run along army lines.Wayne Hennessy-Barrett\u0026#39s business is one of Africa’s fastest growing financial technology companies“In Afghanistan we had several teams of elite soldiers operating in multiple places, communing with the population, trying to understand their needs,” he said.“That led to a methodology of having small teams of well-trained, dedicated professionals.”From the outset, Mr Hennessy-Barrett deployed his staff in teams of four and sent them to trawl through the markets using his own interpretation of the army’s “patrol trinity”.In counterinsurgency terms, this meant “intelligence gathering”, “framework protection” and “local assurance”. For 4G, this was reinterpreted as “marketing”, “lending” and “growth and repayment”. Teams would seek to understand the environment they were operating in, lend to iniduals after learning what their needs were and finally helping them to grow their businesses so they could repay their loans.The loans on offer were small, between £40 and £400, and had to be repaid within a month, the intention being to enforce discipline and focus money where it was needed: replenishing inventory, adding stock and growing businesses.Crucially, it also came with basic training, teaching clients how to maximise growth potential, keep books and improve customer care. The mixture of personal attention and computer algorithms to assess the viability of clients’ growth potential means that 92 percent of loans are paid on time, meaning the company has more money to lend.The model appears to have been phenomenally successful. From its original outlet in Wangige, 4G Capital now has 70 more, with more than 300 employees. Expanding into Rwanda and Uganda, it is one of Africa’s fastest growing financial technology companies. It expects to lend £47 million over the next 12 months.Optometrist Tabitha Njeri, 26, borrowed £80 from 4G Capital to start her own optician\u0026#39s storeThe success, Mr Hennessy-Barrett says, has come from “slaving” the company’s fortunes to the fortunes of its clients. It is doing well because its clients have seen their businesses grow on average by 82 per cent since taking their first loan from 4G.Tabitha Njeri, who runs a small optician’s shop in Wangige, is one such beneficiary. 4G lent her £80 towards her startup costs early last year, gave her training in accountancy and business growth skills and rolled over loans to allow her to increase stock from 50 to 150 glasses. She now plans to expand by opening a diagnosis lab.“I used to find it very difficult to raise enough to support my family,” she said. “Now I can. I have financial stability.”Down the road, Patrick Ngore, who runs a chemist’s, says he has been able to increase stock sevenfold with loans from the company. He also credits training in stock management and minimising expenditure in growing his profit margins from 20 to 40 per cent.Others in Wangige tell similar stories.In many ways, the 4G model, although partially reliant on technology,  is a return to the basics of microfinance. Loans have allowed Patrick Ngore, owner of a chemists,to increase his stock sevenfold and boost his profit margin from 20 per cent to 40 per centThe founder of modern microfinance is generally held to be Mohammed Yunus, who started making small loans to the very poor in Bangladesh in 1976. Lending mostly to women, who formed small groups that were collectively responsible for each other’s debts, he found that astonishingly few defaulted.His Grameen Bank has now made more than £7 billion pounds in small loans to the poor, an achievement that secured him the Nobel Peace Prize in 2006.Yet the microfinance model he pioneered would grow increasingly troubled. Irresponsible and often predatory lending to the poor led to debt crises in Bosnia, Morocco and parts of Pakistan. It also contributed to a debtors’ revolt in Nicaragua in 2008 when farmers, backed by President Daniel Ortega, refused en masse to pay back microcredit loans. A microfinance default crisis in the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh two years later was blamed for a surge in suicide by farmers.Geoffrey Kamanu runs through a finance training programme with staff from 4G Capital The longstanding problem with microfinance, which is largely driven by private companies like 4G, is that business logic often leads to aggressive tactics in collecting debts, says David Roodman, author of the book Due Diligence: An Impertinent Inquiry into Microfinance.In countries like Kenya many microfinance outfits lend at interest rates as high as 30 per cent because they are forced to raise capital from commercial banks, often placing an intolerable burden on poor borrowers.Mr Hennessy-Barrett says his model is addressing those concerns: interest rates are capped at 13.5 per cent and allowances are made for “bad-luck customers” who encounter unexpected setbacks like illness or a death in the family.Experts in Kenya generally applaud 4G Capital’s model, which has been mimicked by one or two other outfits. But they also raise questions about what impact it can really have.Microcredit | Transforming fortunes and futures in NepalDespite its growth, 4G and its 120,000 customers are still pretty small fry, says Paul Musoke, director of financial institutions at FSD Africa, a UK-funded organisation that looks at ways to financially empower the poor.By contrast, M-Shwari and Tala, two providers of small loans through mobile phone apps, have 11 million between them in Kenya alone. Such “light-touch” models, which use technology rather than people to engage with borrowers are always likely to do better than “heavy-touch” approaches like Mr Hennessy-Barrett’s — except in densely populated countries like Bangladesh.“It makes sense what he is trying to do,” says Mr Musoke. “The question is whether it can be scaled up significantly to make an impact.”The other danger in Kenya is that a microfinance “debt bubble” risks being created because, in a poorly regulated market, there is little to stop poor borrowers from taking loans from 4G and other companies offering unsecured credit at the same time.Microfinancing: revolutionising the health and livelihoods of Nepalese women“The greatest potential for harm has come when you have multiple lenders all growing at once because then almost certainly people are borrowing from one to pay the other,” says Mr Roodman.Mr Hennessy-Barrett’s model seems enlightened, yet it is too soon to tell how effective it will be. History suggests that microcredit often stimulates start-up businesses, but ultimately fails to enrich its owners, becoming more a tool helping to manage poverty than to reduce it. Mr Roodman likens it to a prescription drug “useful in moderation but dangerous in large doses”.While it may not be a panacea, microfinance has given people more choice, whatever the overall risks. If Mr Hennessy-Barrett can tweak a flawed model and encourage others to follow suit, he could yet prove as successful pioneer as Mohammed Yunus.Protect yourself and your family by learning more about Global Health Security Banks and FinanceBoris Johnson refuses to deny \u0026#39staged\u0026#39 picture with Carrie Symonds was six weeks old in radio phone-in - Tory leadership latest newsComment: Make the most of Jean-Claude Juncker.

And once here in addition to tucking into fish and chips, they insist on taking photos both inside and outside the restaurant with the staff.“It is a real occasion for them and one they want to share with their friends and family when they return home.”The publicity, Mr Webster said, had turned his restaurant into a “household name” and he now hopes to crack the Chinese market at home. On the back of this I was approached by a consortium of Chinese businessmen keen to recreate Scotts in the southern Chinese city of Chengdu, he said.It will be a facsimile of what we have alongside the A64 at Bilbrough.This is an incredibly exciting prospect - one that I could never have imagined 12 months ago.Boris Johnson refuses to deny \u0026#39staged\u0026#39 picture with Carrie Symonds was six weeks old in radio phone-in - Tory leadership latest newsComment: Make the most of Jean-Claude Juncker.

She said everyone knows such photos can be hi- jacked and used to threaten and embarrass.I am sure that Whoopi meant well but it all backfired when an emotional Bella posted a video saying how upset she was at being “shamed” by the presenter and actress, — calling her actions “sick and disgusting”.I find it utterly baffling that Bella was more distressed by the words of a middle-aged woman who had her best interests at heart than the saddo who tried to embarrass her by releasing nude photos on to the internet for all the world to see.It’s a great shame this has now escalated into a row between the two women, because I truly admire Bella for how she has handled the whole potential blackmailing situation.It was a masterstroke and instantly took all the power away from the snivelling little git who was hassling her. Bella was not ashamed or embarrassed by the intimate pictures and would not be held to ransom. Good for her.But surely it was far more upsetting to be the victim of a potential crime than receiving a slight scolding from Whoopi for being naive enough to take and keep those sorts of images in the first place.Bella had a right old rant on Instagram and has vowed never again to appear on The View — a chat show co-hosted by Whoopi which is the US version of our Loose Women.I feel very sorry for Bella because she was clearly extremely upset by what Whoopi had to say but I think her anger is misplaced.Whoopi was makIng a really important point, which affects everyone, not only those in the public eye.She was speaking for worried parents of teenagers and twentysomethings everywhere who are concerned that online photos of their children getting drunk, posing nude or even having sex will come back to haunt them.It is one of the real dangers of social media that our accounts are not really secure. they can be hacked with relative ease, falling out of “the cloud” and on to your boss’s Facebook — or, even worse, getting viewed by your mum and dad.There are people who think it is a jolly wheeze to post explicit photographs of former lovers online, or who do it as “revenge” for being dumped.Of course, there are those who have no common sense and post pictures of themselves romping in hotel rooms with girlfriends or boyfriends or boozily feeling each other up on holiday.The authorities are now cracking down. Last August, a man who hacked into hundreds of iCloud accounts of Hollywood actresses and leaked their nude pictures was sentenced to eight months in prison.George Garofano stole private photographs from movie stars including actresses Jenner Lawrence and Kirsten Dunst. It was horribly distressing for these women and I completely sympathise.However, the ease with which that slimy toad was able to access personal images proves thatyou don’t want to have potentially embarrassing photos put out there, then don’t take them in the first place — or just press the delete button.Maybe even go back to the Dark Ages, invest in a Polaroid camera and keep your naughty pictures under lock and key. The hackers are vile, but let us not give them the ammunition. And take heed of the advice from wise women such as Whoopi.I SINCERELY hope the latest rumours from the troubled set of the new Bond film prove to be without foundation.It’s being claimed that the film’s director, Cary Fukunaga, held up cast and crew during a complicated shoot because he was playing video games on his PlayStation.Apparently the production crew and actors were not amused at having to hang about for three hours because Cary wanted to play with his toys. I don’t blame them.I cannot believe someone would be so inconsiderate to fellow professionals.I was, however, more aghast at finding out Cary isn’t a spotty teenage geek, but a -year-old man.Surely he should have outgrown PlayStation by now – especially when he is already in charge of the world’s best video game, involving Aston Martin car chases, shootouts, beautul women and dastardly villains.WILLIAM and Kate showed how royals should react when their lestyle causes harm to a member of the public.Widow Irene Mayor, , was hit by a police motorbike escorting the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge to Windsor Castle. She is in hospital with serious injuries.As soon as Wills and Kate found out, they sent flowers and a hand-written note and have told Irene’s family they want to visit her whenever she is ready.I HAVE never watched Love Island. So it’s odd to see images and videos of strange, orange people with impossibly white teeth, like Molly-Mae Hague on my online news feeds and splashed across magazines when I haven’t a blinking clue who they are.And it is utterly bizarre that they all look and sound exactly alike.To be honest,I really need to see fit youngsters strutting around, uttering meaningless sounds and having sex, I will tune into a David Attenborough documentary.THE Fab Five presenters on makeover show Queer Eye are making the world a better place – one scruffy, messed-up person at a time.Makeovers are hardly a new concept but this series does much more than give someone a new outfit and haircut.The hosts lovebomb shy misfits who ask for help, as well as big-hearted people who just neglect themselves – then change their lives for ever.It’s a show full of heart and soul and I blub during every episode.This week I met the British star of Queer Eye, delightful Tan France, from Doncaster. He had a hard time growing up in a world where he had no role models and he feels a huge responsibility to young gay Asian men such as himself.Tan and the Queer Eye boys feature in the video for Taylor Swt’s new single, You Need To Calm Down, with some of my favourite people including RuPaul and Ryan Reynolds.The song hits you over the head a bit with its inclusivity – no bad thing – but the Queer Eye boys do it better just by being themselves.I HAD to look twice at this gorgeous selfie posted by This Morning’s Alison Hammond.She’s glowing with confidence and happiness.After becoming the spokeswoman for a slimming club Alison has lost so much weight and looks stunning.She has talked about being “embarrassed” by weighing st. But I’m so glad she lost weight gradually with a healthy eating plan and doing exercise she loves.I wish Alison all the best with her battle towards being happier, healthier and fitter and I know she will have helped other women with their weight issues too.I BLOODY love Matt Lucas. The Little Britain star saw on Twitter that Amy Dunn was being bullied because she had lost her hair and was being derided as a “Matt Lucas lookalike”.The comedian immediately sent the -year-old a message of support telling her she was beautul and how flattered he was to be compared to her.Amy, who suffers from alopecia, has had people laughing and pointing at her in the street because she happens to have a condition that means she is bald.I hope having Matt on her side has cheered Amy up and given her the confidence to ignore the morons who hurled abuse, and maybe even feel sorry for them for being such ar**holes.Matt is right. Amy is beautul, and so is he.I’M very much liking the look of Beecham House, the new ITV drama set in th Century India that airs tomorrow night.The trails look sumptuous and now Poldark’s Aidan Turner has gone all grungy, leading man Tom Bateman is a most welcome piece of eye candy.Beecham House is on ITV tomorrow at pm.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Boris will only be our th Prime Minister since the very first, Robert Walpole, who was in office from  to .The fact that more than a third of them went to Eton , suggests that social mobility in this country is in terminal decline.Indeed, when it comes to the children of ordinary homes reaching the highest office in the land, social mobility is stone-cold dead.Fee-paying privilege provides the fast-track to power. Yet it wasn’t always this way.There was a golden age of ­meritocracy in the last century when it was normal for our PMs to be educated by the state.Eton was still a bastion of academic excellence in those happy years. So was Harrow, which has produced seven Prime Ministers, and Westminster, which educated six.But between  and , there was enough healthy social mobility in this country for Harold Wilson, Ted Heath, Jim Callaghan, Margaret Thatcher and John Major — all educated at state schools — to become Prime Minister.Major and Callaghan didn’t even go to university. Callaghan couldn’t afford it, while Major left school at  with three O-levels.All five came from modest ­backgrounds, although Wilson, Heath and Thatcher were clever enough to get into Oxford University.For more than three decades, state-educated politicians competed with those who were the product of expensive private educations — and beat them to the top job.This is not an argument against Boris Johnson becoming Prime ­Minister simply because he went to Eton. Boris seems like the man most likely to prevent a Marxist government. This would destroy our economy — a fate far worse than either staying in or leaving the European Union.SoI was a Tory MP or party member, then I would probably prefer Boris to take on Brussels, Corbyn and the Brexit Party.But yet another old Etonian in  Downing Street proves that social mobility is nowhere near what it was in the last century. Andwe care about a fair and equal society, then that should concern us all.It feels signicant that the first candidate to be eliminated from the Tory leadership race was Esther McVey — the candidate from  the least privileged background, reinforcing the belief that Westminster is a closed shop.But when it comes to getting on in le, and even getting to Downing Street, it should not matter a damn where you were born.Your ability — and your willingness to graft — should matter far more than Mummy and Daddy’s bank ­balance.Le can never be totally fair. But two Old Etonian PMs in less than ten years is grotesque.  If there is to be a bright, shining future for this country after we leave the EU, there MUST be more social mobility.Once he has sorted out Brexit  and buried Corbyn, perhaps our Old ­Etonian PM will do something about it.

So why feel guilty about watching it The appeal of this show is fairly obvious — it’s the intimate access you get.Viewers feel like they’re on holiday on on the island too, as invisible guests.The ultimate fly-on-the-wall experience.We hear the most private of conversations, witness the most explosive fallouts. We even get in the shower with them.It’s so intimate that it feels the same as when you read someone ’s diary.Of course, we are watching insanely beautul people parading around in tiny scraps of swimwear. But no matter how gorgeous the contestants, each one is revealed to be as fragile as the next.I think that is where our real fascination lies.Surely they should all be full of confidence, looking the way they do  And yet they seem to be just as insecure as the rest of us.I like the fact that the show is a portal into a generation to which I no longer belong.I’ve learned so much about how young men and women behave and, until Maura uttered the words, I didn’t even know it was possible to have “fanny flutters”.Another thing I like is the escapism. Surely it’s no coincidence that Love Island is at peak popularity during a time when the news is totally dominated with gloom, doom — and Brexit.Personally, I’m also intrigued by the fake hair and nails — and the very y process of getting ready for a night out. I’m luckyI put a comb through my hair.The amount of make-up they manage to get on to their faces is astonishing — although the irony is that the one girl all the guys seem to like, Lucie, is a surfer chick who doesn’t wear make-up.There is also a real cruelty to the show, though. There is always someone better, someone more chosen. The voting process is brutal and leaves all of the contestants anxious about whether or not people like them.This show strips people of everything that is important, other than their body. They are measured on what they look like and little .As a result, lots of people have questioned the damage caused to the mental health of the contestants.There have been more than , complaints to Ofcom about this series already.But there are good things about Love Island.While it’s not exactly the kind of equality that women have been fighting for over the past  years, there’s no denying that female members in the house are as free as the men to proposition members of the opposite sex.In my day, all we had was: “My mate fancies you.” But Maura said of one guy that he gave her “fanny flutters”.When my daughter Sophia was asked to go on the show, she thought it would be fun to be on a free holiday. You can see her point.But no mother wants to watch their child on Love Island. We all know there are plenty of things our kids do that we don’t know about — and that’s the way it should stay.But it’s not just that. One reason I enjoy being part of the Apprentice is because it celebrates young people for their skills, ambition and what they achieve.They know they aren’t being valued for their looks — they are being valued for so much more than that.That said, no one’s self- esteem should be based on how others value us.I’ve often thought that my biggest superpower is that I really don’t care what people think about me.When I’m on the beach I’m not bothered about which bits and pieces are jiggling.Why  Because there is so much more to me than what I look like in a bikini.Or, rather, as a footballer’s we once said to me: “All I’ve got is my looks — at least you’ve got your personality.”I know it was a back-handed compliment. But you know what, I’m fine with that.LOTTIE Moss said on social media that she feels “uncomfortable” with her weight at the moment – as she posted a picture of herself in a dress on a night out.My first thought was she’s going to look back at those photos when she is in her fties and wonder how she could have felt uncomfortable when she looked like this.My second was she can’t worry that much because the dress she’s wearing is almost completely see-through.BOSSES of the Isle of Wight Festival have been criticised by two mental-health charities for banning Jess Glynne for le after the singer cancelled her show at the last minute, owing to anxiety.Anxiety is a debilitating condition which blights the lives of many people.I’m sorry to hear that Jess is one of those people.But when she knows she suffers from this condition, her choice to stay out partying with the Spice Girls until am on the day she was due to perform seems, well, questionable.Having been out drinking all night before work is enough to make even the most level-headed person anxious.To then go on social media advertising that fact, before effectively phoning in sick to work, is also a tad foolish.By doing that, Glynne gave the impression she chose partying over a commitment – and that is not a good look.If we have one job to do as parents, it is to teach our kids the importance of doing the things that need to be done, when they need to be done, whether you like it or not.When I see a young person doing what they said they would do, despite challenges, I know they’ve got backbone.It’s called resilience, grit, determination, and it’s about being irrepressible. Those are some of the most admirable traits a person can have.Anxiety is awful but it’s certainly not helped by partying until the early hours of a work day.THIS week there has been good and bad news for Boris Johnson. The good news is that it looks ashe is going to be our next Prime Minister.The bad news is not that early-hours row with his partner – it’s his new haircut.He used to have “The Trump”, a sort of comb-forward that hid his balding. But his barber has cut it off and, instead of the long-haired blond bombshell look, he’s now a blond basin with thinning top.Boris, please take it from me, when you go into a hairdresser’s the first thing you do is check out the hairstyle of the person holding the scissors.Anyway, I guess it grows back – and soon will be the haystack it’s always been. Now all Boris needs is a new suit.OOPS! My heart goes out to the mum of the rampaging toddler at a Swiss art show who knocked over a sculpture of a fly worth £,.My main question, though, is how a plastic sculpture of a fly could be worth so much money Someone, somewhere, is having a laugh. Right I WAS trying to work out what was unusual about the recent photo of actor Rob Lowe on the red carpet.I realised it’s this. He is a handsome, successful star who is still with his we – Sheryl Berkoff – after  years without trading her in for a younger model.And they look happy.A rare sight in Hollywood, so good luck to both of them.TO be fair, Sofia Richie pretty much pulled it off when she sported the latest bicycle shorts onesie – the trend you prayed would never happen.But all I can say is, I’m glad I don’t follow fashion.WHAT’S in a word  You might think nothing much. And it’s a small thing in a way, but Sainsbury’s needs to be called out for assuming on its hair-removal product that all doctors are male.Its instructions say: “Consult your usual doctor and show him the packaging.”No doubt lots of people will respond by saying that us women are far too easily offended.But it is assumptions such as this behind the fact that, for every £ a man makes, a woman only makes p.We have to stamp out this unconscious bias by calling it out every time we see it.AMAZING that it’s  years since Friends hit our TVs.But judging by pictures of its stars Jenner Aniston, , and Courteney Cox, , on vacation in their bikinis, they still look fantastic.Even more amazing is that they are genuine friends.It just goes to show thatyou eat well, work out and look after yourself, you don’t have to be fat and flabby at .*Note to self – eat better and go to the gym. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

If it is appropriate for us to use it, we will use it.Dramatic footage released last November showed Scotland Yard’s Scorpion pursuit teams hitting mopeds and sending suspects sprawling over car bonnets and flying across the tarmac.However, under existing laws, cops chasing moped thugs are subject to the same legal test for careless and dangerous driving offences as members of the public.Eventhey escape prosecution, cops can be investigated for gross misconduct and sacked.Cops who face charges often have to wait years before having their names cleared.The Home Office has insisted it is “reviewing” the law to give officers greater protection but critics said they must push through new legislation as a priorityThe documentary also interviews members of moped gangs who commit crimes and vigilantes who risk their lives to hunt the yobs.Scotland Yard introduced the bold new tactic of ramming moped thieves to widespread acclaim after violent gangs wreaked havoc on the streets of Lawless London in a terrying crime epidemic.The growth of moped crime - in which some criminals have stolen up to  phones in an hour - has exploded by , per cent across the UK in the past three years.And Lawless London has seen the highest spike in moped muggings, where over , separate offences were recorded last year alone.Victims are often targeted as theyre coming out of tube stations and other transport hubs where theyre more vulnerable to attacks.Thieves snatch handbags, watches and other expensive items before making an easy getaway.Cops had been criticised due to a widespread belief that they werent allowed to pursue a suspect on a mopedthey werent wearing a helmet.But proposed changes in the law make it explicit that specially trained police drivers can chase a rider without a helmet.Forces have previously unveiled other tactics to fight moped crime, like automatic tyre deflation devices and DNA tagging spray.And the tactics appear to be working - while there were , offences of moped crime in London between January and October last year, the same period has seen , offences this year - a reduction of  per cent.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Fexofenadineis a fantastic antihistamine that is only available on prescription. In my experience is one of the most effective around.And whilst some antihistamines are marketed as non-drowsy, some iniduals are particularly sensitive, and will still find themselves experiencing some fatigue.Some lesser known side effects include a dry mouth throat, dry eyes and blurred vision.Medications that block histamine receptors help allergic conditions, but these types of medications can reduce mucous and aqueous production, which cause dry eye and mouth complaints.Adding eye drops to your regime can be really useful to help combat the itchy eyes.Nasal decongestants are often combined with anticholinergic medications which together contribute to dry eyes, dilated pupils and decreased response to bright light.The dilated pupils interfere with your ability to focus on objects and can, therefore, contribute to blurry vision.Boots pharmacist Natalie Masters said: “You may have seen reports on rising pollen counts this weekend.If you’re a hayfever sufferer, don’t panic. When there’s more pollen in the air, your symptoms may worsen, but there are lots of steps you can take to alleviate these.Prevention is key, which means avoiding coming into contact with pollen in the first place.Grassy areas are often best avoided andyou can, don’t spend time outdoors at the times when pollen counts are highest, typically the early morning and late afternoon and evening.If you need to go outside, applying a petroleum jelly balm to the inside of your nostrils or using an allergy barrier nasal spray can help prevent pollen from entering your nostrils, whilst larger wraparound sunglasses can help stop pollen from irritating your eyes.There’s also several products you can purchase which can help to alleviate your symptoms when they start flaring up.Speak to your pharmacist about anti-histamine tablets, hayfever eye drops or a suitable steroid nasal spray.If you’ve been outdoors when the pollen count is high, make sure to shower and wash your hair once you get home to wash away any stray pollen particles.Regularly vacuuming and dusting your house with a damp cloth and washing and drying your clothes indoors may also help to keep your home a pollen-free zone.Importantly, try not to be worried or stressed about your hayfever. It has been claimed that hayfever can be exacerbated by this, so try to keep calm and consider dferent products and methods – hopefully you’ll soon find what works best for you.”Boots is currently has their own brand hay fever products on offer for  for £, including Boots One-A-Day Allergy Relief mg tabletsand  Boots Hayfever Relief for Adults  micrograms dose Nasal Spray  Metered Sprays .Branded products are also on offer at two for £.Nasal Sprays are particularly helpful for the rhinitisor blocked nose symptoms, which antihistamine tablets may not always take care of. Beconase is always a good start, but mometasoneor Fluticasone based sprays such as Avamys and Dymista, can provide that next step for relief.But in some iniduals, nasal sprays can cause some localised irritation within the nostrils, and even nose bleeds.The most important thing about nasal sprays is ensuring you are using them correctly. It is worth noting that they do not work immediately, and their effects are cumulative, meaning the longer you use them, the better the response – so you’ll need patience before you see results.Prolonged use of over the counter decongestant nasal sprays can create a rebound rhinosinusitisused for too long – in essence, they can make symptoms worseused for more than  or  days.What should you do should you experience any of these symptoms Dr Fenton says thatyou experience any of these side effects, its important to discuss them with your GP.He said: There is a multitude of alternative antihistamines, spray and drops that may be more suited to you.Alternatives include using medications used for asthma, such as Montelukast, which is excellent for the runny nose component of hay fever.In addition, some well-known antacidsdespite mainly being used for acid reflux and heartburn, can actually have great antihistamine effects.When all  fails, you may consider the hay fever injection, which is a steroid-based injection. This is not to be taken lightly, as is not without risks, but it can be beneficial to those with sever hay fever.Dr Fenton added: The truth behind hay fever treatment is that it can be trial and error.You have to take the time to find the right combination of treatments for you.Speaking to your GP is useful, as they will take you through all of the options and recommend, prescribe and administer the correct hay fever medications as needed."},{"url":null,"title":"brit troops pay tribute falklands heroes final march conflict","story":"Soldiers from the rd Battalion, Parachute Regiment walked the  miles from Port San Carlos to Mount Longdon in memory of  men who died making the same journey  years before.Port San Carlos is a port on the western coast of East Falkland, while Mount Longdon is a mountain overlooking the islands capital, Stanley, on the opposite coast.Port San Carlos was used by British forces to land thousands of troops on the islands over the course of the war.The original operation was carried out in dficult weather conditions and under fire on June  .It succeeded in taking the high ground that surrounded Stanley, a crucial step towards liberating the capital and ending the conflict.The Falklands War was fought between Britain and Argentina between April  and June  .It was sparked by the invasion of the Falkland Islands, a British overseas territory off the east coast of South America, by Argentina, ruled at the time by a dictatorship.Calls for a military response were initially met with scepticism in Britain, but Margaret Thatchers decision to retake the islands, and the eventual success of the effort, led to a signicant rise in her popularity at home.The invasion met with international condemnation, with the governments of the US, France, and New Zealand offering the use of their equipment and facilities by British forces.A motion condemning the invasion proposed by the British was also passed by the UN Security Council the day after its launched.After losing the war, the military junta faced mounting opposition from the public in Argentina and was toppled the following year.  Many of its senior members are now serving prison sentences for atrocities committing during their time in power.Over the course of the ten-week campaign,  British and  Argentinian soldiers died, with  Brits and , Argentinians were wounded."},{"url":null,"title":"beecham house self loathing british empire","story":"Results were mixed.About a decade ago, though, television decided it was an evil almost beyond compare and we had to be apologetic about the British Empire, for all eternity, even during ITV’s Sunday night pm to pm slot.Latest result of this self-loathing is Beecham House, a lavish and expensive, not to mention dreadful, new ITV drama which is supposedly set in  Delhi but can be far more accurately carbon dated to the early st century period between March , when Poldark took his top off, to .pm on Christmas Day, .That was when the last ever episode of Downton Abbey finished, ITV execs panicked and suddenly thought: “Oh s***. We need another show with a big house and a strong, silent, topless gardener who gallops around searching for love, fulfilment and all that toss.”So we’ve now got this six-part series fronted by Tom Bateman, who actually made a promising start to playing soldier-turned-trader John Beecham.He got shot.I’d have run the closing titles right there and then and promised viewers: “ITV willin about , when it’s got some new ideas.”According to the caption, however, “three years later” John Beecham was back and he’d brought his extended family with him to fill the big house.They include: His dear old racist mum, played by Mrs Patmore off Downton, a motherless baby, wayward brother Daniel, some pot-stirring French git called General Castillion and two underwhelming bits of female love interest, who won’t get any bloke switching over from Love Island in a hurry. Also present is Citizen Khan himself, Adil Ray, who’s moved in next door wearing a glued-on beard that last saw serious action in Carry On Up The Khyber.So I hope no one was expecting a laugh, or a plot. Because Beecham House hasn’t really got one, apart from the baby issue and Beecham’s grovelling desire to be granted a trading licence, which both generate lots of sarky backchat from the locals, but not much .It all stands or falls then, almost entirely, on the leading character.And, oh boy, does this one ever fall.As absolutely everyone’s noticed, for the want of charisma they’ve had to dress the poor bloke up as Indiana Jones, which can’t be a lot of fun in that climate.Even with the overcoat, cowboy hat and women throwing themselves at him, John’s brother still thinks he’s “the dullest man in Delhi”.The thing that really weighs him down, though, is Empire guilt. The righteous berk can hardly look at an Indian without apologising.“Your Imperial Highness, I implore you judge me by my actions not my flag.”“I am not like my countrymen.” “Their hypocrisy sickens me.” “The East India company’s policy of expansion is shameful.” “I love your country and believe India should be ruled by Indians.”  He’s so woke he could be reading last night’s Channel  News.An approach that’s unlikely to win the show many friends, I’d have thought, or stop the more right-on viewers accusing him of having “big white saviour syndrome”.Ultimately, though, I have absolutely no real idea whether John Beecham will strike a chord with the viewers, because, like most shows broadcast in the Sunday night pm to pm slot, I am not part of the target female audience.All I’m meant to do is sit dumbly and join in the apologetic Empire chorus.I’m sorry, I’m sorry, I’m not sorry at all.TIPPING Point, Ben Shephard: “In Only Fools And Horses, who plays the character known as Del Boy ”Ben: “David Frost.”Fteen To One, Sandi Toksvig: “What is the two-word term for a flashing orange globe mounted on a striped pole, used at pedestrian crossings, named after a s minister of transport ”Kresha: “Traffic light.”And Love Island, Molly-Mae: “What is the capital of France ”PSYCHOPATH With Piers Morganrequires expectations to be managed, because it’s barely a minute old when Porky-Talkie reveals: “The prison considers Paris Bennett so dangerous they insist I interview him behind toughened glass.”Andthat’s not health-and-safety gone mad, I dunno what is, frankly.RE: Love Island. If Joe and Lucie were “Jucie” and Jordan and Anna “Jordanna”, did that make Elma and Scottish Anton “Elma Fud” NEVER a good sign when you can tell a show’s going to be a disaster just from the furniture.But that was the case with last Tuesday’s big political bun fight, on BBC, which looked more like a dating show or fire sale at Louis Walsh’s gaff than a debate to decide Our Next Prime Minister.It sounded like it as well, from the way host Emily Maitlis kicked off, barking: “Five men. One job.” A phrase I don’t think I’ve heard any presenter utter since Kerry Katona was fronting ElimiDate, back in .Long before it got to air, Maitlis and the BBC had also clearly decided Boris was the “Islamo- phobic” booby prize, because not one of the researchers saw any warning signs being given off by Abdullah, from Bristol, who’d deactivated his Twitter before appearing on the show. The prize guy, naturally, was meant to be Rory Stewart, who liberal political commentators all think would make a great Conservative Party leader, in the same way they probably think Iggy Pop would make a great lead singer of One Direction.Turned out, though, he’s a fidgeting little oddball who was political toast long before he sighed at Boris: “I’m sure, like me, you’ve been in Enniskillen sitting with sheep farmers.”So, by the end of the night, an attempted BBC stitch-up had accounted for: Rory Stewart, one anti-semite, from Bristol, some other bug-eyed Corbyn cultist demanding an early election and probably Emily Maitlis’ credibility as well.Boris, meanwhile, just ploughed on regardless.Well done, everyone.Celebrity Crystal Maze, Gemma Collins: “Just being honest, it’s an honour for you to have me.”And The Last Leg, Alex Brooker: “The problem with me swimming The Channel is I can’t swim.”Problem how ON Thursday’s Shopping With Keith Lemon, former market trader Rob Beckett claimed: “I used to sell compost and you can’t up-sell a bag of s***, can you ”Yet it never stopped him trying on All Together Now.IT’S nearly six months since that great foghorning orca, Gemma Collins, last made an exhibition of herself on television.So I suppose we were overdue Friday’s appearance on Celebrity Crystal Maze, where she rumbled round the course, like Indiana Jones’ concrete ball, alongside Carol Vorderman, Ellie Taylor, Rick Edwards and her on off boyfriend Arg.And how that pair avoided wedging themselves inside one of the show’s duct shafts will remain for ever one of the Channel  show’s great mysteries.Gemma bellowed over everyone, insulted her co-stars, threw a hissy fit inside one virtual reality game – “Nah, sorry. Stop the game” – and told host Richard Ayoade: “You must be clever ’cos I’ve got the mind of a genius and you’ve made me laugh.” She also attempted to create some sort of mystique around “The GC” tag, claiming it was nothing to do with her initials and inviting alternative suggestions from Carol, who remained diplomatically silent, evenI’d swear you could see in the thought bubble above her head  . . . “Gigantic consonant vowel consonant consonant.”THE Real Chernobyl proving the perfect accompaniment to Sky Atlantic’s show of the year.Susanna Reid’s digestive tract going into deep spasm when Geoffrey Boycott asked her out for lunch, on another unmissable Good Morning Britain.Top Gear’s Chris Harris attempting to drink a glass of water while being electric-shocked by Freddie Flintoff and Paddy McGuinness.And Alien Fun Capsule host Harry Hill responding to Stephanie Beacham name-dropping former Dynasty husband Charlton Heston: “Yeah, Charlton Heston.

Here, its author tells the true story behind the film.One April morning in , a sardine fisherman spotted the corpse of a British soldier floating in the sea off the coast of Spain — and set in motion a chain of events that would change the course of World War Two.Operation Mincemeat was one of the most successful wartime deceptions ever attempted — and certainly the strangest.It hoodwinked the Nazi espionage chiefs, sent German troops hurtling in the wrong direction and saved thousands of lives by deploying a secret agent who was dferent, in one crucial respect, from any spy before or since: He was dead.His mission was to convince the Germans that instead of attacking Sicily, the Allies would invade Greece.The taking of Sicily was key, as it helped to secure the Mediterranean and paved the way for an assault on mainland Italy.The brainchild of an eccentric RAF officer and a brilliant Jewish barrister, the hoax involved an extraordinary cast of characters.They included the inventor of James Bond, a beautul secret service secretary, a submarine captain, an angry admiral and a dead Welsh tramp.Using fraud, imagination and seduction, Churchill’s team of spies spun a web of deceit so elaborate and convincing they began to believe it themselves.The hoax started in a windowless basement beneath London’s Whitehall. It travelled from the capital to Scotland to Spain to Germany — and ended up on Hitler’s desk.Operation Mincemeat originated in the mind of Ian Fleming, the creator of Bond, who worked in naval intelligence during the war.Soon after the conflict was declared in , Fleming drew up a list of possible deception operations for his demanding boss, Admiral John Godfrey, the model for M in the spy films.Onewas to find a dead body, equip it with  papers and leave it in a place where the Germans would find it.The most obvious place was Spain, which was teeming with Nazi sympathisers. If the body and fake documents could be made to fall into the right hands, they would certainly be passed to the Germans.The plan was put into action before the invasion of Sicily in .British and US troops were massed in North Africa, preparing for the invasion of southern Europe, but the target was obvious. Churchill said: “Anyone but a fool would know it’s Sicily.”The challenge for British intelligence was how to convince Hitler that the Allies did not intend to attack Sicily — and then attack Sicily.The two architects of Operation Mincemeat were lawyer Ewen Montagu of Navy intelligenceand an RAF officer working for MI, Charles Cholmondeley.Early in , they were tipped off that the body of homeless man Glyndwr Michael had been brought into the mortuary at St Pancras in London.He had killed himself with rat poison. After consulting with Sir Bernard Spilsbury, Britain’s top forensic expert, the spies decided the Germans could be fooled into thinking he had drowned at sea.Glyndwr’s body was put in the mortuary fridge and they set about inventing a fake personality for him as Major William Martin, of the Royal Marines.They constructed  identity papers, a unorm and orders indicating he was an important courier transporting vital military documents.He would also be carrying letters from his bank manager, a receipt for an engagement ring and theatre ticket stubs.Many years later, Montagu wrote: “We talked about him until we did feel that he was an old friend. Major Martin had become a real person to us.”They also faked love letters from a non-existent fiancée named “Pam”. “Bill darling, do let me know as soon as you get fixed  can make some more plans.”In the dead man’s wallet they included a photograph of Pam, actually Jean Leslie, a young and attractive secretary in MI.The most important fake documents, in an attaché case chained to the dead man’s wrist, were marked “personal and most secret” and indicated that the Allies intended to invade Greece in the eastern Mediterranean, and Sardinia in the west.A second forged letter, from Lord Louis Mountbatten, then chief of combined operations, contained the phrase: “Let me have him [Martin] back as soon as you are finished with him. He might bring some sardines with him.”Sardines, of course, come from Sardinia. Montagu wrote: “I thought that sort of joke would appeal to the Germans.”The bluff represented a serious gamble. If the Germans realised they were being deceived, then instead of reducing troop numbers in Sicily, they would bolster them, with bloody consequences.The body would be transported to the shores of Spain by HMS Seraph, a submarine under the command of Captain Norman “Bill” Jewell.While Seraph awaited her unlikely cargo on the West Coast of Scotland, the team constructed an airtight steel canister, six feet long, in which Major Martin would lie, packed around with dry ice to slow decomposition.Meanwhile, MI confirmed a particularly active German spy was known to be operating in the Huelva region in southwestern Spain — the perfect target for the deception.On April , they dressed Glyndwr in the unorm of William Martin, defrosted his frozen feet to put on his stf army-issue boots, placed the body in the steel container labelled “optical instruments” and loaded it into the back of a van.Shortly after am on April , the Seraph surfaced off the coast of Spain and the corpse, fitted with a lejacket, was slipped gently into the sea. Captain Jewell sent a wireless message: “Mincemeat completed.”Through MI’s files and wireless messages intercepted by codebreakers at Bletchley Park in Buckinghamshire, it is possible to reconstruct in detail the progress of Operation Mincemeat, from Huelva, to Madrid, to the German High Command.After being dragged from the sea by the fisherman, Glyndwr’s body was buried in Huelva cemetery under a marble gravestone that read: “William Martin. Born th March, . Died th April, .Meanwhile, German spies had intercepted the briefcase and fake contents and sent them to Nazi High Command.Goebbels, Hitler’s propaganda chief, had his doubts, as revealed in his diary.But most of the top Nazi generals were fooled by the documents. General Jodl, head of the German Supreme Command Operations staff, declared: “You can forget about Sicily. We know it’s in Greece.”Hitler was convinced by the deception. As they picked up the messages revealing the Nazis had fallen for it, MI sent a coded message to Churchill: “Mincemeat swallowed whole.”The results were extraordinary. The First German Panzer Division of tanks was moved to Greece from France to defend against the expected landing.German minefields were laid off Greece. An entire group of torpedo boats was redeployed from Sicily to the Aegean, and two more Panzer isions were moved from Russia to Greece just as they were most needed in the battle at Kursk,  miles from Moscow.By coincidence, the assault on Sicily was spearheaded by HMS Seraph under Bill Jewell, which planted buoys to lead the invaders to the beaches.In the early hours of July , Allied troops poured into Sicily, meeting little resistance. The surprised Italian defenders swtly surrendered.For two weeks, the Germans remained convinced the main attack would come in Greece and waited for an invasion that never came.Half a century after Operation Mincemeat, the British government added a new line to the headstone in Huelva cemetery: “Glyndwr Michael, served as Major William Martin.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Resign!” were directed at the homelessness minister Heather Wheeler.In an email written before she took up the role, Wheeler described rough sleepers in her constituency as “the traditional type, old tinkers”.The words were leaked and, lo, the outrage flowed hot and predictable. The Big Issue Foundation’s chief executive raged that such language, “has no place in this day and age” and so Wheeler should stand down.A travellers’ charity called her words “racist”, adding that “Irish traveller children should not have to grow up in a society where government ministers show such contempt for their culture”.Yes, Wheeler’s language was wince-worthy, but the leap to “racism” highlights the way race is used as a shield to protect the lestyles of some gypsy, Roma and traveller people from legitimate criticism.Recognised in the Equality Act of  as ethnic minorities, a force field of cultural sensitivity surrounds them. Any discussion of their culture can be labelled racist.Recent reports have found that travellers have it worse than the rest of us: Higher infant and maternal mortality rates higher prevalence of depression higher rates of chronic illness.They are likely to die more than a decade earlier than non-travellers.The educational outcomes for their children are terrible: The lowest attainment of all ethnic groups throughout their school years.They are far more likely to be excluded, and while  per cent of white British children stay in education past , only  per cent of Irish traveller children do.Officialdom’s response to these findings has been to blame officialdom or racial discrimination.The chairwoman of the Commons Women and Equalities Committee, Maria Miller, thinks travellers have been “comprehensively failed by policymakers and public services for far too long”.Always, the blame is directed at “the system”.Always, there is the retreat into the safe language of “vulnerable” people and “marginalised communities”, because politicians are terried of asking dficult questions about why travellers are over-represented in prison, or why many of their children are failing at school.Such questions would only spark accusations of racism and discrimination.This is not to suggest that gypsies, Roma and travellers live free from prejudice.There is discrimination which is real and cruel: Allegations of holiday camp operators having traveller blacklists pubs refusing to serve traveller families children bullied in school.Yet whose interests do we servewe pretend that all of this is down to straightforward racism The usually sensible Trevor Phillips, former chairman of the Equality and Human Rights Commission, has said that for gypsies and travellers: “Great Britain is still like the Deep South for black people in the Fties.”His analogy fails because it suggests the prejudice suffered is all about ethnic heritage, unconnected to the lestyle pursued by many travellers. This is nonsense.Though politicians will not dare say it, many in this country have negative perceptions of these groups because of their experience of illegal encampments on their local playing field: The littering, disruption and what might politely be termed “antisocial behaviour”.They see a group of people refusing to live by the laws the rest of us abide by: Trespassing on land with the police seemingly powerless to stop them breaking locks with no one prepared to arrest them parking on private property and not being towed away.It’s not racism driving this anti-traveller sentiment.It is fury that one community seems to live apart from the rules that govern the rest of us.The authorities seem pitully weak when it comes to evicting these camps. Councils must assess the welfare needs of those on the site before they can get an eviction order.Public money is sprayed on legal fees before the caravans move to a dferent illegal site, where the whole thing starts again.The authorities’ methods might be motivated by a desire not to “marginalise” travellers further, but it isn’t working.We need an approach which, while reconciling travellers’ desire to live on the move, recognises the desire of the rest of us to see the rules of the land enforced fairly.Part of this approach must be to make the process of evicting illegal camps surer and swter.But it’s no use simply wielding this stick without a carrot.The complementary action must be a building programme to create more authorised traveller pitches.Critically, each could have contact points with the local authority, with education and health systems, to catch these families in the net of public services .With more information on who lives where, the authorities could keep better tabs on who is educating their children, who is paying council tax, and so on.This issue may not make the hustings in the Tory leadership campaign, but it matters to the kind of country we are.Sensitivity to dferent cultures is right, butobjectionable or illegal behaviour cannot be dealt with for fear it will look racist, we are in a very strange place indeed.Giving one group a politically correct free pass denied to others is not fair, it is discrimination.Conservatives always talk about the importance of everyone “playing by the same rules”.Here’s a chance for the next leader to show he means it.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But accounts yesterday revealed the refurbishment of the property near Windsor Castle cost £.million  in the financial year to April alone.Any work carried out since then has not been included, and the exterior has yet to be repainted — so the true cost is expected to be closer to £million.The books revealed major work was undertaken to turn five properties back to a single home.A luxury kitchen was installed, while an existing studio with a bedroom was renovated, and fireplaces, floors and staircases replaced.Meghan chose eco-friendly, toxin-free and vegan paint for the redecoration, which was reportedly overseen by designer Vicky Charles. She was responsible for the interiors of Soho Farmhouse in Oxfordshire, a hotel and members’ club popular with celebs.Revealing the royal accounts yesterday, Sir Michael Stevens, Keeper of the Privy Purse, insisted that Frogmore Cottage had been neglected and needed doing up.He said: “The property had not been the subject of work for some years and had already been earmarked for renovation.”He added: “The building was ed to a single residence and outdated infrastructure was replaced to guarantee the long-term future of the property. “Substantially all fixtures and fittings were paid for by Their Royal Highnesses.”A royal source said defective wooden ceiling beams and floor joists were replaced, while inefficient heating systems were also updated. The home also needed substantial electrical rewiring and new gas and water mains installed.The main renovation took around six months but some work is still outstanding, such as repainting the exterior and landscaping the grounds.Palace sources said that cost will not be revealed as it is “part of a five-year repainting and repair programme”.They also said there was a cap on installations such as kitchens and bathrooms, and the couple had to pay extrathey wanted a more bespoke version.Accounts for the Sovereign Grant, which funds the Queen and her household’s official expenses, show the monarchy cost the taxpayer £.million in  , or £. per person in the UK.It spent £million of that — a year-on-year rise of almost £million — thanks partly to work at Buckingham Palace.The latest revelations sparked fury among republican campaigners, who called for an inquiry into a “blatant misuse of public money”.Graham Smith, of the Republic pressure group, said: “This year’s increases are outrageous at a time of widespread spending cuts.“If even one school or hospital is facing cuts we cannot justy spending a penny on the royals.“Yet with all public services under intense financial pressure we throw £.million at a new house for Harry.”Prince Charles used the train to travel back from his Scottish home Birkhall to London on - September at a cost of £,. He also used the train - December at a cost of £, to visit Cardf, and again in February this year to visit Port Talbot.The Queen used the train just twice in the last financial year — in March this year to visit Somerset and in June last year to visit Cheshire with Meghan.THE royals’ carbon emissions almost doubled — mainly due to royal air travel.Accounts revealed their greenhouse gas output increased by  per cent  year-on-year.This was blamed on the “higher usage of chartered fixed-wing aircraft for foreign business travel” and there were “five such overseas visits in - compared to one in -”.Charles and Camilla had three big overseas tours last year, including Africa and the Caribbean, while William went to Israel and Jordan.Palace officials said the Foreign Office chose where to send royals on tour. Charles’ office said  his  overseas travel carbon footprint was only up two per cent.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

So are mirrors. Festival authorities will confiscate them should they see them. Non-biodegradable body glitter is also barred. While Glastonbury isn’t forbidding fans from getting all glammed-up, they are urging people to be using products that are biodegradable.Disposable wipes are a no-no-no.They are known to quickly break down into micro-plastics — which has been an ongoing environmental problem.While not officially banned, gazebos are highly discouraged from being brought to the event.Also banned are portable laser equipment and pens, animals other than registered guide dogs, sound systems, drums and generators.Yes, you can take alcohol onto the site.But be warnedyou take too many slabs of cans, the organisers may think you are trying to sell them on and could confiscate your stocks.Beer tents on the site are run by the Workers Beer Company and Avalon bars. These have London pub prices.You might have the best phone out there, but its useless unless it works.Charging your device is getting easier with each passing year and often your provider will be on site to help. But queues at any charging spots will be epic. So it is best to buy a couple of portable charges. Better still ration your phone juice. Arrange to meet your friends at a good meeting place. Reception is likely to be bad as well, so phoning and texting might not be effective. The weather is going to be hot with temperatures probably peaking at C. But there could be a chance of thunder and lightning, which can be dangerousyou are standing out in the open. Check out the Met Office Glastonbury weather for up-to-date forecasts. The best advice is to check out the Glastonbury Clashfinder.And try not to try and see everything because you might end up missing a lot. Go for a wander and see what you stumble on. Perhaps take in some comedy, spoken word, theatre or even circus performances.Maybe have a massage or do some chilling  in the Green Fields or going to see some jazz. You will lose your pals during Glasto, as sure as night turns to day.But the Find My Friends app allows you to find each other during the maelstrom.And should you wish not to be found you can always turn off the GPS location on the app.  Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Joy’s daughters – Kelly, Teresa and Michele – had decided to find out for themselves why their mother had picked up bruises and bed sores when she’d only been in the home a few weeks.    The answer was heartbreakingly shocking. The sentences for the feral trio – suspended jail terms and community service orders – even more so. The home in which my own grandmother-in-law spent her latter years preserved her safety and her dignity. Lots of care homes across the country have been proactive in installing cameras themselves. For too many others, however, it a dferent story, a problem scandalously still not adequately addressed.Health Secretary Matt Hancock , now back to his day job after his opportunistic bid to be Prime Minister, has been broadly supportive of CCTV. Former Tory attorney general Dominic Grieve also called last year for legislation to make it compulsory in all care homes.Health and Social Care Minister Caroline Dinenage, however, believes the decision should be left up to inidual care home providers. In other words, lots of talk but no action. It is remarkable that an outcry from animal welfare activists led to CCTV in all abattoirs last year, yet for our elderly in care no such protection exists. No longer should anxious sons, daughters, sisters and brothers have to do their own detective work to expose abusers. They need help. And the Government needs to give it to them.

Helmer was a Tory MEP from  for more than a decade, before defecting to Ukip in .He quit Ukip in April, lining up in support for Nigel Farageaposs Brexit Party. He published the tweet last night, commenting on a row between Labour MP David Lammy and Conservative writer Tim Montgomerie.   Mr Helmer wrote: Racial prejudice is wrong, and I condemn it. But David Lammy’s ranting illustrates why prejudice against black people persists.  In response, Mr Barwell tweeted: In which @RogerHelmerMEP argues that it is the fault of *black people* that racism persists Mr Lammy tweeted: Morning Roger, hope you are not justying racism against black people because you donapost like that I have the guts and the  to tell it as it is. That would be as ridiculous as assuming all white, middle-class, retired men are xenophobic and backward based on your tweets. It is, of course, not the first of Mr Helmer’s outbursts which has been met with a broadly negative response. In  he published a blog post telling renewable energy workers their jobs are “damaging the economy” and they should work in “real, value-added industries” instead of “wasteful projects that are little more than gesture politics.”     A week earlier, he tweeted a suggestion that the temperature dropping during a solar eclipse disproved climate change. In , while he was a Conservative MEP, he suggested some rape victims are partly to blame for their assault. Contrasting date-rape to “classic stranger rape” on his blog, Mr Helmer said a woman who “voluntarily undresses and gets into bed … surely shares a part of the responsibility,only for establishing expectations”. “Most right-thinking people would expect a much lighter sentence. Rape is always wrong, but not always equally culpable.” In  he said beating dumb seal cubs over the head was humane and that they deserved to die because they were guilty of eating too many fish. In , he suggested the NHS should fund ‘gay cure’ therapy, telling the Daily Mail: “One person is unhappy with their physical sex and wants to change it and we say, ‘OK you can do it’. You have a homosexual who says, ‘I’m homosexual, actually I’d rather be straight, is there a way of fixing it ’ We say to the person who wants to change from a man to a woman or vice versa, ‘Please do that on the NHS’. We say to this guy, ‘That’s wicked, you’re not allowed to think about it’. The same year he said it was OK for people to find homosexuality “distastefulnot viscerally repugnant.” He defended his prejudice, comparing it to liking dferent types of tea. He said: “Dferent people have dferent tastes, you may tell me you don’t like Earl Grey tea. “That may be a minority view but you are entitled not to like ityou don’t like it.” He has suggested gay marriage would lead to incest and polygamy. When Cardinal Keith O’Brien said gay marriage was a “grotesque subversion of a universally accepted human right,” Helmer said “I wish I’d thought of that phrase.”    In , he dismissed the existence of homophobia, saying it was “merely a propaganda device” used to “denigrate and stigmatise those holding conventional opinions.” During the  London riots, he suggested the army should “shoot looters and arsonists on sight.” And in  he claimed -year-old girls could consent to sex with pop stars. He said: “Suppose a -year-old girl is at a club with a pop star, and he says ‘how about it, dear’  and she says ‘yes please, I was hoping you’d ask’. “In most people’s book, that constitutes consent. Legally, she cannot consent, but in real terms, she can.” He announced his resignation from the European Parliament in , citing age and health as reasons - but amid allegations of misuse of public funds. The EU recovered £, of his transition allowance for former MEPs over claims he had broken the rules governing payments to party workers.

Tuesday  June: Second ballot of Tory MPs  Tory MPs file back into a stuffy room in Parliament to whittle out the least popular candidate still on the ballot. This time, anyone with  or fewer Tory MPs backing themis automatically eliminated too. Just one candidate, Dominic Raab, is eliminated.

Boris Johnson waters down policies on tax cuts, blocking Heathrow and ensuring Brexit on time. Jeremy Hunt admits social care cuts when he was Health Secretary went too far. And rival Rory Stewart bizarrely takes off his tie mid-debate. Amid the noisy debate presenter Emily Maitlis struggled to make herself heard as the five tried to shout each other down during the rowdy BBC show.     June -  June: More MP ballots Further ballots on  June and  June knock out one candidate each time until there are just two remaining. Ballot  is pm to pm on Wednesday. Rory Stewart is knocked out. Ballot  is am to noon on Thursday. Sajid Javid is knocked out. Ballot  is .pm to .pm on Thursday.

Friday  June: Boris Johnson domestic row The race explodes as police are called to the home Boris Johnson shares with girlfriend Carrie Symonds amid a domestic row. He surfaces on Saturday but refuses to answer questions about the incident. Headlines continue for days.  June -  July: Hustings by members  The Toriesapos , members spend a month deciding who will lead their party - and thus be Prime Minister. Members take part in a postal ballot, with a nationwide tour and several hustings by the candidates expected. There is no electronic voting. DATES TBC: BBC TV debates  The BBC announced plans for several debates. The final two candidates would be invited to put their cases to a studio audience in a special edition of BBC Question Time, hosted by Fiona Bruce. The same two would also be each invited to a one-on-one interview with Rottweiler interviewer Andrew Neil. Two separate shows would be broadcast, one for each candidate. However, allies of Boris Johnson appeared reluctant to take part in a wider debate before the field is knocked down to two people. Monday  July  Sky TV debate  Sky News was organising a live head-to-head debate between the final two candidates, hosted by Kay Burley. It would take place in front of a live studio audience of Conservative voters, who decide the contest. But it was postponed from June  after Boris Johnson failed to take part. Tuesday  July: ITV TV debate  Julie Etchingham is expected to host a debate ITV debate on  July. It would be a head to head between Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt and itaposs thought both have agreed in principle. An ITV spokesperson said: ITV will provide coverage across both TV and online, with ITV News’ journalists scrutinising the candidates for Conservative leader, getting answers to the questions that matter. Our plans will include both a head to head debate and interviews, as well as trusted impartial analysis across our ITV news bulletins. Further details of our plans will be announced in due course. Tuesday  July: Next Prime Minister confirmed  The next Prime Minister was expected to be announced in the week of Monday  July. Once the winner is confirmed by the Conservative Party, the process of being installed in  Downing Street would happen quickly. All it takes is for Theresa May to end her lame duck term by visiting the Queen and formally telling the Monarch she is handing in her resignation. Minutes later, her successor could be expected to be called to Buckingham Palace, where the Queen would ask him or her to form a government. What next  Cabinet reshuffle, Brexit plans - and a possible general election  The next Prime Minister can be expected to carry out a major Cabinet reshuffle after years of resignations under Theresa May. Many of those who quit in protest at her Brexit deal can be expected to make a comeback, especiallya Brexiteer ally wins power. This would be the first step towards dramatically re-shaping the UKaposs Brexit plan. Expect the next PM to seize the opportunity of August - a quiet time with MPs and the EU on holiday - to draw up new plans behind closed doors and prepare for fresh clashes with Brussels. Parliament s in the first week of September, at which point the new PM would hold their first PMQs . This would be the ideal moment to begin a legal process towards either making a drastically dferent Brexit deal or crashing out with no deal at all. The next PM makes their first address to the Conservative Party Conference on October , just  days before the Halloween deadline for leaving the EU. But thereaposs a catch. Deadlock in Parliament could force the next Prime Minister to call a general election. Or worse, they could have one thrust upon them through a vote of no confidence in HM Government. Pro-EU Tories have warned  of their MPs are willing to back a no confidence vote to stop No Deal. That would be enough to trigger a general election just weeks into the new Prime Ministeraposs term. Labour could even theoretically hold a no-confidence vote on the new PMaposs first full day in office, Thursday  July. But itaposll have to be a snap decision - asthey donapost force a vote then, itaposll have to wait until Parliamentaposs summer holiday is over in September.

It also costs £. for a ml can and is emblazoned with bright colourful designs. Experts warn the alcohol and caffeine mix mean vulnerable kids risk losing control, with those drunk on it likened to “zombies, The Sun reports. MSP Jackie Baillie said the combination creates “wired, ­wide-awake drunks” and has campaigned for a caffeine limit of mg per ml of alcohol.

She said: I knew the only way to make progress was to completely re-programme my relationship with food.  “I went back to the drawing board, did research on what constitutes a healthy meal and began meal planning in advance.”  Emma, who was born in Liverpool but moved to Melbourne, south eastern Australia when she was , adopted a ‘well-balanced plate’ approach to food. She made sure each meal was half fruit or vegetables, a quarter carbohydrate and a quarter protein. Swapping canteen lunches and secret takeaways for homemade muesli and open sandwiches, Emma soon started to see the results of her ‘clean diet.’ And now she has shed a massive six stone. Emma said: As soon as the weight started to come off it wouldn’t stop. “Within a few weeks of cutting out the junk food and sweets I found that my energy levels skyrocketed. “I made sure I was well hydrated throughout the day and could finally take the children to the park or the beach - things I’d always struggled to do before.” Emma was finally back in clothes she hadnapost been able to wear for years - and her amazing transformation didnapost go unnoticed.  She said: I went from being the invisible lady to being the centre of attention, something that hadn’t happened since my university days. People would come up to me in the street and tell me how incredible I looked, acquaintances I hadn’t seen in years. Then I met Matthias, my second husband, through work in  when he was filming a documentary in Melbourne and he came over to introduce himself before asking me out on a date. The couple quickly fell in love and married at a local register office in Melbourne after he proposed on a romantic boat trip in Prague. And Emma insists no one notices the age gap. She said: No one bats an eyelid when the husband is  years older, so why should it matterit’s the other way around. Matthias is a brilliant husband and a great stepfather, that’s all that I care about.” Now , Emma is constantly asked what the secret to her weight loss is. She said: I documented my progress on Facebook and Instagram , sharing the occasional motivational quote or weight loss technique, and it really spoke to people.By the time I’d dropped all the weight - going from st and a size  to st and a size  - people ranging from old classmates to complete strangers wanted to know how I did it. What always surprises people most is hearing that I was able to do all of this without going to the gym - it just goes to show how important your diet is. “That’s when I thought to myself, ‘You’ve got an opportunity to help people here.’” Building up an online presence, in March , Emma took the plunge and left her telecommunications job to become a full-time ‘body transformation coachapos. She said: Things have grown very organically through social media s. Most of the women have been inspired by my results, and the results the women on the course are getting. I saw a real need for a sustainable weight loss approach and that’s why my online programme delivers. Now fast approaching her th client, Emma is hoping to expand her business model and reach a wider audience. She said: I’ve been given a new lease of le at  and my only regret is that I didn’t do something about my weight sooner. “I know how easy it is to hide at the back of the crowd and pretend everything is ok, when inside you just want to cry. “To anyone out there struggling with their weight that thinks they’re a lost cause – my story is proof that it’s never too late change your le.” To follow Emmaaposs weight loss journey visit her Instagram at @emma.hamlin "},{"url":null,"title":"royal family member who racked","story":"NewsRoyal Family member who racked up highest world travel costs revealedThe overall travel budget for the Royal Family came to £.m for the year, according to the Sovereign GrantShareCommentsByTom DavidsonSenior Reporter:,  JUN NewsThe Royal Family observe a fly-past of aircraft by the Royal Air Force \"Get the biggest Royal Family stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailPrince Charles racked up the highest travel costs among the Royal Family, according to new figures on their finances.

Meteorologists and Public Health England workers have raised the heatwave threat to aposLevel apos for the West Midlands, south-east and south-west England. In all of these areas, the chance of a heatwave within the next few days is over  per cent, with the Met Office warning that conditions could be dangerous, particularly for the very young, old and those with chronic diseases. However, before the mercury soars and summer finally begins, the country faces one more day of thunderstorms.    There is a severe weather warning in place for thunderstorms in north-east, central, east, south, south-east and south-west England this morning, although the worst of the weather should be over by am. Another weather alert has been issued for north-west England and north Wales today, with heavy rain expected, although this should stop at around noon.    The warnings mean that both areas could be affected by flooding, with potential disruption to public transport and delays for drivers. However, things will pick up as the week progresses, with sweltering heat expected from Thursday onwards.  Met Office  chief meteorologist Dan Suri said: “It’s going to get hot and humid for some from Wednesday, with the highest temperatures expected across southern and western parts of the UK.  Not everywhere will see the high temperatures, however, as an easterly breeze will keep North Sea coasts much cooler. “By the time we get to Saturday, however, North Sea coasts will join much of the rest of eastern UK in seeing temperatures of  to C.” A netweather.tv spokesman added: Friday for inland south-west Britain looks the hottest spot at the moment, up to the mid s could be possible. Those at or heading to Glastonbury [Festival] could be sweltering.  Eastern counties will generally stay fresher, even cooler with a breeze off the sea Wednesday to Friday but by Saturday the winds swing around to the south-west so there will warmth for eastern Britain at the weekend as blustery showers appear in the west. Despite the rainy weather today, temperatures will be in the low s in south, south-west and south-east England and in the high teens where. Things will get sunnier tomorrow, especially in Scotland where temperatures will shoot up, although the mercury will take a slight dip for the rest of the country.  Thursday looks set to be a scorcher, with sunshine across the country and highs of C. Friday will be another sunny day, with the mercury peaking at C in some places, before climbing to a sweltering C on Saturday. Despite the heat, most of the country will only get to enjoy sunny intervals on Sunday, apart from south-east, south and south-west England and parts of Wales. The heatwave will subside on Sunday, when temperatures drop down to more reasonable levels, with highs of C in London. Met Office five day forecast: Today: Thunderstorms and torrential rain easing from eastern and some central areas, but remaining cloudy and murky with further light rain in places. Brightening up across western and southern parts, where feeling warm and humid, perhaps sparking the odd heavy shower. Tonight: Largely dry and cloudy overnight with mist and murk developing, especially near North Sea coasts. A few showers may affect the southwest later on. Warm and humid in the south. Wednesday: A few heavy showers possible in the far southwest, otherwise largely dry. Cloud slow to thin through central and eastern England, otherwise warm sunshine. Gusty winds across the far southwest. Outlook for Thursday to Saturday: Dry, increasingly sunny and very warm, perhaps hot across the west and south. Cloud persisting on some eastern coasts where markedly cooler. Potential for thunderstorms in the north on Saturday.

Parenting website BabyCentre has analysed the baby register for the past six months to find out what names mums and dads have been picking for their new arrivals. Olivia and Sophia hold on to the top two spots on the girls list, which is unchanged from . Lily is a new entry at number three, overtaking Amelia. Freya jumped up an impressive  places earning a place in the top  for the first time.    Muhammad is top of the boys list, but Oliver dropped from second place to fourth. Noah takes the runner up spot followed by George after our future king. There are also lots of popular s names popping up, including Jason, John, David, Hannah and Emma. Lorna Marsh, senior editor at BabyCentre, said: We are seeing a real rise in strong and stable names, especially those with a s twist. Whatever anyone’s thoughts on that decade’s politics, they were at least more settled.    Perhaps this is why parents of baby Michaels and Maxines are compensating for the current turmoil with solid s choices. One parent went for a very political option, naming their little one Blair Margaret. The experts have also noticed the rise of many names inspired by popular TV shows. Game of Thronesapos actors Maisie Williams, who plays Arya, and Emilia Clarke, who plays Daenerys, both clearly had an impact with both names featuring on the list. Meanwhile character names Tyrion and Theon rose in popularity and  has even seen a registration for the double character combo of Arya Cersei. Many of the contestants on ITVaposs hit reality TV show Love Island also feature, including Amber, Kem, Camilla, Kady, Cara, Nathan and Marcel.

The child was minutes from death when the dog found her whimpering nearby. “I felt my heart pounding when I saw the baby,” said the owner, a pensioner. “She was waving her little legs and arms in the air, but she was silent.    “As doctors told me later, she must have been crying for hours.” The man picked up the baby and rushed towards a police patrol he had seen earlier in the park.

Especially here, where they have an extensive menu dedicated to them categorised by flavour and even offer “cocktail experiences” for those looking to learn from their mixologists. Our waiter recommended a real fruit mocktail with lots of real crushed fruit and berries and juices to provide a thirst quenching mix without the alcohol .We relaxed into the quiet and sipped our drinks in the sun as we pondered over the vast menu options.The venue’s interior is a mix of classic wooden floors with soft leathers and muted tartans in greys and brown, combining traditional charm with modern comfort. vw, px\"  The menus are bound in heavy leather books, and there was plenty of choice.My other half ordered bruschetta to startwhich, of course, we ended up sharing. Well, I am eating for two!Who knew that three simple slices of toasted bread with oils and tomato could be so delicious  Also, both of us were pretty in awe of the little yellow tomatoes – spot the uncultured pair.I toyed with the idea of my usual steak pie-pick and even deliberated a fish dish, but in the end we both went for the same main course of chicken tikka curryand it was presented beautully.The plate held rice and naan with a small dish of mango chutney and a large dish of gorgeously bright-coloured chicken tikka.The chicken was wonderfully soft and the tikka sauce was full of flavour, not too salty with just a bit of zing. vw, px\"  I’m notoriously soft when it comes to anything spicy, but this was just enough for me and I only needed water for my tingly lips towards the end of finishing the plateful.We were both equally surprised at the portion size from the Caird. Although it felt upmarket, there was no scrimping on the food.I chose the brownie for dessert and my partner the sticky toffee pudding . Again, both platefuls looked almost too good to eat.My dark chocolate brownie was topped with drizzled caramel sauce next to a scoop of vanilla ice cream with sprinkles of crushed chocolate and chocolate sauce. Strawberries and homemade fudge was presented to the side in a design with shards of wafer and small dollops of salted caramel and strawberry mousse. It sounds like a lot of flavours and it was, but in a good way.My partner’s slab of sticky toffee pudding was also teamed with a large scoop of ice cream, crushed chocolate, a large wafer and a couple of raspberries, sprinkled with icing sugar.We both finished the lot.The whole evening was lovely and relaxing.

An implementation plan was produced in December  to cover the years -. Who in Argyll and Bute is responsible for this plan  How many of the outcomes have been achieved As someone who has been involved with autism personally and professionally for many years, I find it extremely disappointing there seems to be an inability by those in authority to get organised enough to address the issues and provide services for autistic people and their families.There is no need for further drafts and consultations.Someone in the authority needs to take responsibility for the existing strategy and implementation plan and get on with it.Maureen Mackintosh, Ardrishaig.Sir,Scotland’s small building firms had a strong start to , in contrast to the UK construction small and medium sized enterprisesector, according to the Federation of Master BuildersScotland.The FMB State of Trade Survey for the first quarter of , the only quarterly assessment of the UK-wide SME construction sector, showed SME workloads declined for the first time in six years.In Scotland, however, there was a jump of  per cent compared with the previous quarter. Thirty per cent of weighted responses were positive, up from  per cent from the fourth quarter of .It is encouraging the Scottish construction industry is bucking the wider Brexit trend with workloads and enquires in rude health. The UK-wide picture is very dferent, with the construction SME sector overall contracting for the first time in six years.Scotland’s good fortune could be due to fewer EU workers being based north of the border compared with other parts of the country, like in London where one in three construction workers are from the EU.Relying less heavily on migrant workers has meant the Scottish construction industry hasn’t fallen foul of thousands of EU workers ing home during the long march to Brexit due to no longer feeling welcome in the UK or sure of their future here.Scotland’s builders, however, must not be complacent. Looking ahead, the First Minister has indicated thatthe UK does leave the EU later this year, she wants a second independence referendum before the next Scottish Parliament election in . This additional political uncertainty, on top of the continued uncertainty stemming from Brexit, could impact on the construction sector in Scotland.The fear is a looming second referendum could test consumer confidence this year and next. For construction SMEs, this is particularly concerning as their prospects are vulnerable to dips in consumer confidence as so much work comes from the private domestic sector.Gordon Nelson, Director of FMB Scotland.Sir,I was joined by my fellow Conservative councillors in Kilmory recently as we discussed atthe numerous challenges facing Argyll and Bute.Ferry sailings, roads, education and the SNP#s late single farm payments were all mentioned.With the SNP hammering local authority spending and cutting our budgets, challenges in delivering services will become more prevalent.Despite this climate of cuts from the separatists, Conservative councillors are delivering for Argyll.

There will also be opportunities for farming and we must ensure that we make the most of these opportunities to build a forward-looking, progressive and resilient sector that benefits farmers and consumers throughout the UK.We would like to invite all UK MEPs on to farms in their local areas to discuss a range of priority issues and to answer any questions that they might have.

Design fleets comprising the Sigma s, Sonatas, Etchells and Hunter s joined the racing at Tarbert.Amid a flurry of rib activity laying and moving marks, it was not long before the CYCA  passage race fleet approached the finish line.The teams later caught up in the bar for the day one prize giving as new event chairman Glenn Porter welcomed everyone to Tarbert. With a number of races omitted due to protests, it was a nice easy start for Glenn.The Hunter s and Sonatas saw a spread of results after some close racing. The CYCA class  fleet on the Largs passage race was won on corrected time by Celtic Spirit. Additional prizes were awarded to Encore for the passage race line honours and Shona of Ashton for toughing it out at the rear of the passage race.Saturday was a much more challenging day on the water with a light wind and dreich drizzle. The race committee nonetheless got two races in for a number of the fleets.Protests concluded, Saturday’s prize giving announced the remaining results from Friday. This showed #s winner and RC Makars Mash class yacht Storm looking strong with a first place.Chimaera showed early signs of being a threat to the Scottish Series crown, taking a first in Friday racing. With no immediate showing of a dominant yacht in the IRC Class  fleet from Friday’s races, it was IRC class four that showed a brewing battle between Lady Ex and F’n Gr. In the CYCA Class  fleet, First by Farr surfaced with the highest number of race wins from Friday.Not to be outdone, CYCA Class  saw the final results dominated by Cool Bandit  before Saturday#s results were announced. With the weather mixing up the league table for Saturday, there were a lot of yachts taking home prizes.Saturday evening saw theof Big Vern and The Shootahs to the Scottish Series for another year and a spectacular fireworks display in celebration of Valhalla of Ashton’s th year on the water.Sunday saw yet another big weather sht with forecasts up to  knots. Loch Fyne likes to mix it up a bit so the fleets ventured out into more sedate conditions than those forecast. But as the weather built, race officers shortened the traditional round Inchmarnock passage race.Sunday prizes featured an additional prize for the best performer in each fleet. Glenn Porter started proceedings with a special award for #assisting mark layers# to the competitor who got tangled up in one of the race marks. In IRC Class  it was El Gran Senor and Forty Licks shining through. The Makars Mash RC class saw Hijacker leading the prize haul. In IRC Class it was Mata taking the #extra# prize. IRC class four saw F’n Gr take a clean sweep of firsts in both races. With only one race in CYCA  and , it was Reflection and Salamander XXII taking home the wins. In the Etchells One,  Design Hero took a win in both races with Squawk leading the way in the Sigma  One Design Class. In the Hunter  fleet Miss Moneypenny was the only yacht placed in both races taking home the best performer of the day for the s.

These should ensure everyone receives #joined up# care, that they are asked how they are feeling as part of every diabetes appointment and that a mental health professional with knowledge of diabetes is part of every diabetes care team.To sign our petition, go to diabetes.org.uk missingAngela Mitchell, National Director of Diabetes Scotland.Sir,I#m asking residents in the Highlands and Islands to give their views on Conservative proposals for tackling serious crime.In order to provide Scotland with an alternative to Nicola Sturgeon and the SNP in , we are keen to gain feedback from as many people to our policy proposals to make them as relevant as possible to the needs and aspirations of everyone in Scotland.Too many people in Scotland are affected by the behaviour of serious criminals. This needs to be properly addressed and my colleague Liam Kerr MSP, shadow Justice Secretary, has outlined key policy proposals in a member#s bill in the Scottish Parliament to tackle this scourge.It would give Scottish judges the power to impose whole le sentences to those convicted of the most serious violent and sexual crimes including the murder of a police officer.The courts would still have discretion to impose the appropriate sentence based on all the facts of each case, as they do in England and Wales where such a provision already exists.The proposed Whole Le CustodyBill will not mean the perpetrators of a particular crime will always receive a whole le sentence, but rather that the courts will have the power to impose one where there is sufficient justication.We have started the consultation and experts and members of the public are invited to register their views.Email me at donald.cameron.msp@parliament.scot or write to me at Donald Cameron MSP,  George Street, Oban, PA NT, with your views.MSP Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands.Sir,The SNP has warned Scotland’s NHS is under threat from a Tory-Trump trade deal that could leave the Scottish Government without a veto over a post-Brexit deal that sells Scotland out.This stark warning follows the revelations from Donald Trump that in terms of trade deals, everything, including the NHS, would be on the table.At Prime Ministers Questions, SNP Deputy Westminster Leader Kirsty Blackman MP said Donald Trump and the Tories could not be trusted on the NHS and criticised the UK government for plotting to take powers away from the Scottish Parliament that would allow it to safeguard Scotland’s NHS.The threats to Scotland#s NHS are growing under the prospect of a hard-right Tory-Trump Brexit trade deal. Those threats could undermine the integrity and independence of our Scottish NHS.The UK Tories will block any potential veto by the Scottish Government over such a damaging deal.The SNP government will fight to the end to defend Scotland#s public services from this unprecedented Tory Brexit danger. Our NHS must remain in public hands. It is not, and should never be, up for sale.Scotland has been completely ignored throughout the Brexit process and Tory plans to grab powers from the Scottish Parliament will leave us even more exposed.It is clearer than ever that the only way to properly protect Scotland#s interests, and keep our NHS in public hands, is with the full powers of independence.MP Brendan O#Hara, Argyll and Bute."},{"url":null,"title":"monsters and magic come to lochgilphead booksigning","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowLochgilphead#s Argyll Book Centre is holding a book signing with Lari Don.The Secret of the Kelpie author will be in the indie book shop on Saturday June  to read her new book to eager ears and talk to readers about their favourite folk tales and inventing monsters.After a quick break, Lari willto read excerpts from her spellbinding Spellchasers trilogy to inspire you to imagine magical adventures of your own and tell one of your favourite myths.Born in Chile, Lari Don was brought up in Scotland where she has worked in politics and for the BBC.

regions first Premier Inn.And now that developers have dropped controversial proposals to include a new supermarket, the plans are being given the thumbs up from David Parker.Mr Parker, who represents Leaderdale and Melrose at the local authority, told us: \"I am pleased that Newland Assets have listened carefully to the representations they have received concerning the Borders Gateway proposals.\"A Class  food retail store was very much against local and national planning policy for the site in Tweedbank as it introduced out of town shopping but the developer has listened carefully to ious concerns on this issue and removed it.ldquoThe new proposals have taken on board many observations made so far during the planning process and the revised plans are better in terms of design, road layout and visual impact.\"I am very excited about the economic impact this development could have on the wider Borders economy.ldquoSecuring a Premier Inn for the Scottish Borders will help put our region firmly on the tourism map and the economic impact of Premier Inn and the potential for other investors to follow them, is something which must be grasped.ldquoThe revised Borders Gateway proposals will complement the work taking place to develop the Tweedbank Innovation Park and will sit comfortably alongside the public and private sector projects which are underway at Tweedbank at present.\"The pound million Borders Gateway development also includes a BP filling station, a Costa drive-thru coffee shop, and a MS kiosk.And it is expected that the new outlets will create up to  jobs.Although the wider vision of the development had been welcomed, the supermarket part of the plans had come in for criticism.And Newland Assets revised their plans to omit the supermarket earlier this year.Councillor Parker added: ldquoBorders Gateway has the overwhelming support of the public and many businesses in the area and now that the food retail plans have been dropped there is no reason why these proposals should not be fully endorsed by the planners and backed by Scottish Borders Council.\"The economic advantages of this proposal signicantly outweigh the very small number of policy considerations which are left.ldquoAlthough it was right for the planners to raise concerns about the previous proposal, now that the developer has listened carefully to all the objections and amended the plans accordingly to deal with them, the Borders public simply wonrsquot understand why the council isnrsquot backing this ambitious inward investment opportunity.\"It will help bring new jobs and secure existing jobs and undoubtedly lead to a tourism boost in the Scottish Borders.ldquoI look forward to this development receiving approval and work commencing on

These beaches are essentially accessible from the central belt of Scotland, in fact from all over Britain when one considers the air service, and the weather records show that there is plenty of sunshine and the water is warm compared to the waters off the east coast of England, for example.#In fact, I#ve been told that Kintyre topped the sunshine league in Britain last year.#The water is so warm, comparatively speaking, that the sport could become an all-year-round activity in this area. In the winter one would have to wear a wetsuit, of course, but the conditions are ideal and the wave forms have great potential # after all, they are coming straight in from the Atlantic over the north of Ireland.#What I#d like to see is a surf club established in Campbeltown. It could become a great asset from a tourist and amenity point of view.#And any Kintyre people who really took up the sport would have a great advantage over other surfers when it comes to competition because they have the benefit of readily available beaches all year round.#If this club gets going, the chances are that the British surf champions in the years to come will be Kintyre people.#ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOOrr Ewing CupFootballers were favoured with beautul weather last Saturday and the games played on Kinloch Park in the Orr Ewing Cup competition brought together very large gatherings of spectators.The match in the afternoon was brought to a sudden termination by an unfortunate dispute over the award of a goal. The opposing teams were Kintyre and HMS Thames.Kintyre opened strongly and after  minutes# play had scored twice. The dispute arose over the award of the second goal, which Thames claimed to be offside.The referee, Mr Duncan McCallum, an old Hearts player, was of a dferent opinion, and on his allowing Kintyre the goal, the naval team without more do walked off the field.It is understood that the Thames team intimated to the league at the weekly meeting on Monday night their withdrawal from the competition.The teams were: Kintyre # Jas McKinlay: James Black and Archd Sharp: M Muir, A McCrank and T Cameron: R McGeachy and D Brown: Dan McNaughton: N Scally and J Donaldson.HMS Thames # Meese: Jesseman and Love: McCloud, Hirst and Fernie: Dunnell and Weekes: McGeachy: Slynn and Segrott.Referee # Mr D McCallum.In the evening, the opposing teams were Campbeltown and Kilbrannan. A week previously Kilbrannan had inflicted a - win over a naval team: against Campbeltown on Saturday they found the tables turned on themselves, and with the same score repeated they had to suffer the chagrin of a five-goal margin.It was hard game, but high scoring seldom adds to the vim or interest of any match and so it was here.Campbeltown from the kick-off may be fairly said to have had the measure of their opponents, but while they were the better , on play there was nothing like a - goal margin between the teams.Campbeltown owed their comfortable lead mainly to the masterly play of their centre forward, Archd O#May. This young footballer was home on furlough from the Rhine Army, and his display was undoubtedly the feature of the game. He is a fearless player with a rare turn of speed and a most deadly shot.At least three of six goals came from his foot, and were beautully taken, while he was the means of a fourth which he gave the right wing the honour of finishing.Kilbrannan#s solitary goal was well taken by Brown after a clever break through and an inidual run.Kilbrannan has material for the making of a team that should get much better results than they have so far achieved.The players are keen and inidually have a lot of football in them, but an almost entire absence of method both in attack and defence spoils their chances.The teams were: Campbeltown # A McCallum: G Quigley and Chas McKinven: D Kelly, J McDonald and John Martin: Chas Black and Arch Black: Arch O#May: W McKillop and James Martin.Kilbrannan # John McIntyre: D Bannatyne and Wm Gilchrist: J Short, N McKenzie and James Boyce: D Gilchrist and M Brodie: C Kelly: D Mathieson and J Brown.Referee # Mr W Mustarde."},{"url":null,"title":"thought for the week june 7 2019","story":"As I retreat into the comfort of a warm house and an even warmer coffee, I wonder what it must have been like for Columba and his fellow monks as they made their way from the shores of Ireland to the wilds of Argyll.The fragile shell of a coracle was not the most effective shelter against the wildness of our coastline.Yet they came.

There are several factors influencing this, but the major factor which has tipped the balance is the extended funding hours and the negative impact this is having both financially on small businesses, like Mary Poppins, and to the quality of early learning and childcare.New Scottish Government policy instructs councils to increase their funded childcare hours from  to , by . This move also includes longer opening hours and a move from term time to year-round opening hours to attempt to make childcare more nationally accessible.Ms Dewar said: ldquoThe money received for funded places does not cover the costs of providing the quality of early learning and childcare which we want and are required to provide, especially with regards to staff costs.ldquoThe timescales and measures that the Scottish Government has put in place to educate a workforce to meet the increased requirements are insufficient, and there is a serious shortfall to meet the requirements of the extended funding.ldquoEast Lothian Council indicated it estimated it would require approximately  staff to facilitate the increase in funded hours in East Lothian. The majority of these posts are early learning and childcare practitioners.ldquoThe local authority advertises early learning practitioner posts at between pound. and pound. per hour. Private nurseries are unable to compete with these rates of pay due to the funding rates we are allocated.A group of parents and staff, including Ms Dewar, are visiting county MSP Iain Gray to discuss the problems, but Ms Dewar added that unless he can ldquowork a miracle and change the policy, then it is unlikely the decision to close the nursery will be reversed.When asked about the nursery, Mr Gray said: ldquoThe loss of any nursery provision is disappointing, particularly with the Governmentrsquos , funded hours policy set to be implemented next year.ldquoIn the case of the Mary Poppins Nursery, the owner has highlighted a number of factors that have contributed to their decision to close.ldquoI have written to East Lothian Council about some of these issues.ldquoHowever, there are also wider issues at play here. The nursery sector has been warning the Scottish Government that private nurseries are struggling in the run-up to the roll-out of its flagship , policy from August .ldquoMinisters must act quickly to address the sectorrsquos concerns and ensure that the capacity exists to deliver the funded hours next year.A Scottish Government spokesperson said: ldquoIt is, of course, concerning to hear of any nursery considering closure, and the obvious effects this might have on staff, parents and children.ldquoEast Lothian Council has provided assurance that they will support families to find alternative early learning and childcare places for children who had been expecting to use the Mary Poppins Nursery from this August.Ms Dewar added: ldquoI am distraught that circumstances have forced me to this decision and that such a wonderful place for children to experience their early years is to close.The decision was met with an outpouring of grief on social media.The nurseryrsquos recent th birthday was marked with a garden party.The nursery was founded by Sue Armstrong, affectionately still called lsquoMiss Suersquo, after she had written to Mary Poppins author P L Travers to askshe could use the name.Miss Sue said: ldquoI received many letters from P L Travers about the nursery.ldquoAt the beginning, she wanted to know what the nursery was going to be like. She had no objection to me using the name, she just wanted to find out more. I ended up meeting her as well.ldquoWe were hoping to get her to come and open the nursery  years ago, but her arthritis was bad. We stayed in touch, however. I would send her letters about how the nursery was getting on along with photos, and she would write back saying how she liked it, and ideas of what to do.ldquoShe said that the children should be encouraged to make up their own stories. lsquoChildren like doing that,rsquo she said.Miss Sue sold the nursery to Ms Dewar in  as she was ldquosick of all the paperwork.She said. ldquoWhen I heard it was to close down, well, itrsquos just all so sad really. Itrsquos such a terrible shame.ldquoIt is such a nice and happy place for the children, homely and warm. Itrsquos just awful that it canrsquot stay open.Miss Sue still attends events at the nursery, dressed as the iconic nanny Mary Poppins.She added: ldquoIn the film, Mary Poppins says that shersquoll stay until the winds change. Well, maybe this is the wind changing for Mary Poppins Nursery.Ward councillor Craig Hoy said: ldquoThe closure of the Mary Poppins Nursery is deeply regrettable but reflects the real pressures the independent sector is experiencing as a result of the SNPrsquos , hours policy.\"The Government faces huge problems to provide the free childcare it has promised. In many areas the level of nursery provision simply isnrsquot there and independent nurseries are already struggling financially with the planned

Five minutes in a car can cover a distance which would represent a fairly long walk.Itrsquos kind of a simple principle, I know, but one I sometimes forget, as I did a couple of weekends ago. We set off from an event at Amisfield Walled Garden for a walk. My idea was to walk along the River Tyne to Hailes Castle and thenndash by car a -minute round trip.We had some supplies in the form of fruit in my bag and a little water. It was a sunny and warm day and so we set off on our adventure.We began the walk at the old Abbey Bridge which spans the Tyne close to Amisfield. As you walk under its ancient ribbed arches of this late medieval bridge, you get a real sense of its age and the beauty of its construction.The path beyond follows the river and it is almost impossible now to imagine that a great abbey once stood here, with connections to the infant Mary Queen of Scots. A ruined old mill of later centuries still stands here. I reflected on the stories of this location: a courageous nun who defied a flood in the th century and a gruesome murder in the th century and just visible in the near distance the old graveyard, now ringed with trees and almost unrecognisable as a resting place for the dead.A labourer once thought he saw a ghost at the graveyard, but it proved to be something , and I had a wry smile at that tale of a drunken evening over  years ago. These are all tales I have already told here, but they entered my head as we wandered to the gate that led along the northern bank of the river.Hailes Castle is on the southern bank of the river and I knew that there was a bridge that would takes us over. So we set off to find the bridge.But it took us over four hours.It was a stunning walk, with wild flowers and trees decorating the riverbank almost all the way. A grey heron seemed to follow us perhaps he was warning us that the walk was longer than Irsquod anticipated.It is a walk decorated with history too, of course. A stone in the corner of the field by the first gate caught my eye. Deeply ingrained groove marks on it intrigued me. I was later told that it could be the marks of a plough, as the tips of the plough have scraped over the stone a ploughman unwittingly leaving evidence of his unrecorded toil.Halfway along the walk we arrived at the small hamlet of Sandyrsquos Mill. The cottages and mill itself have been beautully restored. The th-century mill still has its waterwheel, although itrsquos now embedded in silt. The mill ceased working  years ago and was transformed into a residential property, but with much of the old machinery inside still intact. It appears to be a very sympathetic and sensitive restoration.It was beyond Sandyrsquos Mill that the distance began to take its toll. The young kids were tired and desperately looking for the bridge. I spotted Traprain Law some distance away and realised that I had badly misjudged the distance and time it would take with wee ones. We had to sit and have a rest and story, with that grey heron listening, to gather the energy to continue.The kids didnrsquot complain much as we wandered along the still-beautul path, now desperately looking for the bridge. As we had rested wersquod phoned for friends to come and lsquorescuersquo us at Hailes Castle with chocolate and water, and we knew they were there waiting for us.Irsquove never been quite so pleased to see Hailes Castle. It loomed suddenly from across the river. I had never approached it from this direction and it certainly did its best to impress. The bridge was just a wee way further and we finally crossed it with a sense of relief.When we arrived at the castle, the kids devoured the chocolate and water, in a way that reminded me of a scene in the movie Ice Cold in Alex. Thank goodness for good friends.Wersquod made it and what a sense of adventure ndash and an achievement!I sat with the kids and told stories as my we went with the friends to retrieve our car. Hailes Castle drips with history but they wanted tales about giants.The day was a lesson for me: to think more carefully about distance when setting on a walk! I thoroughly recommend the path, especially on a lovely summerrsquos day. But itrsquos going to take half a dayyou have kids. So prepare for that!Unbelievably, the kids later wanted to go to a playpark. ldquoWhere do they get the energy  my we asked.ldquoFrom us! I replied!"},{"url":null,"title":"hopes-of-seeing-railway-station-return-to-haddington","story":"RAGESmet with Peter Brett Associates ndash a leading consultancy of engineers and planners ndash to outline the case for improved transports links to and from East Lothian.One of the more ambitious plans was to see theof a railway station to Haddington.Residents of the town have not been served by a railway station since , with the station closing to freight nearly  years later.However, RAGES feels there could still be a possibility of a station ing to the town ndash though the group acknowledged that work needed to be done.A spokesman for the group said: ldquoRAGES expressed its preference for re-opening of the Haddington branch, ideally to the previous terminus on Station Road.ldquoMinimal compulsory purchase relocation of existing industrial units would be required the biggest physical obstacle would be the reconstruction of the A overbridge which was unwisely built without preserving the railway alignment and loading gauge.ldquoA level crossing would be required at Gateside, failing which an alternative road access could be provided for the new houses on the north side of the line onto the A.There was also a suggestion of creating car parking and even a park and ride facility in the town to serve the new service, which would link the town with Edinburgh.The spokesman added: ldquoAs insufficient parking exists at Station Road , a park and ride station at Oak Tree would be essential, which could also serve the substantial Letham Mains and Gateside developments.ldquoJust east of where the A crosses the railway formation, there is a large rectangular piece of ground, occupied only by scrub, which would be suitable as a car park.ldquoAs only single track would suffice between Longniddry and Haddington, it would be possible to retain a footpath cycleway as the line was originally provided with double track throughout.ldquoAn electric train service from Haddington to Edinburgh would provide the speed and capacity which road transport ndash car or bus ndash cannot match. Frequency should be half-hourly.Councillor Tom Trotter, who represents Haddington, backed the station bid.He said: ldquoIt is a good idea, especially with the town expanding as it is.ldquoIt would be a tremendous asset to have.However, the councillor felt it was more likely the station would have to find a new site, such as Alderston, to the north of the town.He added: ldquoIn the short-term it is unrealistic, but hopefully in the longer term things can be put in place to make it a realistic possibility.ldquoIt is a great idea and Irsquom sure it would get support from all the local ward councillors, but where it would go and how much it would cost are questions."},{"url":null,"title":"preview-prestonpans-gala-2019","story":"This year is the th anniversary of Prestonpans Childrenrsquos Gala.On gala day itself, the festivities kick off with the crowning ceremony at am at Prestonpans Community Centre.There is then a fancy-dress competition at Middleshot Square at noon before the parade heads off through the town.From Middleshot Square, it heads along Hawthorn Road and down West Loan to the war memorial, then along High Street before turning up Redburn Road, then along North Grange Avenue, where it ends at Mary Murray Park, behind the community centre.The park hosts the gala dayrsquos family fun, which includes a funfair with a host of rides, as well as old favourites such as hook the duck.There is also a vintage fire engine on display, as well as an American police car, motorbike displays, ponies, birds of prey, beat the goalie, Zorbs, safe archery, NERF guns, crazy golf, a tombola and a gala raffle, not to mention ice cream vans, tea and coffee, Mr Donut Man, crepes, waffles, hot dogs, nachos, a burger van, La Favorita pizzas, stalls selling gts, sweets and cake.Gala day marks the beginning, not the end of Prestonpansrsquo week of fun and activities.Events are as follows:Saturday, June Monday, June Tuesday, June Wednesday, June Thursday, June Friday, June "},{"url":null,"title":"bid-to-turn-former-rbs-in-north-berwick-into-a-house","story":"The townrsquos Royal Bank of Scotlandclosed in June last year.

A credible alternative to a regular PC, but at a tenth the cost,\" he said.ldquoThe vision behind Raspberry Pi  is to make a rich multimedia PC experience accessible to everyone. By offering a level of performance suitable for most users wersquove been able to do this at roughly a tenth of the cost of a traditional desktop PC.Mr Upton said there would still be some people - such as ldquohard-core gamers - for whom the Raspberry Pi would not be an acceptable replacement.But he added: ldquoFor the things most people want to do such as editing documents, searching the web or watching a few videos this will be perfectly fine.The development was welcomed by Dr Jeremy Singer, a senior lecturer in computing science at Glasgow University.He has already used previous versions of the Raspberry Pi for a host of applications at the university - including putting them into ceiling tiles to monitor light levels, background noise levels, Co levels, temperature and humidity as part of a wider efficiency drive.ldquoWhen it first came out the Raspberry Pi was very much geared towards teaching pupils about coding and hands on computing, but now it has become much more powerful and people are using it for all kinds of dferent things, he said.ldquoThis upgrade is increasing the computational power of the kit so it will be as powerful,not more powerful, than your mobile phone.

Even customers buying it as a ready made kit still have to assemble it themselves.He said: ldquoThat is a deliberate and interesting move because it shows computers are not just black boxes, but have dferent components that are brought together.ldquoWe need people to understand that computers are not magic and not something to be apprehensive about and this is something that people can play with and use without being scared of breaking it.Mr Upton created the Raspberry Pi in  while at Cambridge University, originally as an inexpensive tool to teach children how to code.Over the last  years more than  million units have been sold to a wide iety of users including computer enthusiasts, academics and businesses, often to monitor environmental factors such as temperature or to control cameras.The company currently sells six million devices a year, giving it just over two per cent of the global PC market."},{"url":null,"title":"pensions-agency-needs-23m-after-bungling-it-plan","story":"The Scottish Public Pensions Agency , which runs the retirement schemes of teachers, NHS staff and emergency workers, spent pound.m on integrating IT systems without a clear business case, after accepting an ldquoabnormally low bid with an ldquounrealistic time scale.Contractor Capita then failed to hit any project milestones and the plan had to be scrapped, and the SPPA now needs poundm of public money to get back on track.Auditor General Caroline Gardner said Capitarsquos inability to hit its targets was ldquothe main contributor to the failure, but also blamed the SPPA for not setting objectives for the project, failing to scrutinise it, and a debilitating churn in its leadership.The Scottish Tories said it was ldquoyet another botched IT contract on the SNPrsquos watch, while Labour accused ministers of letting the SPPA get away with ldquoextreme negligence.The SPPArsquos problems go back to a  plan to integrate its pension administration and payment systems to achieve efficiencies and meet new pension rules.However there was ldquono evidence of a clear business case to justy the route taken, ldquonor evidence that it had fully considered other options.Because Capitarsquos tender price was so cheap, it was officially classed as ldquoabnormally low and the SPPA had to checkit was a ldquovalid bid.The SPPA warned the Scottish Governmentrsquos Legal Department that it didnrsquot have the skills to interrogate the tender deeply, but the SPPA then ldquotook no further action and accepted Capitarsquos reassurances.A rival bidder even issued, then withdrew, a legal challenge to the SPPA decision as the bid was so low.The SPPA awarded Capita the contract in October , with the project due by March .Despite the -month target, the SPPA chose not to extend its existing systems in case of delay, which auditors called ldquoa high-risk approach with an unrealistic timetable.By May , Capita was warning it would miss its first milestone, with further failures forcing the SPPA to extend the le of systems at an unplanned cost of poundm.By late , the project was two-and-half years behind schedule, and in January , amid growing concerns, the SPPArsquos chief executive pulled the plug.Of the pound.m spent on the project, pound.m went to Capita, with the rest spent on extending existing contracts, staff costs, software licences and specialist help.Although it recovered pound.m from Capita after a financial settlement last November, the SPPA has written off pound.m in assets it will never use.It now estimates it needs pound.m capital and pound.m revenue funding from the Government over the next five years to modernise its IT systems properly.Ms Gardner said: ldquoThe public sector is under pressure and we are seeing more instances of bodies embarking on IT projects without the necessary staff and assurance arrangements in place to manage them properly.ldquoIn this instance, I found no evidence of a clear business case for a new integrated system, which was pursued at a time when the SPPA was going through signicant change.ldquoThe result was a project that failed to provide value for money and has considerably set back the SPPArsquos planning.Tory MSP Bill Bowman said: ldquoThe Nationalists should have learned lessons from similar failings with farming payments, NHS  or even Police Scotland.

The message our members have sent could not be any clearer or any louder.“Let’s hope this second strong mandate shows Aberdeen Airport management that they need to come back around the table with an offer Unite can support so that we can find a remedy to this dispute.\"Unite’s members have democratically voted to continue strike action and this action will continue unless they receive a signicantly better offer.\"We will wait to hear from airport management on whether they wish to get back round the negotiating table or whether they are more interested in needlessly escalating this dispute.”data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.buchanobserver webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Ellon Household Recycling Centre\"  Rigid plastic recycling trial to beginviewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\" data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.buchanobserver webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Police Scotland\"  Teens charged following incident at Peterhead Academy viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BUCH | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BUCH | Article Teaser\""},{"url":null,"title":"hotel welcomes chef ahead of renovation","story":"A Newmachar hotel has appointed a prestigious new head chef as it prepares for a major renovation.Graham Mitchell, who has worked at top class venues including Aberdeen’s Moonfish Café, The Chester Hotel and Trump International has joined the Newmachar Hotel to prepare for a transformation of the popular bar and restaurant.Linda and Grant Wright, who have owned the hotel for over  years, are about renovate the eating areas of the hotel with the introduction of ‘The Scullery’.Graham is one of nine members of the Scottish Culinary team and will be taking part in the Culinary Olympics in February in Stuttgart, Germany, where  national teams will compete to win the coveted Olympic Champion title.The Newmachar Hotel recently won a host of awards at the North East of Scotland Hospitality Training Awards, including Graham being named best Scotch Beef Chef of the Year, runner-up Seafood Chef of the Year and the hotel was named winner for Bar Food Restaurant as well as Best Afternoon Tea Venue.”Graham joined the Newmachar Hotel in March, and he is looking forward to the renovations which are due later this year.

This year local Scottish Fire and Rescue team will once again have a fire engine at the clinic to help draw attention to the clinic.Councillor Drever added: #The safety checks are carried out by a specially trained Good Egg Safety expert, not police officers # so people should not feel they are at risk of getting into trouble.“Rather it#s an opportunity to get some reassurance that your car seat is compatible with your vehicle, and to get tips and advice on any adjustments that would improve the car seat’s performance. We#d urge anyone who drives children about # whether that#s childminders, grandparents and parents or wider friends – to drop into the clinic. It is five or ten minutes of your time well spent.”The Good Egg Safety Child Seat clinic will be held in the Tesco car park in Kirkwall on Wednesday July , running from am to pm. There#s no need to book — just look for the Good Egg rep in the Tesco foyer, or head for the red fire engine.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

They want to hear from the owners of all kinds of properties, from urban studio flats to historic country piles. From Shetland to Stranraer and Orkney to Oban, prime properties from all over Scotland will be in the frame.Jo Street, commissioner for BBC Scotland, said: “We’re delighted to announce a second series of Scotland’s Home of the Year. It isn’t just about showing off million-pound properties – it’s about truly celebrating what people have done to turn their house into a home, expressing their iniduality through their design, flair and imagination. We saw some cracking houses over the course of series one and there are far more gems to uncover for series two.”The first series of Scotland’s Home of the Year was broadcast on the new BBC Scotland channel in April and May this year.The series has since seen its audience continue to grow on iPlayer with requests to view so far hitting more than a quarter of a million – ,.The format saw three judges – architect Michael Angus, interior designer Anna Campbell-Jones and lestyle blogger Kate Spiers – travel theand breadth of Scotland to discover architectural gems and unearth some stunning interiors. Both traditional and contemporary properties were put under the microscope and judges considered everything from a one-bedroom apartment to a centuries-old country castle … and everything in between.Each home was scored on ality, distinctiveness and clever design and from seven finalists, one clear winner of series one was chosen – the White House in Kirkcudbright, Dumfries and Galloway, created by proud owner Lesley Smith and her late husband Mike.Series two will have a slightly longer run than series one with nine -minute heats, each featuring three properties from a specic part of the country. The  houses featured will then be whittled down to a final nine which will go under the spotlight in an hour-long final episode.Gerard Costello, executive producer, IWC Media said: “We are thrilled that Scotland’s Home of the Year is ing to the BBC Scotland channel. The first series was a joy to make and we have only scratched the surface of the beautul and distinctive homes Scotland has to offer. We can’t wait to get started.”If you’d like to be considered for the next series of Scotland’s Home of the Year, you can get in touch at scotlandshomes@IWCMedia copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Providing practical training for riders where they can improve their skills and understanding of risks through controlled exercises is a vital part of this strategy.“Motorcyclists are vastly over-represented in serious road injuries, so I hope that Orkney’s motorcyclists will take up this opportunity to both become a safer road user and improve their overall riding experience through better bike handling skills.”Anyone interested in attending the course should email: operationriderrefinement@scotland.pnn.police.ukcopy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Of those, nine were classed as early retirements.This meant that #strain costs# amounting to £, had to be paid from their departments of employment directly into the pension fund in order to recoup the cost of early retirement payments.Asked how many of these employees came from the SFL service, an OIC spokeswoman confirmed that seven had worked for the education service, but could not disclose how many were specically from the SFL or what portion of the money was attributable to their redundancy.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Not content with writing just one book, he decided to author two: one will be the scuttle story in photographs, From Scuttle to Salvage, which will be launched this Thursday, June . The  other, The Last Days of the High Seas Fleet, is the more in depth story of the German Naval mutiny, and how the Fleet came to be interned in Scapa. Both are on sale at the Orcadian Bookshop.As with Jutland, Nick decided to tell the story in film. He is passionate about passing history on to his childrens’ generation, and says he felt that this would be a best way of reaching younger people who prefer video to text. The -minute animation has already been seen by more than , people online, and was made possible through crowdfunding and the help of numerous museums and archives, the Kirkwall Library and Archives being among them.Nick will be talking about the scuttle on June  at pm at the St Magnus Centre, where with him, many of the descendants will participate.

It is such a frightening development that it is almost paralysing.

For centuries, we have lived in balance with nature.

The start-up confirmed the first  units of the Lightyear One have already been reserved, but  in total are to be produced initially.Mr Hoefsloot said the company already has plans for future versions of the car.ldquoSince new technology has a high unit cost, we have to start in an exclusive market Lightyear One is the first long-range solar car and has staggering specications, he said.ldquoThe next models we plan to develop will have signicantly lower purchase prices. In addition, future models will be provided to autonomous and shared car fleets, so the purchase price can be ided amongst a large group of users.ldquoCombined with the low operating costs of the vehicle, we aim to provide premium mobility for a low price per kilometre.ldquoA third, final step will be to provide truly sustainable cars that are more affordable to use than the cost of gas you need to drive a combustion car.ldquoThis will prove to be our most important tipping point in the near future, and it will pave the way for a car fleet that is % sustainable.copy -.

So many brilliant TV comedies have been dreamed up by five guys in a room and here’s another. The writers battle their way out of the room by wading through a sea of discarded pizza boxes, their only sustenance having been slipped underneath the door all the time they were finessing the funny lines. They blink at their first glimpse of sunlight in a while, and then send off the finished scripts – destination ITV.What, the same ITV which hasn’t produced a decent sitcom in what seems like  years, and certainly not a consistent run of them like the s classics Rising Damp, Man About the House, Doctor in the House, Please Sir! And The Lovers  Yes, that ITV.It would, our all-male quintet reckon, be too obvious to send their show to the BBC, even though the work stands comparison with Fleabag, WA and even The Office. Their show is perhaps not alternative enough for Channel  but equally it’s not trying too hard for a gold star for ersity it’s just funny. Hilarious, in fact. And because it deserves a big, mainstream, not-too-trendy audience it’s bypassing Netflix and the other streaming networks to possibly spark a comedy revival at a station where the only laughs in recent times have been the unintentional ones provided by Robert Peston’s hair, Simon Cowell’s hairand the clunky change of facial expression when, just before an ad break in the grisly crime drama, the lead detective realises they’ve been chasing a red herring up the wrong tree.: The greatest TV comedies of the decade so far:  TV shows you might not know were filmed in GlasgowAh, but there’s a problem. ITV no longer wants comedies written just by men. “I won’t commission anything with an all-male writing team,” head of comedy Saskia Schuster announced the other day. She painted a picture of men dominating the scene: hogging her in-tray with their scripts and outnumbering those from women by five to one, almost to the extent she has trouble getting out of her door, and of them shouting loudest during the collaborative process. “Too often the writing room is not sensitively run,” she said. “It can be aggressive and slightly bullying.”Bah, men. You can’t do anything with them, Jenny Eclair once declared from the Edinburgh Festival Fringe stage, and you can’t chop them up into little pieces, chuck them in a pot of boiling water with some carrots and call them soup. But they can be quite funny, and when they’re at their funniest and the gags are flying off the page, they iniably paint the male of the species as complete berks. They may occasionally dominate the writing room but there’s a long tradition, in the finished product we see on screen, of women dominating the kitchen , the living-room and, yes, the bedroom. Men in our comedies are never conquering heroes but hen-pecked husbands, deluded regional managers of paper firms and – most hen-pecked and deluded of all – the foreigner-bashing, Austin -thrashing snob proprietor of the hotel from hell.Fawlty Towers was a genius collaboration between a man and a woman, John Cleese and Connie Booth, writing together in the same room and they survived. That is, they didn’t kill each other, although their marriage didn’t last. Basil was terribly rude about – and in braver moments, directly to the face of – Sybill but she definitely wore the trousers in that relationship. And would anyone seeking an equal voice for women claim that in the comedy of the year so far, the central character wasn’t a beautully written portrait of a widow coping with loss, middle-age, suburban ennui, insensitive relatives, idiotic relatives and the most epicly snooty and cruel sister-in-law this side of a Mike Leigh film This was the just-finished Mum starring Lesley Manville and written by a man, Stefan Golaszewski. I don’t think Schuster would have been complaining about the lack of female input in the creative processMum was one of her shows but it was on the BBC. Fawlty Towers was a Beeb comedy, as was The Office, WA – which had the most tremendous fun sending up ersity and gender quotas – and Fleabag, admittedly the only comedy here solely penned by a woman. So where are the ITV comedies  It used to be a struggle to name a good one now it’s a struggle to name any, be they female-dominated, male-dominated or three-toed sloth-dominated. Schuster may be frustrated by the scripts she receives but ITV would seem to first have to convince writers that it is a good place to be, that it wants to make the country laugh in these gloomy times.By the way, five guys in a room  That tends to be the American model. The British model has often been two guys, one pacing around and jabbering and the other typing. Some of the greatest and most-loved and still-quoted comedies emerged from such unpromising, female-free surroundings, including Hancock’s Half Hour by Ray Galton and Alan Simpson, the same duo who gave us Steptoe and Son, and Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais’ The Likely Lads.Steptoe and Son wasn’t heavy on women but the thought was there. Harold was always trying to don his velvet jacket and escape the rag and bone business and his dirty old man of a father to meet members of the opposite sex but never actually succeeded. And while Thelma in The Likely Lads was a bit of a dragon, the joke was always on Bob and Terry.But under the new diktat none of these fantastic shows would have made it onto the goggle-box and neither would Monty Python’s Flying Circus. That simply isn’t funny.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"no place for ageism in an ageing country leader comment","story":"Employers need to wake up to the fact that they need to accommodate older workers with one in four people in Britain set to be  or over by .The dramatic surge in le expectancy during the second half of the th century – thanks in large part to the NHS – still appears to be news to some British employers.For even though people are, on average, fitter and healthier than ever – and therefore capable of working beyond retiral age in many jobs – ageist attitudes persist. A report by MPs last year condemned the fact that a million people over the age of  were unemployed in the UK as an “unacceptable” waste of talent, blaming straightforward prejudice, casual ageism and unconscious bias.Despite such retrograde thinking, new figures from the Office for National Statistics reveal that more than  per cent of people aged  and over had a job in , double the level in . : MPs blame age discrimination for ‘wasted talents’ of more than million over-s: Older teachers fear being bullied out of the professionAge Scotland said one reason for this is that people want to work longer “because they love their jobs”. They may also work for one of the main reasons anybody does – the money. Many under the age of  who have failed to plan adequately for their pensions will be relying on being able to carry on working in their old age.The trouble is, as Professor Wendy Loretto of Edinburgh University pointed out, there’s a gap between “employers’ and employees’ understanding of the opportunities and practicalities of working in later le”. That gap is one we must all work to close, given that one in four people are expected to be aged  and over by . While some people in their late s will be able to carry on doing their existing job, others may not be able to continue in precisely the same role but still have useful skills to offer or perhaps will be able to perform a part-time role, but not a full-time one.Whatever the retirement age, employers need to recognise this and make the necessary changes to accommodate them. Those that do not will miss out on talented staff who offer that most vital of qualities, experience. And firms may also eventually face action from Government becausetoo many older people are economically inactive, this will become an increasing strain on the economy. Long-term success in business is based partly on identying changes in the way of the world and this one is quite simple – an ageing population means an older workforce.And, regardless of the business-sense, we should all be judged on our inidual qualities, not pre-judged on our age.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"div","story":"A DIVE vessel with  women on board was escorted into port after she began taking in water off Shetland on Sunday. issued a mayday call in bad weather soon after midday when she was approximately eight miles east of Sumburgh Head.

The Punds Water tree has died but the Catfirth specimen remains and has played its part in bringing the trust#s new tree to le.The team cloned the Catfirth tree through a process called #layering#. The cloned tree was then taken to the horticultural unit and further clones have also been successful.Paul Goddard leads the woodlands team. He said: “The final piece in the jigsaw was to pollinate the cloned trees. We used pollen that had been harvested from the Punds Water tree before it disappeared.#We didn’t knowit would work and it was a long wait to find out. We couldn’t believe it when we came in one day and spotted the hazelnut appearing from under the leaves.”Samples taken from peat show that, around , years ago there were high levels of tree pollen representing a erse range of species including rowan, birch, willow, hazel and alder.The tree has produced its first hazelnut. Photo: Shetland Amenity TrustMr Goddard explained: “At around the , years mark, the pollen levels in the peat drop away rapidly as trees began to disappear from our landscape. This coincides with the time that humans started to inhabit the islands, it is also a period when our climate began to change and became cooler and wetter.#Both are thought to be contributing factors in the demise of our native woodlands.”The trust germinates over , trees each year and recently assisted with tree planting at the new Anderson High School.

As a result of its strategic importance both sides concentrated some of their best armoured regiments and equipment in this area. The Guards Armoured Brigade comprised of three tank battalions and had been set up and trained in England. The three battalions were the nd Battalion of the Grenadier Guards, the st Battalion of the Coldstream Guards and the nd Battalion of the Irish Guards. The Irish Guards were recruited from Northern Ireland and the nd Battalion contained men from the Province. You can see it in the tank commanders names. We have Agnew, Brennan, Carson, Connolly, Healy, Harbinson, Mahoney, McCorkell, McGuire, McHugh and Robinson amongst others.The nd Battalion Irish Guards was equipped with American Sherman tanks. These were  ton Medium tanks and mainly equipped with a  mm gun, a useful weapon against infantry but not entirely satisfactory against tanks. The battalion was organised into sub units. There were three squadrons in the battalion, each composed of four troops and each troop had four tanks. The Irish Guards named their tanks after towns and the nd Squadron named theirs with B’s. So we have Ballina, Bangor, Bantry, Belfast, Benbane and Ballynahinch. We also have Ballyraggett and BallymenaBallymena was a special Sherman tank. Ballymena did not have the standard  mm gun. The inconvenient truth for the Allied tank crews was that their tanks were not as good as the best of German ones. A German Tiger tank, for example could destroy a Sherman tank at a distance of over a mile. A Sherman on the other hand would be lucky to harm a Tiger at  yards.  The Britsh crews themselves had already concluded that a Sherman tank was not considered as safe a location as many would have been believed. Hence they covered the front with extra metal tracks and the propensity of the Sherman to do a “Ronson”, that is light up, encouraged the crew to get out very quickly.To deal with the stronger German tanks the Allies devised a way of mounting a bigger gun on some of the Shermans. This new gun was so big it meant redesigning the tank and reducing the size of the crew. These Shermans, now armed with a  pounder gun, which referred to the weight of the shell it fired, were nicknamed FireflyThe Irish Guards arrived in Normandy  days after the initial D Day landings. Caen had still not been completely captured so the Irish Guards eere given a mission to help bypass the city of Caen by gaining ground to the east of the city and drive towards the village of Cagny. This was Operation Goodwood, named after the racecourse in England.Undercover of darkness on the night of th July, Ballymena and the other tanks moved over the River Orne on newly constructed bridges and prepared for battle.The smoke, noise and movement of the battlefield created chaos. Units became mixed up and both sides sometimes got lost. This led to one of the most famous incidents of the battle. By the middle of the afternoon of July th the Irish Guard’s assault is under fire, stalled and mud bound outside the village of Cagny. Lt John Gorman of B Squadron th troop commanding a mm armed Sherman called “Ballyraggett” gets slightly ahead of his comrades and spots a German King Tiger at about yrs. Knowing his gun could do little damage to the King Tiger, Lt Gorman chose a dramatic course of action. He had previously briefed his crew Gunner Albert Scholes, Driver James BaronRadio operator Agnew, and told themhe got the chance they would adopt “Navy tactics”. He instructed Baron to drive at full speed ahead and prepare to ram the German tank. Firing a high explosive shell at close range stunned the inexperienced German crew but had little impact on the tank. However, the high speed collision effectively immobilized both tanks. The Sherman and the King Tiger were abandoned and their crews hid in the fields.Lt Gorman realising the King Tiger was still a viable threat ran towards the nearest Sherman Firefly, in the knowledge only a  pounder gun on the Firefly could do any meaningful damage. This was Ballymena. Some of Ballymena’s crew were already either dead or injured but Gorman jumped in and directed fire on the abandoned King Tiger.  The fighting continued for a while but eventually Gorman was able to rescue his own and other crews and get back to safety.For his exploits Gorman - later Sir John - was awarded the Military Cross. Editor’s note: Sir John, who died aged  in May , was a Northern Irish Roman Catholic Unionist with an unflinching sense of service.After the war he joined the Royal Ulster Constabulary before becoming a senior manager with British Overseas Airways Corporation, then head of the Northern Ireland Housing Executive. Finally he was elected to the Northern Ireland Assembly as the sole Roman Catholic member of the Ulster Unionist Party, and served as Deputy Speaker until the Assemblys suspension in . He was a frequent visitor to Ballymena during his time with the NIHE and he never failed tomention that he had married a Ballymena woman, Norah Caruth.

At the time it was taken in the iconic Flamingo Ballroom, they were members of local rock’n’blues band, Tailor.The band was formed in the early s by Tucker McIlwee and John Tennant.“Other band members who played with Tailor over the years were Ronnie McAuley, Hubert Dunlop and Ricky Maybin, Henry McQuillan, Dave Moore Trevor Erwin andGerry McNeely. We were transported to and from the gigs by Brian Surgenor, ” says John.“Our first gig was at a place called Betty Staffs in Belfast but we travelled throughout Ireland playing most of the towns on the circuit.“Amazingly, we had never played in Ballymena until Sammy Barr of the Flamingo approached our manager to offer a booking.”It transpired that Tailor were playing on the same bill as Rory Gallagher. As you would expect, the group were excited but, in their own words, ‘not overwhelmed.’John remembers: “We met with Rory and his band during set up,. Rory was a very down to earth guy. We discussed what songs we were going to play as we were going to have a one hour set. The Flamingo was full to the brim, the crowd were electric and Tailor recieved a tremendous welcome.“Following the gig we met with Rory for the photo call. The rest is history. Tailor continued to travel theand breadth of Ireland entertaining the young and not so young ravers until the group members went their seperate ways after six years of traveling on the road.”After years of inaction the group reformed to play two gigs for Cancer research, The Countryman Inn and the Telecom Club were filled to capacity for the night of nostalgia and entertainment. pound was raised for charity.And John ponders: “Will the group do it again  Watch this space!”Rory Gallagherwas an Irish blues and rock multi-instrumentalist,songwriter, and producer.Born in Ballyshannon, County Donegal, and brought up in Cork, Gallagher recorded solo albums throughout the s and s, after forming the band Taste during the late s. His albums have sold over  million copies worldwide.Gallagher received a liver transplant in , but died of complications later that year in London at the age of .He began playing after school with Irish showbands, while still in his early teens. Having completed a musical apprenticeship and influenced by the increasing popularity of beat groups during the early s, Gallagher formed The Taste, which was later renamed simply, Taste, a blues rock and RB power trio, in .Performing extensively in the UK, the group played regularly at the Marquee Club, supporting both Cream at their Royal Albert Hall farewell concert, and the blues supergroup Blind Faith on a tour of North America.After the break-up of Taste, Gallagher toured under his own name. The s were Gallaghers most prolic period. He produced ten albums in that decade, including two live albums, Live in Europe and Irish Tour . November  saw the release of the album Deuce. In the same year he was voted Melody Makers International Top Guitarist of the Year, ahead of Eric Clapton. Though he sold over thirty million albums worldwide, it was his marathon live performances that won him greatest acclaim. He is documented in Irish Tour , a film directed by Tony Palmer.During the heightened periods of political unrest in Northern Ireland, as other artists were warned not to tour, Gallagher was resolute about touring Ireland at least once a year during his career, winning him the dedication of thousands of fans, and in the process, becoming a role model for other aspiring young Irish musicians.

It is just one of many activities we have planned to celebrate the enormous pride that the people of Northern Ireland have in the achievements of our golfing greats. “While Northern Ireland might one day boast its own ‘Mount Rushmore’ for golf, we can reassure everyone that this stunt is digital theatre and something we hope will raise a smile ahead of July.” Robin Daly, son of the late Fred Daly, said: “Our family are extremely honoured that my father is being remembered in this way.

Lavishly staged by a professional creative team, this stirring Grand Opera House Summer Youth Production is the most ambitious to date, bringing together  of Northern Ireland’s creatives. Supported by a -piece orchestra, the impressive score will feature all the big numbers including I Still Believe, The Movie in my Mind and the iconic The American Dream.-year-old Aquinas pupil Lára Mulgrew will perform the role of Ellen in the stage show. No stranger to the Grand Opera House stage, Lára performed aged nine the role of Molly in their production of Annie. Lára described the audition process “as very straight forward” and how it will be “wonderful” to portray the role of Ellen come July.“I hadn’t seen the production before but was able to watch it on Youtube. It’s going to be a total of six performances and it’s a very mature role,” she said. “It’s definitely the most challenging role I’ve ever had to perform and it will be a great challenge to take on her maturity.”Methody College’s Louis Fitzpatrick will take on the role of American GI John Thomas, part of the battalion deployed in Saigon during the Vietnam War.“I heard about the auditions for Miss Saigon through a friend, I went for one audition and did well enough to get a call back. I was really ecstatic to learn I had got the part as I was performing Footloose at the time as part of the Belfast Youth and Drama Society, I joined in April  and the first production I did was Les Misérables.“I hadn’t watched the stage version before but was able to watch it on Amazon Prime.”The -year-old has just completed his A’levels in Moving Image, Politics and Drama and told the South Belfast News how he hopes to go on to study film at the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland in Glasgow.Grand Opera House Chief Executive Ian Wilson added: “This is the ninth year that the Grand Opera House has staged its Summer Youth Production, and Miss Saigon® School Edition will be the biggest so far. It’s very rare for a theatre the size of the Grand Opera House to be granted the rights to the youth version, so it really is a brilliant opportunity to see the best up-and-coming musical theatre stars in one of the most popular musicals of all time.”For ticket information visit: www.goh"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"local mla gets brexit safety alert","story":"POLICE have delivered an extraordinary advice list to the West Belfast home of a Sinn Féin MLA suggesting ways in which he can improve his and his family’s personal security post-Brexit.The document has already been delivered to the homes of all  MPs across the United Kingdom, but officers who called to the home of Máirtín Ó Muilleoir said they are widening distribution of the document to take in Brexit spokespersons of parties in the north. The leaflet – headlined ‘When It Goes Too Far’ – outlines steps that politicians should takethey are targeted by extremists in any wave of public unrest that may break out post-October , the latest deadline for the UK leaving the EU.The document – which Mr Ó Muilleoir yesterday branded “Brexit bollox – has been compiled by a number of UK agencies: the National Police Chiefs’ Council, the Crown Prosecution Service, the College of Policing and the Electoral Commission. Despite its wide experience in dealing with public unrest, the PSNI has not been involved in drawing up the guidelines. But local police officers have been tasked with distributing it to MLAs closely connected to the Brexit issue.To the fore in the security advice is what Mr Ó Muilleoir and his family should do in the event of being targeted with a hazardous substance. Police advice is to:• Leave the house and seek fresh air.• Treat itchy or painful skin with water.• Remove outer clothing – but not by pulling it over the head.• Remove any substance that may contact clothing or skin by using a dry absorbent material or brushing it off.Advice is also included on what signs may signal the presence of hazardous substances in the home.The leaflet also advises politicians not to engage with iniduals who may be “stalking harassing” them, either online or offline. It urges them to seek further advice on personal safety and building security from their local police force and to conduct a review of what personal information about them is available online.The leaflet explains that the advice is being forwarded for politicians to consultthey are subjected post-Brexit to “unacceptable levels of harassment and intimidation”. It continues: “In some cases, these behaviours and actions have reached the criminal threshold. The worst examples have led to violence and injury.”The most serious example of Brexit-inspired violence was the murder of Labour MP Jo Cox in June  in West Yorkshire by a gun- and kne-wieldingman holding extreme pro-Britain views. Mr Ó Muilleor said: “It seems preposterous to me that the PSNI is promoting Brexit security advice compiled at the behest of a UK government which for three years has shown itself so thoroughly inept in its handling of the issue. There’s little in this that isn’t already known to most people and no reason why it couldn’t have been emailed to me rather than dispatching a police patrol. There are Catholic families in my South Belfast constituency living under the jackboot of the UVF and the flegger bully-boys. The PSNI would be better advised to protect those folk rather than wasting their time and my time with this Brexit bollox.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"squeeze on school places gets worse","story":"ALLIANCE South Belfast MLA Paula Bradshaw says a fundamental reform in the allocation of school places is needed, after figures showed a soaring demand for places in South Belfast,with well over a quarter of applicants now not getting their first choice.Ms Bradshaw revealed statistics released to her by the Education Authority outlining the number over the past five years of school admissions.In ,  pupils living in South Belfast applied for a post-primary place –  pupils were offered a place at first preference whilst  were refused.In , out of a total of  applications,  pupils were offered a place at first preference, with  refused.“The number of pupils seeking places in South Belfast post-primary schools has risen from  to  in the past five years, yet Area Planning seems to have managed to miss this completely,” explained Ms Bradshaw.“This defeats the whole purpose of Area Planning. How can it not already have been known that approximately  more pupils would be requiring places over this period  If Area Planning was unable to monitor this correctly, it is entirely unsuited for purpose. It is a complete failure of the system. “The outcome of this failure is drastic. As a consequence, we now have, for the first time, seven pupils in South Belfast not receiving any offer at all for September . Additionally, the number not receiving their first choice rising dramatically from  per cent to  per cent and this will only rise further.“With more than a fth more pupils seeking places in South Belfast than was the case just three years ago, we should have been taking action to address the shortfall in provision we knew was pending.“The increased intake at Lagan and Aquinas, of  places each, can cover only a sixth of that increase and is nothing like sufficient. So, what we are seeing is a comprehensive failure of the whole transfer system in South Belfast.“With ever more new housing in and around South Belfast, this is only going to get worse in years to come. Where is the monitoring of this  What will the requirement be five years from now  What is being done to address it  “The Alliance Party has called, and will continue to call, for a fundamental, independently-led review of education provision with a view to far-reaching transformation recommend-ations being proposed.“A high priority within this process would be a focus on improving Area Planning, so that pupils and their families are not left in the appalling situation where they are left without a school, with the ultimate solution being more educational provision either within existing schools or a new build,” added Ms Bradshaw."},{"url":null,"title":"9000 in northern ireland apply to secure status after","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

of Ireland and Northern Ireland .A new body of experts has been set up in the UK to look at potential alternative arrangements.Read MoreExtent of Irish north-south cooperation revealed in secret Brexit impact mapping exercise reportFuture PM seeking to delay Brexit would face EU hostility – VaradkarExpert  appointed to advise UK government on alternative arrangements for Irish border after BrexitMany Brexiteers believe technological solutions could replace the backstop. But Mr Varadkar said he could not see evidence of arrangements being outlined before the October  deadline for the UK’s withdrawal from the EU.If there is a no-deal Brexit at the end of October, Ireland will be under an obligation to protect the single market.Leo VaradkarThe Taoiseach made the remarks at the end of an EU summit in Brussels as European Council president Donald Tusk said Brexit would become “more exciting” than before with a change of British prime minister but that the EU’s position had not changed.Mr Varadkar said: “We can’t accept that alternative arrangements are an alternative to a backstop unless we can see what these alternative arrangements are, know how they would work and see them demonstrated.“That hasn’t been done yet and I don’t see that being done this side of October  which is why we certainly can’t accept the deletion of the backstop.”He added: “For us, a deal without a backstop is effectively no deal because it means that there is no legal guarantee we won’t have a hard border, there is no operable mechanism by which we can avoid a hard border, it would just be a case of trying to pull it off, which I don’t think really is much of a solution.”Mr Varadkar said EU leaders had reaffirmed that the Withdrawal Agreement was not open for renegotiation and they agreed that negotiations would only take place between the UK and the EU.But he said the Irish government would have an “obligation” to protect the single market in the event of a no-deal outcome.“If there is a no-deal Brexit at the end of October, Ireland will be under an obligation to protect the single market, it’s our single market, our economy and our jobs are dependent on it,” he said.“We will have to make sure that Ireland doesn’t become the back door to the European single market.”He added that the only way he could see of being sure of avoiding a hard border was through regulatory alignment.Asked about the Tory leadership race, Mr Varadkar highlighted that both of the candidates, who remain in the running to become prime minister, had voted for the Withdrawal Agreement.He said he looked forward to holding a meeting with the new prime minister and discussing potential changes to the Political Declaration.But he reiterated that there would be “no implementation period for the UKthere is no Withdrawal Agreement and there will be no Withdrawal Agreementthere’s no backstop”."},{"url":null,"title":"brexits impact on many crossborder initiatives

However, the -page mapping exercise gives an insight into the extent we could be impacted.The scope of areas highlighted is broad and includes everything from health, travel, waterways, animal movement and organised crime and drugs to benefit fraud, schooling, library provision and teacher and doctor qualications.For each of the  sectors, the document species the extent to which it is underpinned by the Good Friday Agreement as well as by existing EU legal and policy frameworks.In the case of the North West Cancer Centre, the report points out that the initiative was based on an intergovernmental agreement between Health Ministers from both jurisdictions.It says the centre at Altnagelvin Area Hospital, which opened in November , \"offers radiotherapy services closer to home for many patients from the north west, reducing their travel time signicantly\".Similarly, the All-Island Congenital Heart Disease Network is identied as ensuring that \"vulnerable children\" receive treatment on the island of Ireland.

Genuine concerns in areas like agri-food and healthcare must be taken seriously.\"Sinn Fein MP Chris Hazzard said an expert  is not needed to show how disastrous a no-deal Brexit will be. He said: \"The British Government has now convened a  of experts to determine the impact of a no-deal Brexit on the North. \"It neednt have bothered as a range of experts have already given dire warnings of the disastrous impact a no-deal Brexit will have on the Norths economy, our rights and the Good Friday Agreement.\" Cabinet Office Minister David Lidington said the documents were part of \"initial scoping work\" by the Government, supported by the Civil Service here, the European Commission and the Republic.Mr Lidington said they were intended to form the basis of discussion and not final products.

No formal or transparent selection process was used in her selection for appointment nor was she given a written contract of employment, statement of main terms and conditions or job description.During , following several years of signicant growth, the firm decided to consider promotions from associate solicitor grade to salaried partner. Mrs Mercer and two other colleagues were promoted to salaried partner later that year.However, the following year, when she applied for promotion to the role of an equity partner, she was told she did not meet the eligibility criteria. Mrs Mercer did not find out about the promotions of her comparators at the time they took effect on June , , because they had not been announced internally. Instead she learned about them around  through what she described as the \"office rumour mill\". When she enquired about applying for promotion to the next stage, she was informed that there would be no more movement in the firm for the foreseeable future.Mrs Mercer flagged ious issues about her pay during  and  and the fact that promotions were taking place without any formal or transparent selection process.In June  she informed one of firms partners that she wanted to be paid the same salary as her male comparators and to have her bonus calculated on the same terms as theirs. Mrs Mercer was later told that the firm had decided to defer the issue of her salary and bonus until the end of the financial year as part of a wider review of business and salaries. Following this she lodged an internal grievance, seeking equal pay with her comparators on the ground that she was performing like work with them. Her grievance was rejected as the firm was of the view that her work as a salaried partner was \"not as demanding as that of a salaried partner benefiting from a profit share arrangement\". The legal practice accepted that Mrs Mercer was receiving less remuneration than her male colleagues but did not accept that she was undertaking like work with them. It contended that, although she and her male counterparts were all qualied solicitors, there were signicant dferences in the work they and Mrs Mercer were undertaking both in respect of legal work and other responsibilities.In addition, the respondent contended that,Mrs Mercer proved that she was undertaking like work with her comparators, there were genuine material factors which were not the dference of sex and which explained and justied any dferences in pay.The tribunal found that Mrs Mercer was employed on like work with all her comparators going back six years to June .The firm was ordered to pay her £, in respect of the dference between her gross annual salary of £, and the modied amount of £, going forward. She will also receive £, arrears of annual salary falling six years before the date of her claim in June  along with interest of £, on arrears."},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article38247255.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/court.jpg","title":"ormeau road man accused of touching child without consent in belfast","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It is for democratic politicians in the democratic world to do so,” he said.The chairman of the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee Damian Collins said Sir Nick was wrong to say there was no evidence that Russia used Facebook to interfere in the referendum.“He is technically wrong on that point which he should know,” he told BBC Radio ’s Today programme.“We asked Facebook whether there was any evidence of Russians buying ads during the referendum. There was – which they shared with us – on a very small scale, but nevertheless it was there.”He added: “There has been no proper audit done during the referendum. There is certainly evidence of suspicious Russian activity during the referendum and where.”"},{"url":null,"title":"twitter thread lets you pretend to be beyonces assistant for the day","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

A condition set at the time was that the town should not sell the castle, failing which the Prussian crown estate administration reserved the right to revoke St Goar’s ownership.Prince Georg Friedrich of Prussia, the great-great-grandson of Kaiser Wilhelm II and the current head of the Hohenzollern family, argued that a  agreement under which St Goar granted the hotel next to the ruins a -year leasehold amounted to a sale. \" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Kaiser Wilhelm II But Koblenz state court rejected his case for the site’s .The castle was part of the family property seized by authorities in November , when the German monarchy ended with Wilhelm’s abdication shortly before the end of the First World War.It was put under a crown estate administration set up by the Prussian finance ministry. That administration then transferred the site’s ownership to St Goar.The court found that the castle was transferred to the administration not as the Hohenzollerns’ private property but as a “special asset” of the royal family.

It was the third flight of a Falcon Heavy, but the first ordered by the military.The US Defence Department mission is expected to provide data to certy the Falcon Heavy — and reused boosters — for future national security launches. It was the military’s first ride on a recycled rocket.Center core engine shutdown and stage separation confirmed. Second stage engine burn underway pic wrnuMmGL— SpaceXJune , Both side boosters landed back at Cape Canaveral several minutes after lt-off, just as they did after launching in April. But the new core booster missed an ocean .SpaceX said this was not unexpected for the especially dficult mission.Nasa signed up for a spot on the rocket, along with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration , the Air Force Research Laboratory, the Planetary Society and Celestis, which offers memorial flights into space.An astronaut who flew on Nasa’s first space station in the s, Skylab’s Bill Pogue, had a bit of his ashes on board, along with more than  other deceased people. Mr Pogue died in .SpaceX said the mission was one of its most challenging launches. The satellites need to be placed in three dferent orbits, requiring multiple upper-stage engine firings. It was going to take several hours to release them all.The Deep Space Atomic Clock by Nasa’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory is a technology demo aimed at self-flying spacecraft. The clock is meant to help spacecraft navigate by themselves when far from Earth. Nasa was also testing a clean and green alternative to toxic rocket and satellite fuel.LIFTOFF!!! Go #FalconHeavy!!

Durkan said that many of the  staff at Foyle House, on the Duncreggan Road, will be made redundant as it will be \"impossible\" for them to relocate to Belfast.In  HMRC announced that the Derry tax office would close in  .It came as part of a move to reconfgure its offices into thirteen regional centres serving every nation and region in the UK, with one of these centres being located in Belfast.In July  HMRC declared that its Belfast Regional Centre would be based at Erskine House, Chichester Street, Belfast, and expected to open in late . It is on schedule to open later this year.This week, Sir Jonathan Thompson, Chief Executive and Permanent Secretary of HMRC, sent a letter to Mark H. Durkan asserting that based on current plans Foyle House will close in September , with staff moving, where possible, to the Belfast Regional Centre.There are currently around  staff in Foyle House and Mr Thompson accepted that the majority live outside reasonable daily travel to Belfast.Mark H Durkan had asked that consideration be given to the integration of HMRC workers in Derry into the Northern Ireland Civil Service.Speaking to the Derry News yesterday, he said: “The intention of HMRC to close their offices here in September  is something I have been appealing against since it was announced in November .“I had written to Head of Civil Service, David Sterling to consider the integration of Derry staff to available DAERA positions in Ballykelly. Why this obvious solution has not been given due consideration is beyond me.“And while HMRC have acknowledged a duty of care to ex-employees, the current plan to relocate  staff members to their Belfast offices is a highly impractical approachnot virtually impossible for those with families and caring responsibilities. For many the only option they have been left with is redundancy.“It is a ludicrous and tin-eared approach to remove employment opportunities, chronically lacking in the North West, and in effect to move more of our skilled workers to Belfast.“These experienced and highly competent staff would be an asset to any organisation. The inability to provide these people some peace of mind as well as affording them opportunities to apply their skills in similar roles closer to home, has been completely overlooked.”However, in his letter Mr Thompson said, “regrettably, there are no priority arrangements for redeployment of our staff into Northern Ireland Civil Servicedepartments.“The NICS is entirely separate from the Home Civil Service and, as such, HMRC staff can only apply for roles in the NICS which may be advertised externally, including those at the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs in nearby Ballykelly.”Mr Thompson added that it has always been made clear that HMRC wants as many people as possible to transfer to their new location and continue their careers in Belfast.“That is why we have committed to hold one-to-one meetings between staff and managers around a year in advance of any move, to discuss inidual circumstances.“The meetings will establish who can and cannot move and what level of support will be needed to keep people working for HMRC. The one-to-ones for this office will commence in September ,” he concluded.The letter went on to say that those who decide to travel to Belfast will be given financial support in terms of travel costs and in some cases with home moves.The option of working in other government departments would also be explored.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh"},{"url":null,"title":"creggan men mixing mayweather dream las vegas boxing encounter","story":"A boxing coach and personal trainer from Creggan has spoken about an ‘amazing’ trip to Las Vegas spent in the company of many of the fight game’s legendary characters never mind his best friend who just happens to be international footballer James McClean.James McClean recently decided to celebrate turning  by inviting a few of his close friends and their partners to go on a trip to Las Vegas. So, Conor McBride and the rest of the group jumped at the chance and found themselves there last week in advance of the Tyson Fury v Tom Schwarz heavyweight bout.Conor told the Derry News: “While we were in Las Vegas, I had the idea to visit the Mayweather gym as James and myself are both big boxing fans.

So, my coach and GB coaches suggested I give it a go this year. My shoot was what won the event.ldquoI was neck and neck with the previous British champion most of the way round.

Suzie has an extremely busy summer ahead of her and is so looking forward to the challenges ahead.ldquoMy focus now is Traithle Europeans in June in Madeira, then Worlds in Florida in October.

They have also branded claims the mercury bath poses a health and safety risk as a ldquored herring and fear that replacing the existing mechanism could potentially damage the Fresnel lens.Described as a ldquoworkshop, the January meeting lasted over one hour with the official council record of the debate that ensued only amounting to a paltry two and a half lines.The Lecale Lightkeepers vehemently argued that they had a case for briefing councillors on the impact the loss of the beam would have but, surprisingly, the request was initially rejected.Instead, council officials insisted that officers from the the Commissioners of Irish Lights would be invited to future meetings of the districtrsquos respective DEA Forums to discuss the future of the lighthouse.The local authority said this was to ensure that information could be shared and that local stakeholders and communities were fully consulted on any proposals for the lighthouse in the immediate future, before any plans are finalised.Council officials also insisted that wide ranging public consultation on the future of the lighthouse would take place.Campaigners mdash who were at a complete loss to understand why they were initially refused an opportunity to meet directly with councillors over five months ago mdash have now been told they will get a chance to brief them and outline their case for the retention of the beam.The Lecale Lightkeepers have described the plan to remove the beam as ldquototally inadequate and unacceptable and are looking forward to outlining their case for its retention.They are also pleased that having heard from the Commissioners, politicians can now have face-to-face dialogue with campaigners.Campaigners have held several discussions with the Commissioners and frequently engage with the organisation as part of the bid to retain what they have described as a key facet of Lecalersquos heritage.ldquoWe welcome the opportunity to meet with councillors to demonstrate just how passionate people are about the retention of the beam, the spokeswoman declared. It is a symbol of unity in Lecale and has brought together all sides of our erse community. It must be retained.ldquoMeeting with councillors is particularly important for us. We have put together a detailed presentation on the lighthouse issue and will outline our concerns about the future of the beam which we cannot afford to lose for a whole host of reasons.The spokeswoman said that in the interests of fairness and given the sensitive nature of the beam issue, it was important that they meet with local politicians.ldquoCouncillors have had the opportunity to hear from the Commissioners and it is important that they hear what we have to say as the group representing those opposed to this controversial proposal, she continued.ldquoThe beam must be retained for future generations given that it is an intrinsic part of the maritime history and heritage of the area and is a stunning feature of the Lecale landscape.The spokeswoman added: ldquoNewry, Mourne and Down Council is backing the campaign to retain the sweeping beam and it is it important that councillors hear directly from campaigners. The beam must be retained we simply cannot afford to lose it from this area and see it consigned to the pages of history..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Curran steps down from government association position  ","story":"DOWNPATRICK councillor Dermot Curran is stepping down from his role as president of the Northern Ireland Local Government Association this Friday.The group is the representative body for the provincersquos  councils and Cllr Curran will leave his position at the grouprsquos annual conference which is taking place at Newcastlersquos Burrendale Hotel.The Ardglass man is Northern Irelandrsquos longest serving district councillor, having been elected to the former Down Council in , following the reorganisation of local government.He has served as NILGA president twice describing the accolade as both a ldquoprivilege and a challenge.While stepping down as the organisationrsquos president, Cllr Curran will remain a key member of the NILGA Executive.Cllr Curran mdash who was last month re-elected to Newry, Mourne and Down Council mdash has been a councillor for  years and while already Northern Irelandrsquos longest serving politician, some of his council colleagues believe that he is the longest serving in the British Isles.Dedicated to public service, Cllr Curran said he has ldquothoroughly enjoyed his second term at NILGArsquos helm and looks forward to continuing his work with the organisation.He also believes that local councils will continue to play increasingly important roles in their respective areas and that an opportunity exists to unlock the potential of local government as the hub of public services.Cllr Curran said that over recent years councils had changed dramatically, as had the political, financial and legal environment in which councillors operate.He said while local authorities had more responsibilities and power than before, they were also increasingly stretched in terms of finances and resources, an issue which has been compounded since the suspension of the Assembly.ldquoThe  councils are a key element of investment and public service delivery, but they control just % of the public purse.

However, I doubt many think that it is the cradle of horse racing, but it is.We do of course have a famous racecourse, which has just hosted a festival of racing as part of the DownTime Summerfest.Some of you, dear readers, may even know that there is an earlier racecourse in Downpatrick mdash at Old Course Road. So racing has been going on for centuries in our beautul corner of the world. And we have also played a vital role in the foundation of the Sport of Kings.The breed of horse associated with modern horse racing is the thoroughbred. A mere glance is enough to tell even the casual observer that the thoroughbred does not look like other horses.When compared to a pony or carthorse, the thoroughbred is leaner, taller and sleeker. In fact, these horses are perfectly designed for racing. They have big lungs, a big heart and long, slender legs that can move swtly.They also need special care when compared with native breeds. They have thin hair coats and so need to wear rugs or live in stables in bad weather. They need special food to give them energy to race. So these features tell you that the ancestor of the modern thoroughbred came from somewhere hot mdash from the desert, in fact. The ancestor of our racehorses is from Arabia.Back in the th century, horses were bred for work and war, not pleasure. Officers prized horses that were fast to get them in and out of battle and keep them alive. By this time, the medieval charger of knights mdash the destrier mdash was out of fashion. They were too slow and cumbersome, and soldiers no longer wore heavy suits of armour.So the horse evolved through selective breeding to become fleet of foot. There were no horses faster than the Arabian, which was specially bred to become bigger and faster than its wild cousin. The armies of the Ottoman Sultan developed special studs to create this new war machine.In , one of these fine stallions, known as the Byerley Turk, found himself outside the gates of Vienna. The Ottoman Sultan wanted to capture the imperial capital of the Holy Roman Empire, an objective he failed to achieve when the Polish King John III Sobieski led the greatest cavalry charge in history to defeat the Ottoman forces.The Byerley Turk was captured and eventually brought to England, finding himself in the ownership of one Captain Byerley.His adventures were not over though. Recognising a fine animal, Captain Byerley adopted the Turk as his war horse. In  hewas called to Ireland to fight for King William and in  he fought at the Battle of the Boyne. Indeed, Captain Byerley later attributed his surviving that battle to the swtness of his favourite war horse.After the battle, the Turk was entered in a horse race mdash in Downpatrick. Of course, he went on to win that race and go on to be one of the most famous horses in history. The Flying Horse housing development to the east of Downpatrick is named after this famous race.The remarkable career of the Turk continued mdash and now we come to his ultimate destiny. He was put out to stud in Yorkshire. His pedigree was highly prize and he became the first of only three foundation sires of the modern thoroughbred breed.Genetic testing has revealed it is his DNA that is the most common in all modern racehorses. His progeny are successful right to this day including names such as Dr Devious, Ahonoora and Indian Ridge.And it all started with a fateful race in Downpatrick over  years ago. Needless to say,Downe Vets had been around then and caring for his veterinary needs, we feel he could have achieved more..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Hurlers seeking big upset at Croke Park  ","story":"DOWN senior hurlers go into Saturdayrsquos Christy Ring Cup final at Croke Park against Meath as rank outsiders.Few pundits outside the Down camp expect anything other than a comfortable win for Meath, but say that quietly in and around Ronan Sheehanrsquos new kids on the block.The Newry man, who has close connections to several Cork hurling legends, has engendered a new-found enthusiasm and confidence in his charges.His young hurlers are a real surprise packet this season and getting to the Christy Ring Cup final is a major achievement for his fledgeling side.Sheehan has invested heavily in youth and has two schoolboys in his starting .Downpatrickrsquos Tim Prenter, who plays his club hurling for Ballygalget and Ballycranrsquos Phelilm Savage are both in their final year at St Patrickrsquos Grammar School and De La Salle, Downpatrick, respectively.Both lads were in the Down Schoolsrsquo side that lted the Mageean Cup earlier in the season and both hail from famous sporting families.Prenter, who also won a MacLarnon Cup medal with the Red High a few months back, is the son of former Antrim senior football defender Kieran Prenter and his grandfather Seamus Burns was a well known member of the all-conquering Belfast Celtics basketball team that swept all before them in the s and s.Savage, whose brother Liam is also in the team, is the son of former Ballycran and Ulster midfielder Gary lsquoGazarsquo Savage, who was also a noted centre half with Ballycam Celtic in the Newcastle League.There are also several other young players in the  with Portaferryrsquos Matthew Conlon, Ronan Blair, Darragh Mallon, Tom Murray, Caolan Taggart and Eoghan and Daithi Sands all in their early s.Throw in Liatroimrsquos Oisin McManus, P J Davidson and Ruairi McCrickard and Ballycranrsquos Stephen Keith, Gerard Hughes, Huw Flynn and Liam and Phelim Savage and you have the nucleus of squad that could dominate Ulster hurling for years.In addition to Prenter, Ballygalget provide the squad with, John McManus, Danny Toner, Marc Fisher and Cathal Coulter with Newry Shamrocks providing Paul Sheehan and Jordan Murphy.Helping Ronan Sheehan from the sidelines is Cork legend Diarmuid OrsquoSullivan and the Down manager believes his support has been critical in moving the side forward.ldquoDiarmuid has been doing a bit of defensive coaching for us and he has been there for all of the Christy Ring Cup games, he said.ldquoHe would know a lot of the boys from the development squads because he wouldrsquove come and done coaching sessions down through the years. The first set of minors he was involved with were probably the likes of Conor Woods, so, itrsquos going back a bit.ldquoHaving him there with what people would probably say is a relatively inexperienced management team as well as a relatively inexperienced team on the field of play has become very important, he added.ldquoWe see this as a bit of a journey over the next two to three years and Diarmuid being there to help build along the way will make a massive dference. Sheehan also believes that OrsquoSullivan has made a big impact on the players and he canrsquot praise him highly enough.ldquoIn terms of his knowledge of the game and the wee bits of coaching he does around how to tackle, there have been huge strides, Sheehan said.ldquoTackling was definitely something we felt we needed to work on, we were giving away too many frees in the past. You can see the dference even in the way the likes of Tom Murray, only  and Darragh Mallon at , are playing like demons, he beamed.ldquoThe other thing be brings is a great calmness on match days.The lads respond well to that, when he has a quiet word with them beforehand.This will be Downrsquos fourth appearance in the Christy Ring final, but they have only lted the cup once and that was back in ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"New working group to run local mountain bike trails  ","story":"A NEW working group is to be established to assist with the management of the hugely popular mountain bike trails in Castlewellan Forest Park.Newry, Mourne and Down Council is keen to meet with those who use the trails and organise local events, alongside representatives from Cycling Ireland, to discuss what have been described as a number of challenges in managing the facility and sister trails in Rostrevorrsquos Kilbroney Forest Park.Over pound.m has been invested in developing trails in both parks and together they attract over one million users each year, with pound, invested annually in their management.The success of both authorised and unauthorised trails within both parks presents challenges for Newry, Mourne and Down Council, members of its Enterprise, Tourism and Regeneration Committee were told on Monday.The local authority manages the bike trails under licence from the Forest Service and is also responsible for their maintenance.Politicians were told that in addition to the authorised trail network, an unofficial or lsquonaturalrsquo network also exists and has been in place for many years.

Gery Kelly and Bill MontgomeryGerry starts his journey at his home club in Ardglass tracing the beginnings of golf in Ireland and reveals a few surprises as he discovers the relatively unknown Ulster-Scots golfing pioneers who helped establish the sport here.He visits stately homes including Mount Stewart on the shores of Strangford Lough and Grey Abbey House – chatting with Lady Rose Lauritzen and William Montgomery – and travels to St Andrews to explore how the Scots claim to have invented the sport and what part they played in bringing the game across the Irish Sea. .ev-modals .modal.in .modal-dialog .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget .photo-article-notier-default .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p @media.photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p He also sets out to finally answer the age-old dispute about which club is actually the oldest in Ireland. Gerry, who has been playing golf for over five decades at Ardglass Golf Club, said: “Before I began filming for the programme, despite playing the game for most of my le, I actually knew very little about its history, and that’s a shame because there are few sports with as long and as rich a history. Gery Kelly at St Andrews“The thing that amazed me the most was the fact that golf was played in Scotland in the s and it took over  years before it came here. With all the movement of people between the two countries, that Ulster-Scots connection, why did it take so long for the game to be finally organised here ”Gerry, who has been playing golf since he was a teenager, said: “Golf is a sport you can get easily hooked on. It’s a game for le. I know people still playing in their nineties.“For me it’s not so much now about that standard of golf now. I used to play off single figures, now I’m a teenager , it’s about the craic with your fourball. “We would get out once or twice a weekend and play for a fiver. It’s the most important three or four hours of the week to win that fiver.”Links To The Past: Pioneers Of Ulster Golf is on BBC Two Northern Ireland tomorrow night at pm.The one-hour film has been produced by NPE Media for BBC Northern Ireland, with support from the Ulster-Scots Broadcast Fund.l Morning View, page JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings  Terms and Conditions  Disclaimer  Privacy policy    d.onerror  d.onload  d.src  [\"secure-uk.imrworldwide cgi-bin m ciuk-hcgccsi\", escape, \"rp\", escape, \"tscompactrnd\", .getTime].join"},{"url":null,"title":"politics","story":"....... , , , , Would you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast News Letter via email \"Newsletters\"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia Ltd , via occasional emails, to keep you informed about new features, special offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"By clicking on register, you will be creating an account with Belfast News Letter and agreeing to JPIMedia Ltd#s Standard Terms and ConditionsWould you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast News Letter via email \"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia Ltd , via occasional emails, to keep you informed about new features, special offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \" addCustomTextToCreateAccountTemplateNewslettersWould you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast News Letter via email \"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia Ltd , via occasional emails, to keep you informed about new features, special offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"  \". s .  \". s  \". s  \".after+text+ .+text+ .before+text+ .after+text+Bootstrapper.ensEvent.trigger]]]]]]]Bootstrapper.ensEvent.trigger]] initInArticleOnlySiteText, initArticleSiteText, isInArticleOnlyTemplateReady. s isArticleTemplateReady. s addCustomTextToSiteTemplate addSiteName.html  Politics   Jobs Cars Homes  Directory  Announcements  Advertise My Business Subscribe#jp #login-widget #login-flip.flip RegisterLoginEdit Account\"Sign Out\" --\"    --       News Politics Traffic and Travel Crime Weather Business Education Health Opinion People Read This News Traffic and Travel Crime Weather Business Education Health Opinion People Read This Sport Football Rugby Union Motorcycling More Sport Sport Opinion Whats On Arts  Entertainment Things To Do Nightle Lestyle Retro Cars Homes Must Read           Politics      \"  MOT backlog: MLAs plead for rethink after exemptions for drivers ruled outWaiting times for MOT tests have shown little sign of improvement despite extra tests on Sundays and the recruitment of extra staff # and at some test centres the backlog is now even worse.

A spokesperson for the department said on Monday: “Given the steps already being taken by the DVA, the department is not considering the use of exemptions at this time.”The steps taken by the DVA include running an additional , vehicle inspections across Sunday, June  and Sunday, June  with plans for even more Sunday openings in the coming weeks, the recruitment of extra staff, and issuing reminder letters earlier.But DUP MLAs Gary Middleton and Carla Lockhart have urged a rethink of the decision to rule out exemptions for the forseeable future.Mr Middleton said: “I know there were a number of measures put in place – which has to be welcomed – but I don’t know how much impact that has had.“I still believe they need to, and have the power to look at exemptions because this is no fault of the drivers.”He added: “People are being left without their cars. I think the DVA need to look again because it’s been a few weeks now and the problem is still there.”Ms Lockhart said she would put that point to the DVA.She recently received a letter from the DVA’s director of operations Pat Delaney, which said: “I do not consider an exemption necessary at this time as I am hopeful that the measures outlined above will help reduce waiting times.”DUP man John Finlay: ‘I warmly welcome the banner in Ballymoney in support of Soldier F’ Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"The Upper Bann MLA said: “I find that response very disappointing. I believe the DVA should consider some form of exemption so responsible motorists are not being unfairly penalised by a problem with the system.“I will be making further representations to the DVA on that basis.”SDLP MLA Mark H Durkan, a former Stormont minister with responsibility for MOT tests, has said the current backlog is being made worse by drivers missing appointments. “While I am disappointed that DfI have chosen not to consider a ‘period of grace’ for motorists, the current situation has been somewhat exacerbated by the hundreds of people failing to show up for appointments,” he said.try catch  TrendingExclusive: Joey Dunlops family issues plea forof highly sentimental items belonging to five-time world championN.I. railway line reopens after tragic incidentWillie Frazer critically ill family lsquodevastatedrsquo by VSSTwo people found dead in N.I. house -

Unfortunately the swing bridge has been out of commission since June .I have met with residents and local Labour councillors, who have been working closely with residents to discuss their concerns and plans to make the bridge once more available to the public.The bridge is owned by the Vale of Glamorgan Council and leased to Penarth Quays MarinaLTD. It was built to ensure that both residents and boat owners had equal access to land and water.I understand that there are no mechanical reasons why the bridge should not be used.The Vale Council and PQM have agreed that safety upgrades need to be carried out for the bridge to reopen. In October  PQM submitted a planning application for modications to the swing bridge. I have been told that PQM were contacted by the Vale council to mody the current application to include lower intensity flashing lights and lsquosilent alarmsrsquo. Unfortunately PQM felt that the changes would not meet the safety standards they felt necessary and choose to withdraw the application. I understand that the Vale Council is currently awaiting the outcome of a noise report which will feature in future discussions between the Vale and PQM over the future of the swing bridge.The swing bridge has been an integral part of marina le for many years and is enjoyed by both residents and the thousands of tourists to the area. Connecting the two sides of the marina the bridge acts as a short cut for residents, particularly useful for those with walking dficulties. Having spoken to local businesses about the potential for the reopening the consensus seems to be generally positive. Reopening of the swing bridge, customers could use the car park on Llwyn Passat and use the bridge to access Portway businesses.I hope that the Vale council and PQM are able to work together to find a solution. I think we can all agree that the way forward is to ensure safe operation of the bridge while minimising disruption to adjacent properties.Before the Easter recess I met with residents to listen to their concerns over plans to remove Victorian lampposts from across Penarth. The cast iron lampposts, which have been an integral part of Penarthrsquos street scene for a century are being replaced by the Vale council with modern LED lighting. I am disappointed that several lampposts along Cwrt-Y-Vil road have been removed without notying residents.Residents have set up a petition, of which over a thousand people so far have signed asking for the old posts to be left in place with new ones installed beside them. This has been carried out in towns and cities across the UK to protect the local heritage.The petition can be found at www.change.org p vale-of-glamorgan-council-save-the-victorian-heritage-of-penarth u .I will continue to work with your local Labour councillors on these issues.

I will challenge other councillors to back it.Earlier on Wednesday, Cllr Gray made a statement to Vale of Glamorgan Councilrsquos Conservative group to say he was resigning.In his statement, he said he had ldquoabsolutely no issue with the manner in which Cllr Bailey was elected as the new leader of the Conservative Group,But he said he is ldquoat least partially at odds with Cllr Bailey on three issues ndash the proposed lsquoclosurersquo of Llancarfan Primary School, the Dinas Powys Bypass and the incinerator in Barry.On the Llancarfan School proposal, which would see the primary moved to a new building in Rhoose, he said: ldquoI seconded a motion to have the executive reopen the issue consultation and this was ignored by the then cabinet but now that this dficult decision has been made I fear that any attempt to articially prop up Llancarfan School will take funding away from the budgets of Penarth schools which is something I will not tolerate.Cllr Gray said heremained ldquounconvinced that the proposed bypass around Dinas Powys, linking Cardf to Barry, ldquois an issue with a large base of support in my ward, and the efforts to give it even more prominence and funding would I believe be to the detriment of the residents of my ward.Vale council has been waiting for more than a year for Welsh Government to decide whether the Barry incinerator needs to carry out an environmental impact assessment before it can operate.Cllr Gray said any efforts to ramp up the councilrsquos rhetoric on the incinerator ldquowould do a disservice to those residents who are passionate about the subject.ldquoRaising  hope for headlines is not the reason I stood for local government and I donrsquot want to mark my success by how many column inches we are able to achieve on a wedge issue, he said.       ,params: .pushHe added:ldquoThe structures around the group that Vince is proposing seemed to be geared up to act as an opposition party and not to focus on the work of delivering core services for the benefit of the most vulnerable members of our society.ldquoI donrsquot expect everyone to agree with my decision and I donrsquot take this decision lightly ndash I am sure that there will be a great number of people who have an opinion on whether I have done the right thing or not.ldquoI need to remain true to myself and my belief in acting as a positive advocate for the residents in my ward ndash the issues that get me out of bed every morning to work hard for the residents in my ward are not the way the press views me but how I can make a positive dference to peoplersquos lives. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log        ,params: .push-- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

And under my leadership, a Conservative administration will proudly put the people of the Vale of Glamorgan first.ldquoNaturally, we are open to working with other councillors who share those ideals.ldquoOthers - including those who resigned from the Conservative party - will have to explain to voters where they stand on these issues - and I would urge them to back us, rather than propping up a Labour administration that was rejected by the Vale at the last election.Cllr Bailey said he had a six-point plan for the Vale.He pledged to deliver the Dinas Powys bypass stop inflation-busting council tax rises scrap proposed parking charges review the local development planto curb inappropriate development protect rural schools and oppose the Barry Biomass plant.Cllr Bailey said that he was also keen to improve engagement with the public, after a series of hugely unpopular decisions taken by the existing cabinet.He said: ldquoDuring the elections in , we promised to build a stronger relationship with local residents by consulting them on key decisions.ldquoUnfortunately, too many people feel that their views are simply being ignored and that Vale consultations are just tick box exercises.

Although a relative newcomer to the site, having previously taught in Newport, it is clear he is immensely proud of the students and staff.ldquoVisitors to the school often comment on the warm, friendly and purposeful environment that exists at Stanwell and, despite its size, they see how the school cares about the inidual child and their progress, he said.ldquoThe schoolrsquos Mission Statement is summarised as lsquoLearning to Excelrsquo and this is the vision for every child, whatever their starting points, interests or talents. The school thrives because we have a fantastic team of teachers, teaching assistants, support staff, parents and governors who help make this vision a reality.ldquoThis is what makes the school so successful because everybody gives so much.Wandering through a theatre the school uses to put on assemblies and biannual productions, Mrs Kynaston pointed out a section of floor that moved away to create an orchestral pit. The production value afforded to every department ndash theatre, maths, sports, English ndash was astounding.ldquoWe try to give our pupils the very best, said Mrs Kynaston. ldquoWe want them to truly reach their potential. To excel.Mr Brown agreed. ldquoOur amazing staff believe in every young personrsquos potential to succeed and really do go the lsquoextra milersquo for pupils, he said. ldquoOur pupils flourish academically but also as well rounded, confident young people ready to contribute to society.The extra-curricular provision at the school is broad and this really helps to develop our students confidence and skills beyond the classroom setting.That extra-curricular provision is a key focus for the school.Lessons finish at .pm, earlier in the day than most other schools, but that affords pupils plenty of time to take on other pursuits.The school offers a huge number of activities, ranging from the expected - rugby, football, hockey, theatre and orchestra - to the esoteric, like German Film Club or Cipher Club.School trips in recent years have taken students to such exotic destinations as Costa Rica, Iceland, Borneo, Morocco, Spain, Germany, France, and Italy, allowing students to soak in culture both at home and abroad.Clearly, a huge pupil base allows for a huge number of options.The schoolrsquos ability to bring such a population to the table, and keep them focussed, has produced excellent results.In the last fty years alone, it has produced Olympians, rugby internationals, Members of Parliament and television presenters.It has ties to Nasa, and men who walked on the moon have visited the school for talks.Its most curious claim to fame comes in the form of a mascot painted on a wall.Emma Davies, a former pupil of the school, had a design chosen as the official Welsh Wenlock ndash the Olympic mascot for the London  games.But Stanwell flourishes academically, as well.In its  GCSE results,  per cent of Stanwell pupils achieved at least their expected grades, compared to  per cent of the rest of Wales. The same story went for maths, with  per cent again hitting their expected target or better, against  per cent of Wales.       ,params: .pushAt A level,  per cent of all grades were A* or A, with  per cent of the year group achieving A* to C overall.A level results put Stanwell students amongst the top performers in Wales, with many iniduals securing exceptional grades.  of themachieved the equivalent of three A grades or better.Three of its pupils went to Oxford University last year, while another earned a place at Cambridge University.Mr Brown said: ldquoWe place a large emphasis on listening to our learners and and our pupils make a dference as leaders in the school, whether itrsquos through well established groups such as our school council, eco-committee or charity committee, or in aspects of teaching and learning where we have subject prefects and learner voice groups.ldquoThey help us evaluate our work as a school and plan for the future.ldquoWhat always comes through is how proud they are of their school.Rightly so. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log        ,params: .push-- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The renaming of our on-air studio to ldquoThe John Wilce Studio was a popular choice to recognise his outstanding dedication.ldquoJune  wouldrsquove been Johnrsquos th birthday, so this we felt really was a fitting tribute and a lovely memorial to all those who knew him, as a constant reminder of his contribution to Radio Glamorgan.Mr Wilce regularly presented on Sunday evenings, often dedicating features to listeners. Without fail he played a Beatles track every time he was on air.When Mr Wilce was off-air, he oversaw and maintained broadcast equipment, actively engaged in fundraising and stood as a trustee, assisting with the day-to-day running of the station.Jamie added: ldquoI speak on behalf of everyone at RG to say it was a privilege to know John, not only as a fellow volunteer but as a friend. He always put everyone  first and his patience was beyond words. His music knowledge was phenomenal and the impact he had on everyone he met, not just at Radio Glamorgan has really come to light since his passing.Michelle Fowler, volunteer services manager at Cardf and Vale University Health Board, said: ldquoItrsquos such a wonderful tribute to rename the studio after John.

We believe it is important that all families feel welcome in the school. Education is a partnership between home and school with a shared responsibility based on trust and mutual understanding and the co-operation and participation of parents with our school in the education of their child is positively encouraged.ldquoA good relationship between school and home builds a childrsquos confidence, aids their learning and helps them to fulfil their potential in all areas.They stressed that the children had an equal say in their education, through the use of techniques like lsquoImmersion Daysrsquo ndash where pupils have a multi-sensory experience of any given topic.These learning opportunities have ied from using LEGO in building new robot designs and solving problems, to visits from STEM experts. businesses and education experts.The pupils develop a basis from these experiences from which to draw questions and interests, while the staff ask for pupilsrsquo ideas about how they would like to learn further.ldquoWe recently we had an Immersion Day on the topic of volcanoes, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoA few of the pupils mentioned ways they would like to learn more about the subject. When we followed their suggestions a few weeks later, they were incredibly enthused ndash it really focuses them, develops their engagement.These pioneering techniques of giving the children an equal say in their education have a proven record.Albert Primary featured in Estynrsquos lsquoRecognising excellence in education and trainingrsquo publication for its innovative approach.The publication said: ldquoThe school provides pupils with an excellent range of high quality learning experiences.Mr Gilbert said: ldquoMost importantly the inspection report captures the ethos of our school and, in particular, it confirmed that we are achieving our aim to make the school a happy and secure place in which pupils grow in confidence and independence.Albert Primary also earned an award for being the top performing primary school in Wales in recognition of their implementation of the Renaissance Reading programme, and the impact it has on their childrenrsquos reading progress.The staff were experienced and enthusiastic. During the tour, I was treated to a brief rehearsal of the schoolrsquos summer production ndash The Lion King. The youngsters performing looked genuinely thrilled to be involved, and were remarkably talented singers.There is plenty of sport provision, with the deceptively spacious grounds playing host to several open tarmac areas and courts. Football, basketball, rounders, cycling and more were on offer, along with chess, drama and music clubs. For those looking to go off school site, Belle Vue Park is feet away from the front entrance, and often works with the school.This year, Albert Primary has been awarded the prestigious Platinum Flag Award after previously gaining three Green Flag Awards thanks to the environmental education programme, Eco-Schools.But no school is without its problems.A major concern for Albert Primary is having to balance a large deficit budget. In order to do so the school has lost a number of agency learning support staff, with the deputy head taking on a greater teaching commitment next year to make up for the shortfall.Another blow came after four years of saving and planning to convert a disused toilet block into a teaching and community centre.The funds, totalling pound,, had to be used to offset the deficit budget instead. The proposal was to refurbish the existing outbuilding to provide a new classroom facility for the oversubscribed main school to use, alongside the community.The governors are currently creating a task group of stakeholders to address future funding sources.But the spirits of the pupils and staff have not been dampened by financial dficulties.ldquoI believe that we are extremely fortunate in Albert Primary to have created such a positive and vibrant environment in which our children can learn, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoIt is the dedication and commitment of its staff and everyone associated with the school that makes Albert Primary the school that it is today ndash successful, happy and continually improving.Albert Primary was founded in  to accommodate all ages of children up to school leaving age.Much of its original character has been preserved and it now holds Grade  listed status. The school has some unusual Victorian artwork by Norton Nante and parts of the school were designed by highly respected Victorian architect J Coates Carter.A Victorian mural on the front of the building shows several children hard at work. One of them is holding a pet mouse on a lead.It is clear that this quirky attitude to learning has been present and successful in the school for a long time.Long may it last. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Abandoned - BlissThe first dog to arrive at the centre was -year-old Spaniel Grace, found by a member of the public at the side of the road. She was taken to the vet immediately, but after an owner didn’t come forward, she was brought to Dogs Trust.Two weeks ago, another Spaniel - aged eight and nicknamed Bliss by the team - was found tied to a fence not far from the rehoming centre. Like Grace, the Spaniel has not been microchipped, which has been a legal requirement for all dogs since  and the easiest way to identy a dog who has become separated from their owner. Shockingly just one week later, a Cairn Terrier - less than a year old, was found by a rehoming centre staff member at the very same spot where Bliss was left. Terrier Rizzo was lucky to be found as she is quite small and it would have been easy to miss her in the long grass.The most recent addition to the ranks of abandoned pooches is Sally, an eight-year-old Collie cross, who was found as a stray by a member of the public and brought to the rehoming centre.Abandoned - RizzoOonagh Philips, Rehoming Centre Manager said: “We want to remind anyone who no longer feels that they can care for their dog to contact their local rescue organisation for support. When a dog is abandoned on the road side, it not only puts them in danger, but also drivers. We are so thankful that all four of these dogs were found when they were.“Grace and Bliss were very shaken up by their ordeal when they came into our care and it took them a couple of days to build trust around people again. We could tell Rizzo hadn’t eaten in a while, which could have resulted in a deterioration of her physical health. Sally is incredibly sweet natured, and just like the others, will make a wonderful addition to the right home.“We are not sure why there has been a recent influx in dogs being abandoned. We always remind people that ‘A Dog is for Le®’ but we understand that le happens, and places like Dogs Trust are there to support any dog owner who experiences a bump in the road and needs our help. Sometimes the most responsible thing we can do as a dog owner is admit that we aren’t coping with our pets, but it is important to ensure they are kept safe and not left to fend for themselves.”If you

Glandore offers its members a wide iety of flexible office space, co-working and hot-desking – designed so companies can grow organically. But it’s also focused on bringing its members together, connecting indigenous and international firms, while also considering wellness in the workplace, and improving its green credentials. Clare Kelly is a director of the family business – a qualied occupational therapist and Trinity College graduate, who joined Glandore in .She’s now tasked with focusing on the key marketing and business development elements of the burgeoning company – attracting and retaining members, and ensuring there remains a strong pipeline of clients.“We offer our members a erse range of services,” Clare tells Ulster Business. That includes short-term hot-desking for small businesses with just a handful of employees, to providing flexible high-end office space for companies with dozens, or hundreds of workers.”And while the flexibility allows firms to scale from small numbers to a larger workforce – taking short-term space for as little as just three months – Clare says many of the companies stay for several years, orto Glandore further down the line in their own business journey.“We also host a range of events, and can bring everyone together through the network of our members. That has allowed us to cater from very early start-ups, right through to the largest multi-national company, or scaling FDI business,” Clare says.“The dference with Glandore is the flexibility. A company may wish to bring in one or two people, and then concentrate on recruitment – but they can then scale with their growth, from say  to  people. “That flexibility and scale is key. In terms of Glandore, we are offering high quality space, but also offering a range of business services to our members.”Across its two Belfast city centre flexible workspace buildings, Glandore’s expanding network means it can now host around  members – with locations at Arthur House and the nearby Arthur Place.It has six locations in Dublin, including the Silicon Docks and Central Business District, and has boasted a long list of foreign direct investment firms, including Facebook, Twitter, Dropbox and Smartbox, and has also opened its newest office space building in Cork city.Glandore has forged strong relationships with Invest NI – helping provide high-end working environments for rapidly expanding FDI businesses – along with Belfast City Council, the Belfast Chamber and Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry.Some of its high profile international current, or former members, include cyber-security experts Rapid , digital marketing firm Bazaarvoice and global payments giant Cayan – a company which has now expanded into its Belfast headquarters at City Quays.The quality and bespoke nature of the offices are part of what helps Glandore stand out from the crowd. Clare says firms are able to specy exactly what they want, with a top-end design and fit-out team on hand to develop a specic working environment for each business.“When Glandore was set up by Michael in , he always focused on a high quality working environment,” Clare says. “We take premium office space in premium locations, and there is no expense spared in fit-out.“We provide a bespoke set up – whether they need a co-working space or a virtual office, for example. We can tailor that for each business. It’s not a cookie-cutter approach.”And while she says design and the aesthetics are important, behind the decor is the IT and security infrastructure to ensure that guests have the very best available to them.“We have always invested heavily in our network, and have our own on-site IT. We have an IT director, manager and team – so there is support even before day one. All of these things are important to firms of all sizes.”For Glandore, it’s not simply about putting guests on seats – there’s much more to the offering. “We have such a erse mixture of companies in the network and community, and we are able to mix the indigenous firms with the international companies, and actively, facilitate connections between our members.”That includes an alumni programme, which sees members past and present ing to celebrate their successful partnerships.“We bring back customers from the last  years, and representatives from Invest NI and Belfast City Council. It’s about making the connections between the current scaling members and those which have come before,” Clare says.“That support is invaluable. It can be very isolating in the those days when you are setting up, so it’s great to have someone you can bounce ideas off.”Glandore goes further still, with the introduction of both the Glandore Wellness Programme and Glandore Green Initiative – the latter focused on creating a greener and more sustainable office space.“We have been working with these companies for several years, and we get a bird’s-eye view,” Clare says. “One thing we have been very mindful of is the need for us to support from a wellness perspective.“We offer a complimentary wellness programme, which started in , long before it became a buzzword. It offers a way for our members to connect with each other, and help in retaining talent.”And while almost every business has experienced some Brexit-related impact, Clare says Glandore has reached its highest occupancy rate in its history – rising to % in Belfast.“It has been a very uncertain time and that has impacted businesses across Northern Ireland. There have been some delays in regards to FDI, but our hats go off to Invest NI which still attracting businesses into Northern Ireland.”And while there’s also scope for further growth in Belfast, there’s potential for that demand to move outside Belfast, with a potential to grow into the North West.“The hope is to continue our expansion as an all-island business, having operated on both sides of the border for  years, with capacity to grow the businesses in Belfast.“With the likes of Derry, that would be something on the agenda for Invest NI as part of its remit to win investment for outside Belfast. We will take the lead from the councils and from Invest NI, and we will look to see where we can add. If there isn’t space for a business to land, people will go where.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/bbobb.jpg","title":"coffee chain bob and berts creating  new jobs","story":"Posted on Monday  June  by John Mulgrew A Northern Ireland coffee shop chain is creating  new jobs as its expands it reach across the UK with eight new stores, it has emerged.
