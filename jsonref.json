Olsen’s UK Head Office has been sent to the island to assist these guests while we secure a new departure date for their cruise.           It comes after the MSC Meraviglia was turned away from two ports in the Jamaica and the Cayman Islands after a crew member fell sick         The Meraviglia was eventually allowed to dock in Cozumel, Mexico (pictured), on Friday after the crew member and another passenger tested negative for coronavirus\u0027We are keeping all guests, both on board and ashore, fully informed at all times.\u0027We believe that the refusal for us to commence debarkation operations in the Port of La Romana was the result of a very small number of influenza-like cases on board. \u0027Our medical team has confirmed that they are all feeling better. \u0027No guests or crew are, or have been, displaying symptoms that are considered to be consistent with those of coronavirus.\u0027  The cruise line\u0027s website shows the ship was due to dock in the Dominican Republic to drop off a load of passengers after a 14-day voyage.It would then pick up another load and set off on a new cruise on Thursday night.The MSC Meraviglia did eventually dock at Mexico\u0027s Caribbean island of Cozumel on Thursday and President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said passengers would be allowed to disembark,Mr Lopez Obrador said Mexico had to act with \u0027humanity\u0027 after the ship was refused entry at ports in Grand Cayman and Jamaica.The cruise line had expressed frustration with the rejections, which came after it reported one crew member from the Philippines was sick with common seasonal flu. It said no passengers had shown evidence of the covid-19 virus.\u0027The ship is being allowed to dock and the passengers, those who are aboard the cruise ship can disembark,\u0027 Mr Lopez Obrador said, adding that health inspections will be carried out.         It also comes after a coronavirus outbreak on board the Diamond Princess ship (pictured) sickened almost 700 amid a failed attempt to confine people to their cabins         Six people - including a British man - have died after catching coronavirus on board the vessel, before being evacuated (file image)\u0027We cannot act with discrimination,\u0027 he said. \u0027Imagine if a ship arrived and it wasn\u0027t even allowed to dock, and they were told, \u0027Keep going on your way, see where you can dock.\u0027 That is inhuman.\u0027He added: \u0027We cannot close our ports, nor can we close our airports.\u0027\u0027Imagine the desperation and everything it implies, almost 5,000 people on a ship and they cannot get off,\u0027 he said. \u0027Why such backward attitudes?\u0027The case of the Meraviglia illustrated the crisis of nerves over the virus. Mexico has no confirmed cases and MSC Cruises said the crew member had only common seasonal flu, had been placed in isolation and had \u0027nearly recovered\u0027.Local media showed a small knot of Cozumel residents near the cruise ship dock demanding that passengers not be allowed to disembark, citing fears about potential contagion or effects on the tourism-dependent economy.Just minutes after Mr Lopez Obrador spoke on Thursday, the governor of the Quintana Roo state, where Cozumel is located, confirmed the ship had docked, but said \u0027no authorisation has been given\u0027 yet for passengers to disembark.Governor Carlos Joaquin wrote that health inspections would have to be carried out first."},{"url":null,"title":"Women mysterious condition sleep 36 hours","story":"Share this article While parents need to be aware of the risks this poses, the vast majority will, in adulthood, become more responsive to sounds designed to wake them. But a few — such as Paula — won’t.Dr Irshaad Ebrahim, a specialist neuro-psychiatrist and clinical director at the London Sleep Centre, says Paula is far from alone in suffering from ‘sleep inertia — a condition in which the brain’s drive for sleep overwhelms the drive for wakefulness’.‘There could be a number of causes, from an underlying disorder, such as sleep apnoea, or problems with sleep quality so that the brain feels it needs to stay asleep to get a sufficient amount,’ says Dr Ebrahim.‘Otherwise, it might be down to a circadian rhythm disorder, which puts those affected into a deep sleep phase — which usually happens in the first two to three hours of the night — at the wrong part of the sleep cycle.’Paula did seek help from her GP a couple of years ago, after sleeping through a day’s work when Mark was not around to wake her, and after blood tests came back normal, was given a clean bill of health.Since then, she’s tried everything from going to bed early, to exercising in the evening, meditating, using a sun lamp and even leaving the curtains open. Nothing works.         She finds it hard to accept the severe fatigue syndrome syndrome because once up and about, she is very active, working as a fitness coach, mentoring women in their homes, via the internet, all over the worldMost evenings, she turns in at around 10pm and has to be physically dragged from sleep ten hours later, at 8am, often after music producer Mark, 41, has spent more than an hour trying to wake her.Paula has had problems waking for as long as she can remember. Her mother says that, even as a baby and toddler, she could ‘sleep round the clock’ and it was always a huge problem getting her up for school in the mornings.Although her loved ones try to be understanding, her nocturnal habits have been a source of great tension over the years.Six years ago, Paula had enjoyed a night out with her sister, Petra, who was staying with her, and a group of friends. Towards the end of the evening, Paula — who hadn’t been drinking — was ready to go home, while Petra wanted to stay a little later. So Paula caught a taxi home, fully expecting to still be awake by the time her sister returned, so she could let her in.When Petra got back, however, Paula was already fast asleep and, despite banging on the door, until a neighbour threatened to ring the police, and calling her mobile 50 times, Petra could not rouse her.‘There were no hotels nearby, so my poor sister ended up spending the night in a photobooth at a nearby train station,’ says Paula, still shamefaced at the memory. ‘It was January and by the time I opened the door to her the following day she was like a drowned rat and frozen to the bone.‘She was so angry she slapped me across the face and didn’t speak to me for weeks. In fact, it’s still a bone of contention between us as she can’t understand how anyone could sleep through all that.’         Paula Stewart, 38, is \u0027entirely reliant on my partner to physically wake me, otherwise I would, quite literally, sleep all day\u0027. As a student, she managed to sleep through an alarm and evacuation of her residencePaula has also left her business partner, Layla, in the lurch by sleeping the day away, instead of turning up for meetings she has arranged at their offices.‘Layla has always been understanding, up to a point,’ says Paula. ‘But it’s so embarrassing having to admit that the reason I’ve let people down is because I can’t do that most basic thing that others seem to find so easy and wake up in the mornings.’Left to her own devices, she can sleep for an unbroken 36 hours, although she says she never wakes feeling refreshed.One weekend last year when Mark was away, she slept through the whole of Saturday — going to bed at 11.30pm on Friday night and not waking until 9.30am on Sunday. She was shocked to discover she’d lost a day when she came to.She felt dehydrated, and needed the loo, but neither of those discomforts had disturbed her enough to wake her.Paula has always assumed she was alone with her sleep problems, but it turns out there are others like her.Mother-of-two Liz Dowse, 38, from Chelmsford, Essex, says chronically heavy sleeping has dogged her entire life. Even as a toddler she would sleep until midday.Every night she sets 15 alarms on her mobile phone, which she keeps right beside her bed, then sleeps through each one in turn.It is only because husband, Matt, 42, a manager for a dry-cleaning machinery firm, repeatedly shouts at her until she’s physically up and standing by the bed, that she manages to function, and embrace the day at all. The whole process can take up to an hour. ‘Thankfully Matt is understanding of what we refer to as my “condition”.         ‘Other people may think I’m just idle, but when I fall asleep it’s honestly like I go into an unconscious state and, when I finally wake up, I’m in a sheer panic, with no idea what day or time it is.’Unsurprisingly, it fell to Matt to wake his wife to feed their children — Teddy, 13, and Francesca, eight — when they were babies.There have been embarrassing episodes when she’s been away from home, too. One night, Liz — who hardly ever drinks alcohol, in case it exacerbates her sleep problems, and is not on any medication — was working away and staying in a hotel where the fire alarm went off.While every other guest came to — it’s hard to imagine how anyone wouldn’t, given that it was also accompanied by the bedside phone ringing and ceiling lights flashing — and evacuated the hotel, Liz was totally oblivious.‘I finally woke to find several firefighters around my bed,’ she recalls. ‘It was so humiliating. I could see from all the missed calls that my boss at the time, who was also staying at the hotel, had been repeatedly calling my mobile.’Liz, a size 6 to 8, has had various blood tests and health checks to rule out such things as an underactive thyroid or anaemia, which could make her tired and has been told by one doctor that she has ‘severe fatigue syndrome’.Having Googled it and only been able to find ‘chronic fatigue syndrome’ — a condition said to render sufferers exhausted the whole time — she finds it hard to accept that as a possible diagnosis because once up and about, she is very active, working as a fitness coach, mentoring women in their homes, via the internet, all over the world.Dr Neil Stanley, resident expert for Sleepstation, an online programme to tackle insomnia, has another theory. When we sleep, we go through various cycles of deep and lighter sleep.While most people are difficult to wake during their deep sleep phase, when the body and brainwaves slow down, these normally occur in the middle of the night, and few experience it so close to the end of a cycle.         There is an increasing number of women who suffer sleep (stock image) inertia - \u0027a condition in which the brain’s drive for sleep overwhelms the drive for wakefulness’, according to Dr Irshaad Ebrahim, a specialist neuro-psychiatrist and clinical director at the London Sleep Centre‘So it may be that these women are not in deep sleep but in dreaming sleep and the signal from their alarm is not sufficiently intrusive to wake them, because they might just incorporate that noise into their dream,’ says Dr Stanley.Lynette Morse, 38, from Glasgow, who has missed foreign holidays and family funerals — as well as sleeping through an earthquake — feels she has tried everything in her power to be able to get out of bed in the mornings.Having been to her GP numerous times about her problem, to no avail, kept diaries of everything she does and eats, changed her routines, including the times she goes to bed and aims to get up, she is wholly reliant on partner of eight years. Cameron, a careers adviser, to wake her.He sets an alarm for ten minutes earlier than he needs to get up and dedicates that time to waking Lynette. ‘I’ve had alarms on my mobile phone, ones that vibrate and radio alarms, but none of them wake me,’ says Lynette who, like Paula and Liz, rarely drinks alcohol and is not on any medication. ‘I need someone repeatedly calling my name, and taking the covers off me, until I eventually come to.         Problems with sleeping (file image) mean an inidual\u0027s brain might feel it needs to stay asleep for a sufficient amount or they could suffer an underlying condition such as sleep apnoea, Dr Irshaad Ebrahim added. Circadian rhythm disorder, which puts those affected into a deep sleep phase usually happens in the first couple of hours ‘Cameron puts music on, continues shouting my name and then lets our cat in, who’s big and climbs on top of me and starts pawing at my face, so it’s a mixture of these things that finally means I can put my feet on the floor.‘I think Cameron thought I was exaggerating the extent of my problem at first and, maybe in the first couple of months he got frustrated, but now he accepts that I cannot wake up without his help. I’m hugely grateful to him but being so totally reliant on someone else makes me anxious. I often think: “What would happen if he became ill in the night? How long would it be before I was aware?”.‘I’m always Googling to see if there’s some new pill or technology to help people like me and I once joined an online group for heavy sleepers, but got frustrated and left because no one had any solutions.’Like Paula, Lynette, who runs a web-based business from home, selling baby clothes, told Cameron early in their relationship that she didn’t want children, partly because of her ‘sleep problem’ which she says would make motherhood ‘very challenging indeed’.When she was living alone, Lynette missed a family holiday to Tenerife, waking three hours after the flight had taken off, despite countless calls to her mobile from her frantic parents at the airport.When her cousin died, Lynette was ‘utterly mortified’ to sleep through the 11am funeral. She was also horrified when a neighbour told her that she’d caught a would-be burglar trying to kick in her front door the previous night — Lynette had slept through it.More alarming still, years ago when on holiday Lynette was dead to the world when an earthquake struck in Marmaris, Turkey, causing her hotel to rock on its foundations. Fortunately, she was with her parents who insisted the manager unlock her hotel room door so that they could wake their daughter during the evacuation.\u0027It’s gone down in family folklore that not even an earthquake, measuring a terrifying 5.6 on the Richter scale, can wake me.’So next time you’re tossing and turning in the middle of the night, cursing the fact you can’t get back to sleep, spare a thought for the super slumberers — who’d give anything to be able to wake up. "},{"url":null,"title":"Heavier new cars pump CO2 older models","story":"Share this article Mid-size petrol SUVs, which covers vehicles of the size of the Nissan Qashqai, rose by 20.4 per cent – up from 157.6gkm to 189.8g.The worst-performing group were the large petrol-hybrid cars, which are the size of the BMW 3 Series. These recorded an average increase of 31.7 per cent – up from 89.2gkm to 117.4g. All car models analysed were subjected to the same tests, in lab-controlled conditions.Which? said its analysis was more realistic than official tests because cars are run through an additional tough motorway cycle. They are loaded with 200kg, with the air-con and radio switched on, which better reflects everyday use.         The small petrol cars category, which covers those the size of a Ford Fiesta or Volkswagen Polo, saw an average increase of 11.2 per cent – up from 131gkm to 145.7g (stock image)On a positive note, the Which? analysis found emissions linked to harming human health – NOx (oxides of nitrogen) and CO (carbon monoxide) – have reduced dramatically. In petrol cars, the level of CO emissions has dropped by 40.6 per cent. Across all diesel vehicles, the decrease in NOx was an average of 84 per cent.The editor of Which? magazine, Lisa Barber, said: ‘It is shocking to see our tests uncover increasing levels of carbon dioxide emissions for the latest cars that are being built and sold to UK consumers.‘Manufacturers must ensure that they are doing everything in their power to create cleaner vehicles that are fitter for our planet and its future.’But the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders rejected the findings. Chief executive Mike Hawes said: ‘Only the official, Europe-wide WLTP test... can be relied upon by consumers to accurately compare vehicles on a like-for-like and repeatable basis.‘This shows that new cars emit, on average, some 29.3 per cent less CO2 than models produced in 2000, the effect of which drivers can see at the pump.’"},{"url":null,"title":"UK schools close TWO MONTHS plan contain coronavirus","story":"Share this article            David posted a picture of his wife, Sally, also getting treated.

Mr Levy\u0027s interview came at the time of the poisoning in Salisbury of Russian Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia.

But, ahead of a Tate Britain show, we look at the pictures that were deemed just too outrageous. WARNING: explicit contentA woman who is naked except for fancy stockings touches what the artist calls her “coynte” while a winged cupid teases her bottom with a powder puff. A wizened man admires a young man’s elephantine erection, the glans as big as his bald head – all delineated in sharp black outlines and shadowed with inky pools against expanses of white. These are a few of the many explosions of obscenity that a slender, pale young man created in the room he checked into at the Spread Eagle hotel in Epsom, Surrey, in June 1896.The drawings Aubrey Beardsley completed in this suburban hideaway were to illustrate the ancient Greek comedy Lysistrata by Aristophanes. The works, that can be perused at your leisure in Tate Britain’s forthcoming exhibition, had an incalculable effect on the birth of modern art. Beardsley’s eroticism would soon be emulated all over Europe by revolutionaries such as Klimt, Schiele and Picasso, while James Joyce summed up his impact on modernism in a double entendre: “Kunstfull”.That isn’t generally how this unique artist is remembered, though. Beardsley is pigeonholed as a preciously eccentric purveyor of late-Victorian erotica. Rediscovered in the 1960s, when both Victoriana and sex were fashionable, he hovers in the subconscious of British art. His name sounds posh, which adds to the air of whimsy, but he was born into an economically unstable lower-middle-class family in Brighton in 1872 and left school aged 16.Beardsley was an insurance clerk before being discovered by Oscar Wilde’s first male lover, Robert Ross. This led to an artistic collaboration with Wilde, but his importance goes far beyond the aesthetic movement. He put sexuality at the centre of modern art for the first time, spreading his influence across Europe – to Vienna, Paris and Barcelona – 25 years before surrealism.Then in 1895, a year before he settled in at the Spread Eagle, Beardsley’s world fell apart. Wilde was arrested and charged with gross indecency. The author’s love for Lord Alfred Douglas became a scandal and anyone associated with him was suspected of sodomy. Beardsley, at the age of 22, had been chosen by Wilde to illustrate the printed edition of his disturbing drama Salome. Following that success, he became art editor, designer and illustrator of the Yellow Book, a bestselling magazine that brought avant garde ideas into respectable homes. But when Wilde fell, its publisher John Lane sacked him. Beardsley had only recently been able to give up his day job. Now he was vilified and poverty-stricken.The poet WB Yeats, a friend of Beardsley, remembered him looking into a mirror shortly after being sacked and saying: “Yes, yes, I look like a sodomite ... but no, I am not that.” The man in the mirror was an exquisite dandy: when Beardsley became a star in 1890s London, he started wearing suits in subtly contrasting shades of grey with yellow gloves over his ethereally thin figure. Yet there is no evidence that he ever went to bed with anyone of any gender – except maybe, biographers speculate, his sister, Mabel.And here Mabel is, naked in a back room at Tate Britain. To get a sneak peak at Beardsley’s drawings, I’ve visited the museum’s Prints and Drawings Rooms. The frontispiece he designed for the collected plays of a now-forgotten writer rests on a wooden stand. Mabel Beardsley is the nude at the far left, with layers of radiating hair that look like they belong in a psychedelic poster. She is looking ecstatically at Wilde, who stands beside her dressed as the ancient wine god Bacchus. In front of them is a goat-legged faun.Sex is Beardsley’s theme and, unprovable allegations aside, it seems to have existed for him only on paper. That makes him an artist for our time. Long before the virtual and fluid sexualities of the 21st century, Beardsley created an erotic fantasy world of shifting identities and infinite variety. His art is one long act of self-pleasuring that reached its consummation on Epsom High Street.His most famous illustration for Wilde’s Salome is actually called The Climax. In this intense symbolist design, Salome has persuaded her stepfather, Herod, to have John the Baptist’s head cut off in return for gratifying his lust with an erotic dance. She can now satiate her own lust for the Baptist – or at least his lips. She floats in the air, seemingly with orgasmic joy, as black blood pours from the fetishised dead head she embraces.Does that seem an over-explicit interpretation of this great fin de siècle image? Well, you should see his rejected designs for Salome. Several scenes were deemed too dirty by the publisher and he was asked to replace them with milder versions. In his original drawing of The Toilet of Salome, a pageboy stands naked holding a tray of tea things. Another near-nude youth sits with his hand between his legs, masturbating as he gazes at the tray-carrier. Meanwhile, Salome also masturbates.Sex is all in the head. That is Beardsley’s message, and the basis of the strange game he played with Victorian censorship. The reason Salome first appeared in English as a book, rather than on stage, was because it was refused a licence by the Lord Chamberlain. Beardsley’s drawings mock the censor by dancing a fine line between innocence and depravity. The publisher accepted his vision of Salome’s love of a severed head, but rejected his drawing of her sitting with her back to us in a dressing gown that’s open. What was the problem? She holds a conductor’s baton.Before he got sacked from the Yellow Book, Beardsley filled the widely read magazine with similar suggestiveness. His illustration A Night Piece shows a woman in a long black dress and gloves and a thin black ribbon round her white throat walking down a dark city street – she is, in Victorian parlance, a woman of the night. In another picture, called L’Éducation Sentimentale, a young woman is listening attentively to her older friend. Both have tough, pinched faces. It’s not a sentimental but a sexual education set in a brothel.Beardsley pictured his audience as young women. On the cover he designed for the Yellow Book’s publicity leaflet, his imagined female reader studies the latest volumes outside a bookshop. She looks rapt, for Beardsley depicts reading itself as the most subversive of pleasures. In his revised version of The Toilet of Salome, she has Émile Zola’s novel Nana on her bookshelves – a “dirty French novel”, as Lou Reed would later put it. The Yellow Book was yellow to evoke the typical covers of sexy French fiction. Wilde wrote Salome in French, intoxicated by the writings of Flaubert, Huysmans and Baudelaire. Beardsley was equally au fait, regularly taking the boat train to Paris. French artists loved him back: Toulouse-Lautrec ordered three copies of his illustrated Salome.When Beardsley checked in to the Spread Eagle hotel, he’d just come back from Brussels, another capital of fin de siècle culture. There he probably encountered the explicit art of Félicien Rops, including his 1878 gouache Pornocrates, in which a pig is held on a leash by a naked woman wearing a blindfold and black stockings. On the way back from the Belgian capital, Beardsley fell seriously ill. It was to get out of London’s smog that he fled to Epsom. He had known since he was diagnosed with tuberculosis when he was seven years old that his life would be limited. In the two years following his stay in Epsom, he would travel to France in search of better health, dying at Menton on the Riviera in 1898, aged 25.As his young life entered its premature twilight, he found sensual solace in Aristophanes’ Lysistrata, a play about love defeating death – or, in Greek, Eros defeating Thanatos. Aristophanes wrote it during a murderous war between Athens and Sparta that seemed to have no end. He imagines the women of both cities refusing to have sex with their husbands to stop the war. Beardsley turns this sex strike into an orgiastic triumph of lust over despair. Even as they listen to a speech, his Greek women can’t stop fondling each other. A Spartan woman gleefully taunts her lust-crippled husband with her body. Men gather in a mass display of monumental members.We tend to analyse erotic art in terms of power, but for Beardsley it was quite simply a matter of life and death.• Aubrey Beardsley is at Tate Britain, London, 4 March to 25 May."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0082ad7c3efeca1539f349b5c32d10fe4b1ad547/0_762_12150_7290/master/12150.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0fcf5d688a2b4a286cffadd4f1205ec5","title":"own a guardian classic photograph abandoned car peak district 1979","story":"This week’s photograph in our weekly archive print series is a wintry image of a Mini abandoned in the snow and surrounded by sheep, shot by Don McPheeA Mini appears to have careered off the road and been abandoned in heavy snow near Buxton, in Derbyshire.  photographer Don McPhee captured the image in January 1979.

After I finished Lucy Ellmann’s Ducks, Newburyport – a single-sentence stream of consciousness set entirely within the mind of an Ohio housewife – I experienced a comedown. Her unnamed protagonist starts every new thought with “the fact that”, a banal phrase that felt like an exposed secret whenever I spotted it in the wild. Scrolling through examples of the clickbait that litter her thoughts (“Dog Sees Himself On TV And Freaks Out”), absurdist headlines took on a new profundity. When I finished it, I missed her.It’s one thing to read Ellmann’s 1,030-page novel it’s another to read it aloud. When tiny press Galley Beggar signed Ducks, Newburyport, they didn’t give much thought to an audiobook, says co-founder Sam Jordison. It still didn’t have an audio publisher when it was nominated for the 2019 Booker prize – but as the Royal National Institute of Blind People (RNIB) makes all shortlisted titles available to members of its library, it commissioned US actor Stephanie Ellyne to tackle the challenge.Ellyne spent almost two months recording the book, and it left a strong impression. As the housewife contemplates violence – historic, domestic, political – she started feeling “more emotional and upset about news coming out of America, the hideous political situation there,” she says. “One thing that was helpful was that I share a lot of those ideas – there’s really troubled times in the States at the moment.”For 45 hours and 34 minutes, Ellyne reads Ellmann’s text in a calm, bemused voice that recalls Laurie Anderson’s spoken-word work. During recording, she averaged 41 pages per hour, though the work continued away from the microphone. Every night, Ellyne would read and research the following day’s pages, working out how to pronounce the thousands of place names and obscure historical battles in US history. “My engineer and I wondered if some of them were fictional, but sure enough, they’re true,” says Ellyne. “The violence in America – all these shootings – isn’t new.”The audiobook wasn’t initially intended as a commercial project. But then Red Szell, co-presenter of RNIB’s audiobook podcast Read On, met Ellmann and her husband Todd McEwen at a Booker prize event and got talking. It turned out that McEwen’s mother is blind, so Szell invited them to the recording. “I was a bit apprehensive,” says Ellyne. “The writer might absolutely hate what you’re doing! But fortuitously she and her husband seemed to really like it.”Ducks, Newburyport’s heft has become rather mythological. “So many male reviewers have complained about this book’s size that I fear male upper body strength may not be all it’s cracked up to be,” Ellmann told the Independent. But for anyone still daunted, listening might offer a solution, says Smith. “With a digital audiobook you don’t always notice how long a book is, and something that might look experimental on the page sounds totally natural when read aloud.” In a way, she says, Ducks, Newburyport may be perfectly suited to the format. “The idea of listening to someone’s innermost thoughts is intriguing. The further we get into the protagonist’s head, the more powerful the experience becomes. It gives a surreal sense of immediacy, and an intense need to keep listening – to stick with her and find out what happens.”WF Howes is expecting a good response when the audiobook is released this week. But will anyone attempt it for screen or stage? The rights haven’t been sold yet, says Kirsty McLachlan of David Goodwin Associates, who thinks “it would be a fascinating book to adapt”.“One of the many things that really matters about Ducks, Newburyport is the way it gives voice and space to that wonderful female narrator,” says Jordison. “And having a middle-aged, struggling woman, living a deep and interesting intellectual life at home in the midwest would be pretty radical for Hollywood.”He admits that the matter is out of his hands, but is enthusiastic about translating the book to film. “Or,” he says, “even better: a two-billion-part Netflix series detailing every single thought in the narrator’s head.”• The audiobook of Ducks, Newburyport is published by WF Howes, available through Audible.

The reduction in demand has accelerated significantly following the increase in COVID-19 cases in Europe, particularly the spread of the virus to Tenerife.Whilst this reduction in demand has led to a natural reduction in marketing spend, the Board does not now expect the Group to achieve payback in the current financial year on its previously outlined strategic marketing investment.With less than 10 minutes until Wall Street opens, the future market is predicting fresh heavy falls.

Bubonic plague is thought to have been carried to this remote corner of Derbyshire from London back in the 1660s by infected fleas, trapped in a bale of fabric ordered to make costumes for a festival. The sickness spread fast, killing dozens of villagers and leaving many on the verge of fleeing in panic – but then something extraordinary happened.The rector of Eyam, believing it his duty to spare neighbouring towns from infection, persuaded his parishioners to take the astonishingly self-sacrificing step of sealing themselves off from the world. They would live or they would die, but nobody would leave until the sickness had burned itself out. One mother is said to have buried six of her children, yet by staying must have saved countless other women from the same fate.It’s impossible to read the story of Eyam without wondering who on earth would be capable of such selflessness now. When it came to the crunch, how many of us would secretly have more in common with the local squire, who fled after the first few deaths and left his neighbours to their fate? Compared with 17th-century peasants, modern Britons simply aren’t enormously used to the idea of sacrifice for the supposed collective good.Doing whatever is necessary to stop the virus spreading is, much like vaccinating your kids against measles, not just about protecting your own interests but putting the wellbeing of the herd first. The trouble is that we all know what has happened to vaccination levels across the west, as a minority of parents seemingly decided the herd was someone else’s problem.Are we really ready for a pandemic? Not so much for the virus itself as the personal sacrifices and inconveniences that might follow a serious outbreak: for lockdowns and school closures, empty streets and cancelled holidays, perhaps even factory shutdowns and shortages in the shops if there is serious disruption to global supply chains. The word “quarantine” sends a particularly medieval shiver down the spine because it means being trapped where the infection is – like the tourists now confined to a Tenerife hotel after an Italian guest tested positive – when instinct tells you to flee. But even self-isolation, or voluntarily shutting yourself away at home, as the government recommends here for those potentially exposed to the virus, will be hard on self-employed people who don’t get sick pay, and those in jobs so precarious they don’t want to risk taking 14 days off.If NHS beds come under intense pressure, difficult choices may have to be made. Yet it’s hard to imagine the spirit of Eyam prevailing when ministers have already had to invoke draconian emergency powers to prevent a man rescued from coronavirus-stricken Wuhan leaving quarantine in a Merseyside hospital.China’s solution to this dilemma has been the kind of brutally sweeping measures that perhaps only the most authoritarian of states could muster: sealing off whole cities, banning travel, knocking up new hospitals in days and reportedly even nailing victims’ front doors shut, in some cases, to stop them venturing out. The virus now seems to be peaking in China. Yet what can be made to work in a society where everyone fears the consequences of disobeying authority, and where the concept of collective sacrifice for the communal good is drummed in from childhood, won’t translate easily to European democracies.So far, Britain has opted more for keeping calm and carrying on, bearing in mind the World Health Organization’s warning that this is about containing the social and economic damage caused by mass outbreaks, as well as saving lives. Japan is closing all its schools but the health secretary, Matt Hancock, was clear, when briefing MPs on Wednesday, that this government would seek to keep schools open wherever it could. The scientific advice is seemingly that the economic and social disruption caused by widespread closures, which stop parents going to work, isn’t worth it at this stage.The unspoken fear is obviously that there may be more than enough economic disruption as it is, with efforts to contain the virus hampering the free movement of goods and people around the world. The modern equivalent of Eyam’s bolt of cloth is lorry drivers shuttling between factory depots, or middle managers flying to and from meetings, meeting and greeting and sneezing and coughing as they go. Airlines freezing recruitment, restaurants reporting cancellations and factories running low on parts are only the most visible signifiers of what may be to come.But when the WHO urges countries to step up preparations, it isn’t just talking about hospital beds and economic resilience and endlessly reminding people to wash their hands. This isn’t just a test of clinical resources but a test too, in some ways, of Britons’ willingness to put ourselves out for others. Thankfully, this isn’t another Eyam. But we have a choice about whether to be vicars or squires, all the same."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d254cfdabc75cd5bb4653ee6fbab562efa41a9c9/0_83_3914_2349/master/3914.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=602edcd1d88b5f853899360c97050954","title":"eu british sovereignty britain single market","story":"Access to the single market should be balanced by guarantees on fair competition. That way, we can forge an ambitious future• Amélie de Montchalin is France’s secretary of state for European affairsOn 31 January, the sovereign and democratic choice of the British people came into force. Brexit happened it is now behind us. What did not happen, though, to our mutual relief, is a much-dreaded “cliff-edge”, “hard Brexit”, or “no deal”. In spite of all the drama of the past months, we managed to find a compromise together.Now that the UK has “got Brexit done” I hope that, after such political and media passion, we can go back to reason and restore enough trust in our partnership to build an ambitious relationship. Now that the United Kingdom has left the EU, it has to deal with another fully sovereign power: the European Union. Now that the political phase of Brexit is over, our citizens, our businesses deserve a more pragmatic approach.When we hear Boris Johnson explain with much emphasis how he intends to “take back control”, regain leeway and make UK interests prevail, how should we Europeans respond? Just like British politicians, our responsibility as European public decision-makers is to protect our citizens, who are legitimately concerned about the impact of Brexit.Our 47-year proximity is, and will remain, de facto, a “special relationship”. The UK may seek to develop such ties elsewhere, but the bottom line is that our mutual relationship is irreplaceable. The UK companies I meet tell me just that. They do not want to sever their ties with the EU internal market and its 450 million consumers.How do we meet the expectations of our citizens and industries? In choosing Brexit, the UK unilaterally decided to withdraw from the single market and from many European Union policies. Again it is your choice, but this choice comes with consequences.Like any free trade agreement between sovereign partners, our future relationship has to be a balance of rights and obligations. Unfettered access to the single market can only be granted if balanced by a series of guarantees to maintain fair competition.This is not ideological. Our aim is not to constrain UK sovereignty. Our aim is to provide fair competition to our companies, especially in the fiscal, social, environmental and agricultural domains. To put it bluntly, you do not want American chlorinated chicken entering your market, and we do not want it either.If we want to achieve this together, first do not underestimate our unity as sovereign Europeans. I am not addressing you today as a French minister, but as a European voicing a European position. The 27 member states did not accept any “cherry-picking” or “mini-deals” from the UK side during the first phase of the talks. We stand and will stand behind chief negotiator Michel Barnier on this. The only way to reach a fair agreement is to deal with the EU as a whole.Likewise, we think sustainability is more important than deadlines, and we will be very vigilant about including a sound governance mechanism, to mitigate any potential future violations. We will not lower our level of ambition to meet an artificial deadline. The 10-month deadline is only relevant in terms of the British political agenda. For Europeans, substance is more important than deadlines.From now on, what we need most is mutual trust. It is a precondition for everything else. To us, an important signal in the coming months will be the implementation of the withdrawal agreement, including citizens’ rights, the Northern Ireland protocol and effective controls in the Irish Sea. We are talking about an international treaty: I have no doubt that the UK will fulfil its commitments.We French are among your closest European neighbours. Take this other “special relationship” as an opportunity to build the UK-EU partnership. Let’s not create fake oppositions, let’s not revive artificial fights through the media. Our shared history shows just how much our two nations can achieve when we work together. Without the joint steering forces of France and the UK, we would never have had the Channel Tunnel or Airbus. On both sides of the Channel, we need to make sure that having such common ambitions will be possible in the future.• Amélie de Montchalin is France’s secretary of state for European affairs"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8a9580268f204503870497800e8f488c532bc190/0_119_5877_3526/master/5877.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=263386426ee53899a4cfd21488ebe083","title":"regions london northern cities young people","story":"Northern cities will only flourish when the capital stops stealing their young peopleI recall one word that dominated a business seminar in Manchester some time ago. The seminar was on the north-south ide, and the word was London. It was obsessive. Why does London keep taking our best people, everyone asked? Why do our children all want to get to London?This week’s report by Lord Kerslake on the north-south ide presents the problem in graphic terms. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) shows Britain with the widest regional inequality of any advanced nation. London’s economy is growing at between two and four times the rate of the north. It is blessed with better health, better trains, better skills. The south-east has largely escaped austerity, its public spending rising £2bn in a decade. The north’s has fallen by £6bn. Fixing this gap will require action “on a level with Germany post-unification”, the report says, when trillions were spent over decades on the former east.Some of this gloom is misleading. Surveys claim London is the least happy region in the land, the north far more content. The OECD and the Institute for Fiscal Studies have also shown that inequality in Britain is less between north and south than between particular places. Leeds contrasts with Rotherham. East London is poorer than Harrogate.Kerslake is aware of the need, but he does not address the issue obsessing my Mancunians. To them the issue was London, seen as exciting, creative, rich – an existential menace. Rulers since Elizabeth I have tried to reduce its appeal. She tried to send her courtiers back to their country estates, and failed. London has always been the goose that lays Britain’s golden eggs, and is still – now more than ever.My economics tutor used to warn us that much of what he taught might one day be proved wrong, but he hoped at least to have showed us how to recognise nonsense. A case in point must be Kerslake’s solution to the north, which tallies with Boris Johnson’s old-Labour cliche of “levelling-up”. It lies in vast dollops of public investment in infrastructure, in interconnectivity, skills and “cross-governmental, ministerially led” coordination. This is the same language used by Harold Wilson, Margaret Thatcher, Tony Blair – every prime minister– usually in the year after an election.None of this addresses what Manchester understands, that you will not level up the north without levelling down London. The capital has to reduce its appeal to the north’s most precious resource, its creative talent and entrepreneurial zeal. This requires big regional cities to develop “creative critical mass”. They must treasure their heritage, their converted mills, their historic districts – anything to distract their young people from craving a move to London. This may involve sucking energy from their surrounding towns – as Leeds has from Bradford. Cities such as Frankfurt, Toulouse, Milan and Barcelona have established a cultural self-confidence that has succeeded in resisting the magnetism of their country’s capital. The only city outside London to come near such magnetism is semi-autonomous Edinburgh.In the case of demagnetising London, the task is near insuperable, but it must be attempted. Revival will come from small steps, not giant infrastructures. These steps will never work if they depend on London, on its taxpayers, its civil servants, its government. Dependency economics has been the curse of Scotland and Wales. There is no such thing as public spending-led growth – as has conspicuously failed in eastern Germany. Growth comes from employers and investors being stimulated to exploit local skills and talents. They should pay local taxes and run local government. Northern cities will flourish only when London stops stealing their people, their ideas and their power.If the regions are to rise, London must in some degree fall. It must stop gorging on infrastructure investment – as, mercifully, it may now do on Heathrow expansion. It should stop drawing ever more commuters into its centre, which is what Crossrail and HS2 (now running only to the Midlands) are about. It must stop cramming itself with students, the one truly energising factor in many northern city economies. London’s student fees should soar, and northern ones plummet. The capital should stop receiving the lion’s share of arts subsidy.Kerslake rightly acknowledges that Britain must decentralise government power. But how many times must we hear this trotted out? Experience abroad advises accountable local mayors, delegated taxes, borrowing powers and no more reliance on begging from Whitehall.I believe this will never happen until those with power are physically ejected from the capital. Civil servants and politicians (and journalists) must go north. The increasingly dysfunctional Houses of Parliament should abandon their billion-pound gilded temporary outposts in Westminster, and go north for five years. It would refresh them and it would certainly refresh the nation.Demoting London to promote the regions would not necessarily mean a richer Britain, though the present imbalance must be damaging to national prosperity. Wealth is not the issue. Brexit has shown it is now subservient to populist slogans such as patriotism and group identity. One such “identity” is the north, and it has shown itself politically toxic. The north-south ide must be countered. This will happen only if the “levelling” is real. London should ready itself for a hit."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b010b03d7da67def75bce500a57b1d639bc98cd9/222_378_2208_1324/master/2208.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b947f955f52bbdbb53347b661df6882f","title":"john shuttleworth funniest things","story":"The standup, singer-songwriter and radio presenter on the things that make him laugh the mostI do believe it was a sketch by the late Mike and Bernie Winters in the early 1970s.

They plan to distribute an alternative set of recommendations at a UCL town hall meeting on the inquiry on Friday evening.The inquiry did not investigate London Conference on Intelligence meetings on eugenics, which were run at the university by James Thompson, an honorary senior lecturer who has now been stripped of his title. Speakers at these meetings included white supremacists and a researcher who had previously advocated child rape.Andrew Sabisky, the former No 10 adviser who was forced to step down last week because of a furore around his comments on race and intelligence, was listed as a speaker at an LCI meeting at UCL in 2015. Toby Young was forced to resign as a director of the government’s New Schools Network after it was revealed that he also attended one of the meetings.Joe Cain, a professor of the history and philosophy of biology at UCL and one of the dissenting members of the inquiry committee, said: “I tried really hard to get the London Conference on Intelligence on to the agenda of that committee but I met with a brick wall. We absolutely should have talked about it – but we just didn’t.”The university says it conducted a separate inquiry into how Thompson was able to book meeting rooms without its knowledge – which it is also publishing on Friday – and procedures have now been tightened up.But a second member of the inquiry committee, who asked to remain anonymous, said: “We definitely should have talked about these meetings. But the big issue is not how a member of staff booked a room, but why someone with his views was a member of staff at all.”They added: “I refused to sign the report largely because of its tendentious focus on race. I have no issue with addressing racism, but the fact is that the early eugenicists at UCL were far more focused on targeting people based on things like poverty or disability.”Cain is also concerned that the inquiry did not probe sufficiently deeply into teaching at UCL. He says that although the report asserts that eugenics is not being taught anywhere in the university, the inquiry team did not investigate whether this was the case.“My God, I hope that’s true, but the fact is we didn’t look. I’m sure students would let us know if the sort of crazy eugenics you see in the LCI meetings were being taught, but eugenics can also be much more subtle than that.”Galton coined the term eugenics and endowed UCL with his personal collection, along with an endowment that funded the country’s first professorial chair of eugenics.Cain was one of the first to call for the renaming of university buildings and already refuses to teach in the Galton lecture theatre. He said he was pleased that the inquiry has instructed the university to issue a “meaningful and effective apology” for the hurt that UCL’s involvement in eugenics had caused BME students and academics.“The history of eugenics reminds us about stigmatisation. It says to members of our community ‘you don’t belong here and you aren’t normal’.”Responding to the inquiry’s recommendations, UCL said it was taking action including the funding of new scholarships to study race and racism, a commitment to ensure all UCL students learn about the history and legacy of eugenics, and the creation of a two-year research post to further examine UCL’s history of eugenics.Prof Kalwant Bhopal, the director of the centre for research in race and education at Birmingham University, said the inquiry must not be used as a sticking plaster for racial inequality. “It’s no good just ticking boxes and changing a few names. How will everyday lives change?” she said.Dr Adam Rutherford, a science broadcaster who teaches at UCL and has just written a book on race, said: “What I’m concerned about is that the gloss of renaming buildings will overshadow the big structural issues that really matter, like why is there such an attainment gap between BME and white students? And why are there so few senior BME academics?”Sandy Ogundele, the black and minority ethnic officer at UCL students’ union, said the report’s recommendations were “a significant first step in a long-term process for UCL to make amends for its deeply troubling ties to eugenics.”Prof Michael Arthur, UCL’s provost, said: “We acknowledge that UCL has a problematic history with eugenics which has, and continues, to cause significant concern for many in our community. This past should not be hidden but openly and critically discussed.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a84cd649e594f28952de632d487735a796de1df4/1065_701_746_448/master/746.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=abf22f29d8bed5194fe813d2cdc15539","title":"greta thunberg bristol schools shut students join climate strike","story":"Activist tells crowd of over 20,000: ‘We will not be silenced because we are the change’Tens of thousands of people, many of them children skipping school, braved heavy rain and thick mud to join a climate strike headed by Greta Thunberg in Bristol city centre.The vast crowd fell silent as 17-year-old Thunberg said governments were acting like children so it fell upon youngsters to be “the adults in the room”.Police said there were more than 20,000 at the Bristol Youth Strike 4 Climate event on College Green in the city but organisers estimated the figure to be closer to 30,000.Criticising governments and the powerful, Thunberg said: “Once again, they sweep their mess under the rug for us – young people, their children – to clean up for them.“We must continue and we have to be patient. Remember that the changes required will not happen overnight.”Thunberg arrived in Bristol by train and was driven to the climate strike in a red Nissan Leaf electric car.Wearing a yellow raincoat and woolly hat, she took to the stage to chants of “Greta, Greta” from schoolchildren and teenagers.She told them: “We will not be silenced because we are the change, and change is coming whether you like it or not. This emergency is being completely ignored by the politicians, the media and those in power.“Basically, nothing is being done to halt this crisis despite all the beautiful words and promises from our elected officials. So what did you do during this crucial time? I will not be silenced when the world is on fire.”Thunberg flagged up the recent decision by north Somerset council to oppose Bristol airport expansion as an example of what could be achieved if activists worked together.The Swedish teenager went on to join protesters, including school pupils, on a march through the city centre accompanied by a samba band.Avon and Somerset police had warned of the potential for protesters to be hurt and urged parents not to allow children to go unaccompanied.Bristol Cathedral, which sits on College Green, was ready to open its doors to anyone needing refuge but the organisers insisted they had put measures in place to make sure nobody was hurt.Just before Thunberg’s speech, an incident in the crowd prompted one organiser to call for a stretcher and ambulance from the stage.Isaac and Maya Swann, 11 and 15, had persuaded their mother, Karen Davies, to bring them along. Isaac said: “We wanted to see Greta and to join the march.” Maya said: “We want to help make a change. She’s really brave and inspirational, giving up part of her childhood to spread this message.”Davies said: “I was against them taking time off but last night they came to me and said they felt if I was their age I would be there. They were right. I’d be in the thick of it. I sent an email to the school and they were supportive. I think many schools see it as educational.”Ed Thompson, a housemaster at Clifton college, took overseas boarders aged 11-13 and the school’s “green team” to the event. He said: “We have discussed Greta’s influence in school, and she is a true icon to all ages for her passion, determination, tenacity and likability. The word ‘inspiration’ is too often used, but she is a guiding light to the next generation for peaceful but powerful activism, and encouraging love and care for our environment, which is such a strong message for young people.”The crowd was swollen by many students who missed lectures, tutorials and lab sessions to listen to Thunberg.But it was not just young people who attended . There were groups of doctors, nurses, even a collective of wildlife film-makers.One moment of tension came when police equipped with video cameras moved through the crowd pointing their lenses at strikers, including a group from the Public and Commercial Services Union.Some employers had turned a blind eye to workers who wanted to listen to Thunberg.The green energy company Good Energy from Chippenham in Wiltshire went further, actively telling its 250-strong workforce to join the strike.One of the strikers, Johanna Pettipher, who works as an accounts specialist, said: “Going on climate strike on the direction of Good Energy’s senior team feels like a blessing. In my last job, I had to take a day off work to go to the climate strike in October. Protesting is the best way to tell the world that we are ready for better.”The mayor of Bristol, Marvin Rees, tweeted a picture of the crowds taken from City Hall:"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b378f4c023b111d5f3da82a41af9ebe92f51fcea/0_84_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9654f80540b88b4a922bef114b6b10ed","title":"larva fat sustainable alternative butter cakes","story":"Fat from larvae could be a more sustainable alternative to dairy, say researchersScientists at Ghent University in Belgium are experimenting with larva fat to replace butter in waffles, cakes and cookies, saying using grease from insects is more sustainable than dairy produce.The researchers soak black soldier fly larvae in a bowl of water, put it in a blender to create a smooth greyish dollop and then use a kitchen centrifuge to separate out insect butter.“There are several positive things about using insect ingredients,” said Daylan Tzompa Sosa, who oversees the research.According to the researchers, consumers notice no difference when a quarter of the milk butter in a cake is replaced with larva fat.

Flat at the front, with a tight black panel running from the abdomen to the throat, it puffed out at the hips and lower belly around the curve of a deep scooped bodice.That unfamiliar shape was presented three times, in forest green, cobalt blue and buttercream brocade, on the Loewe catwalk. Other novel shapes followed: three more gowns with tight black bodices, in cinnamon, cream and electric blue, covered the upper torso with a large off-the-shoulder ruffle, and sprouted out, in a cascade of brocade, at the mid-back. Later there were three dresses with drop shoulders, balloon sleeves and a drop waist at the side of which were two pannier-like points of fabric.“I was looking at building new kinds of silhouettes that can work in an abstract world,” said the creative director, Jonathan Anderson, backstage. “I like the idea of creating a totemic look,” he continued, describing it as “a fashion silhouette – pushed and experimental”.Loewe is a brand that is comfortable with weirdness. Its unconventional designs appeal to fashion heads who swoon over challenging shapes the way jazz fans thrill over certain configurations of grace notes. It is not, however, a brand that fills its catwalks with objets d’art designed to provoke thought but not to be worn, in the manner of a label such as Comme des Garçons.Being the ultimate label for the craft-obsessed wealthy gallerist crowd, the Spanish leather house is a huge source of highly covetable handbags – the puzzle and the balloon have become modern classics – and is a reliable source of trends. In a few seasons’ time, will our eyes acclimatise and these shapes end up in our wardrobes? Stranger things have happened.Further luxurious oddities came via a collaboration with the Japanese ceramicist Takuro Kuwata, whose “crater-like, meticulous” designs became “engineered panels” – as Anderson called them – that were embedded into gowns. He also made charms the size of a fist that looked like mutated flower heads, which hung from bags and around the neck of one of the models.There were plenty of more straight-up commercial pieces on the catwalk, too, such as the ruched flamenco bags, the covetable trench coats with thick tweed collars, camel-coloured trapeze coats with contrasting dove grey sleeves and neat black skirt suits with gold-buttoned jackets featuring subtle peplums. The shoes – kitten heels and loafers – looked like commercial winners, coming with bejewelled show clips."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2d1069f471ad09079e8f3d81fa8c1341f6fc71bb/690_574_3256_1953/master/3256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=482bd4296e82aecd66755a37d525afcf","title":"what noma did next new nordic food rene redzepi claus meyer locavore foraging","story":"In our time of climate crisis and inequality, as top chefs dream less of Michelin stars and more of changing the world, the New Nordic movement is reaching beyond haute cuisine into classrooms, supermarkets and parliaments. By  Kieran MorrisFew restaurants have enjoyed as much acclaim and influence, or been as widely caricatured, as the Copenhagen fine-dining institution Noma. In its 16 years of existence, it has been at the top of the World’s 50 Best Restaurants list four times. There are three Noma books, two feature-length films and a Noma documentary series. There are Noma dissertations and dozens of “Nomaheads” – dedicated diners who follow the restaurant all over the world, from Yucatan to Tokyo to Sydney and back again. In the early 2010s, there were so many articles about hunting for wild produce with Noma’s charismatic head chef that one writer declared it “The Era of the ‘I Foraged With René Redzepi’ Piece”. There is even a 240-page travelogue, written by an Esquire editor who followed Redzepi across the world for four years.But all the attention that has been lavished on Noma’s hyperlocal, micro-seasonal food – butterflies moulded from blackcurrant leather 100-year-old mahogany clams served in their shell – has obscured the much more ambitious aims that the restaurant’s creators, alumni and allies have been trying to achieve. Noma as a traditional haute cuisine restaurant, with its elegant cookbooks and high-concept food, is being overtaken by a grander project. The people behind the restaurant are trying to expand New Nordic, a culinary movement they began in Scandinavia 15 years ago, to the rest of the globe. In doing so, they want to transform every link in the long chain of how food is produced and consumed, from the dirt up to your dinner table.The New Nordic movement is bound by a set of 10 principles that stress sustainability, locality and respect for the natural world. Those ideals may sound familiar, but the scale of what its adherents are accomplishing makes New Nordic potentially far more transformative than any previous food movement. It is reaching beyond farms and fine-dining restaurants, and into halls of power, supermarket aisles, canteens and classrooms.Pretty much anywhere in Denmark, you can walk into a supermarket and find ready meals – made with traceable organic produce by co-operative kitchens in Copenhagen – that bear the name of Claus Meyer, Noma’s co-founder. Meyer has also created a food training programme in Denmark’s prisons to reduce reciism, and he is partnering with Ikea – which feeds 660 million people a year, making it one of the 10 largest food-service operations in the world – to “veganise” its menu.Further afield, in Bolivia, Meyer has opened restaurants and cooking schools to revive the nation’s hospitality industry. In the US, Dan Giusti, a former head chef at Noma, now feeds more than 4,000 school children a day with nourishing meals, while in Albania, Fejsal Demiraj, one of Noma’s current sous chefs, runs a foundation that researches and catalogues the nation’s village recipes to give the country a documented culinary history for the first time.Followers of the New Nordic approach are also working to change food policy and production practices around the world. Building on the success of Noma and the New Nordic manifesto, Nordic governments have set up an institute to promote their region’s food policies to other nations. In addition, Redzepi has set up a non-profit organisation called Mad – it means “food” in Danish – that led a campaign in partnership with the UN in the summer of 2019 against the environmental damage of food production.There are also plans for a Mad Academy, with funding from the Danish government, which aims to become “a Bauhaus of food”, as its executive director, Melina Shannon-DiPietro puts it – a place where all the different steps in food production are taught, and where efforts are geared towards answering the most urgent questions of the day: “How do we make food sustainable? How do we make food available to all? How do we protect food cultures against globalisation?”It’s as if Fergus Henderson took his “nose-to-tail” philosophy into Whitehall, got funding from the National Lottery and ended up getting people across the British isles to butcher their own meat, instead of just feeding offal to well-heeled Londoners. What the New Nordic movement is trying to export is not a single cuisine, but an all-encompassing philosophy of food.Chefs were once courtiers then, in the 19th century, they became artisans. For a time following the deprivations of the second world war, they were relics – vestiges of lost luxury in a time of hardship and scarcity. As the age of reality television and fast money dawned in the 80s, so too did the bonafide celebrity chef: a hard-living, tortured genius who justified their wealth and fame with a relentless dedication to perfection. Then, around the turn of the millennium, came an era of techno-utopianism and the transformation of the chef into a wizard of molecular gastronomy, with its frozen foams and fluid gels and trompe l’oeil flourishes.The New Nordic movement heralded another shift in the world of fine dining. In our current era of climate emergency and brutal inequality, celebrity chefs have transformed again, from ruthless kitchen dictators such as Gordon Ramsay and Marco Pierre White, or mad scientists such as Ferran Adrià, into crusaders for a better world. Where once the dream was to cook for presidents, now the aim is to work with them. Massimo Bottura, the ebullient owner of the three-Michelin-star Osteria Francescana in Modena, was celebrated in the 2019 Time 100 for his work feeding the homeless. José Andrés, the Spanish chef once credited with bringing tapas to the US, now has an accolade far exceeding a Michelin star: a nomination for the Nobel peace prize, for his disaster relief efforts in Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria. The pursuit of Michelin stars and coffee-table cookbooks has been superseded by pursuing a role in public life.Of course, there have been powerful voices challenging the mainstream food industry before. At the height of the first-wave of the environmental movement, in the 70s, Alice Waters’ groundbreaking restaurant Chez Panisse, in Berkeley, California, shone a light on the relationship between food producers and cooks, encouraging diners to reject commercialism and supermarkets, and return to the farmers and ranchers who produce their food in a more sustainable way – even if it means paying more for that produce.Even Jamie Oliver, whose TV persona has been a figure of ridicule to many for the past two decades, invested much of his time in social enterprises, most famously challenging the British government on the quality of school dinners during the heady high-point of the Blair hegemony, and founding the not-for-profit restaurant chain Fifteen, which trained, and was staffed by, apprentices from disadvantaged backgrounds.But the New Nordic movement has done more than any single chef to make doing “more than just cooking” the new normal. Redzepi could have opened up a Noma Dubai, and a Noma in the Vegas Bellagio. That’s what the old French masters, such as Alain Ducasse, Pierre Gagnaire and Joël Robuchon, did when they reached the peak of the profession: snatch up Michelin stars all over the globe for their luxurious outposts in far-flung, glitzy hotels. Instead, Redzepi is devoting his time to Mad and to a revamped Noma – often referred to as Noma 2.0 – just a couple of kilometres from the site of the now-shuttered original.Still, the movement – and the restaurant at its forefront – has its critics, who argue that it can be sanctimonious, or narrow, or inattentive to the simple notion that food should be a pleasurable experience. George Reynolds, writing for Eater, took Noma to task for its self-imposed Nordic exceptionalism, writing that “its borderline isolationist culinary philosophy doesn’t feel quite right for the present age more than ever, closing yourself off to other influences is not just unnecessarily limiting but politically unpalatable.”The fact is, though, that the rise of New Nordic means there is no longer a bright line between the chef and the activist, the test kitchen and the laboratory. Joe Warwick, the creative director of the World Restaurant Awards, believes that the people leading the New Nordic movement’s restaurants, canteens, labs, thinktanks, policy institutes and cooking schools, have “exerted influence on their industry on a scale that only a few chefs and restaurants in history ever achieve”.Two decades ago, Denmark might have seemed a rather unconducive place for a revolution in haute cuisine, let alone in food altogether. Being generous, you could have said that it was a country of open-faced sandwiches, hot dogs and overproof alcohol. But you might also have associated it with the cheapest processed pork in the EU, known for being made in a grim factory from a candy-pink slurry of something that once was a pig. “Back then, all you could get in the centre of Copenhagen was bad French food or bad Italian food,” the food writer Andrea Petrini told me. “There was no Danish food culture.”One of the New Nordic movement’s first feats was to help to transform Scandinavia from a land of herring cured in lye to the gastronomic centre of the world. In 2000, Claus Meyer, then a TV chef and one of Denmark’s most recognisable faces, had been appointed by the Social Democratic government to overhaul the country’s poor culinary reputation. He led a committee to create a special quality label for the best Danish food producers to apply for, in the manner of France’s Label Rouge system, which certifies the quality of foods such as Bresse chicken and Bayonne ham. But at the next election, in 2001, the Social Democrats fell, the initiative was scrapped and Meyer was dismissed. “I realised when the committee was demolished that working towards a better food culture was not wanted in parliament anymore,” Meyer told me. “I found that so crazy.”So Meyer bankrolled a proof-of-concept restaurant in Copenhagen that would champion Nordic produce. In 2003, Meyer opened Noma – the name is a portmanteau of nordisk mad (“Nordic food”) – with Redzepi, then a rising star with no experience as head chef, at the helm. Around the same time, Meyer corralled 13 of the Nordic region’s best chefs into an 18-hour workshop to carve out what a world-leading food culture would look like. Meyer and the chefs agonised over the precise wording, order and emphasis of what would become the Manifesto for the New Nordic Kitchen, published in 2004 – a 10-point mission statement that sought “to express the purity, freshness, simplicity and ethics we wish to associate to our region”.Noma, which had spent its first year tweaking French classics with Nordic herbs, moved with religious fervour towards locavorism, making everything as wild and Scandinavian as possible. We put the forest, or the shore, or the snow on a plate in front of you, Redzepi’s dishes often seemed to say. The hope was that Scandinavia’s restaurants would realise the potential of the region and set about regenerating a “Nordic food culture”.What took New Nordic from a local concern to a global movement, however, was Noma’s astonishing success. When Noma dethroned the Spanish restaurant El Bulli, a temple of molecular gastronomy, at the top of the 50 Best list in 2010, it represented a transition between two self-defined “eras” of haute cuisine – from the laboratory to the forest cabin, so to speak. El Bulli would close for good a year later, with its head chef, Ferran Adrià, recognising the end of his restaurant’s journey.El Bulli had always sought to push the limits of what a restaurant could be, bringing in scientific rigour and dedicated lab spaces to make its food more daring. Redzepi had been a student of Adrià’s at the height of El Bulli’s fame. Noma’s innovation was borrowing Adrià’s approach and applying it to answer the questions posed by the New Nordic manifesto: how to radically enlarge the scope of what we think of as food, while making it more ethical and accessible.Noma began attracting talents from outside the food world: anthropologists, molecular chemists and agricultural scientists who would work in its Nordic Food Lab. This lab space – which was, for many years, a rigged-up houseboat moored outside of the restaurant – developed new local products, such as miso made with Danish yellow peas, or salt from shoreline seaweeds for the restaurant to use, while doing original research into the culinary bioersity of Scandinavia.Lars Williams, who was drafted to Noma from Heston Blumenthal’s test kitchen in 2009, moved to the houseboat in 2010 to run the Nordic Food Lab for two years. “We’d be as scientific as chefs could be,” Williams said. “We’d try the same idea 30 different times, with 30 different incremental variations, and record it all to assure we’d been rigorous.” Much like the restaurant, the lab operated with solely Nordic produce, but did its best to stretch that definition: “Things from the Faroe Islands were fair game, things from Northern Norway were fair game – we didn’t just operate around a kilometre’s radius around Copenhagen.”A lot of what the lab worked with – Øland wheat flour, æggeblomme (“egg yolk”) potatoes and other native varietals – had never been tested and examined to such depth before. Through the lab’s research, crops that had all but ceased to be cultivated were finding new uses, and a reason to be grown again.At the peak of Noma’s powers, when it felt as if every other food article was about the majesty of New Nordic, Redzepi began to look beyond the restaurant kitchen. In 2011, he launched what would become a series of annual ideas conferences, the Mad Symposiums, where invited speakers – everyone from the head of the European Environmental Agency to Japan’s most celebrated soba noodle maker – would address an audience of superchefs, interns, farmers, journalists and industry figures on a patch of Copenhagen dockland.These gatherings, which straddled the line between networking events, university lectures and evangelical tent rallies, helped build the movement that is spreading across the globe today. Figures of all stripes and skills would swap business cards, applaud each other’s speeches, plan events and collaborations together, united in the belief that everyone had the destiny of the food world in their hands.In 2012, Redzepi launched the Mad non-profit, to “unite a global cooking community with a social conscience”. Aside from its larger symposiums, Mad has run pop-up salons in London, New York and Sydney, inviting local chefs and journalists to talk about topics as expansive as abandoning ego, indigenous food culture and questioning the very value of life itself. They have partnered with Yale to teach students about leadership, have published essay collections on how food cultures overlap all over the world, and launched a foraging app, VILD MAD (“wild food”), to help users find what’s edible in their local park.Around the same time that Redzepi founded Mad, Meyer, who sold his majority stake in Noma in 2013, began testing New Nordic principles far beyond Scandinavia. After mapping the countries of the world on metrics such as economic development, crime rates and bioersity, Meyer decided to open a restaurant called Gustu in Bolivia’s capital, La Paz, with another talented young Danish chef, Kamilla Seidler, at the helm. Seidler and her team used Bolivia’s fauna and flora to create the restaurant’s idiosyncratic cuisine – llama tartare, alligator escabeche and a lot of quinoa – and brought the restaurant on to the foodie radar. But more importantly, she completed the restaurant’s primary objective: training the restaurant’s Bolivian staff so she could leave Gustu in their hands.To do this, Gustu opened two Manq’a cooking schools, named after the indigenous Aymaran word for food – one based in the capital, La Paz, and one in Bolivia’s second city, El Alto. Manq’a offered general culinary qualifications that enabled all students to work in the hospitality industry exceptional students, such as Gustu’s current head chef, Marsia Taha, would be placed on a fast-track scheme to move into the world of fine dining. There are now nine Manq’a schools in Bolivia and two in Colombia, more than 1,000 alumni, three canteens for La Paz locals to eat a freshly cooked three-course meal for just over £1.50, a tour company, a catering service and a fleet of delivery drivers to order a takeaway from.Alongside this, there is now a manifesto for a new Bolivian cuisine, drawn up by Meyer, Manq’a alumni and local figures within the Bolivian food scene there is a Gustu bar selling Bolivia’s national spirit, singani, and a whole host of restaurants across Bolivia, helmed by ex-Gustu staff, continuing to reimagine Bolivian food and make use of farmers and suppliers providing indigenous produce. In 2014, President Evo Morales had the restaurant cater his third-term inauguration. The following year, the restaurant was asked to devise a recipe for special quinoa communion wafers presented to Pope Francis when he visited the country.Seidler, after Gustu, returned to Copenhagen to carry through her vision of what she calls “social gastronomy” with her latest restaurant, Lola, which operates as both a fine dining restaurant, and a job inclusion programme that trains socially excluded iniduals in cooking and hospitality skills.Others, such as Noma’s New Jersey-born former head chef Dan Giusti, have turned their efforts toward improving the food of public institutions. In 2016, Giusti opened Brigaid, a chef-led startup that brings chefs into public schools to train cafeteria staff, ensuring that pupils eat made-from-scratch food every day – beef tacos and chicken teriyaki instead of vending machine snacks or, worse still, nothing. Brigaid has now expanded into three states, feeding thousands of school children every day across 12 public schools. It’s a world away from the 40 covers a night he served at Noma.The volume of social initiatives pushed by Noma affiliates is staggering. Another former head chef, Matt Orlando, runs a scheme that teaches Copenhagen schoolchildren how to grow their own food in small urban spaces. Over the road from him in the docklands of Refshaleøen is Empirical Spirits, a distillery run by Noma alumni that has organised agronomy workshops in the Oaxacan mountain village of Huitepec in Mexico to help the community continue growing its most valuable crop, the Pasilla Mixe chilli.Roberto Flore, former head of the Nordic Food Lab, now runs a lab at the Technical University of Denmark that offers space to experiment and develop schemes addressing matters such as hunger, food waste and accessible technology for food production. One scheme, called ServedOnSalt, has developed a battery that uses solar energy, salt and water to create a cheap and clean-powered cooking stove for use in refugee camps another has been focused on improving the safety and storability of milk products across rural Ethiopia.Scandinavia now leads the world in food policy, too. In 2018, Dr Afton Halloran, one of the world’s foremost experts on sustainable food systems, published a collection of innovative food policies from around the Nordic region, the Solutions Menu. It outlined the benefits of 24 innovative food policies, aggregated from successful initiatives around the Nordic region – including universal free school meals, organic food in hospitals and schemes to help farms move towards zero food waste. Halloran and her co-authors cited Noma and the New Nordic movement as their chief inspiration.When the Manifesto for the New Nordic Kitchen was first published, in 2004, the reaction in the world of fine dining was sceptical, if not outright suspicious. The manifesto’s points were criticised for being too vague, too piecemeal, too male – all the signatories were men – and too focused on “encouraging cooperation” rather than challenging the region’s industrial food producers through legislation and policy.At the time, Camilla Plum, a Danish food writer and TV personality, was quoted in Denmark’s newspaper of record, Berlingske, lambasting the manifesto’s toothlessness. “The manifesto reminds me a little of Queen Margaret’s annual New Year’s speech,” Plum said. “There are lots of good-natured thoughts and the usual nice greetings to Greenland. They are beautiful sentiments, but they have no real meaning.”Today, though, it seems indisputable that the manifesto more than succeeded in its aims. Scandinavia now stands alongside Spain, France and Italy as one of Europe’s major gastro destinations, with Michelin stars being found as far north as Trondheim in Norway, 200 miles south of the arctic circle. Thousands of jobs in hospitality have been created and, with them, catering colleges full of new students. There are new food producers and artisans, and more diners engaged with the food of the region in which they live.That said, the desire to shake up Scandinavia’s culinary reputation seems a little bit provincial now. The movement has long since mutated into a much larger phenomenon. The aim was once for the Nordic kitchen to be seen as natural and sustainable now, anything with bare wood, organic produce and a compost bin can be thought of as Nordic.Beyond that, the movement has established a Nordic way of doing things that can be adapted anywhere in the world, to breathe new life into cuisines that are distinctly Bolivian, or Mexican or Albanian. And these are just the first initiatives that Noma and the New Nordic principles have sparked. “We’ve already seen people who have come from Noma step out into the industry and work towards change,” says Dan Giusti. “But there’s people in that kitchen right now, and more people who will come through there in future, who we haven’t heard yet. In 20 or 30 years, there’s no telling how big the change could be.”• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, and sign up to the long read weekly email here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/adfedccd1f4044b6f69ee447f24eb9297371c1ae/0_45_3140_1884/master/3140.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d8b40568e7807215dafd24674d8b3264","title":"manchester city aymeric laporte out for around a month with hamstring injury","story":"Aymeric Laporte will be out for up to a month with the hamstring injury suffered in Manchester City’s 2-1 win at Real Madrid on Wednesday.

NO! Wait. That’s wrong. This is what he really said:“All the games are difficult, and Norwich have shown that they’re a dangerous team.“We’ve seen that when we drew here earlier on in the season.

We’re trying to find a solution with him. It’s frustrating that he has come in and out somewhat but he’s injured for tomorrow. Asked how long Abraham would be sidelined, Lampard said: “I don’t know, we need to see. I speak to the doctors every day about it but we are not actually clear on that one.“At the minute he’s not doing anything active for the next couple of days. So I don’t know. And I don’t know how long that will be. Callum is another one who isn’t fit this weekend.’On Pulisic’s groin injury, Lampard said: “The projected time out was a lot less than what it’s turned out to be. I had a similar injury myself as a player and was out for three months, the worst injury I had so I can certainly sympathise and speak with him about the detail of the injury because it’s not an easy one.“I actually re-injured it trying to be too keen to come back so I know it’s a delicate injury. I expected him back quicker but knowing the injury I can see that it’s a difficult one.’Those quotes courtesy of the Chelsea website.Spurs team news: Sissoko, Foyth and Sessegnon are all still sidelined for the meeting with Wolves on Sunday afternoon:For those needing, Pep Guardiola’s full press conference from earlier is available on Manchester City’s YouTube:BBC reporter: “There’s been a lot going on at Manchester City this season with the Uefa investigation, Premier League investigation, there’s been a story this week about claims of your emails being hacked, there’s coronavirus, talk about your contract - how would you describe your season off the pitch, has it been a bit unique in that sense?After six years of delays, Inter Miami will play their first-ever league game this weekend. There are still obstacles to overcome though, writes Chris Smith:The football never ends - it’s the Carabao Cup final on Sunday! Aston Villa v Manchester City, to see who wins that.Ahead of the showpiece occasion, Villa manager Dean Smith has confirmed that Manchester City are a fantastic team, and Pep Guardiola is a fantastic manager:“We’re massive underdogs against a world-class team, but I can only name one or two other teams who wouldn’t be underdogs going into the game against City,” Smith said. “They’re a fantastic team, no matter which 11 they put out, and they’ve a fantastic coach which is why they can go to the Bernabeu and get a result. But I like sometimes being the underdog because we can go and have a good fight without people expecting anything of us.”On the team news front, Smith confirmed that midfielder John McGinn will definitely miss the final, having done his level best to recover from an ankle injury sustained before Christmas.What is it about young footballers and romance-based reality shows? Gavin Willacy is wondering ...Burnley coach Steve Stone has returned to the club following the conclusion of an independent investigation, according to PA media. Former Nottingham Forest midfielder Stone, the Clarets’ under-23s coach, was placed on an “agreed break” in October following reports of an allegation of bullying.Burnley did not make public the reason for 48-year-old Stone’s absence, nor have they disclosed the findings of the investigation. The Premier League club revealed in October that the matter was being handled independently and Stone has now returned to the club.More Moyesy now, courtesy of West Ham’s official website.On Southampton’s recent strong away form, Moyes had this to say: “Up until the last week or two, they’ve had a good record and are very hard working and high pressing. Sometimes it makes it easier away from home when you play that way. Without the ball they’re excellent and we’ll need to be ready for them.”Like Newcastle, West Ham have apparently banned handshakes at the training ground due to fears over the coronavirus.“We have supplied all the players with hand gel to keep with them. We’ve also agreed to no shaking hands at the moment, just fist bumps,” Moyes said in his pre-match press conference ahead of the visit of Southampton. “If we score tomorrow, of course they’ll be able to celebrate!”Why not just replace handshakes and fist bumps with military salutes? They involve no physical contact, and may even help to improve discipline in the ranks.Bournemouth team news now ahead of fourth-placed Chelsea’s visit to the south coast tomorrow.Nathan Ake and Jefferson Lerma might both be back to face Frank Lampard’s side after missing last week’s defeat by Burnley. Ake had concussion and Lerma had a rib knock.Coach Eddie Howe said: “Nathan has trained this week so, hopefully, should be okay providing there are no ill effects from his head injury. It’s a similar case with Jeff and he has come through a couple of days’ training.”Howe added that David Brooks, Arnaut Danjuma, Chris Mepham and Lloyd Kelly continue to make progress as they recover from injuries.He said: “They are running on grass but haven’t joined us in training yet. Chris is a bit behind the others and they are improving quite quickly. We would hope to get them back in training, if not next week then the week after.”The Cherries sit 16th going into the match, just two points above the relegation places.Let’s have another helping of Klopp quotes. Here he is, denying that midfielders Naby Keita and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain are competing for a starting spot in his Liverpool juggernaut:“They’re not competing against each other and hopefully they don’t see it like this. It’s not like this,” he said during his press conference earlier. “They offer naturally different things. Naby can play better, obviously, and has played better. But that wasn’t the reason the (West Ham) game was like it was.“Then Oxlade came on, really fresh and with his natural skill, having direction, speed, it’s a different player. In different situations we need different players and they all are exceptional. Until the change, we were more fixed in positions. It wasn’t flexible enough or unpredictable enough, we were too easy to defend, we didn’t really come through. In other situations we were too high on the wings and were hit on counter-attacks.”Don’t forget! You can drop me a line on email or Twitter @LukeMcLaughlin should you so desire. More quotes from Liverpool manager Klopp, who has been speaking about the dramatic 3-2 win against West Ham on Monday night - the first time his team have trailed in a match since against Aston Villa in early November last year:“I watched the game back, and in that game being 2-1 down helped us a little bit because the direction after that, a lot of things were different,” said Klopp. “I didn’t know it was the first time since Villa, but the boys reacted well and that’s the only thing we have to know. Some people used the word complacency, that they saw glimpses of that. I didn’t see that at all.“It’s a long season and the concentration level can drop from time to time in all teams, in games and between games. How much the boys fight for a result is exceptional. There is no fear about anything, but we also don’t take it for granted that there will just be one or two goals up. This game (against Watford) will be tough. I said it, 100 per cent. I don’t want people to think we are going to win 6-0. It just will not happen.”A Twitter trip down memory lane from the Premier League - and a goal by Benito Carbone for Bradford in 2000:Influential Manchester City centre-back Aymeric Laporte will be out for three to four weeks, says manager Pep Guardiola, following the injury he sustained in Madrid in the Champions League tie earlier in the week. The Frenchman will therefore definitely miss this weekend’s Carabao Cup final, a Manchester derby and the second leg against Real Madrid.“Life is not easy and always in the world the people who survive are the ones who cope with the bad moments,” Guardiola said. “It is what it is. Accept it, work hard to come back as soon as possible.”Meanwhile German international winger Leroy Sane, who has been out with a knee injury since the Community Shield, will play for Manchester City’s under-23s against Arsenal on Friday.Guardiola said: “I don’t want to put targets on him, we want him to play the game then speak with him, (about) how he felt.”Ahead of the Premier League leaders’ trip to Watford tomorrow, Liverpool manager Jürgen Klopp says Jordan Henderson, James Milner and Xherdan Shaqiri are making progress as they recover from injury - but all will be ruled out this weekend.“I’m not sure about Hendo, and Shaq not yet, but they are all coming closer.”In Serie A, Juventus v Inter Milan on Sunday night - a crunch clash as far as the title race is concerned - will be played behind closed doors due to the coronavirus outbreak. The Bianconeri released a statement last night announcing the move. Juventus top the table on 60 points, Lazio are second on 59 with Inter Milan in third on 54.Juventus said the decision is part of “urgent measures regarding the containment and management of the epidemiological emergency that is COVID-19.”Meanwhile on the Reuters news wire, news that the entire Swiss league football programme for the weekend has been called off due to the ever-worsening coronavirus outbreak: The Swiss soccer league (SFL) has called off all of the weekend’s football matches after the government banned large events expected to draw more than 1,000 people as a measure to curb the new coronavirus epidemic. The SFL also said that it would have to consider playing future matches behind closed doors in order to finish the season.“The five matches in each of the Super League (top tier) and the Challenge League (second tier), which were scheduled from Friday to Sunday, will be postponed to an indefinite date,” it said in a statement. “The SFL will inform about the further course of the championship in close cooperation with the authorities and the clubs next week.”The average attendance for the Swiss Super League this season is 11,116. The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Switzerland has risen to 15, and more than 100 people are in quarantine. Now for a story off the wires stemming from Celtic’s 3-1 Europa League defeat by FC Copenhagen last night. Ugly scenes reported by PA media:A player and steward from FC Copenhagen have been charged over an alleged assault on a police officer during the club’s Europa League match with Celtic. Michael Santos, who scored in the 3-1 victory at Celtic Park, and the steward were spoken to by Police Scotland, according to the Danish club.Footage from the televised game appeared to show an incident involving another Copenhagen goalscorer, Pep Biel, in which the club say he was grabbed by “an official”.Copenhagen said a steward “tried to prevent a clash” before being taken away by officers, with Santos also speaking to police. Both have since been charged over the incident.A statement on the Danish club’s website said: “After Pep Biel’s 2-1-goal at Celtic Park there was turmoil in front of the FCK fan section after an official grabbed Pep Biel during the celebration. One of our stewards tried to prevent a clash and was led away and talked with Scottish police. Michael Santos also talked with the police, who subsequently have charged them both. They travelled home with the team, and we are now waiting to see if the Scottish police will pursue the case. We will co-operate if they want more information from the club.”Thank you Barry, and good afternoon to our readers everywhere.Let’s crack straight on with a couple of match previews for this weekend. Will Steve Bruce give Dwight Gayle the nod to start for Newcastle against Burnley?As for Brighton \u0026amp Hove Albion, they are winless so far in 2020, something they’ll be desperate to remedy in tomorrow’s lunchtime game against ‘local’ rivals Crystal Palace. Watch out for those Patrick van Aanholt free-kick thunderbolts ...That’s all from me for today, but worry not - I’ll be handing over the reins to Luke McLaughlin, who’ll bring you news from the rest of this afternoon press conferences as they take place. “There is no guarantee Liverpool would be crowned Premier League champions if the season was curtailed by the coronavirus,” they say, in news that could cause panic on the red half of Merseyside.The broadsheet also reports that there is no guarantee the bottom three clubs in the Premier League would not be relegated, with no specific regulation in place governing such a scenario."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/69b4e820e1d21a5bff7d20ba91b8da28f49690f4/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=332b9b12af61da52fea1e26d5d240988","title":"celebs on demand shoutout app cameo hopes to expand in uk","story":"Fans can use the platform to order personalised messages by stars from Snoop Dogg to Dick Van DykeIt has raised $65m in funding, it features thousands of stars including the actors Billy Zane, Nigel Havers, Tom Felton and Dick Van Dyke – and now its creators have their sights set on Britain.But Cameo is not seeking British talent for movies and TV shows, or even to endorse brands. Instead, it is asking them to hold their phones at arm’s length, smile and wish you a happy birthday.The concept is simple enough: you can pay a famous face – a genuine megastar such as Snoop Dogg or a cult figure from a favourite reality show – to send a message to you, or a friend, and be as surreal or personal as you want (within reason). And now that Cameo has mastered the US market, it is looking further afield.“Awareness is growing … it won’t be long before Cameo is everywhere in the UK,” says Martin Blencowe, Cameo’s co-founder, who often works (with two others) from the platform’s Soho office and signs up many stars to the platform himself.At the top of his British wishlist are Daniel Craig, Lennox Lewis, John Cleese, Jay from The Inbetweeners and David Jason of Only Fools and Horses. “If you got a message from Del Boy, everyone would want that: ‘Rodney, you plonker’, ‘This time next year we’ll be millionaires!’”It works like this: the fan chooses a celebrity from Cameo’s “marketplace” – which can be ordered by price or category, just like on Asos – then fills out a form, briefing them on what to say. Some celebrities, such as Jackass’s Bam Margera, typically respond within hours.Dick Van Dyke, the 94-year-old Mary Poppins star, says on his profile he has been unable to fulfil all orders “due to overwhelming demand”, despite charging $500 a go.Plugs for businesses typically cost more. Larry Thomas, who played the Soup Nazi on Seinfield, charges more than double his standard rate to appear wearing a chef’s coat.Any request is accepted at the talent’s discretion – though that is not always exercised. The rapper Flavor Flav was last year tricked into recording a video wishing Cardinal George Pell, convicted of child sex abuse, a “happy retirement”.Flav told media: “I just do the shoutouts … I didn’t know I was shouting out paedophiles!”For better or worse – more often better, says Blencowe – Cameo presents people with a way to connect with their favourite public figures: “We make superfans.”Among the messages that stand out in his memory are the powerlifter CT Fletcher’s pep talk for an aspiring actor and The Goonies star Sean Astin encouraging a fan to stay sober.Blencowe moved from Brighton to LA as a promising track runner 14 years ago, before his athletics career was ended by injury. He says he had the idea for Cameo in 2016 while working as an agent in the NFL.His friend had just had a child and he asked the Seattle Seahawks player Cassius Marsh to record a message of congratulations. “It was a way for me to compensate for not calling for two days,” says Blencowe, “but my buddy went nuts over it.”Since then, Cameo has raised more than $65m in funding and sold more than half a million videos, most in the last year.But another Briton has laid claim to the original idea. Angus Lancaster founded CelebVM in 2013 after he saw how difficult it was for bands to interact with their fans while working on a One Direction music video.Most of the hundreds of celebrities on his books are British, including John Challis from Only Fools and Horse, Big Keith (Ewen Macintosh) from the UK Office, Paul Cattermole from S Club 7 and stars from Towie, The Real Housewives of Cheshire and Right Said Fred. Each ask about £20-30 for a video.Lancaster says Cameo “did just copy the idea” – but its press, plus the crossover between its books, has helped CelebVM grow. “It’s only affected us beneficially, really.”Plus, adds Lancaster, both are dependent on their stars’ networks for success. “It’s not the platforms that have got the power, it’s the celebrities and their social media. We just facilitate it.”For Cameo’s bigger stars, it is an easy way to monetise what they are often asked to do for free, and on their terms. “They can pick and choose when they work – it’s almost like the gig economy for celebrities,” says Will Hobson of the Sheffield-based digital marketing agency Rise at Seven.Depending on demand, it is possible for them to earn sums in the “mid-six figures” annually from Cameo, says Blencowe – including on commission, by signing up their famous friends.Iain McCallum, a communications consultant with 30 years’ experience of television, says it is “inevitable” that Cameo will grow in the UK – but added that brand-savvy stars with careers that sustain them would probably avoid it.His advice to his own clients would be to “think very carefully about the profile that you’ve worked so hard to build”.But, adds McCallum, “I would never say to anybody that they are wrong to do it … It’s tough out there.” For those who have been “bitten by the TV bug” but are struggling to stay afloat in the industry, Cameo is a viable source of income.At least one name on Blencowe’s list may elude him. David Jason’s manager said she could not say whether Jason would ever join Cameo – but he would “certainly” never appear as Del Boy. “He is part of David’s past.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/36a95469648a03f7b4e6f04f7ce37527140f9450/102_91_2273_1364/master/2273.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=04aaf06853fd77d662bfb72ff8a65e95","title":"coco khan leap year birthday celebration","story":"But is doing something with friends and family really a good idea?If good things come to those who wait, then I’m in for a treat: 29 February is my birthday and I’ve waited four long years for it.

I don’t know how to meet everyone’s expectations.In my family, birthdays are sacred as something we do together (rare) while forcing ourselves not to argue (a miracle). But my leap-year birthday means I usually split the event between a family party and celebrations with friends between 28 February and 1 March. It works because, like many British Asian children, I live a double life – hiding my more hedonistic and liberal side from much of my family (mainly to keep the elders from having a heart attack).So while the easiest solution would be to do something with friends and family, it’s a bad idea the thought of Auntie B meeting my first boyfriend, who is now a polyamorist who calls himself a “cannabinoid artist”, is a therapy session waiting to happen.I know, it’s my birthday and I should do what I want, but if there’s one thing I’ve learned, it’s that occasion days serve a collective purpose.

My mother once explained that when I was conceived my father was away, so it couldn’t have been him. She had an affair with a man she won’t tell me about also, at the time was raped by my father’s brother. I share many physical traits with my sisters, so have always assumed my uncle was my real father. My father died 25 years ago, followed by my uncle 10 years later, so I cannot get DNA samples.It has never bothered me in the past, but, strangely, as my children and I get older, I want to know who my father was. There are so many DNA-testing kits and websites that I don’t know where to start. That’s a lot of information for you to process: that your father wasn’t your father that your mother was raped by her brother-in-law that she had an affair with an unnamed man. You didn’t mention whether your mother is still alive. If she is, I wonder if you could safely rekindle the conversation about your real father with her?As for the practicalities of DNA testing, I’ve had many letters in the past six months asking about this. Be aware that there are two types of tests: one to see if you are related (or not) to someone and “ancestry” tests, which shed light on your ethnicitygenealogy. The two aren’t the same.I contacted two professionals in this field. One, Penny Scott, is a partner at Cartridges Law, chair of the Family Law Committee of the Law Society and a member of its children panel the other was Ryan Wetherell, operations manager at NorthGene Ltd, a government-accredited DNA-testing laboratory.If you want to go down the DNA-testing route, from what you’ve told me, your best bet would be to ask your sisters to provide a sample. To do this, you must have their written consent. To take “bodily material” from someone (a hair from their hairbrush, say, or send in their toothbrush) without their consent would contravene the Human Tissue Act 2004, which covers DNA testing, and therefore would be a criminal offence.Within DNA testing to see if you arearen’t related to someone there are two types: one to find out who your relations arearen’t for your own interest, and one for legal purposes (for changing a birth certificate, say, or to get someone to pay child maintenance). With the former, as long as all written permissions are obtained, you can collect the samples and deal with the labs directly. The latter is more expensive because a chain of custody has to be maintained – so the DNA sample (usually a swab from the mouth) would have to be taken by an independent third person: a GP, pharmacist, or nurse or the DNA agency may have a collector who can do this. This ensures the sample is taken from the right person and not tampered with. If you were able to get bodily material – from clothing or razors, say – from someone who is deceased, written consent must be given by the next of kin. It’s important to make this clear as there is a lot of misinformation about DNA tests.Now to the emotional aspect. I feel you may need to prepare yourself for answers you aren’t expecting.

Thomas’s talks (I found them on YouTube) are shouty, inspirational monologues in which he berates people for not wanting success enough: they think they want it, but they need to want it the way they want to breathe. And I do find them quite motivating, once you get past the fact that this logic completely ignores social circumstance as the primary driver of success.One of the things that Thomas asserts is that he wakes up at 3am. This enables him to get loads of stuff done while everyone else is asleep, and so stay ahead of the competition. He says cool-sounding things like, “I use pain to push me to greatness”, and “I do not take constructive criticism from people who have never constructed anything”, which implies you should only take advice from builders.I found myself reflecting on his early starts as I shafted my own sleep patterns beyond all recognition. Right now, I am typing this while my family are sleeping soundly – because if I think about something I have to do, I cannot relax until it is done. Thomas would be proud.Lately I have been trying to fit exercise into my life while also staying on top of work, which has led to some early starts. January saw me getting up at 5am to head to the gym, where I would push it to the max, then feel terrible for the rest of the day. In my defence, I wanted to be back in time for the school run, and you don’t get a body like mine without effort. As the old saying goes, “No pain, no gelatinous body that makes you sad when you go on holiday”.The problem is, my job involves late nights, and I often don’t get to sleep until 2am. In the past, I have simply cancelled my early morning and slept in, waking up later to lament my failure to “chase the tiger” or whatever Thomas might say. This year, I didn’t want to do that, but am instead left absolutely useless for the rest of the day. Last week I went to a launch event, where I was meant to talk to people enthusiastically about my upcoming shows, and ended up spending the evening reassuring them that I was actually OK, because I looked so glassy-eyed and exhausted.Paranoia is another side effect of my short nights. Sleep deprivation makes perspective a long-forgotten friend, my days spent mentally spiralling off the smallest thing. I did an advert for my podcast recently that went to the sponsor with some incorrect wording, which meant that my eye for detail has gone, which meant that my work would start to get worse, which meant that my agent would drop me, which meant I would struggle to pay the bills, which meant my family would leave me. Thomas would say, “A setback is only a setup for a comeback” but I don’t think by “comeback” he means “correctly worded advert”.A couple of weeks ago, I did a charity club night that went on until 3am. I then had to get home in time to travel to the airport for 6am, albeit for a family half-term break. After weeks of early starts and late nights, this sent me into a kind of madness. I am sure my kids were just playfully bantering in the departure lounge, but to me it sounded as if they were saying, “Hey, Daddy, all three of us are going to spend the day trying to make you cry.” The second we got on the plane and settled the kids, I fell asleep. I woke up feeling properly rested, for the first time in ages. I looked across to tell my wife so, before realising that she’d had to look after the kids on her own while I slept. She looked the way I did at the launch event. I told her the reason she didn’t feel good is because she didn’t want it enough."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cad557cf696d550373dbb5306f1ca60910d54383/64_183_4234_2542/master/4234.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5e8156f1af88e5a974f2eb5919879895","title":"uk house prices rise at fastest rate for 18 months","story":"Increase in home values comes as estate agent Foxtons reports £8.8m lossUK house prices have risen at their fastest rate since mid-2018, after December’s decisive election result triggered a rebound in demand.The news came as the estate agent Foxtons reported an £8.8m loss last year, down sharply from a loss of more than £17m the previous year. It expects sales to improve during 2020.Nationwide’s chief economist, Robert Gardner, said the housing market had gained momentum in recent months. “While overall economic growth ground to a halt in the final three months of 2019, labour market conditions remained buoyant and borrowing costs low. The decisive election outcome may have provided a boost to buyer sentiment,” he said.However, the outlook for house prices will depend on the UK’s economic performance over the coming months, which could take a hit depending on the outcome of Brexit trade talks and the impact of the coronavirus outbreak. “There are still significant uncertainties that threaten to exert a drag on the economy in the coming quarters,” Gardner warned. Nevertheless, Nationwide expects the UK economy to continue expanding at a modest pace, with house prices staying broadly flat. If the forecast proves correct, the fortunes of estate agents could improve.The chief executive, Nic Budden, said Foxtons sales pipeline – transactions not yet completed – was stronger than a year earlier. “Looking forward, with the uncertainty of the general election removed, early signs are that the sales market may improve,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3a778b98ca5e4c827b0ffa7f5d91f58bb8387fea/259_273_3150_1889/master/3150.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=497c796e41bca2ab2c7afe0c7ab68905","title":"denis katya opera review venables huffmann music theatre wales","story":"Riverfront Theatre, Newport Music Theatre Wales’s production of Philip Venables and Ted Huffman’s opera gives horrible immediacy to their oblique take on a tale of transgressive teensRomeo and Juliet crossed with Bonnie and Clyde: Denis Muravyov and Katya Vlasova were both innocent and transgressive. Music Theatre Wales’s UK premiere of an opera based on the true story of two Russian 15-year-olds in the Pskov town of Strugi Krasnye, who over three days livestreamed their own demise on Periscope, is chilling. The standoff and police shootout was the stuff of tragedy.Yet the manner of composer Philip Venables’s and librettistdirector Ted Huffman’s telling of their tale is unusual. Neither Denis nor Katya is portrayed: instead events are plotted – piecemeal and post hoc – by two protagonists playing the roles of journalist, friend, neighbour, teenager, teacher and medic. Mezzo-soprano Emily Edmonds and baritone Johnny Herford, already much acclaimed in last year’s Opera Philadelphia premiere, project these with objectivity and passion. Four cellists, one in each corner of the bare set, form a sort of Greek chorus.A horrible immediacy comes from the fast intercutting of video to both libretto and score, whether witness testimony, spoken narrative or sung monologue words projected on the screen quote original livestream comments and trolling, as well as strategic reasoning in Venables and Huffman’s creative process and that of co-authortranslator Ksenia Ravvina. Vindicating their argument that the piece would be stronger for not showing any of the actual streamed video, the final image of Strugi Krasnye is even more bleakly evocative. That still shot becomes a pan, the view from a train pulling away from the station, gradually gaining speed, the soundscape now a crushing metallic grind. The final music carries an almost baroque feel, inidual cello lines in haunting threnody.Echoing an ancient wedding ritual, each had dyed their hair to take the other’s look. Realising they had gone too far, they asked in vain for their online viewers’ advice. Given the present questions about the toxicity of social media, the opera’s focus on the nature of voyeurism is particularly uncomfortable. So, too, is the unavoidable rider that society as a whole is complicit in such deaths."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/214fea0779b4daecfce207fbd29bb82e9611afd5/0_400_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8faa20e2a73866249769d7fa35e55789","title":"india modi and the rise of hindu nationalism","story":"With Delhi rocked by deadly protests as Muslim and Hindu groups clash violently,  writer Samanth Subramanian looks at the rise of Hindu nationalism within India.

The ex-insider said Tighe was good at his job but Patel had wanted more people in senior roles in the department whom she trusted.The Home Office did not deny the claim that Patel asked for Tighe to be sacked on Christmas Eve, nor that she had wanted him to leave.A Home Office spokesperson said: “The home secretary and permanent secretary are deeply concerned about the number of false allegations appearing in the media. They are focused on delivering on the Home Office’s hugely important agenda, which includes creating an immigration system that works for the UK, putting more police on the streets and keeping the public safe from terrorism.”Over the last week No 10 has made moves to defuse the public spat, with both Patel and Rutnam told to stop the sniping and restore calm in the Home Office.The row originally blew up when it was claimed that Patel had tried to get rid of Rutnam after he raised complaints about her alleged bullying and belittling of staff.It then further escalated with claims that MI5 had restricted Patel’s access to security information because it did not trust her, which the intelligence agency and home secretary strongly denied.The department has said there have been no formal complaints about Patel’s behaviour.Rutnam made a rare public appearance on Thursday at a policing conference but made only a brief allusion to the reports about his poor relationship with Patel.He told the National Police Chiefs’ Council (NPCC) and Association of Police and Crime Commissioners summit in Westminster: “You probably have already heard a great deal more about permanent secretaries in the last few days than you ever expected to. But be reassured, I am not going to talk about that. I am going to talk about what really matters, which is cutting crime and building a law enforcement system that is more capable, more resilient and better placed for the future.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f4b96e31e25b37c4a27d384458126f31b3ade7a6/0_201_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2d1139ea1b87f45defd3ad7610686d76","title":"extra 50000 border staff needed for post brexit trade says gove","story":"New recruits needed to process millions of extra declaration forms from 1 January 2021A race to hire 50,000 people in the next six months to process Brexit paperwork is under way after the government confirmed they would be needed for border operations.But experts have warned it will be a challenge to train enough people in time to be competent in the complexity of customs declarations and the second layer of red tape involving entry and exit declaration forms that are mandatory for trading with the EU.The Road Haulage Association has warned that the number of declaration forms for tariffs alone will rocket from the current 50m a year to 200-250m a year.In addition, the exit and entry forms introduced after the 911 terror attack in New York to ensure safety on ferries and planes will involve another 100-125m forms being processed every year.Michael Gove, the chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, who is responsible for readying the country for full Brexit at the end of the year, confirmed in parliament on Thursday afternoon that the RHA estimated 50,000 new recruits would be needed in the next six months.Rod McKenzie, the managing director of policy and public affairs at the RHA, said: “We have been told by a large freight company expert in the field that they get a productivity of around 4,000 clearances a year per staff member (that is about 20 clearances a day). That makes sense given the complexity of many transactions. Worth noting, that is with skilled, trained, experienced labour.“So if we are dealing with 200m extra declarations, at a productivity rate of 4,000 per year that equals 50,000 staff needed on day one, and probably more.” Gove has access to about £7.5m to fund new HRMC customs agents but may seek funds from the wider Border Delivery Group cross-department initiative to prepare for 1 January 2021.Neighbouring countries including France, the Netherlands and Ireland launched customs officials recruitment drives last year, with six-month training schedules considered a minimum.Agents in Dover who deal with lorries coming in from the Ukraine, Turkey and other non-EU countries have warned that the skills base around customs disappeared with the creation of the single market in 1991, with just a handful of customs agents now operating in offices in Dover.The emergence of the human resource needed puts into perspective the scale of the task – the number of staff needed dwarfs the 12,000 people estimated to work in the fishing industry, a sector emblematic of Brexit.Government sources have said the new recruits would largely be “intermediaries”, agents who help businesses process their export and import paperwork with HMRC.The tax authorities will also recruit government agents to process the paperwork and guard against tariff evasion on borders.The Freight Transport Association and the RHA have been pressing the government for the past three years to wake up to the realities of a hard Brexit.The FTA said Thursday’s publication of the government’s negotiating goals gave some “hope” in that it provided confirmation that the government was not pursuing frictionless trade.However, it called for “more ambition” to help road, aviation and rail transport prepare to minimise the disruption from 1 January.“Over recent months, the FTA has repeatedly requested the UK government prioritise the needs of logistics in its negotiations around the future trading relationship with the EU or risk a devastating effect on the UK’s highly interconnected supply chain. The business organisation has also warned of knock-on effects on UK plc’s future productivity, and on the economy as a whole but these concerns seem to have been overlooked,” it said in a statement."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/003128bc972dfe8ca695b4e65bd1602f55cf665e/0_70_5725_3435/master/5725.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=81b52cdb9de8c2bb78adf43aee58cf93","title":"tell us have you been affected by the coronavirus","story":"If you have been affected or have any information or news tips for our journalists, we would like to hear from youIf you’ve been affected by the coronavirus, we’d like to hear from you.A British man who was quarantined on Diamond Princess cruise ship has died, Japanese media reports.

He and his wife spent two weeks on a remote Scottish island with no mobile phone reception at all.A bit extreme, acknowledges Rycroft, but this act of self-isolation was a huge relief after the intense activity of trying to prepare the UK for Brexit. As part of his job, Rycroft came under intense political and personal pressure, as did other senior civil servants, including then Brexit chief negotiator Ollie Robbins.But looking back, Rycroft and Robbins were practically living in halcyon days compared with the atmosphere that’s pervaded the civil service since Boris Johnson became prime minister last July. This week has seen reports that three senior civil servants are on a No 10 hitlist: Sir Tom Scholar at the Treasury, because the department has been opposed to Brexit Sir Philip Rutnam at the Home Office, because he is seen as obstructive and |Sir Simon McDonald at the Foreign Office, because he fell out with Johnson when he was foreign secretary.The plans to remove senior civil servants from key departments has resulted in a “poisonous” atmosphere across Whitehall, according to union leaders. But it’s actually more dangerous even than that.The management manual has yet to be written that recommends alienating thousands of hardworking staff on whom the organisation relies to get its everyday work done. But this shoddy tactic is one that is eagerly taken up by many incoming governments keen to embark on their policies and nervous that the civil service will somehow be a blocker, despite all the evidence on how effectively it carries out the work of the elected government of the day.More worrying, though, is the rise and rise of bullying at all levels of the civil service. Accusations about Priti Patel’s behaviour towards officials at the Home Office have led to other department heads having to reassure their own staff. Matthew Rycroft, the top civil servant at the Department for International Development, has written to his staff to reassure them that the ministry has “zero tolerance” of bullying and harassment in the wake of reports about Patel.Bullying isn’t just coming from ministers. There have been long-term problems of bullying in many civil service departments for years. The most recent, shocking case came to a head this week as former Department of Work and Pensions trainee Anne Giwa-Amu was awarded almost £400,000 after having been singled out and humiliated by colleagues, who violated her dignity through the use of racist language.A bullying culture, from top to bottom, is clearly no way to run the country. Senior civil servants may be under threat, but they also need to consider the morale of the departments they run."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2395410826f0d7e6bd46c436ac4b87843f34dbfe/1191_686_3802_2281/master/3802.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2d01e60237e4f50318454e8dfdb1c0c4","title":"england much to ponder smooth victory pakistan at womens t20 world cup cricket","story":"Before this year, Heather Knight had only one T20 half-century to her name. Now she has four, not forgetting her first three-figure score in the format, hit here in Canberra on Wednesday. Her purple patch has arrived at just the right time for England, it seems: Friday’s effort – a 47-ball 62 – was the batting cornerstone of England’s 42-run win against Pakistan.“I’ll be disappointed to leave Canberra,” Knight said after the match. “I’m enjoying batting further up the order and shaping the innings for the team. I try to be there at the end and score at a decent strike rate.”Knight aside, it was the England bowlers who once again got the job done, bowling Pakistan out for 116 with two balls remaining. The best figures of the day went to Sarah Glenn (three for 15), who continues to deceive opponents with her stump-to-stump leg-spin, putting a big dent in the Pakistan chase by having both Javeria Khan and Iram Javed bowled in successive overs following the powerplay.“I’m enjoying it,” Glenn said of her time in Australia, during which she has taken 10 wickets across four tri-series matches and three World Cup encounters. “I’ve grown up always bowling stump to stump, I don’t naturally get much turn, so I like the extra bounce that you can get out here.”Glenn’s performance came after the Pakistan captain Bismah Maroof – who had top-scored in Pakistan’s exciting win against West Indies on Wednesday – became Katherine Brunt’s first victim of the tournament, her attempted ramp shot failing to come off. Anya Shrubsole – who finished with three for 25, taking her 100th scalp in T20 internationals in the process – then helped wrap things up with wickets in successive deliveries in the 19th over, including a beautiful slower ball that told for Aliya Riaz (41), the only Pakistan batsman to show much fight.The result puts England second in their group, with only one remaining hurdle, their match against West Indies on Sunday, standing between them and the semi-finals.Nonetheless, there will be much to mull over for a side for whom reaching the semis was really the minimum expectation. England’s eight-batsman strategy is grounded in the idea that Amy Jones and Danni Wyatt are best utilised up top, while Tammy Beaumont at No 6 allows them to “finish big”. Arguably that strategy failed on both counts here, with England failing to do enough to leapfrog South Africa’s superior net run rate and go top of their group.Early on, England were once again in trouble, with Jones and Wyatt falling in the powerplay – Jones in the very first over of the innings, trapped lbw by Diana Baig. Wyatt was saved from a similar fate two overs later, when Pakistan wrongly decided against reviewing a ball that had rapped her on the back pad and was shown to have been hitting the top of the stumps. However she failed to capitalise on her reprieve and fell cheaply, sending up a catch to point to leave England 47 for two in the sixth over.At the back end of the innings, a flurry of wickets also cost England the chance to finish strongly. Four wickets fell for 15 runs in the final three overs, with Beaumont surviving only four deliveries. Fortunately for England, Knight’s determined effort to prop up the innings had already done enough damage. Arriving at the crease in the sixth over, she shared a 34-run stand with Nat Sciver, followed by a half-century partnership with Fran Wilson – the England captain the dominant partner in both cases.Pakistan will be ruing a number of missed opportunities to dismiss her. Knight was put down no fewer than four times, the first when she was on 32, while Wilson (who scored a run-a-ball 22) was also dropped when still in single figures.Of the Pakistan fielders, only the keeper Sidra Nawaz – whose Sarah Taylor-esque stumping off a leg-side wide saw off Sciver for 36 when she looked in sight of a third consecutive half-century – was blameless in defeat."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/39c510d50227249488bfe3b804fd0c732d43c17d/0_384_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6d9697bf85fcdc8d9a01396b869a633b","title":"the breadwinners of barishal how women in bangladesh are starting their own businesses","story":"Women in this flood-hit area are supporting their families through small businesses backed by the British Red Cross. From tailoring to tea making, the success of these enterprises is inspiring other young women to follow suitby  Thaslima Begum in BarishalIn the sprawling urban slums of Barishal, where monsoons and flooding are inescapable, life for women is hard. They are more likely to miss out on getting an education, and without the proper knowledge and skill set, many struggle to make a living. As they are more likely to live in poverty, they are more affected by disasters. But despite these challenges, with the help of livelihood grants from the Red Cross, many women in Barishal are finding innovative ways to eke out a living.Rina, 37, from Palashpur, wakes up early every day to start preparing for work. From a side road of a small slum with heavy foot traffic, she has been running a successful tea stall for the last two years. Brightly coloured crisp packets hang like a banner across her shopfront, where Rina sells roughly 160 cups of tea a day at 5 taka (under 5p) a cup.She uses the money to pay for her children’s education and managed to save enough to buy a small TV, which kept her busy during the World Cup. “Everyone here loves football, so I thought it would be a good investment,” she says proudly. “Not everyone in the slums owns a TV, so when they stop to watch, they also buy tea.”Married at 12, Rina now has five children and is the sole breadwinner of her family. Her husband suffered a stroke seven years ago and is no longer able to work. “I had no money to feed my children. I’d already taken out loans and was worried about our financial situation.” But in 2018, she received a small grant, which enabled her to kickstart her own business.Rina’s customers are mostly men labourers who come to drink chai during their breaks and catch up with their friends. Though they don’t speak to Rina much, she has learned a lot from listening in on their conversations. “They discuss everything – sports, politics, economics and the weather – information I never had access to while sitting at home.”Knowledge about the weather is particularly important for Rina as flooding hampers her business. “When the water comes in, people aren’t interested in sitting around drinking tea.”As she buys her tea wholesale, grown in north-eastern districts such as Sylhet, it’s important for Rina to know of incoming natural disasters that might affect her supply, so that she can plan ahead.Mahmuda, 36, has just had a baby and is making plans on how to balance her tailoring business with motherhood. After receiving a small business loan, Mahmuda was able to establish her tailoring business, which has been going from strength to strength. Dressed in a traditional shalwar kameez she made herself, Mahmuda gently rocks baby Diya back and forth.After going into labour early and losing a lot of blood, the doctors thought both mother and baby wouldn’t make it. Mahmuda was able to use the money she generated from her business to pay for hospital fees and basic necessities for her premature baby.“My business is slowly expanding, and I am able to feed my children,” she says. Mahmuda buys materials and sews clothes for the women in her community. She recently bought a wardrobe to safely store her clothing and protect it from flooding and the smell of the draining system outside her home.Mahmuda lives with her baby and two young sons, sick husband and elderly mother – all of whom she supports financially. Her father left when she was small, so Mahmuda’s mother raised her on her own. She is happy to now be able to take care of her in return. “I am also able to maintain my sons’ educational expenses, which I couldn’t do before – it was a real struggle to pay their tuition fees every month.”Every morning, before the sun rises, Mukhal, 28, sets off on a small dinghy to the local fish market. Dressed in a black burka and face veil so as not to draw attention, Mukhal is one of the few women who can be found in a market mostly dominated by men. Over time she has been able to develop her negotiation skills, so she gets a better price for the catch. She then fills her basket and carries it back to her village, where she sells the fish to her neighbours.Mukhal has led a difficult life. Forced into marriage at the age of 12 when her father died, she became pregnant at 15, and was beaten then abandoned by her husband who took another wife. Her home is on the banks of the river and prone to flooding. “Everything I do is for my son. My only hope is to be the best mother that I can be. I don’t want my son to live this kind of life – I want him to be educated and to have a good job. He wants to be an engineer! I work hard to pay for his education, so he doesn’t have to struggle like me.”Also driven by a strong desire to help her family, Chompa, 15, currently works in an electronics factory. Her father was a rickshaw puller, but because of his old age and the flooding from heavy rain, such arduous work has become difficult. So Chompa is now the main breadwinner in her family, spending all day at a factory where she uses her small hands to put together electronic goods destined for faraway places worlds she catches brief glimpses of through the TV screens that she helps assemble.Chompa earns approximately 4,000 taka (£36.30) a month, which she puts towards rent, food and her parents’ medicines. But a few months ago, while building a fan, it suddenly switched on and the blades sliced off three of her fingers. “There was blood everywhere,” she says. “After a few seconds, I passed out.” Though the factory covered her hospital bill, and at this time she is still receiving her monthly salary, a future without able hands feels uncertain – she says she is likely to be downgraded or dismissed from her role.“What can I expect from this life?” she asks. “I have many dreams, but there are no opportunities.” She wishes she could attend school, but like many young girls from Barishal, this isn’t always an option. One day, when she is old enough, Chompa wants to own a business. She has seen the examples of other women in her community achieving success providing her with glimmers of hope that another reality is not only possible, it is within reach."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/41343817522d9d4c16f49597b3cc1c3dbd94a0f5/0_186_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=38c747c32397b7492ac7974edf94bbc2","title":"joe biden south carolina primary","story":"The former vice-president looks to be in the driver’s seat as the first state in the deep south casts its voteJoe Biden is heading into South Carolina’s Democratic presidential primary vote on Saturday as the heavy favourite to win, which would provide a much-needed boost just days ahead of the crucial Super Tuesday elections.There was a point in the last few weeks when it seemed like the former vice-president’s South Carolina “firewall” might actually have some cracks in it. It seemed that the Vermont senator Bernie Sanders, Biden’s ideological polar opposite, might prevent him from winning the state decisively.That moment came and went.“I’ve been confident about South Carolina because I’ve worked so hard over 30 or more years here … not to run for president, but to have the relationship with the community,” Biden told CNN on Friday morning. “I believe it’ll be the launching pad for me.”Biden has campaigned on a message of dignity and unity, and stressed his experience as Barack Obama’s vice-president. He was the envy of other 2020 Democratic candidates this week, after he was endorsed by Jim Clyburn, the highest-ranking African American in Congress.“Since Congressman Clyburn has endorsed the vice-president that has given him a great boost, a great energy. That has certainly provided clarity to iniduals that were undecided,” said Clay Middleton, a South Carolina Democratic national committee member.A day later, a new Monmouth University poll of South Carolina voters found Biden leading over Sanders by 20 percentage points. That poll was notably different from other recent South Carolina polls which showed Biden leading by single digits.A solid win would give his campaign a shot in the arm days ahead of the Super Tuesday elections, when Democratic voters in 16 states and US territories will have their say on which presidential candidate they want to see take on Donald Trump in the November election.Eight major Democratic candidates including Biden and Sanders remain in contention, and this week could mark a decisive make-or-break moment for several of them.Biden entered the presidential race as the frontrunner and heavy favorite to win the Democratic nomination, but has since struggled to meet expectations. He placed a distant fourth in the Iowa Democratic caucuses, the first vote in the race in February. He didn’t do much better in New Hampshire.Biden, a more moderate Democrat called out the progressive candidate directly at a campaign stop in McClellanville on Thursday, warning that Sanders’ Medicare for All proposal “will be a long, long expensive slog, cost over $35tn and the patients can’t afford to wait”.Sanders’ signature policy Medicare for All, which would implement a government-run healthcare system in the US, is one of the most contentious policies being debated among Democrats this year, highlighting splits between progressives and moderates who largely favor an expansion of Obamacare.Biden and his team have long argued that a win in South Carolina would rebuff his critics, and show he has the ability to attract a broad coalition of Democratic voters.“The people know me. My entire career has been wrapped up in dealing with civil rights and civil liberties,” Biden said during the latest Democratic  debate in Charleston. “I intend to win in South Carolina, and I will win the African American vote here in South Carolina.”Mike McCauley, a veteran Democratic strategist based in South Carolina, said winning South Carolina could help Biden frame himself as the most prominent alternative to Sanders.“For moderate Democrats like myself and my colleagues and peers across South Carolina we’re looking for who’s going to be the alternative to Bernie that’s going to emerge,” he said. “So I think that’s the springboard that South Carolina can give Biden is to provide that distance.”While Sanders has risen to national frontrunner and become the candidate to beat, in South Carolina, where Biden leads in polling, the billionaire Democratic candidate Tom Steyer has also been a source of concern for the former vice-president.Steyer has poured $20m into his campaign in the state and made a concerted effort to win African American voters. He has made a point of highlighting his positions on reparations and racial justice as he has campaigned throughout the state.At a stop at a community resource center of North Charleston, Steyer said: “I really care about racial justice.”“I think when I come to South Carolina and talk to African Americans they realize I’m not kidding,” Steyer told the . “I’m serious about it and I think as a result we share some goals and we share some history and I’m talking about things that they can believe in, because I’m serious about it.”There is still a long way to go in the Democratic primary race before a presidential nominee is officially named at the party’s national convention in July.

Who’s up and who’s down this week in US politics?The leftwing senator from Vermont’s landslide victory in Nevada forced Democratic and media doubters to admit he was now the man to beat (even the day before the New York Times was still calling him the “nominal” frontrunner). But heavy lies the crown – with his new status came the avalanche of attacks from opponents that Sanders sceptics have long warned the self-proclaimed democratic socialist would face if he ever began to lead the pack.His “honeymoon” to Moscow, unwise articles he wrote for an underground zine in the 60s and 70s about cancer, orgasms and rape fantasies … Indeed, Sanders fanned the flames himself this week with typically unapologetic comments about Fidel Castro, telling CBS News he was “opposed to the authoritarian nature of Cuba” but adding: “He had a massive literacy program. Is that a bad thing? Even though Fidel Castro did it?” There will be much more of this if Sanders’ success continues with a strong showing in South Carolina tomorrow and victory on Super Tuesday, 3 March.Whisper it, but is Biden back? Democratic centrists will eventually have to coalesce around someone to take on Sanders, and after flirting with Pete Buttigieg, Mike Bloomberg and Amy Klobuchar, they may end up concluding that the former vice-president – for all his faults – looks the strongest. He was more focused and aggressive at the debate in South Carolina on Tuesday night, and employed some amusing self-deprecation at one point when he gave way to the moderator: “Why am I stopping? No one else stops. It’s my Catholic school training.” Relying on his firewall of African American support, Biden has solidified his lead in South Carolina and can reasonably hope for a strong victory there on Saturday that might reboot his campaign. He can expect to scoop up a fair number of delegates on Super Tuesday too, particularly in Texas and North Carolina, although Sanders is increasingly leaving him for dust in California. Can he stage a comeback? Cutting out the questionable stories about being arrested in South Africa might help.Bloomberg had a better debate this week, but his social media tactics came under fire after his team posted a controversial set of satirical tweets featuring false comments supposedly made by Sanders about various dictators. It wasn’t his first offence – many objected to the misleadingly edited video his team had put out after the debate in Nevada – and the Sanders tweets were deleted. “It’s the embracing of a cynical outlook: ‘Lol nothing matters’,” Whitney Phillips of Syracuse University told the . “It’s leaning into nihilism.” Bloomberg’s national poll ratings have flatlined since his disastrous first debate performance – he remains in third place behind Biden and Sanders – and he has dipped back below Elizabeth Warren and Pete Buttigieg too in the crucial Super Tuesday state of California, when he enters the race proper.That last element seemed key – an economic slowdown caused by the virus could seriously damage Trump’s chances of re-election, and the stock market is his favourite measure of his own success. The day after a less-than-reassuring press conference in which Trump put the vice-president, Mike Pence, in charge of the anti-virus effort, the Dow had its worst ever daily drop and the S\u0026ampP 500 posted its largest fall since August 2011.Well, would you want to head up the coronavirus response? Such a poisoned chalice is the vice-president’s new job that there was even speculation Trump could eventually use it as a pretext for dropping Pence from the 2020 ticket – perhaps replacing him with a telegenic woman such as the former UN ambassador Nikki Haley.Not to worry, though, Pence is “really very expert at the field” of healthcare, as Trump told his press conference on Wednesday.So expert that he notoriously wrote on his website in 2000: “Despite the hysteria from the political class and the media, smoking doesn’t kill.” And as governor of the midwestern state of Indiana, he faced heavy criticism for his handling of the situation when the state experienced the worst HIV crisis in its history."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f2db7be379eb632f4722a26b086d966edebcc6aa/0_333_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=87fef70348f2e338624d4c987dcc270e","title":"coronavirus truth myths flu covid 19 face masks","story":"The truth about the protective value of face masks and how easy it is to catch Covid-19Most people who are not elderly and do not have underlying health conditions will not become critically ill from Covid-19. But the illness still has a higher chance of leading to serious respiratory symptoms than seasonal flu and there are other at-risk groups – health workers, for instance, are more vulnerable because they are likely to have higher exposure to the virus. The actions that young, healthy people take, including reporting symptoms and following quarantine instructions, will have an important role in protecting the most vulnerable in society and in shaping the overall trajectory of the outbreak.Wearing a face mask is not an iron clad guarantee that you won’t get sick – viruses can also transmit through the eyes and tiny viral particles, known as aerosols, can still penetrate masks. However, masks are effective at capturing droplets, which is the main transmission route of coronavirus, and some studies have estimated a roughly five-fold protection versus no barrier. If you are likely to be in close contact with someone infected, a mask cuts the chance of the disease being passed on. If you’re just walking around town and not in close contact with others, wearing a mask is unlikely to make any difference.For flu, some hospital guidelines define exposure as being within six feet of an infected person who sneezes or coughs for 10 minutes or longer. However, it is possible to be infected with shorter interactions or even by picking the virus up from contaminated surfaces, although this is thought to be a less common route of transmission.Scientists were quick out of the gates in beginning development of a vaccine for the new coronavirus, helped by the early release of the genetic sequence by Chinese researchers. The development of a viable vaccine continues apace, with several teams now testing candidates in animal experiments. However, the incremental trials required before a commercial vaccine could be rolled out are still a lengthy undertaking – and an essential one to ensure that even rare side-effects are spotted. A commercially available vaccine within a year would be quick.A pandemic is defined as worldwide spread of a new disease – but the exact threshold for declaring one is quite vague. In practice, the actions being taken would not change whether or not a pandemic is declared. Containment measures are not simply about eliminating the disease altogether. Delaying the onset of an outbreak or decreasing the peak is crucial in allowing health systems to cope with a sudden influx of patients."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bbe289a4dbddc5c162884c2df56db6fef49d98c0/0_207_6340_3804/master/6340.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=be785a2d52bac8b7eda1bf10f7b3687e","title":"delhis muslims pray under armed guard after week of riots","story":"Regular Friday prayers take place amid heightened sectarian tensions in India’s capitalMuslims in Delhi have held Friday prayers under the watch of riot police after a week in which 42 people were killed and hundreds injured during the city’s worst sectarian violence in decades.Scores of mosques in the north-east of the Indian capital held their first sermons since mobs armed with swords, guns and acid razed parts of the district on Monday.Paramilitary police patrolled the streets, still littered with broken shards of glass, stones and other debris.“If they burn our mosques, we will rebuild them again and pray,” said Mohammad Sulaiman, who was among about 180 men who prayed on the rooftop of a mosque that was set on fire in the unrest. “It’s our religious right and nobody can stop us from practicing our religion.”Five days after the riots started, hospitals were still trying to identify the dead as the toll continued to rise. Residents of the areas affected by the riots are still looking for missing relatives.Tensions between Hindu hardliners and Muslims protesting against the Hindu-first policies of Narendra Modi’s government had been building for months when the violence exploded on Sunday night, on the eve of Donald Trump’s first state visit to India.Police said they had detained more than 600 people over the unrest and were keeping a heavy presence in north-east Delhi.Dozens of volunteers stood outside the main mosque in the neighbourhood of Mustafabad, where some of the week’s worst violence took place, urging devotees to disperse immediately after prayers. “These are testing times. We have to be patient,” said the presiding imam after calling on his congregation to stay calm.Many in the neighbourhood were frightened after police barred Muslim worshippers from what was left of one of several mosques set ablaze by Hindu rioters on Monday.Nearby, a group of residents in the Hindu-dominated Shiv Vihar area blocked the lane leading to one of the local mosques with the burnt-out frames of motorcycles, which they said were set alight by Muslims. “No one will be allowed to enter until the rioters are caught,” they shouted at a crowd of Muslims seeking entry.“We don’t want violence,” said Saleem Mirza, as police told the Muslims to disperse to avoid any fresh trouble. “We want to live in peace, work for our children and live a normal life. We prayed for peace for everyone today.”India’s new citizenship law has triggered months of demonstrations between anti-government demonstrators and police. At least 30 people died in protest violence last year, mainly in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh.Many of the country’s 200 million-strong Muslim minority fear the law – and a mooted citizens’ register – will leave them stateless.Modi has sought to allay the fears but in recent weeks politicians from the prime minister’s rightwing party have called the demonstrators “anti-nationals” and “traitors”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8a7f2bf3423ec463fe255fd966c4ebdd1064c7ee/0_202_3024_1814/master/3024.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e144013d729437f0467bfe679edd6696","title":"luxembourg public transport free nationwide congestion","story":"Country is first to implement measure nationwide as it attempts to reduce congestionLuxembourg is to become the first country to offer a free public transport system, as the government tries to reduce particularly dense car traffic.Some cities have taken similar partial measures but the transport ministry said it was the only time such a decision had encompassed an entire country.Luxembourg City, the capital, where a tramway has been under construction for several years, is notoriously bad for traffic jams.

Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. Many of those initially infected either worked or frequently shopped in the Huanan seafood wholesale market in the centre of the Chinese city.The virus can cause pneumonia. Those who have fallen ill are reported to suffer coughs, fever and breathing difficulties. In severe cases there can be organ failure. As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system. Many of those who have died were already in poor health.In the UK, the medical advice is that if you have recently travelled from areas affected by coronavirus, you should:More NHS advice on what to do if you think you have been exposed to the virus can be found here, and the full travel advice to UK nationals is available here.China’s national health commission has confirmed human-to-human transmission, and there have been such transmissions elsewhere.As of 25 February, the outbreak has affected 80,000 people globally. In mainland China there have been 2,663 deaths among 77,658 cases, mostly in the central province of Hubei. More than 12,000 people affected in China have already recovered.The coronavirus has spread to at least other 30 other countries. The most badly affected include Japan, with 850 cases, including 691 from a cruise ship docked in Yokohama, and four deaths. Italy has recorded 229 cases and seven deaths, while South Korea has recorded 893 cases and eight deaths. There have also been deaths in Hong Kong, Taiwan, France, Iran and the Philippines.There have been 15 recorded cases and no fatalities to date in the UK.Another key unknown is how contagious the coronavirus is. A crucial difference is that unlike flu, there is no vaccine for the new coronavirus, which means it is more difficult for vulnerable members of the population – elderly people or those with existing respiratory or immune problems – to protect themselves. Hand-washing and avoiding other people if you feel unwell are important. One sensible step is to get the flu vaccine, which will reduce the burden on health services if the outbreak turns into a wider epidemic.No. A pandemic, in WHO terms, is “the worldwide spread of a disease”. The spread of the virus outside China is worrying but not an unexpected development. The WHO has declared the outbreak to be a public health emergency of international concern. The key issues are how transmissible this new coronavirus is between people, and what proportion become severely ill and end up in hospital. Often viruses that spread easily tend to have a milder impact. Generally, the coronavirus appears to be hitting older people hardest, with few cases in children."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/59c182c55d1854e6002f6aeec27921f2dc935ca6/67_402_4793_2878/master/4793.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ccf00ebab0d785815a0ff400ee89c316","title":"coronavirus spreads across the world in pictures","story":"As cases of people infected with the coronavirus or Covid-19 grow rapidly in Italy, Iran and South Korea, the rest of the world is bracing for a pandemic"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5fb006b55e3bc31720c7ba68208d0fbcb6499d45/0_0_5760_3840/master/5760.jpg?width=880\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=30ab649a3d4589ce6981f2a99d3df2ee 1760w","title":"coronavirus live updates latest news china wuhan stock markets update","story":"Man quarantined on cruise ship in Japan becomes first Briton to die from coronavirus as WHO says epidemic could get ‘out of control’.

The meeting is scheduled to be held on Monday.Labour has accused Johnson of acting as a “part-time prime minister”. Shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said: “Our part-time prime minister needs to get a grip of this escalating situation quickly. It shouldn’t take another three days for this meeting to take place.”The acting leader of the Liberal Democrats Ed Davey said: “People across the country are anxious and concerned about coronavirus: they want to see leadership.“The Liberal Democrats called on Boris Johnson to chair a Cobra meeting weeks ago to ensure everything was being done to prepare for a potential coronavirus outbreak. With the NHS already so stretched, it’s gobsmacking that the Prime Minister has delayed chairing Cobra for so long.“Just like his failure to visit communities hit by flooding, on coronavirus Johnson seems like he’d rather bury his head in the sand than hear for himself what the experts are saying and what his ministers are doing.”Ofqual, the exam regulator for England, says it is considering how to manage the dangers of a coronavirus outbreak disrupting this summer’s GCSE and A-level exams.Students are due to sit A-levels – crucial for university entry – in May and June, but a widespread outbreak of Covid-19 at that point could mean that, in worst-case scenarios, students and staff may be unable to take the exams due to illness or quarantine restrictions.In a statement Ofqual said: “We are working closely with awarding organisations and the Department for Education to consider how to manage any particular risks to the smooth running of exams and assessments should there be a widespread outbreak of coronavirus.“We will update our existing guidance to reflect any specific arrangements schools and colleges should put in place if required. In the meantime, students, schools and colleges should continue to prepare for the summer exams and assessments as usual.”A-levels and GCSEs are taken from the second week of May until the middle of June, with exam results published in mid-August. Disrupted A-level results could complicate the process of university applications, which rely in most cases on students gaining specific exam results. But in a period of difficulty universities may use other methods to allot places, such as previous exam results.The Foreign Office has confirmed the death of a Briton who was onboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship. A spokesman said: “We are supporting the family of a British man who has died in Japan and are in contact with local authorities. Our sympathies and thoughts are with his family at this difficult time.”The WHO has said that the assessment of the risk of spread and risk of impact of Covid-19 is now “very high at global level”.The director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, told reporters in Geneva that the continued increase in the number of coronavirus cases and in the number of affected countries over the last days was “clearly of concern” but there was still a chance it could be contained.China’s 329 reported cases in the past 24 hours was the lowest figure there in more than a month, he added.There were more than 20 vaccines in development globally and several therapeutics were in clinical trials, Tedros said, and we could expect the first results in a few weeks time.Aer Lingus has confirmed that the person from Northern Ireland infected with Covid-19 travelled on the airline to Dublin airport.In a statement the airline said: “Aer Lingus can confirm that the patient in Northern Ireland who has been diagnosed with the Covid-19 virus travelled with the airline from northern Italy to Dublin.“Aer Lingus is co-operating fully with the HSE in relation to the Covid-19 developments and is liaising with the Department of Foreign Affairs, other government departments and the relevant authorities as required.“Aer Lingus will continue to assess the situation based on the guidance received.”Stocks are falling sharply in New York, as the coronavirus market rout continues.You can follow our live business coverage here:Moscow authorities are deporting 88 foreign nationals who violated quarantine measures imposed on them as a precaution against coronavirus, the RIA news agency cited the city’s deputy mayor as saying on Friday.Hundreds of people have been quarantined in Russia and Moscow authorities have carried out raids on potential carriers of the virus – iniduals at their homes or hotels – and used facial recognition technology to enforce quarantine measures.My colleague Kim Willsher, our Paris correspondent, reports:A woman from Cannes has tested positive for the coronavirus, the first in the Côté d’Azur region in the south of France.The 23-year-old was admitted to a special isolation unit in hospital in Nice after being found to be carrying the Covid-19 virus on Friday following a visit to Milan in Lombardy.The authorities are waiting for the results of tests on a second person from the area. David Lisnard, the mayor of Cannes, said the woman’s condition was “satisfactory”. He said he had been in contact with the regional health agency and was reassured there was “no particular cause for concern for the public health authorities”. An investigation is under way to trace anyone with whom the patient was in contact.Christian Estrosi, the mayor of Nice, who is seeking re-election in municipal elections next month, said he would be reducing the time spent campaigning. Estrosi announced that the Nice carnival this weekend was cancelled as a “preventative measure”. The nearby town of Menton has cancelled its annual Fête du Citron (Lemon Fête), a series of events due to be held over the weekend.The Cannes film festival committee said it was monitoring developments and said it was too early to say whether the event would go ahead.

The man is in isolation in Mexico City. At least five family contacts have also been placed in isolation.His case is connected to the second confirmed case in the northern state of Sinaloa, which is still pending the results of a second test.The coronavirus could reach most “if not all countries”, the World Health Organization said on Friday after Nigeria confirmed sub-Saharan Africa’s first case, Reuters is reporting.“The outbreak is getting bigger,” Christian Lindmeier, a WHO spokesman, told a Geneva news briefing. “The scenario of the coronavirus reaching multiple countries, if not all countries around the world, is something we have been looking at and warning against since quite a while.”Five more countries have reported their first case of Covid-19 – Nigeria, Estonia, Denmark, the Netherlands and Lithuania. Estonia’s social affairs minister Tanel Kiik said the affected inidual in that country is an Iranian national resident in Estonia, who had not recently arrived in the country either by plane or by sea but by bus from Riga, Latvia.Lindmeier added that the WHO was looking very carefully into reports of some people getting re-infected. “We need to carefully look at how the tests were taken, how the person was examined, if it was maybe overlooked that the person still had the virus somewhere in the residue in the body, whether they got reinfected by different means or ways. We’re not in a position to say it is possible or not to be coming back and being re-infected.“In general, we would expect that a person who had the coronavirus infection would be immune for at least a while afterwards. But again this is something we do not yet know.”A British man who was onboard the quarantined Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan has died from the coronavirus, the Japanese health ministry has confirmed.The first foreign passenger to die, his death brings the toll among passengers from the vessel to six.A spokeswoman for Princess Cruises, which operates the Diamond Princess, said: “All of us at Princess Cruises, including the crew of the Diamond Princess, offer our sincere condolences to family members and friends for their loss. Our dedicated care team are on hand to provide support.”Our Pablo Gutiérrez has created this set of maps illustrating how Covid-19 is spreading across the world.Prof Jonathan Ball, a professor of molecular virology at the University of Nottingham, has responded to media reports of a dog in Hong Kong being tested “weak positive” for coronavirus.“There is no evidence that the human novel coronavirus can infect dogs and it would be incredible for a virus to make so many species jumps in such a short space of time,” he said.“We have to differentiate between real infection and just detecting the presence of a virus – these are very different – and the fact that the test result was weakly positive would suggest that this is environmental contamination or simply the presence of coronavirus shed from the human contact that has ended up in the dog’s samples.“In truth this is incredibly irresponsible because the last thing we need to do is create mass hysteria about the possibility of dogs being infected, and therefore potentially transmitting this virus when there is absolutely no evidence for this whatsoever.”Researchers at the Sacco hospital in Milan say they have isolated the Italian strain of the coronavirus, reports Lorenzo Tondo. The scientists say the discovery will help to develop a vaccine and new treatments to contain the virus.Early in February, Italian researchers from the Spallanzani hospital in Rome successfully isolated Covid-19, which allowed the country to immediately activate tests on patients.“The virus previously isolated by researchers at the Spallanzani hospital is precisely the Chinese one, originating in Wuhan, while the coronavirus that we have isolated prevents the viral strain spreading in Italy,” Claudia Balotta, an immunologist at the Sacco hospital, told the Corriere della Sera.“Viruses reshuffle their genetic makeup to better bind to cells in the new host,” Tullio Prestileo, a doctor of infectious diseases at the Benfratteli hospital in Palermo, told the . “By spreading from one country to another, the virus originating in Wuhan will obviously reshuffle its genetic patrimony and the virus strain in China will have some slight differences from the one in Italy or Germany.”Thanks to the discovery, the Italian researchers believe they can now “trace the journey of the virus from China to Europe and detect the date of its first spread in the country”.The GMB union is the latest body to issue a warning about the threat the coronavirus poses to workers in the gig economy.Mick Rix, the GMB national officer, said:The threat of Coronavirus is a huge problem for employers and workers across the UK. But workers in the so-called gig economy, or on zero-hours contracts, are left abandoned and penniless if they have to self-isolate.Once again the bogus self-employment model is screwing over the disadvantaged. GMB is calling on all employers – regardless of the contract – to do the right thing and pay their workers if they have to take time off due to the global health crisis.The union said that in one recent case a delivery driver was contacted by a customer who considered themselves high risk. The driver told the company, which instructed her not to come back into work. This meant she faced the prospect of not being able to earn any money until she was given the all-clear.Public Health England has issued new advice on the coronavirus in places of education.

As Covid-19 is a viral illness, antibiotics are of no use and neither are antiviral drugs that work against flu.

Photograph: Dara Mac DónaillAfter seven years of Liffey cycle scheme stalemate, cyclists and campaign groups were for the most part relieved, if not totally delighted, when last April the National Transport Authority (NTA) announced its chosen route.Any joy was short-lived, however, when it emerged a few months later the project would not be in place until 2024 at the earliest.Dublin’s cyclists must be used to disappointment by now, particularly when it comes to the Liffey scheme.It’s hard to fathom how a 5km cycle route could possibly take so long to install, given almost half of it, the section from the Custom House heading east, is already done. Also, it just needs to run on an existing road beside a river – essentially a straight line.For five years Dublin City Council couldn’t manage to design a scheme everyone liked, and so failed to choose any scheme at all.Quays ersionsThe council’s transportation department presented eight different “preferred routes” for the path from 2012-2017, but couldn’t secure the sanction of councillors for any of them. Some were discarded because they would inconvenience drivers with ersions off the quays, others would have taken cyclists away from the riverside for a distance, which campaigners felt detracted from the integrity of a “Liffey” cycle route.Some of the eight options were sensible and workable, some were terrible and shoddily planned. The worst being the one, proposed in 2015, that involved erting buses through an apartment block under construction in Smithfield. One of the few apartment complexes being built in the city at the time, it is now completed and occupied.In 2017, after more than €360,000 had been spent on the project, the NTA called a halt and said it would take over the decision-making. It took them until 2019 to come up with a plan, essentially the same as one discounted by the council several years ago that had cycle lanes on both sides of the river.Route trialSome campaigners weren’t happy with this option, favouring a two-way northside-only route, but were even less happy when it emerged the project wouldn’t be in place until 2024. Last month, they called for the city council to trial the two-way route for eight to 12 months.But the council, showing unexpected backbone as far as this project is concerned, has decided to put in place as much of the NTA’s plan as possible, barring the expensive engineering works such as boardwalks and instead of a short trial, keep those measures in place until the NTA project is completed.It’s not perfect, and it is particularly disappointing large sections of the south quays are excluded. However, given a recent Garda report found the quays to be among of the most dangerous roads in the State, it is very encouraging the council is stepping up and putting a basic framework in place, until the NTA gets around to building on it."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4181069.1582312165!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"waste materials to be airlifted from mv alta wreck","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe MV Alta, a 77m Tanzanian registered cargo ship which had been abandoned and drifting in the Atlantic Ocean for 17 months, washed up on rocks near Ballycotton in east Cork last weekend.

Particularly, she said, to what extent cost and environmental concerns were informing decisions.She said of particular concern was the need for an ecologist to examine local sea life for signs of pollutants.“It’s a simple thing. Maybe they have done all of this but there isn’t enough information available, and if they haven’t done it, why not?”Keep awayMs Dubsky said despite local restrictions, efforts would be made by environmentalists to examine limpets, a marine mollusc, on rocks in the area to see if they are falling off.Members of the public have again been urged to stay away from the wreck which is on a dangerous and inaccessible stretch of coastline and in an unstable condition.As part of the operation, access to a local cul-de-sac road has been restricted to residents. The council has also said that lands along the shoreline are private.Under law, it is an offence for anyone to interfere with a wreck or to attempt to board it.A Revenue official has been appointed Receiver of Wrecks by the Department of Transport, a function necessary to manage the possession and disposal of vessels which wash ashore."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4187993.1582905122!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus myths that have gained traction","story":"Minister for Health Simon harris has visited Dublin Airport where he met with HSE staff providing information about the coronavirus to people as they arrive in Ireland.

Photographer: Geert Vanden WijngaertBloombergIn the two months since a novel strain of coronavirus emerged in Wuhan, China, panic has spread throughout social media.The World Health Organisation has expressed concern about an “infodemic”, warning that misinformation about the Sars-CoV-2 virus (which causes Covid-19 illness) is causing harmful stigmatisation and discrimination.With a focus on doomsday scenarios, fake news has created false but believable memes to feed people’s understandable thirst for information. But despite social media giants attempting to tackle misinformation about the new virus, the spread of false news continues.A 2018 Rand corporation survey found that of all categories of fake news, health news is the worst. Vaccines have been a particular target now false news sources are blurring the line between opinion and fact about the new illness, Covid-19.Here are some of the myths that have gained traction around Covid-19.Getting coronavirus is a death sentenceFact: The vast majority of cases are mild and self-limiting. The new bug has a mortality rate of about 2 per cent. Even those admitted to hospital with a severe illness are most likely to fully recover. Researchers tracking the disease report 17,000 recoveries from the illness. And if it had a high mortality rate, we would not be seeing the easy spread of Covid-19.Wearing a face mask will protect you from itFact: Despite global panic buying there is no evidence that standard disposable surgical face masks offer protection against the virus. Because they are not custom-fit and are loose, these masks may allow tiny droplets from an infected person to get into the wearer’s nose, mouth or eyes. In addition, anyone with the virus on their hands who touches their face under a mask could become infected. However, people diagnosed with Sars-CoV-2 who wear these masks lessen their chance of infecting those around them.A commercial hand sanitiser is only way to kill itFact: While washing hands is the single most important action you can take to stop the spread of the virus, it must be done thoroughly. Wash for at least 20 seconds with soap and water, including between the fingers and the area around the base of the thumb. If using a sanitiser, for it to be effective, make sure it contains at least 60 per cent alcohol.Cannabis and garlic protect against the virusFact: A YouTube video of a doctor discussing how cannabis can boost a person’s immunity to the coronavirus is a fake. Medical experts emphasise there is no evidence to suggest that cannabis improves immunity against the virus.Online claims that Covid-19 can be cured overnight by drinking freshly boiled garlic water are untrue. There is no specific anti-viral treatment for it.Closing borders and airports will stop the spreadFact: Past experience suggests there is no benefit to measures such as these. If anything, they promote fear and panic. And they probably make it more likely that people with symptoms of Sars-CoV-2 won’t come forward and identify themselves to health professionals."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4185547.1582834321!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus what we know so far about how ireland is affected","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tPassengers wearing protective face masks arrive at the Hongqiao railway station in Shanghai. Photograph: Noel CelisAFP via Getty ImagesHave there been any cases here so far?One case was confirmed in Northern Ireland on Thursday evening. The patient travelled from Italy through the Republic and into Northern Ireland.The Department of Health has said that more than 100 people have been tested for coronavirus in the Republic so far and all results have come back negative.What about Irish people abroad? Especially those who may be returning?Two Irish-German passengers who were on board the Princess Diamond cruise ship docked off Yokohama, Japan, tested positive for the coronavirus. They are not normally resident in Ireland are being treated in hospital in Japan.Elsewhere, a hotel on the island of Tenerife was placed under quarantine when an Italian doctor staying there tested positive for the coronavirus. The Irish Department of Foreign Affairs is providing consular assistance to a number of Irish citizens in the area.Two other Irish citizens were quarantined in Liverpool in England after being evacuated from the Diamond Princess cruise ship moored off Japan. Both subsequently left quarantine and reported they were healthy and safe.But does all this mean we should avoid overseas travel?The Department of Foreign Affairs has advised against all non-essential travel to China, and against all travel to the Chinese province of Hubei.It has also advised Irish citizens not to travel to Japan, Hong Kong, Iran, Singapore, South Korea, as well as four regions in northern Italy where restrictions have been imposed, and which have direct flights with Ireland.What if I’ve recently been to an affected area?Anyone who has been to an affected region (mainland China, South Korea, Japan, Singapore, Hong Kong, Iran and four regions in northern Italy) in the last 14 days and is experiencing symptoms should self-isolate and call their GP.The same applies to anyone who has been in close contact with a confirmed case of the virus in the last 14 days and is experiencing symptoms. Anyone who has been to an affected region in the last 14 days, and are well, should visit hse.ie for advice.So is this going to mess a lot of people’s holiday plans up?A number of secondary schools across Ireland have decided to cancel school trips to Italy in light of the latest travel advice.Alexandra College in Dublin confirmed it had cancelled the school’s annual trip for transition year students to Italy after a teacher, who organised the trip and is from Italy, consulted with local Italian authorities.Irish holiday makers are also reportedly cancelling trips to Italy. In some cases, these included bookings for holidays that are not due to take place until the summer. Travel agents have also said that, for now, Irish people are stalling on making bookings.Is that affecting airlines? And what about other businesses, and our tourism industry?The airlines are feeling the pinch alright. Earlier this week, investors began ditching stocks that they believed were vulnerable to a European outbreak. One of the biggest was Ryanair, whose shares tumbled 13.4 per cent in Dublin.Ryanair says all its flights are operating as normal but added that it would follow any public health instructions that were issued. The same is true of Aer Lingus.Elsewhere, Junayeo Air confirmed last week that it had decided to postpone the scheduled launch of its proposed Dublin-Shanghai service on March 29th until further notice.It’s not just the airlines either. Many Irish companies have operations in affected regions or depend on them for supply lines, and they are also dealing with some of the fallout. For example, one of our biggest companies, Kerry Group, said sales in China are set to fall by about 30 per cent in the first quarter of the year.What are we going to do about citizens from affected regions coming here?The DAA, which operates Dublin Airport, has said it is currently “business as usual” at the airport with flights from affected regions landing as normal.The Government is doing what it can to limit mass influxes from affected regions. The surge in cases in Italy has forced the cancellation of Ulster’s Pro14 rugby game against Benetton in Treviso due to take place on Saturday.Minister for Health Simon Harris has also called for the Ireland’s Six Nations rugby match against Italy on March 7th to be called off. Minister for Sport Shane Ross has said more sporting fixtures could be cancelled if necessary to prevent the spread.Could we not just screen people as they arrive in Ireland?No. Entry screening for Covid-19 “doesn’t work, wouldn’t work” and would be a “waste of resources”, the chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan has said.Fair enough. Can expect other big events, like the St Patrick’s Day Festival, to follow suit then?The cancellation of mass gatherings, such as large conferences with a significant number of participants from a highly affected area, “may be justified in exceptional circumstances” according to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.Decisions to cancel however will be co-ordinated with organisers and public health authorities on a case-by-case basis. But it’s possible we will see more major events cancelled.What about schools?During a containment phase, school closures “are not justified”, the European Centre for Disease Control said.“There is also no data to support informed decisions on proactive school closures in terms of their anticipated effectiveness in mitigating the ... epidemic, due to the unknown level of transmission of this virus among children.”However, should transmission of the virus become widespread, school closures “may be necessary”, even though they probably would not reduce the impact of the epidemic. For now though, it seems unlikely.What are the chances of someone testing positive for the virus here and what happens then?Harris has said the outbreak in Italy and in neighbouring countries means the chances of an Irish case in the coming days or weeks has increased significantly.He has designated the virus as a notifiable disease, which means doctors will be obliged to routinely notify the HSE when a case is diagnosed.The Department of Health is also understood to be looking at bringing the condition under legislation that would allow for a person with the virus to be detained and isolated."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4188039.1582907483!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"placing of children in adult psychiatric unit in limerick unacceptable","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThree children were placed in an adult acute psychiatric unit at University Hospital  Limerick over an eight month period, the Mental Health Commission has said. Image: Google Street View. Three children were placed in an adult acute psychiatric unit in Limerick over an eight month period, the Mental Health Commission has said.The children were placed in the unit at University Hospital Limerick because there was no suitable accomodation available elsewhere.“The placing of children in adult units remains a totally unacceptable, but common feature of mental health care practice in Ireland,” the commission’s chief executive John Farrelly said. “The psychiatric unit at Limerick is an adult acute admission unit and, as such, is not structured or resourced to provide separate or specifically age-appropriate facilities.”The Limerick unit is one of three identified in reports published by the commission on Friday as having been involved in “high-risk non-compliance” with regulations. The others were the St Edna’s Unit at St Loman’s Hospital, Mullingar and the Maryborough Centre at St Fintan’s Hospital, Portlaoise.Not all staff were up to date or had been trained in mandatory training in fire safety, basic life support, prevention and management of aggression and violence, and the Mental Health Act 2001, the reports found.These types of failures put service users and staff at risk, said the Inspector of Mental Health Facilities Dr Susan Finnerty.In relation to the acute psychiatric unit in Limerick, the commission noted that the high observation unit, which contains a seclusion room and eight single bedrooms, was out of commission at the time of inspection. “This area has never been operational and there are no plans to open it in the immediate future. This affects the availability of space and accommodation for residents in the main approved centre,” the report noted.StarkIt also noted that the main sitting room in the unit was bare and stark in appearance, and was a thoroughfare to the outdoor area where residents could smoke. “The sitting room smelt of smoke as the adjoining door to the smoking area was often left open. The main sitting room of the approved centre was cold. The premises was unclean in some areas - particularly the fridge and the sink in the pantry.”One outdoor area contained litter such as cigarette butts, one toilet was malodorous, and plant beds in all of the gardens were overgrown with weeds. In relation to St Edna’s, the report noted that there was evidence of exposed wiring, broken doors, and cracked ceiling glass. “The corridors in St Edna’s ward were noticeably cold. Some furnishings were worn and in a poor state of repair.” In relation to the Maryborough Centre, the report noted that, while there were problems with some aspects of its operation, compliance with regulatory requirements had improved over the past three years, from 64 per cent in 2017, to 83 per cent last year."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4187197.1582833494!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"what should you do if you think you might have coronavirus","story":"At a media briefing in Dublin the HSE has said that  there have been 90 suspected cases of  Covid-19 tested here, but none have been positive for the virus.

Photograph: iStockThe first thing to consider is have you possible symptoms – coughing, shortness of breath, breathing difficulties, fever?Then, have you come back from any of the at-risk areas in the past 14 days – China, Hong Kong, Japan, Singapore, South Korea, Iran, and four regions of Northern Italy: Lombardy, Veneto, Emilia-Romagna or Piedmont?Do you think you have been in contact with someone confirmed with the virus? Or were you in a hospital where coronavirus patients were being treated?If you fit any of these criteria, call your GP. Do not call to the surgery in person.The GP will question you as per a normal medical consultation. Based on the outcome of this discussion, he or she may then contact the local public health doctor for further consultation.If the GP decides you need to be tested, he or she will contact the emergency department of your local hospital, where staff will be informed that a person requiring testing is arriving. Staff will make the appropriate arrangements, such as donning protective gear.New protocolThe protocol from this point on changed earlier this week. Before that point, people requiring tests were transported by ambulance to hospital. This will still apply in cases where people are very ill, but in cases where the person is deemed to be fit and able to travel, he or she can be brought to hospital by someone such as a partner or other household contact.On arrival the person is tested and clinically assessed. If necessary on clinical grounds, they may be hospitalised, but those deemed to be fit to go home will be sent home.Once home, they will be contacted by a public health specialist providing advice about self-isolation.The test is sent to the National Virus Reference Laboratory in UCD where a result is ready within 24 hours. Effectively this means samples received in the afternoon will not receive results until the following day.If the test is negative – as all in the Republic have been to date – the person is free to resume normal life, but advised to keep an eye on any symptoms.If the result is positive, the person would be taken to hospital, mostly likely the national isolation unit at the Mater hospital in Dublin, and treated there."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Mental Health Commission raises concerns about \u0026lsquohigh-risk non-compliance\u0026rsquo in three centresSign of peace is to be suspended at Masses and holy water fonts emptiedDonegal man jailed for seven years for raping teenager in a field and then in her homeDead woman\u0026rsquos sisters say \u0026lsquojustice has been served\u0026rsquo after fourth accused found guiltyFour people found guilty in trial over death of 61-year-old with a fifth pleading guilty\u0026lsquoShe will never feed herself, never go to school, never walk up the aisle,\u0026rsquo mother saysLabour likely to be asked to alter stance on staying outside fray of building administrationWelsh-born Sionad Jones tells court of Sitka spruce\u0026rsquos harmful effect on Irish bioersityJudge rejects Minister\u0026rsquos arguments that regulations prevented the man\u0026rsquos enlistmentTeenager had gone to London with \u0026euro2,000 to organise drug deal from the United StatesA 10-year-old boy born here to a Nigerian mother has been deported arising from the refusalWhen charged by garda\u0026iacute the 50-year-old replied \u0026lsquono thanks no\u0026rsquoAlexandra, Heidi, Hollie and Odhr\u0026aacuten grew most in popularity last year\u0026lsquoSmall number\u0026rsquo of those in contact with woman with coronavirus in NI identified as at riskSeven men aged between 18 and 20 are arrested, released on bailNational emergency group chair warns current operations to deal with floods may be suspendedASTI insists Department of Educaton circular aimed at resolving row is \u0026lsquounacceptable\u0026rsquoStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4187817.1582894836!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"baby names 2019 emily and jack retain top spots","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tAlexandra, Heidi and Hollie were the girls’ names growing most in popularity last yearJack and Emily were the most popular baby names registered last year, according to the Central Statistics Office (CSO).

These unique surnames included some double-barrelled surnames – for example Driscoll-O’Shea. The top three surnames for births registered were Murphy at 683 (1.1 per cent), Kelly at 567 (0.9 per cent) and Ryan at 450 (0.8 per cent).The CSO has published babies’ forenames since 1998 and receives this data from the General Registration Office (GRO).Carol Anne Hennessy, CSO statistician, said some of the less popular names for boys included Teidí, Saul, Dexter and Ruán and for girls’ included Féile, Jorja, Kyrah and Constance.“Back in 1969, John, Patrick, Michael, James and Thomas were the names most favoured by parents of new-born baby boys. There were 209 male new-borns named John in 2019, just over 7 per cent of the number of boys given the name John in 1969,” she said. “Interestingly, not one of the top five names for girls appeared in the top 100 names a half century earlier. Mary, Catherine, Margaret, Ann and Elizabeth were the most popular names for baby daughters in 1969, with 2,182 baby girls named Mary in that year. “In 2019, there were 452 baby girls named Emily, 20.7 per cent of the number of girls given the name Mary in 1969.”Stay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4187838.1582894224!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus advice wash your hands and avoid hugging kissing and hand shaking","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t A spectator wears a face mask at the Dubai Duty Free Tennis ATP Championships  in Dubai. Photograph: Ali HaiderEPAWith the coronavirus spreading rapidly across the world and one case now confirmed on the island of Ireland, much of the focus is on how to deal with the illness and care for the sick.But equally important, if not more important, in what is still a containment phase is how to minimise the odds of contracting the virus and stay safe as the illness spreads.The first and best advice is not to panic. Hysteria is a real enemy in a situation like this.“We are actually in a very delicate situation in which the outbreak can go in any direction based on how we handle it,” World Health Organisation head Dr Tedros Ghebreyesus said on Thursday night. “This is not a time for fear. This is a time for taking action to prevent infection and save lives now,” he added.There has been a huge amount of speculation about the illness, much of which is ill-informed or speculative but what we know for certain now is that the Covid-19 coronavirus is new and scientists are assessing how it spreads.We also know that similar viruses tend to spread via cough and sneeze droplets.’Social distancing’That is why so-called “social distancing” will be important in the days ahead. That means you should move at least a metre away from anyone who appears ill if you can. Avoid shaking hands or hugging or kissing people as part of a greeting.There has also been a lot of talk in recent days about face masks and alcohol based hand sanitisers but - by far - the most effective way to protect yourself is by regularly washing your hands.At the risk of stating the obvious, a quick rinse under the tap doesn’t get rid of dangerous germs. Hands need to be vigourously washed with soap and hot water for at least 20 seconds or the length of time it takes to sing the Happy Birthday song twice.Many people don’t dry their hands either which is why it is important to remember that damp actually can help germs to breed and allows them to spread more easily onto whatever you touch next.According to advice from the HSE, in addition to hand-washing people should also use alcohol based hand sanatisers if necessary.It is also important to cover your mouth and nose with a tissue or your sleeve when you cough and sneeze and to put used tissues into a bin and then wash your hands again. People should not touch their eyes, nose or mouth if their hands are not cleanThe HSE advice also reminds people to clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces.With regard to face masks the HSE advice is simple. People who are well or have no symptoms of illness should not use them. “There’s no evidence that using masks is of any benefit if you are not sick,” it says.People who should use face masks if they have or may have coronavirus or if they are in close contact with someone who has or may have coronavirus or if they are are a healthcare worker in close contact with people who have or may have coronavirus.Healthcare workersAccording to the HSE people who work in a healthcare setting can best protect themselves by regularly washing their hands and covering their mouths and noses when coughing and sneezing.Health care professionals dealing with cases or suspected cases of the coronavirus are being advised to wear personal protective equipment which includes a surgical face mask, a face shield or goggles, gloves and a clean, non-sterile, disposable long-sleeved gown. “If this is not available, wear a plastic apron and roll up sleevesIrish people displayed a propensity to stockpile during the two or three days that the beast from the east made its presence felt two years ago.Bread supplies dried up and fresh meat and dairy disappeared from supermarkets as supply chains displayed a worrying fragility.Will something similar happen if panic about the coronavirus mounts? Possibly.Certainly in other locations concerns over shortages have led some people to stockpile and there has been evidence of panic buying.Already in this country all the face masks have disappeared from pharmacies and even hardware shops.“I don’t think it is necessary, and I certainly don’t advise it,” Mark Woolhouse at the University of Edinburgh to New Scientist this week.Food suplyJennifer Nuzzo at Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security in Baltimore, Maryland told the same magazine that people should ensure they have at least three days’ food supply to hand as they are advised to do during hurricanes. “I’m not saying it’s specifically necessary in this case,” she said.Meanwhile virology blogger Ian Mackay recommended slowly building up a “pandemic stash”.Certainly do not stock up on prescription medicines - not only will you almost certainly not need them but you may make it harder for those that do need them to access them. Which takes us back to the start and the best advice which is don’t panic.Stay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4187810.1582892655!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus north s health chief confident virus can be contained","story":"Minister for Health Simon harris has visited Dublin Airport where he met with HSE staff providing information about the coronavirus to people as they arrive in Ireland. Video: Bryan O\u0027Brien\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tNorth’s chief medical officer Dr Michael McBride speaking at a press conference on Thursday. Photograph: Michael McHughPA WireNorthern Ireland’s chief medical officer has said he is confident health authorities in Northern Ireland will be able to contain the spread of coronavirus. The first case on the island of Ireland was confirmed on Thursday in a woman who had flown to Dublin from northern Italy and then travelled on to Belfast. She followed the advice from the Public Health Agency (PHA) and contacted her GP and then “self-isolated” at home while awaiting the results of tests. The “presumptive positive” result has been sent to laboratories in England for verification. The PHA has said she is receiving “specialist care”. Dr Michael McBride said at a press conference in Belfast on Thursday that a “small number” of those in contact with the patient had been identified as at risk. Speaking on BBC Radio Ulster on Friday, he said he was “confident that the steps that the inidual took upon return to Northern Ireland, based on advice that was relayed, and indeed the prompt and rapid action by PHA colleagues, will ensure that we’re able to contain this,” he said. “What we do not have in Northern Ireland at this point in time, and this is really crucially important, we do not have cases in Northern Ireland that have occurred in Northern Ireland,” he said. “We don’t have community transmission in Northern Ireland.” “Basically speaking, that has enabled the authorities to put in step everything that has been planned and prepared for to limit spread of the virus to the wider community,” he said. On Friday, Dr John Cuddihy, the director of the Health Protection Surveillance Centre, told journalists in Dublin that “each of the stages of this person’s journey have been identified and all relevant contacts in all of those stages of transport have been contacted (and) traced.” People who sat within two rows of the woman on the plane have been contacted. It is not clear whether she travelled from Dublin to Belfast by public transport, but both Iarnród Éireann and Translink have carried out a “sanitising clean” of the Dublin to Belfast Enterprise trains as a “precautionary measure”. A special isolation unit has been established at the Royal Victoria Hospital in Belfast. Travellers who have recently returned from high risk areas, including specific parts of northern Italy, should self-isolate at home and contact their GP by phone, the PHA has advised. “Washing your hands regularly will help prevent flu and other viruses spreading,” the PHA said. Anyone who becomes unwell and suspects they may have been exposed to coronavirus should stay at home and phone their GP for advice.

Because the trajectory is not stable, 2020 CD3 will eventually be flung away from the planet.The new moon is thought to be between 1.9 and 3.5 metres across.Kacper Wierxchos, a researcher at the NASA-funded Catalina Sky Survey, made the discovery with colleague Theodore Pruyne.He hailed the rare sighting as big news, tweeting: It\u0027s a big deal as, out of one million known asteroids, this is just the second asteroid known to orbit Earth.A spokesman for the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory\u0027s Minor Planet Center, which collects data on minor planets and asteroids, said: Orbit integrations indicate that this object is temporarily bound to the Earth.No link to a known artificial object has been found. Further observations and dynamical studies are strongly encouraged.The spokesman added: The story of 2006 RH120 is not without controversy, however, as its orbit appears similar to some Apollo-era spent rockets boosters, and therefore some scientists believe it may be an artificial object.”Meanwhile, Tesla CEO Elon Musk said the car-sized object was not the Telsa Roadster he launched into space in 2018, which is now orbiting the Sun.

We\u0027ve known for years that the next great pandemic was going to come from a virus that leapt from animal to man. I wasn’t surprised when bats at a meat market in Wuhan, China were implicated in the latest scourge. It wasn’t a question of if but when. Nor am I surprised by the sluggish response we’ve seen from authorities around the world.Although the coronavirus’ suspected mortality rate of  2 per cent sounds low, it’s about the same as that of the Spanish flu of 1918 and that virus killed between 40 and 100 million people. To contain coronavirus, therefore, we must be vigilant, perform far more tests, and we must not cut corners.Before I became a doctor, I spent years studying the viruses that live in bats, everything from Ebola to rabies to Nipah Virus, because my research team suspected that bats were the linchpin for the next outbreak. We feared bats because they have a unique trait: the ability to suppress their immune system in the presence of an infection (this is thought to help cope with the stress of flying). It means bats can live with pathogens that kill humans.We knew to be fearful of these flying mammals. Around the time I became an infectious disease specialist in the United States, a federally-funded program called PREDICT was assembled to monitor infectious diseases in bats all over the world. Scientists used many of the techniques I helped to develop 15 years ago, gathering information that could be used to create vaccines, new medicines, and inform crucial public health decisions. PREDICT was shuttered in October, and I am unaware of any such programs operating elsewhere.It’s clear we took our eye off the ball. Now we\u0027re scrambling to catch up. But how? As the novel coronavirus sweeps the world - we\u0027re at more than 80,000 cases and counting - the virus has crept into 47 countries so far. Expect that number to rise. But where will it go next? A truism in epidemiology is that the more you look, the more you find, and many countries aren’t looking all that hard. The countries that have done the best job in containing the virus - Singapore among them, where recoveries are now outpacing new cases - were swift to ban inbound flights from China, quick to quarantine potential victims, and crucially, have conducted rigorous early testing.This is key. While leaders focus on quarantines, vaccines, and new medicines - all of which are important - we rarely hear about the development of new tests to detect deadly pathogens once an epidemic begins. This failure happens with every outbreak and it must change.China made major strategic mistakes at the onset. Once they identified a cluster of pneumonia associated with the meat market in Wuhan, they closed the market, citing “renovations”. Then, when they discovered how the virus was transmitted, they didn’t immediately reveal that it could be spread from one human to another. After eventually sharing this finding, they swung in the other direction and undertook a severe quarantine the largest in history. The World Health Organization initially said this was a mistake but eventually acknowledged the quarantine helped. The rest of the world needs to be proactive. Other countries must aggressively test people to indicate just how prolific this virus actually is. In Iran, of the 139 cases reported, 19 have died. This suggests we’re missing far too many patients, perhaps thousands.It\u0027s useful to take a look at how testing is done to understand why it’s failing in some countries. During any outbreak, the first step is for the government to quickly develop a new test (in this case, it took China about four weeks) then produce a lot of them. The testing relies on a form of nucleic acid amplification that’s rather straightforward once the virus has been sequenced. Private companies and academic laboratories can generally step in to manufacture them but must follow strict quality controls. This system usually works (in the US, it didn’t earlier this month the tests which the FDA sent to 50 states were found to be flawed and had to be recalled - which means we are very much in the dark as to the true scale of the spread there.)Things are looking more encouraging in the UK. The NHS has already tested more than 7,000 patients, 15 of which have so far been positive, and has now started piloting a home-testing scheme which means high-risk iniduals don’t have to leave self-isolation to undertake it. Select hospitals in the UK have been instructed to test a broad swathe of patients, including patients with flu-like symptoms who have no known link to a coronavirus case or travel to China, South Korea, or Italy. These are important steps they will hasten diagnosis, ensure patients are properly triaged, and will help contain this pandemic. Coronavirus is scary because there\u0027s so much uncertainty. We still don\u0027t know exactly where it came from, we don\u0027t know how long patients may remain asymptomatic after infection, and we don’t know where the virus is heading next. In many industrialised nations, including the United States, we still don\u0027t have the means to rapidly and efficiently diagnose coronavirus. As a result, the true extent of this pandemic remains a mystery. Some, including Harvard epidemiology professor Marc Lipsitch, predicts that by the end of the year, anywhere between 40 to 70 per cent of people will be infected with the virus globally - though this does not mean everyone will be severely ill as a result. We do not know how many people have only suffered mild symptoms and not sought medical treatment. Again, without proper diagnostics, we cannot understand the full scope of the problem. And downplaying the spread of a virus when it first hits is not the answer.Next time a bat passes one onto a human (and it will happen), we must get proper diagnostic testing up and running before we focus on anything else. It\u0027s a lesson we continue to relearn. Matt McCarthy is Assistant Professor of Medicine, Weill Cornell Medicine and the author of “Superbugs: The Race to Stop an Epidemic.”The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

He had a first class brain and, rather like Robin Williams\u0027 character in Dead Poets Society, an uncanny ability to command pupils\u0027 attention.Colleagues admired how students excelled under his tuition, remembering him as the reason that a string of pupils from an ordinary Worcestershire school had gone on to study at Oxbridge.But while some students no doubt benefited from his academic attentions, others claim there was a high price to pay. Three of his former students have told The  he was a predator who used his position to groom female pupils for sex.They have decided to speak out now because they say the MeToo movement has helped them realise that what they had previously characterised as a relationship with an erudite older man was actually a wholly abusive breach of trust on his part.They hope it will embolden other women in similar positions to speak out about abusive former teachers.One alleged victim, Kerry, said: He would have sex with us or sexually assault us in his office on the school premises.She was just 15 when they first had intercourse, she claimed, saying: He saw me flirting with boys and he was concerned I was going to lose my virginity, so he wanted to get in there first.Mr Wilkinson told The  he did not acknowledge any of the alleged relationships. He said the allegations were turning into a nightmare for him, but that he had no further comment to make. I don\u0027t want to say anything … I have nothing to say about it. I\u0027m sorry, he said.According to his alleged victims, the grooming would start with him putting stickers on their locker, playing footsie under the desk or inappropriately placing a hand on a knee at the theatre.They claimed he would hold private study groups at his house, offer students lifts home and invite his favourites to use his school office. Some of the alleged relationships would last for years, the women have said.One former student, who claimed she first had sex with Mr Wilkinson when she was 16, said: I would have a relationship with him as a boyfriend … it was always at his house. We never went anywhere else because it was a secret.After the relationship ended, she said, she put it in a box and never really dealt with it.The three women claimed he went to great lengths to keep the relationships secret. Kerry said he even encouraged her to move to a different school to ensure that he was safe.But he still engineered situations in which they would be alone together, she said. He is alleged to have sexually assaulted her in his school office. He also offered her private tuition to get her into Cambridge (which she eventually did), charging her parents for two-hour lessons that were largely spent in bed, she claimed.Kerry alleged that he seduced her by reciting poems about his lover\u0027s deep velvet amber eyes and her lips learning, yearning.She believed they were written for her, but said she later learnt she was not the only conquest to whom he recited them. He allegedly recycled the verses for another woman he started dating after she left school and would go on to marry and later orce.He also loved to discuss his favourite books, notorious pornographic novel \u0027The Story Of O\u0027 and \u0027Lolita\u0027, Vladimir Nabokov\u0027s infamous tale of a middle-aged professor who believes he is seduced by an underage child, Kerry said. They were his manuals for living, she added.Enthralled by him, she did everything he asked, and alleged their abusive relationship continued until she was 18, by which point, she said, they\u0027d had sex hundreds and hundreds of times.Speaking from her home in Sydney, she described how he would ask her to pose for pornographic pictures and, she claimed, once borrowed a school video camera to film her naked. She was later humiliated to learn that his other lovers allegedly saw these pictures.But she was not the only one he was said to have slept with. He allegedly entered a sexual relationship with another student while he was abusing his position to have a relationship with Kerry.He was married to a fellow teacher, Susan Wilkinson, when he started teaching at the school. Ms Wilkinson left him after she became pregnant with his child, and he allegedly moved on to another colleague. Before the marriage disintegrated, one of the school\u0027s male teachers tried to warn Susan of Mr Wilkinson\u0027s behaviour, telling her that putting David in the sixth form is like putting him in a sweetshop.One other alleged victim recalled finding a trove of mementos: Polaroid photographs, letters and cards from girls who looked to be aged around 16. They were in their underwear – they weren\u0027t naked, but it was clear there was a sexual kind of scene to them, she said.Mr Wilkinson allegedly targeted very bright girls. The three who spoke to The  also admitted that they tended to come from difficult backgrounds. Some were still at school when the relationships began, they said. With others, Mr Wilkinson allegedly waited until after they completed their A-levels.According to the women, he would have sex with them at every opportunity.Kevin O\u0027Regan, who became head teacher in 1997, after Mr Wilkinson retired, recalled some hearsay about an incident with a sixth-former that had taken place before 1985 but was told it had been dealt with.Mr Wilkinson was so adept at ensuring his behaviour was kept secret that head teachers in charge at the school for the near-quarter of a century he was there say they were entirely unaware of any alleged abuse.When approached by The , one former head said he remembered Mr Wilkinson as an excellent, brilliant teacher. He added: Nearly all the arts candidates who went to Oxbridge, and there were a number, were taught by him and he was the reason they got in. He was one of the best teachers I ever came across. Very able.What was startling about Mr Wilkinson\u0027s alleged campaign of abuse was the complexity of the web of deceit it would involve.One woman, Lucy, claimed Mr Wilkinson initiated their sexual relationship in his car after a party at his house to celebrate the end of A-levels. She later learned that he went home after their encounter and allegedly initiated a sexual relationship with another of her classmates.Lucy returned to the school the following year to re-sit some exams. He was displeased but they carried on their affair regardless, she said.She believed that formative experience set a pattern for many of her subsequent relationships. She – and every other former student The  spoke to – wept as she recounted the impact it had on her life.I\u0027m not sure that our laws are sufficiently sophisticated at this point to understand the deep and profound ramifications of this kind of behaviour – that it is not only lifelong but also generational, she said. What\u0027s happened to me has also affected my children in ways that are very hard to describe.Like Kerry, she spent most of her life oblivious to the possibility that she might have been one of a string of girls to have become involved, and believed Mr Wilkinson had singled her out early on because she was somehow special.It was only in the wake of the MeToo movement that they started to reappraise things – and the discomfort they felt crystallised into horror.Kerry added: I think of him as almost evil – as a Svengali character who used his charisma and all of the tools at his disposal, literature and poetry, for sinister ends, to get what he wanted.And I think of him as being narcissistic. Up until this whole process, I think I was still somewhat grateful to him for what I had seen as a positive impact on my life, but I now realise that any positive impact was overstated and came at a huge, huge price to me.The allegations have been reported to the police. But the women\u0027s stories do not necessarily account for all those whose lives he allegedly affected.One girl who rejected his advances – whether wittingly or unwittingly – was allegedly subjected to a campaign of bullying by the man supposed to be nurturing her.Hillary Hinchliff, who went on to have a successful career in education and became principal of a renowned school in India, wept as she recounted how Mr Wilkinson made her life hell after she turned down his offer of a key to his private office.At the end of the day, he\u0027s a sick inidual who should have been stopped, she said.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2020/02/27/17/correction-0.jpg","title":"stock market correction coronavirus meaning definition sp 500 stoxx 600","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.What does a correction actually mean?

Last year the country went for more than a fortnight without burning a single lump of the black stuff, thought to be the first time since the 1880s.At around 8am on Thursday, coal was supplying only 1.9 per cent of the country\u0027s energy needs. It has largely been replaced by gas, which provided 50 per cent\u0026nbspon Thursday morning, and wind, 17 per cent.However, coal is still being used for industrial purposes, such as steelmaking.Drax already burns biomass at the site, a renewable fuel which consists of plant material and animal waste. However its critics say that it causes deforestation, and encourages farmers to grow monocrops just to be burned.Mr Gardiner said: “By using sustainable biomass we have not only continued generating the secure power millions of homes and businesses rely on, we have also played a significant role in enabling the UK\u0027s power system to decarbonise faster than any other in the world.”He added that the business is still “fully committed” to the regions its operates in “and with the right regulatory and investment framework is well positioned to deliver its plans for Yorkshire and the Humber”.It came as the company said adjusted profit before tax hit £142 million in 2019, up from £37 million the year before, on revenues of £4.7 billion, up around 11 per cent.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.110 In Cold Blood by Truman Capote (1966)The first classic of the true crime genre was Capote’s investigation of the four murders that rocked the small farming community of Holcomb, Kansas. He spent six years fascinated with killers Richard Hickock and Perry Smith, after travelling to research the tragedy with his childhood friend Harper Lee. “No one will ever know what In Cold Blood took out of me,” Capote once said. “It scraped me right down to the marrow of my bones. It nearly killed me. I think, in a way, it did kill me.”210 I\u0027ll Be Gone in the Dark by Michelle McNamara (2018)In 2018, more than 50 rapes and 12 murders in California were finally matched to a single culprit after 40 years. It’s possible to argue the killer would have gone undiscovered forever if not for the extensive research left behind by journalist Michelle McNamara after her death in 2016, which became this portrait of obsession. A true crime enthusiast since childhood, she gave the Golden State Killer his catchy name and turned national attention back to his crimes. The most compelling passages show her holed up with evidence, compulsively re-reading the gory details. “There’s a scream permanently lodged in my throat now,” she writes at one point. 310 Happy Like Murderers by Gordon Burn (1998)Gordon Burn’s unflinching exploration of Fred and Rosemary West exposes the decay that lay at the heart of rural England. He shines a light on the brutality of the murderous couple’s backgrounds - not to make them sympathetic, but rather to show how a legacy of cruelty can curdle into violence.410 Helter Skelter by Vincent Bugliosi (1974)The best-selling true crime book of all time covers the infamous Manson murders, which have stayed in the public imagination now for 50 years. Buglioso, prosecutor in the Tate-LaBianca trials, lays out the events that inspired movies like 2019’s Oscar-winning Once Upon a Time in Hollywood. Buglioso resented attempts to turn the cult leader into a mystical folk hero. In this book, he instead exposed how Manson exploited people who were already susceptible to anti-social ideas. It remains our primary source of information on a murderous motive that combined white supremacy, drug-fuelled paranoia, and Beatles conspiracy theories.510 Party Monster by James St James (1999)James St James paints an indelible picture of New York nightlife in this infamous tale of drugs, sex, fashion and murder. The 1996 death of a drug dealer named Angel kicked off a scandalous series of events that rocked the city’s party scene. As a club kid himself, the author shows us how he became the confidant of one of the killers, and experienced the dark side of a subculture that embraced total anarchy.  Formerly titled Disco Bloodbath, the novel later became a feature film starring Macaulay Culkin. 610 The Journalist and the Murderer by Janet Malcolm (1999)This unusual story focuses more on the ethics of journalism than the violent crimes of its titular murderer, Jeffrey MacDonald. Journalist Joe McGinniss befriended the man, who had murdered his pregnant wife and two daughters, and then wrote a book based on everything MacDonald had told him.710 Unbelievable by T Christian Miller and Ken ArmstrongRecently adapted for a Netflix series starring Toni Collette, Merritt Wever, and Kaitlyn Dever, Miller and Armstrong’s story of a shocking rape investigation won them numerous awards, including the 2016 Pulitzer Prize. The book’s central crime took place in Lynnwood, Washington, in 2008, and justice wasn’t delivered until other cases emerged years later and 1,300 miles away in Colorado.810 Columbine by Dave Cullen (2009)Two decades later, the Columbine shootings are as sadly relevant as ever. Dave Cullen’s 2009 examination of the massacre shows how the media storm obscured the tragedy at the time, creating myths instead of soberly investigating the circumstances. Nuance and accuracy are key to the book’s success. Cullen pushes past the image we have of the two shooters to get to the truth.910 The Red Parts: Autobiography of a Trial by Maggie Nelson (2007)Maggie Nelson is known today for genre-defying critical successes like The Argonauts and Bluets, but this 2007 book about her aunt’s murder shows an early foray into true crime. The case had haunted her since childhood, and when new DNA evidence emerged to lay blame 35 years after the tragedy, Nelson observed the new suspect’s trial closely. Through the prism of her family’s grief, the book is beautifully lyrical at times. Her mother’s perspective is particularly crucial, as she mourns her younger sister’s short, turbulent life. Nelson remains rational and skeptical throughout, however, commenting on the nature of crime and punishment in enthralling prose. 1010 The Stranger Beside Me by Ann Rule (1980)Ann Rule aspired to be a crime novelist in the 1970s, but she couldn’t have known that her best-selling debut would be inspired by the man who worked next to her. 110 In Cold Blood by Truman Capote (1966)The first classic of the true crime genre was Capote’s investigation of the four murders that rocked the small farming community of Holcomb, Kansas.

He probably didn’t have a clue when he was writing it.”Koontz, a prolific US novelist best known for works including Demon Seed and Odd Thomas, has yet to respond to the discovery.The disease, meanwhile, continues to spread around the world.

The UK\u0027s blue chip index of large companies briefly touched a three-and-a-half year low, before rallying to partially regain some of the day\u0027s losses.Among the biggest fallers was British Airways owner International Airlines Group which saw its shares tank after warning the Covid-19 had caused a drop in demand for flights.

Last year the country went for more than a fortnight without burning a single lump of the black stuff, thought to be the first time since the 1880s.At around 8am on Thursday, coal was supplying only 1.9 per cent of the country\u0027s energy needs. It has largely been replaced by gas, which provided 50 per cent\u0026nbspon Thursday morning, and wind, 17 per cent.However, coal is still being used for industrial purposes, such as steelmaking.Drax already burns biomass at the site, a renewable fuel which consists of plant material and animal waste. However its critics say that it causes deforestation, and encourages farmers to grow monocrops just to be burned.Mr Gardiner said: “By using sustainable biomass we have not only continued generating the secure power millions of homes and businesses rely on, we have also played a significant role in enabling the UK\u0027s power system to decarbonise faster than any other in the world.”He added that the business is still “fully committed” to the regions its operates in “and with the right regulatory and investment framework is well positioned to deliver its plans for Yorkshire and the Humber”.It came as the company said adjusted profit before tax hit £142 million in 2019, up from £37 million the year before, on revenues of £4.7 billion, up around 11 per cent.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

I’m drama by association. I put myself out there with my peers I don’t know if people really ever wanted to do the same with me. So I stopped wasting my energy.”Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesIn the interview, Halsey also discussed her public split with rapper G-Eazy, with whom she recorded the 2017 duet “Him \u0026amp I”.Created with Sketch.The 50 best albums of 2019 Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The debut solo album of the art-punk pioneer was never going to be predictable, easy-listening. No Home Record channels the dissonance and avant-garde vibe of New York’s experimental no-wave movement in a nine-song, genre-defiant collection that jumps between industrial, minimal electro-rock and abrasive art punk. Uniting the tracks is their creator’s restlessly questing, non-conformist spirit. It’s great to have her back. (EB)Nilüfer Yanya isn’t down with the “wellness” industry. On her debut album, Miss Universe, the singer-songwriter makes this perfectly clear, tearing into all those “improve yourself” schemes littered across social media and parcelling up that angst as cerebral, skewed alt-rock. ​Synths and saxophone play their part on the smoother, more soulful “Paradise” and “Baby Blu”. Listen to the driving groove of “Heat Rises”, meanwhile, and you’ll be instantly reminded of Kelis and Andre 3000’s “Millionaire”. That said, Yanya is very much her own artist: original and bold. (PS)Five years since their last album, the Ohioan duo have gone back to basics. Gone are the subtle inflections and lacquered psychedelia of Turn Blue Let’s Rock is all about simple hooks and nagging choruses, “an homage”, in the words of drummer Patrick Carney, “to the electric guitar”. Get past the terrible title, and you’ll be rewarded with a viscerally entertaining album that never lingers for more than four minutes per song. If this is genre pastiche, it’s genre pastiche done with skill and savvy. (PS)450 47) Bat for Lashes – Lost GirlsMusically, Lost Girls couldn’t be more Eighties if it were playing a Commodore 64 while eating Angel Delight. Like Stranger Things, everything about it is unashamedly nostalgic: the power drums, the moody atmospherics, the arpeggiated synths. Close your eyes and you can practically see Jason Patric on the Santa Cruz boardwalk in The Lost Boys​. Yes, nostalgia is a fairly generic formula. But listened to as a whole, the album positively thrums with sonic invention, managing to feel both fresh and full of intrigue. Khan once again demonstrates a knack for uncanny storytelling. (PS)On his debut album, the 24-year-old mixes sultry jams that recall the electronic funk of MGMT with nods to the greats: Prince, James Brown, Led Zeppelin and Marvin Gaye. Throughout, Collard exhibits his extraordinary voice, which swoops to a devilishly low murmur or soars to an ecstatic falsetto. On the lustful “Hell Song” he sings “less is more… but more is good”. You’re inclined to agree with him. (RO)When the Missouri singer broke out in 2014, she became known for her lo-fi, introspective sound and the staggering range and power of her voice. On All Mirrors, she dials things up even further than 2016’s Sixties-leaning My Woman, and turns her focus outwards – it is an album, she says, “about losing empathy, trust, love for destructive people” and “owning up to your darkest side”. It is also balletic and haywire, refusing to follow traditional rules of song structure. Listening to it feels like accidentally pressing play on two songs at once, and finding the combination strangely inebriating. (AP)750 44) Lizzo – Cuz I Love YouThis is a polished, playful album, though it has a DIY edge to it: “S**t, f**k, I didn’t know it was ending right there,” she chuckles in the final few moments of “Like a Girl”. “Girl, run this s**t back,” she says after a vivacious flute solo on “Tempo” – a song featuring a guest verse from Missy Elliott, the person who, Lizzo said on Twitter, “made this chubby, weird, black girl believe that ANYTHING was possible”. (AP)There’s no attempt to chase someone else’s wave here no token drill, afroswing or trap beats to satisfy playlist algorithms. Instead, his cold grime sonics are rendered down to their no-frills essentials – brutalist blocks of sad angular melodies and hard, spacious drums. The result is a quintessentially London record, as dark and moody as it is brash and innovative. “We used to do young and stupid,” Skepta concludes on “Gangsta”. “Now we do grown.” (IM)It lacks a centrepiece to match the arresting depth and space of Sweetener’s “God Is A Woman”, but Grande handles its shifting moods and cast of producers (including pop machines Max Martin and Tommy Brown) with engaging class and momentum. One minute you’re skanking along to the party brass of “Bloodline” the next floating into the semi-detached, heartbreak of “Ghostin’”, which appears to address Grande’s guilt at being with Davidson while pining for Miller. She sings of the late rapper as a “wingless angel” with featherlight high notes that will drop the sternest jaw. (HB)The Chicago-born singer’s ninth album is a furious reaction to the social and political events of 2018 – over 11 breathless tracks, he turns that anger into a howl of resistance. Each song feels personal yet relatable – the deep-rooted despair felt on “Trauma” at the sight of wealthy bullies rising to power is a universal one, as is the sense of liberation in just letting go on “What Can You Do But Rock n Roll”. Twelve Nudes is Furman’s most urgent and cathartic record. (RO)On his studio debut, YBN shows off his versatility, but not to the point that it distracts from the underlying message of each song. You have the menacing “Broke as F***”, where the beats and stark piano hook contrasts with Cordae’s rags-to-riches rap. Aged 21, the North Carolina artist flecks songs such as the Anderson .Paak-featuring “RNP” with an endearing kind of nonchalance over the woozy, psychedelic soul of opener “Wintertime”, meanwhile, he wonders how Corretta Scott King felt upon learning Martin Luther had cheated on her. It’s by no means a perfect album in the grand sense of the term, but it is a perfect demonstration of everything Cordae is capable of. (RO)Big Thief’s frontwoman Adrianne Lenker has an uncanny ability to make you feel like you’re in on a secret. Her whispering, spectral delivery and deeply personal lyrics are the key to this. Even on the band’s third album UFOF, with an audience that has grown exponentially in the past few years, the songs are still immensely intimate affairs. The album’s deathly intrigue is drawn from her own personal traumas, which she successfully spins into something that feels universal. But you don’t come away from this record feeling downcast. It’s more a reminder of how fleeting yet beautiful life is, and an appeal to make the most of it. (RO)1350 38) Jenny Lewis – On the LineHere, Lewis does what she does best: adds the glossy sparkle of Hollywood and a sunny Californian sheen to melancholy and nostalgia, with her most luxuriantly orchestrated album yet. Even when she’s singing, “I’ve wasted my youth”, it’s in that sweet voice, with carefree “doo doo doo doo doo doos”, and at a pace that’s so upbeat that it masks the sentiment. It’s a bittersweet mourning of her past. (EB)Few people have had as big a year as Billie Eilish. The first – and currently only – artist born in the Noughties to have a US number one single, she also released her double platinum debut album, the innovative and multifarious, if irksomely titled, When We All Fall Asleep Where Do We Go? There are some missteps –  “Wish You Were Gay” being one of them – but for the most part this is an album as full of charm and bite as Eilish herself. And with a melody that ducks and es in between the beat like a bank robber dodging lasers, the dark, dank pop-trap masterpiece “Bad Guy” is surely a contender for song of the year. (AP)One of the biggest new rap stars to emerge in 2019, AJ Tracey’s variety and the scale of his ambition on this album is breathtaking. Fans will be surprised to discover he sings almost as much as he raps, in pleasingly gruff tones. Each track is a standout, none more so than “Ladbroke Grove”, a hat-tip to classic garage in which Tracey switches up his flow to emulate a Nineties MC. It’s a thrilling work. (RO)The former Chairlift frontwoman’s solo debut (at least, her first under her own name) is an eccentric, experimental delight – PC music by way of classical pop. The product of a orce and a series of adrenal rushes she refers to as “pangs”, the album is musically agile and often lyrically stark: Sometimes I wonder Do I love you too much? Then I tell myself ‘Caroline, shut up’”, she sings on “Caroline Shut Up”. Polachek’s voice is her secret weapon – so jolting and elastic she had to prove it wasn’t autotuned in an astonishing Twitter video. (AP)Simpson recently said he wanted Sound \u0026amp Fury to “hit like a Wu-Tang record”, so each intro is like a one-two punch loaded with brilliant hooks. Then there’s the rollicking “A Good Look” and “Last Man Standing” – it’s pure rock and roll: sleazy, slick and lots of fun. Sound \u0026amp Fury marks another milestone for a remarkable artist. (RO)Of all the excellent bands to emerge out of Dublin’s booming music scene over the past few years, Fontaines DC are the best of them. Perhaps it’s the fact that they’re technically outsiders, having grown up on the borders of the city (or in their guitarist Carlos O’Connell’s case, between there and Spain). Frontman Grian Chatten eschews punk’s tradition of valuing shock value over songcraft and instead offers searing, literary observations of a city with which he has a lovehate relationship. (RO)1950 32) Vampire Weekend – Father of the BrideAlready subject to manic shifts in style and tempo, this hour-long LP roams in lounge pants from Deadhead jams to Zombies-catchy hooks, infectiously kitsch prog, highlife samples and – on “Sunflower” – a scat breakdown. An unfashionable record, then, and that may be its best asset. With such low stakes and barely any emotional intensity, Father of the Bride won’t cement Vampire Weekend’s legacy. But after a highly strung decade on the indie-rock A-list, it gives them room to breathe. (JM)“Making this album has allowed me, for the first time, to find compassion when I have been at my most ungraceful, confused and fractured,” FKA twigs writes in the album’s press notes. “I stopped judging myself, and at that moment found hope in MAGDALENE.” At times, MAGDALENE is just as ungraceful, confused and fractured as its creator was – a rush of baroque electronics, industrial noise, opera, synths, autotune and precarious falsetto. The follow-up to 2014’s LP1 is the sound of a woman teetering on the brink of collapse, gathering herself, and then erupting into a kind of defiance. (AP)2150 30) Bill Callahan – Shepherd in a Sheepskin VestBill Callahan returns after six years with this homely, career-best album in which he sings of his own contentment. “The panic room is now a nursery,” he observes on “Son of the Sea”. Death still looms – often in the form of a black dog that follows Callahan around various tracks – but its inevitability seems more of a comfort than something to be feared: “Everybody must walk the lonesome valley,” he sings firmly. “Yeah, they must walk it by themselves.” (RO)Arriving three years after the release of her debut, Nothing’s Real, Shura’s excellent second record is camp and theatrical, pivoting between a big, poppy sensibility and a minimalist, lo-fi one – sometimes on the same track. Lead single “Religion (U Can Lay Your Hands On Me)” is a slinky shoulder roll of a song, laden with passionate blasphemy: “I wanna consecrate your body, turn the water to wine, I know you’re thinking about kissing, too.” It’s laced, too, with piano – an instrument she’d always been “allergic to” before this record – and opulent orchestral strings. (AP)2350 28) Cage the Elephant – Social CuesOn Cage the Elephant’s fifth album, Social Cues, frontman Matt Shultz reacts to the breakdown of his marriage and the loss of three close friends. He undergoes a kind of Jekyll and Hyde transition through the 13 tracks, the result of which is the band’s best work to date. Single “Ready to let Go” is by far the most explicit – a moody swamp-rock jam where Shultz comes to terms with his impending orce. He bares his soul on Social Cues, and apparently shakes off a few demons in the process. (RO)Howard listened to Brazilian artist Jorge Ben – “where there’s literally, like, 18 different things happening in the song” – while she was making the album, and it shows. “13th Century Metal” builds like an alarm, while “Baby” is scatty and scattered, like something off The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill. Sometimes, there is one instrument too many, but usually the components crash together well. (AP)Written during her recent pregnancy and the birth of her first child, Remind Me Tomorrow shows Van Etten dimming her spotlight on toxicity and instead casting a warm glow behind the record’s psychic overview. As well as expectations of confessional singers, she subverts folk music’s focus on bare-bones songwriting. But the daintiest composition “Stay” is her most perfectly realised yet, over music box chimes and heel-clicking percussion she coos: “You won’t let me go astray You will let me find my way.” After years of making peace with drift and uncertainty, she’s never sounded more sure of anything. (JM)Inspired by the improvisations he was creating while on tour with The xx in 2017, Sam Shepherd found himself making “some of the most obtuse and aggressive music I’ve ever made”. This newfound drive can be heard in singles such as “LesAlpx”, a mind-melting track that climbs breathlessly towards its summit with a pounding bass beat and high, whistling chirps that punctuate the tension. It’s an insight into his brilliant mind and – such is the sheer variety of the album – a way to inspire one’s own imagination. (RO)2750 24) Stormzy – Heavy is the HeadThere are three themes that run through the record: his defiance in the face of doubt the pressure of high expectations and his efforts to lift others up as his success continues to grow. He reminds himself constantly of who he is beneath the gloss that fame has brought: he’s “Rachael’s Little Brother”, “Big Michael”, a guy who likes to watch Avengers and Game of Thrones. All of his best traits are present and correct: sincerity, a smooth flow and forensic-like analysis of societal ills, laced with pathos and humour. The lasting impression is of an artist whose only way is up. (RO)A blunt, bold album on which Hackman’s beatific voice sits atop methodically messy instrumentals. Songs such as “All Night” are so candidly carnal it feels inappropriate to listen to them in public notes of riot grrrl, pop and rock come together throughout the record to create something that is, at times, quite striking. (AP)2950 22) Solange – When I Get HomeThe decade’s second great Solange album churns several deformed, jazzy aesthetics – including Brainfeeder’s gloopy electro-funk and the concoctions of DJ Screw – into a lustrous cloud of R\u0026ampB. The result hints at Seventies soul voyagers like Stevie Wonder yet retains its future-shock, celebrating Houston futurism without pandering to fans of its explicitly political predecessor. (JM)For her fifth studio album, Cate Le Bon went to live in a secluded cottage in the Lake District, where she sang to an empty house and took lessons in wood-carving. Yet her compositions on Reward are lush, warm and whimsical opener “Miami” is resplendent with stately horns and percussion that reminds you of childhood. There’s a fantastic sense of space, too, spun from diaphanous arrangements such as “The Light”, where she meanders delightfully from a clear, lilting call to a deep vocal rumble. It’s an album by an artist intent on readdressing her relationship with her own existence. (RO)Fender drew plenty of early comparisons to Bruce Springsteen – on Hypersonic Missiles they’re entirely warranted, as much for the instrumentation as the lyricism and his vignettes of working-class struggle. There are sax solos (more than one), and pounding rhythms that make you want to jump in a car and drive down a highway at sunset, and blistering electric guitars next to classic troubadour acoustics. He has Springsteen’s rousing holler, and the early indications of someone who could be the voice of a generation – not because he wants to be, but because he sees things and understands. (RO)Swift’s sixth album Reputation was camp and melodramatic, killing off “the old Taylor” and waging war on anyone and everyone who dared to criticise her. It was sincerity veiled as self-parody, insecurity veiled as breeziness – and all the better for that uneasy paradox. But Lover, her new, seventh album, feels like a partial resurrection of the Swift of old: moony romance and earnest earworms abound. It’s the sound of a singer excited to be earnest again. Taylor Swift is dead. Long live Taylor Swift. (AP)The record is an introspective mix of psychey soul, blues, rock and funk, which skips and strolls and swaggers through its 13 tracks – but it is not simply an exercise in nostalgia. Its influences  decades Gil Scott-Heron, Fela Kuti, Kendrick Lamar and Bobby Womack are all recalled. “I’m not going to have an alter ego, or becomes Sasha Fierce or Ziggy Stardust,” says Kiwanuka. “I can just be Michael Kiwanuka.” With an album this good, it’s hard to argue with that. (AP)On his sixth album, Kano’s powers of observation are at their peak. Home has always been at the heart of his music, so he maintains the close-quarters perspective of his 2005 debut Home Sweet Home the swaggering confidence of that record, though, is replaced by a more thoughtful gravitas. He’s an elder statesman of grime, and you can almost see his furrowed brow and shake of his head on “Trouble”, while the frenetic “Class of Deja”, starring fellow veterans D Double E and Ghetts, reminds the listener how he lit the path for future generations. (RO)3550 16) Hot Chip – A Bath Full of EcstasyLyrically, the band offer up some of their most poignant phrases to date on this – their seventh and best record. Second single “Hungry Child”, a trance-y floor-filler, contains the plaintive, “Dreaming never felt so bad Lonely never felt so wrong before” while, over the shuffling beats of “Echo”, Alexis Taylor sings of leaving your regrets behind while seeming to understand the effort required to achieve this. For all its glimmering synths and the robotic pathos of Taylor’s idiosyncratic vocals, this is a record with both heart and soul. (RO)3650 15) MUNA – Saves the WorldSaves the World should see MUNA joining the ranks of those who have brazenly borrowed their sound. Lead single “Number One Fan” banishes intrusive thoughts – “Nobody likes me and I’m gonna die” – just in time for a lavish, self-celebratory chorus, one part earnest, one part tongue-in-cheek. Elsewhere, they are downright defeatist, laments the inevitable pull back to a recent ex (“Stayaway”) or reflecting on a lover’s similarity to an adulterous father (“Taken”). “Hands Off”, meanwhile, toys with temptation before slamming the door shut. It is fierce and forthright. (AP)Fans have already drawn comparisons between We Are Not Your Kind and Slipknot’s seminal 2001 album Iowa. While the latter was even heavier (it would be difficult if not impossible to outdo), the sheer ambition on We Are Not Your Kind is just as staggering. If anything, the dynamic created by placing a bigger emphasis on melody allows you to consider everything without being engulfed by noise. Critics may question how relevant Slipknot are in 2019. The pummelling force of We Are Not Your Kind should be enough to silence them – this may be one of the band’s most personal records, but the rage they capture is universally felt. (RO)Each song is titled after a black woman Rapsody admires: Serena Williams, Sojourner Truth, Maya Angelou, Aaliyah, Oprah Winfrey… and for each one she explores these women’s traits, successes and strife. As on Laila’s Wisdom, Eve conveys Rapsody’s natural feel for funk – “Michelle” (Obama) bounces in on a jaunty piano riff – but other tracks, such as “Afeni”, are pure soul. Nina Simone said an artist’s duty, “as far as I’m concerned, is to reflect the times”. This is precisely what Rapsody has done, in the most resonant way possible. (RO)There’s a deeper sense of personal connection to anchor Julia Jacklin’s lyrical and melodic smarts. That snare drum on “Pressure to Party” keeps a relentless, nerve-snapping pulse throughout, while “Don’t Know How to Keep Loving You” nails a depth of intimacy while acknowledging relationship ennui. Grunge-rinsed, feminist-flipped, upcycled Fifties guitar an’ all: Crushing is a triumph. (HB)Philippakis’s voice is shrouded in the smoke from society’s wreckage. Lead single “Exits”, six scintillating minutes of Eighties “sledgehammer” pop that lumbers into view like a heavy artillery vehicle covered in sequins, concerns the one percenters building underground cities to escape global warming. “Syrups” has Yannis howling a passionate post-apocalyptic vision of robot invasions and sand-clogged towns over a corroded Gorillaz dub that builds to a motoric charge as global panic sets in. An inspired album of scorched earth music. (MB)A talented pianist as well as a rapper and singer, Dave often spits over discordant chords to amplify the urgency of his chosen subject, or else raps in gruff, assertive tones across an emotional sequence that complements his stoic intensity. On “Environment”, he talks about the conflict between what people see of his apparently glamorous life, and the reality behind the scenes where the blood and sweat is drawn out of him. He’s put everything into this album. (RO)Weyes Blood, whose real name is Natalie Mering, accompanies her instrumental idiosyncrasies with strong, luscious melodies and unfussy lyrics. “No one’s ever gonna give you a trophy for all the pain and the things you’ve been through,” she sings on “Mirror Forever”. “No one knows but you.”And then there’s that voice – at once warm and haunting, controlled and untethered. It’s no wonder she’s lent it to the likes of Perfume Genius, Drugdealer and Ariel Pink: it adds a touch of profundity to everything it meets. (AP)The warm splashes of piano that washed over that song also break through the anxious rattle of dance beats on the album’s eponymous opener, the singer so regularly reviewed as “vaporous” promises to “leave the ether, assume form” and “be touchable, be reachable”. His own sharpest critic, he winks at the journalists who’ve called him glacial as he drops from remote, icy falsetto into a richly grained, deeper tone to ask: “Doesn’t it seem much warmer?” (HB)Following the traumatised chaos of 2016’s Skeleton Tree, Ghosteen is a warm cloud of ambient solace – a sonic evocation of the communion he has experienced through his newly porous relationship with his audience. He sounds buoyed, not weakened, by exposing his wounds. (HB)4550 6) Tyler, the Creator – IGORThe production here is superb. Tyler has never been one for traditional song structure, but on IGOR, which is undoubtedly a break-up album, he’s like the Minotaur – luring you through a maze that twists and turns around seemingly impossible corners, drawing you into the thrilling unknown. Its lack of resolution at the close – surely the most torturous element of a great love lost – makes it all the more powerful. (RO)The indie-rock band’s second album in the space of five months (the first being UFOF), was described as the “earth twin” and, indeed, they sound utterly grounded – to each other, and to their surroundings in the arid Chihuahuan Desert of Texas, near the Mexico border. In contrast to her fragile performance on UFOF, here Adrianne Lenker sings in lusty whoops and calls on “Forgotten Eyes”, while “Not”, the record’s dark, brooding soul, caterwauls with feedback screeches and a merciless, two-minute guitar solo that leaves you simultaneously devastated and enthralled. (RO)Bruce Springsteen seems to have told almost every tale in the grand old storybook of American mythologies, except perhaps one: a wide-eyed Californian dreamer finds the Golden State turns sour and flees back east, to some romantic speck of a town, to pine and rehabilitate. It’s the classic pop plotline of Bacharach and David’s “Do You Know the Way to San Jose?”, and it’s a tale Springsteen taps repeatedly here, on his sumptuous, cinematic 19th album, which is nothing short of a late-period masterpiece. (MB)Few albums in 2019 have been as eclectic, or with as singular a vision, as Simz’s GREY Area. She flips between two tones: formidable and reflective. On tracks such as “Offence” and “Boss” she drips with venom delivering lines in a low, deadly buzz over killer bass hooks and punk distortion. On “Selfish” and “Flowers” she’s softer – allowing herself to be vulnerable because she knows she doesn’t have to ditch all sentiment to compete with her male peers. She’s better because she embraces every facet of herself, and offers it to the listener in as clear a statement as possible. (RO)Lana Del Rey has always been obsessed with the past. Hers is a sound rooted in nostalgia, a paean to everything she was born too late to live through: old Hollywood, Sinatra, beat poetry, Sylvia Plath and Fifties Americana. At her best, she mines something fresh from it all. At her worst, she wallows in it. Her new album Norman F**king Rockwell!, named after a 20th-century American artist, does both. (AP)When Aldous Harding performed in London this month, an enamoured fan cried out that they loved her. “I appreciate that,” she replied softly. “But, I’m busy.” The response is Harding to a T – wry, weird, introspective, focused. Her spectacular, singular third album, Designer, is all of those things. Taking the left-field folk that made her name and splashing post-psych pop and jittery orchestral flourishes onto the canvas, the New Zealander harbours secrets while beckoning you in. The debut solo album of the art-punk pioneer was never going to be predictable, easy-listening. No Home Record channels the dissonance and avant-garde vibe of New York’s experimental no-wave movement in a nine-song, genre-defiant collection that jumps between industrial, minimal electro-rock and abrasive art punk. Uniting the tracks is their creator’s restlessly questing, non-conformist spirit. It’s great to have her back. (EB)Nilüfer Yanya isn’t down with the “wellness” industry. On her debut album, Miss Universe, the singer-songwriter makes this perfectly clear, tearing into all those “improve yourself” schemes littered across social media and parcelling up that angst as cerebral, skewed alt-rock. ​Synths and saxophone play their part on the smoother, more soulful “Paradise” and “Baby Blu”. Listen to the driving groove of “Heat Rises”, meanwhile, and you’ll be instantly reminded of Kelis and Andre 3000’s “Millionaire”. That said, Yanya is very much her own artist: original and bold. (PS)Five years since their last album, the Ohioan duo have gone back to basics. Gone are the subtle inflections and lacquered psychedelia of Turn Blue Let’s Rock is all about simple hooks and nagging choruses, “an homage”, in the words of drummer Patrick Carney, “to the electric guitar”. Get past the terrible title, and you’ll be rewarded with a viscerally entertaining album that never lingers for more than four minutes per song. If this is genre pastiche, it’s genre pastiche done with skill and savvy. (PS)450 47) Bat for Lashes – Lost GirlsMusically, Lost Girls couldn’t be more Eighties if it were playing a Commodore 64 while eating Angel Delight. Like Stranger Things, everything about it is unashamedly nostalgic: the power drums, the moody atmospherics, the arpeggiated synths. Close your eyes and you can practically see Jason Patric on the Santa Cruz boardwalk in The Lost Boys​. Yes, nostalgia is a fairly generic formula. But listened to as a whole, the album positively thrums with sonic invention, managing to feel both fresh and full of intrigue. Khan once again demonstrates a knack for uncanny storytelling. (PS)On his debut album, the 24-year-old mixes sultry jams that recall the electronic funk of MGMT with nods to the greats: Prince, James Brown, Led Zeppelin and Marvin Gaye. Throughout, Collard exhibits his extraordinary voice, which swoops to a devilishly low murmur or soars to an ecstatic falsetto. On the lustful “Hell Song” he sings “less is more… but more is good”. You’re inclined to agree with him. (RO)When the Missouri singer broke out in 2014, she became known for her lo-fi, introspective sound and the staggering range and power of her voice. On All Mirrors, she dials things up even further than 2016’s Sixties-leaning My Woman, and turns her focus outwards – it is an album, she says, “about losing empathy, trust, love for destructive people” and “owning up to your darkest side”. It is also balletic and haywire, refusing to follow traditional rules of song structure. Listening to it feels like accidentally pressing play on two songs at once, and finding the combination strangely inebriating. (AP)750 44) Lizzo – Cuz I Love YouThis is a polished, playful album, though it has a DIY edge to it: “S**t, f**k, I didn’t know it was ending right there,” she chuckles in the final few moments of “Like a Girl”. “Girl, run this s**t back,” she says after a vivacious flute solo on “Tempo” – a song featuring a guest verse from Missy Elliott, the person who, Lizzo said on Twitter, “made this chubby, weird, black girl believe that ANYTHING was possible”. (AP)There’s no attempt to chase someone else’s wave here no token drill, afroswing or trap beats to satisfy playlist algorithms. Instead, his cold grime sonics are rendered down to their no-frills essentials – brutalist blocks of sad angular melodies and hard, spacious drums. The result is a quintessentially London record, as dark and moody as it is brash and innovative. “We used to do young and stupid,” Skepta concludes on “Gangsta”. “Now we do grown.” (IM)It lacks a centrepiece to match the arresting depth and space of Sweetener’s “God Is A Woman”, but Grande handles its shifting moods and cast of producers (including pop machines Max Martin and Tommy Brown) with engaging class and momentum. One minute you’re skanking along to the party brass of “Bloodline” the next floating into the semi-detached, heartbreak of “Ghostin’”, which appears to address Grande’s guilt at being with Davidson while pining for Miller. She sings of the late rapper as a “wingless angel” with featherlight high notes that will drop the sternest jaw. (HB)The Chicago-born singer’s ninth album is a furious reaction to the social and political events of 2018 – over 11 breathless tracks, he turns that anger into a howl of resistance. Each song feels personal yet relatable – the deep-rooted despair felt on “Trauma” at the sight of wealthy bullies rising to power is a universal one, as is the sense of liberation in just letting go on “What Can You Do But Rock n Roll”. Twelve Nudes is Furman’s most urgent and cathartic record. (RO)On his studio debut, YBN shows off his versatility, but not to the point that it distracts from the underlying message of each song. You have the menacing “Broke as F***”, where the beats and stark piano hook contrasts with Cordae’s rags-to-riches rap. Aged 21, the North Carolina artist flecks songs such as the Anderson .Paak-featuring “RNP” with an endearing kind of nonchalance over the woozy, psychedelic soul of opener “Wintertime”, meanwhile, he wonders how Corretta Scott King felt upon learning Martin Luther had cheated on her. It’s by no means a perfect album in the grand sense of the term, but it is a perfect demonstration of everything Cordae is capable of. (RO)Big Thief’s frontwoman Adrianne Lenker has an uncanny ability to make you feel like you’re in on a secret. Her whispering, spectral delivery and deeply personal lyrics are the key to this. Even on the band’s third album UFOF, with an audience that has grown exponentially in the past few years, the songs are still immensely intimate affairs. The album’s deathly intrigue is drawn from her own personal traumas, which she successfully spins into something that feels universal. But you don’t come away from this record feeling downcast. It’s more a reminder of how fleeting yet beautiful life is, and an appeal to make the most of it. (RO)1350 38) Jenny Lewis – On the LineHere, Lewis does what she does best: adds the glossy sparkle of Hollywood and a sunny Californian sheen to melancholy and nostalgia, with her most luxuriantly orchestrated album yet. Even when she’s singing, “I’ve wasted my youth”, it’s in that sweet voice, with carefree “doo doo doo doo doo doos”, and at a pace that’s so upbeat that it masks the sentiment. It’s a bittersweet mourning of her past. (EB)Few people have had as big a year as Billie Eilish. The first – and currently only – artist born in the Noughties to have a US number one single, she also released her double platinum debut album, the innovative and multifarious, if irksomely titled, When We All Fall Asleep Where Do We Go? There are some missteps –  “Wish You Were Gay” being one of them – but for the most part this is an album as full of charm and bite as Eilish herself. And with a melody that ducks and es in between the beat like a bank robber dodging lasers, the dark, dank pop-trap masterpiece “Bad Guy” is surely a contender for song of the year. (AP)One of the biggest new rap stars to emerge in 2019, AJ Tracey’s variety and the scale of his ambition on this album is breathtaking. Fans will be surprised to discover he sings almost as much as he raps, in pleasingly gruff tones. Each track is a standout, none more so than “Ladbroke Grove”, a hat-tip to classic garage in which Tracey switches up his flow to emulate a Nineties MC. It’s a thrilling work. (RO)The former Chairlift frontwoman’s solo debut (at least, her first under her own name) is an eccentric, experimental delight – PC music by way of classical pop. The product of a orce and a series of adrenal rushes she refers to as “pangs”, the album is musically agile and often lyrically stark: Sometimes I wonder Do I love you too much? Then I tell myself ‘Caroline, shut up’”, she sings on “Caroline Shut Up”. Polachek’s voice is her secret weapon – so jolting and elastic she had to prove it wasn’t autotuned in an astonishing Twitter video. (AP)Simpson recently said he wanted Sound \u0026amp Fury to “hit like a Wu-Tang record”, so each intro is like a one-two punch loaded with brilliant hooks. Then there’s the rollicking “A Good Look” and “Last Man Standing” – it’s pure rock and roll: sleazy, slick and lots of fun. Sound \u0026amp Fury marks another milestone for a remarkable artist. (RO)Of all the excellent bands to emerge out of Dublin’s booming music scene over the past few years, Fontaines DC are the best of them. Perhaps it’s the fact that they’re technically outsiders, having grown up on the borders of the city (or in their guitarist Carlos O’Connell’s case, between there and Spain). Frontman Grian Chatten eschews punk’s tradition of valuing shock value over songcraft and instead offers searing, literary observations of a city with which he has a lovehate relationship. (RO)1950 32) Vampire Weekend – Father of the BrideAlready subject to manic shifts in style and tempo, this hour-long LP roams in lounge pants from Deadhead jams to Zombies-catchy hooks, infectiously kitsch prog, highlife samples and – on “Sunflower” – a scat breakdown. An unfashionable record, then, and that may be its best asset. With such low stakes and barely any emotional intensity, Father of the Bride won’t cement Vampire Weekend’s legacy. But after a highly strung decade on the indie-rock A-list, it gives them room to breathe. (JM)“Making this album has allowed me, for the first time, to find compassion when I have been at my most ungraceful, confused and fractured,” FKA twigs writes in the album’s press notes. “I stopped judging myself, and at that moment found hope in MAGDALENE.” At times, MAGDALENE is just as ungraceful, confused and fractured as its creator was – a rush of baroque electronics, industrial noise, opera, synths, autotune and precarious falsetto. The follow-up to 2014’s LP1 is the sound of a woman teetering on the brink of collapse, gathering herself, and then erupting into a kind of defiance. (AP)2150 30) Bill Callahan – Shepherd in a Sheepskin VestBill Callahan returns after six years with this homely, career-best album in which he sings of his own contentment. “The panic room is now a nursery,” he observes on “Son of the Sea”. Death still looms – often in the form of a black dog that follows Callahan around various tracks – but its inevitability seems more of a comfort than something to be feared: “Everybody must walk the lonesome valley,” he sings firmly. “Yeah, they must walk it by themselves.” (RO)Arriving three years after the release of her debut, Nothing’s Real, Shura’s excellent second record is camp and theatrical, pivoting between a big, poppy sensibility and a minimalist, lo-fi one – sometimes on the same track. Lead single “Religion (U Can Lay Your Hands On Me)” is a slinky shoulder roll of a song, laden with passionate blasphemy: “I wanna consecrate your body, turn the water to wine, I know you’re thinking about kissing, too.” It’s laced, too, with piano – an instrument she’d always been “allergic to” before this record – and opulent orchestral strings. (AP)2350 28) Cage the Elephant – Social CuesOn Cage the Elephant’s fifth album, Social Cues, frontman Matt Shultz reacts to the breakdown of his marriage and the loss of three close friends. He undergoes a kind of Jekyll and Hyde transition through the 13 tracks, the result of which is the band’s best work to date. Single “Ready to let Go” is by far the most explicit – a moody swamp-rock jam where Shultz comes to terms with his impending orce. He bares his soul on Social Cues, and apparently shakes off a few demons in the process. (RO)Howard listened to Brazilian artist Jorge Ben – “where there’s literally, like, 18 different things happening in the song” – while she was making the album, and it shows. “13th Century Metal” builds like an alarm, while “Baby” is scatty and scattered, like something off The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill. Sometimes, there is one instrument too many, but usually the components crash together well. (AP)Written during her recent pregnancy and the birth of her first child, Remind Me Tomorrow shows Van Etten dimming her spotlight on toxicity and instead casting a warm glow behind the record’s psychic overview. As well as expectations of confessional singers, she subverts folk music’s focus on bare-bones songwriting. But the daintiest composition “Stay” is her most perfectly realised yet, over music box chimes and heel-clicking percussion she coos: “You won’t let me go astray You will let me find my way.” After years of making peace with drift and uncertainty, she’s never sounded more sure of anything. (JM)Inspired by the improvisations he was creating while on tour with The xx in 2017, Sam Shepherd found himself making “some of the most obtuse and aggressive music I’ve ever made”. This newfound drive can be heard in singles such as “LesAlpx”, a mind-melting track that climbs breathlessly towards its summit with a pounding bass beat and high, whistling chirps that punctuate the tension. It’s an insight into his brilliant mind and – such is the sheer variety of the album – a way to inspire one’s own imagination. (RO)2750 24) Stormzy – Heavy is the HeadThere are three themes that run through the record: his defiance in the face of doubt the pressure of high expectations and his efforts to lift others up as his success continues to grow. He reminds himself constantly of who he is beneath the gloss that fame has brought: he’s “Rachael’s Little Brother”, “Big Michael”, a guy who likes to watch Avengers and Game of Thrones. All of his best traits are present and correct: sincerity, a smooth flow and forensic-like analysis of societal ills, laced with pathos and humour. The lasting impression is of an artist whose only way is up. (RO)A blunt, bold album on which Hackman’s beatific voice sits atop methodically messy instrumentals. Songs such as “All Night” are so candidly carnal it feels inappropriate to listen to them in public notes of riot grrrl, pop and rock come together throughout the record to create something that is, at times, quite striking. (AP)2950 22) Solange – When I Get HomeThe decade’s second great Solange album churns several deformed, jazzy aesthetics – including Brainfeeder’s gloopy electro-funk and the concoctions of DJ Screw – into a lustrous cloud of R\u0026ampB. The result hints at Seventies soul voyagers like Stevie Wonder yet retains its future-shock, celebrating Houston futurism without pandering to fans of its explicitly political predecessor. (JM)For her fifth studio album, Cate Le Bon went to live in a secluded cottage in the Lake District, where she sang to an empty house and took lessons in wood-carving. Yet her compositions on Reward are lush, warm and whimsical opener “Miami” is resplendent with stately horns and percussion that reminds you of childhood. There’s a fantastic sense of space, too, spun from diaphanous arrangements such as “The Light”, where she meanders delightfully from a clear, lilting call to a deep vocal rumble. It’s an album by an artist intent on readdressing her relationship with her own existence. (RO)Fender drew plenty of early comparisons to Bruce Springsteen – on Hypersonic Missiles they’re entirely warranted, as much for the instrumentation as the lyricism and his vignettes of working-class struggle. There are sax solos (more than one), and pounding rhythms that make you want to jump in a car and drive down a highway at sunset, and blistering electric guitars next to classic troubadour acoustics. He has Springsteen’s rousing holler, and the early indications of someone who could be the voice of a generation – not because he wants to be, but because he sees things and understands. (RO)Swift’s sixth album Reputation was camp and melodramatic, killing off “the old Taylor” and waging war on anyone and everyone who dared to criticise her. It was sincerity veiled as self-parody, insecurity veiled as breeziness – and all the better for that uneasy paradox. But Lover, her new, seventh album, feels like a partial resurrection of the Swift of old: moony romance and earnest earworms abound. It’s the sound of a singer excited to be earnest again. Taylor Swift is dead. Long live Taylor Swift. (AP)The record is an introspective mix of psychey soul, blues, rock and funk, which skips and strolls and swaggers through its 13 tracks – but it is not simply an exercise in nostalgia.

It’s the classic pop plotline of Bacharach and David’s “Do You Know the Way to San Jose?”, and it’s a tale Springsteen taps repeatedly here, on his sumptuous, cinematic 19th album, which is nothing short of a late-period masterpiece. (MB)Few albums in 2019 have been as eclectic, or with as singular a vision, as Simz’s GREY Area. She flips between two tones: formidable and reflective. On tracks such as “Offence” and “Boss” she drips with venom delivering lines in a low, deadly buzz over killer bass hooks and punk distortion. On “Selfish” and “Flowers” she’s softer – allowing herself to be vulnerable because she knows she doesn’t have to ditch all sentiment to compete with her male peers. She’s better because she embraces every facet of herself, and offers it to the listener in as clear a statement as possible. (RO)Lana Del Rey has always been obsessed with the past. Hers is a sound rooted in nostalgia, a paean to everything she was born too late to live through: old Hollywood, Sinatra, beat poetry, Sylvia Plath and Fifties Americana. At her best, she mines something fresh from it all. At her worst, she wallows in it. Her new album Norman F**king Rockwell!, named after a 20th-century American artist, does both. (AP)When Aldous Harding performed in London this month, an enamoured fan cried out that they loved her. “I appreciate that,” she replied softly. “But, I’m busy.” The response is Harding to a T – wry, weird, introspective, focused. Her spectacular, singular third album, Designer, is all of those things. Taking the left-field folk that made her name and splashing post-psych pop and jittery orchestral flourishes onto the canvas, the New Zealander harbours secrets while beckoning you in. “Everyone’s instinct was: she must have cheated, she said. It’s easy to make me the villain. I’m in a bikini in a music video, so I must be a whore.\u0026nbsp“It’s so much greater than me – it’s a social perception of women. So f**k it, I’m gonna tell them everything that happened.”The singer’s third studio album, Manic, became the first album in 2020 to go certified platinum.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

In the meantime, students, schools and colleges should continue to prepare for the summer exams and assessments as usual.BREAKING\u0026nbspThe World Health Organisation has upgraded the global risk of coronavirus to very high, according to AFP.\u0026nbspTedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, chief of the WHO, has described the global outbreaks as linked epidemics, but says there\u0027s no evidence coronavirus is spreading freely and insists we still have a chance of containing it.\u0026nbspMore to follow...Guests start to leave Tenefife hotel on lockdownAt least 23 guests left a Tenerife hotel in several small groups on Friday, four days into a 14-day quarantine imposed because of the coronavirus, Reuters is reporting. Around 700 holidaymakers remained stranded in the compound.The Canary Islands regional government on Thursday cleared 130 holidaymakers to leave the hotel. The rest of the group will be allowed to leave in the coming hours, according to a statement from the H10 Costa Adeje Palace.It was not clear where Friday\u0027s groups were being taken, although one bus driver told TVE television he was taking his group to the airport.An elderly couple could be seen leaving in an ambulance. But the authorities said there have been no new cases since the virus was detected in four Italian tourists earlier this week.Half a dozen guests, including a baby in a pram, underwent temperature scans in the back of the hotel before boarding the first minibus, a video, shot by hotel guest Christopher Betts, showed. One of the people boarding said he was from Belgium.Spain now needs to liaise with the governments of the remaining hundreds of guests, to establish monitoring protocols before they are allowed to return home, local health authorities confirmed on Friday.\u0027It is not something terrible\u0027\u0026nbspThe president of Mexico appeared to downplay the seriousness of coronavirus, saying it isn\u0027t even equivalent to flu, as the country\u0027s second case of infection was confirmed.\u0026nbspSeasonal flu kills more people because it has infected far more people, but the new virus appears to have a far higher mortality rate.\u0026nbspIn the central China city of Wuhan, where the new coronavirus first surfaced, 2 per cent to 4 per cent of patients have died, according to the World Health Organization.But in the rest of China, the death rate has been 0.7 per cent. On average, the death rate from seasonal flu is about 0.1 per cent.\u0026nbspI repeat, according to the available information, it is not something terrible, fatal, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said. There shouldn\u0027t be any yellow journalism, or exaggerations, to cause a mass psychosis of fear, of terror.\u0026nbspFirst cases confirmed in Mexico\u0026nbspMexico has reported its first two cases, in what are among the\u0026nbspfew confirmed instances in Latin America.A man who had been in Italy, and showed positive in an initial test in Mexico City, went through a second test that turned up positive results early on Friday, deputy health minister Hugo Lopez-Gatell Ramirez told reporters. The man is in isolation, he added.His case is connected to a second confirmed case in the northern state of Sinaloa, Mr Lopez-Gatell added.Due to the epidemiological association with the other case, it is confirmed, he told a\u0026nbspnews conference.Priests in Jerusalem instructed to administer communion by hand only\u0026nbspRoman Catholic authorities in Jerusalem have instructed their priests to give communion by hand only, rather than placing the wafers on worshippers\u0027 tongues, and to empty holy water fonts - as precautions against the spread of the coronavirus.The Latin Patriarchate of Jerusalem announced the measures on Thursday, shortly after the start of Lent, the 40-day season that leads up to Easter. Millions of pilgrims frequent Jerusalem and other holy cities such as Nazareth and Bethlehem each year.Archbishop Pierbattista Pizzaballa, the Vatican\u0027s apostolic administrator, said in a statement that with its many visitors the Holy Land is in a unique situation.The guidelines include receiving Communion by hand only, rather than placing the wafer directly on the recipient\u0027s tongue, and avoiding having the faithful receive Communion from the chalice.\u0027The outbreak is getting bigger\u0027The coronavirus could reach most “if not all countries”, the World Health Organisation said on Friday, after Nigeria confirmed sub-Saharan Africa’s first case.“The outbreak is getting bigger,” WHO spokesman Christian Lindmeier told a Geneva news briefing on Friday. “The scenario of the coronavirus reaching multiple countries, if not all countries around the world, is something we have been looking at and warning against since quite a while.”Mr Lindmeier added that the WHO was looking\u0026nbspinto reports of patients being re-infected.\u0026nbsp“We need to carefully look at how the tests were taken, how the person was examined, if it was maybe overlooked that the person still had the virus somewhere in the residue in the body, whether they got reinfected by different means or ways, he said. We’re not in a position to say it is possible or not to be coming back and being re-infected.“In general, we would expect that a person who had the coronavirus infection would be immune for at least a while afterwards. But again this is something we do not yet know.”Japanese Ministry of Health confirms British death\u0026nbspThe Japanese Ministry of Health has confirmed the death of a British man on board a cruise ship\u0026nbspin Japan.\u0026nbspThe man is the sixth person to have died after contracting the virus aboard\u0026nbspthe Diamond Princess cruise ship, which has been quarantined in Yokohama port.He is the first Briton to have died from coronavirus, also known as Covid-19.\u0026nbspA spokesperson for the Foreign Office said: “We are supporting the family of a British man who has died in Japan and are in contact with local authorities. Our sympathies and thoughts are with his family at this difficult time.”\u0026nbspA total of 19 British nationals\u0026nbsphave been diagnosed with the illness.Foreign Office criticised over \u0027poor communication\u0027 with Britons quarantined in Tenerife\u0026nbspA Briton quarantined at a coronavirus-hit hotel in Tenerife has criticised the poor communication from the Foreign Office.\u0026nbspLara Pennington said her family have been kept completely in the dark at the H10 Costa Adeje Palace hotel, where at least four guests, including an Italian doctor, have tested positive for coronavirus.\u0026nbspThe mother-of-two told BBC Breakfast that she felt quarantine provisions were not being safely managed at the four-star hotel in the south-west of the Spanish island.\u0026nbspOn Friday morning, guests started to leave the locked-down hotel after undergoing screening for Covid-19.Overall, 130 guests from 11 countries have been told by Spanish authorities that they can leave, because they arrived at the hotel on Monday - after those who tested positive had been taken to hospital.\u0026nbspWe don\u0027t have an issue with being quarantined, it\u0027s that we do not believe it is being safely managed within the hotel, Ms Pennington said.\u0026nbspObviously we\u0027ve had very, very limited communication, we feel like we\u0027ve been kept completely in the dark. So what we are told we\u0027re not even sure is coming from a reliable source.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The swimmer, who won 200m gold in Rio, as well as 400m and 1,500m freestyle golds in London, subsequently asked CAS for a public trial.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesSun\u0027s fellow swimmers reacted angrily after FINA initially cleared him of any wrongdoing, with Britain\u0027s Duncan Scott refusing to shake his hand on the podium at the world championships last year in Gwangju. Sun responded to the snub by firing back: “You’re a loser, I’m a winner”.The 10-hour CAS hearing was broadcasted on the court\u0027s website showed Sun to be evasive at times under questioning that was hampered by severe translation issues between Chinese and English. The CAS panel\u0027s verdict was delayed until all parties got a verified translation.The 6-foot, 7-inch (2-meter) Sun, the first Chinese swimmer to win Olympic gold, has long been a polarizing figure in the pool. Rivals branded him a drug cheat at the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Olympics, and two competitors refused to stand with him on medal podiums at the 2019 world championships.Now banned until February 2028, the 28-year-old Sun cannot defend his 200-meter freestyle title in Tokyo.The World Anti-Doping Agency went to CAS after a FINA tribunal only warned Sun. The first ruling was that anti-doping protocol was not followed, making the samples invalid, and cited doubts about credentials shown to him by the sample collection team.WADA requested a ban of between two and eight years for a second doping conviction.Sun served a three-month ban in 2014 imposed by Chinese authorities after testing positive for a stimulant that was banned at the time. The ban was not announced until after it ended and he never missed a major event.That first case led to criticism of FINA for appearing to protect one of the sport\u0027s biggest stars in a key market.Live Rugby union coverage direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

They believe the explosion came from the heart of the Ophiuchus cluster of thousands of galaxies: a large galaxy at the center contains a colossal black hole.Black holes don\u0027t just draw matter in. They also blast out jets of material and energy.The first hint of this giant explosion actually came in 2016. Chandra images of the Ophiuchus galaxy cluster revealed an unusual curved edge, but scientists ruled out an eruption given the amount of energy that would have been needed to carve out such a large cavity in the gas.The two space observatories, along with radio data from telescopes in Australia and India, confirmed that the curvature was, indeed, part of a cavity.The radio data fit inside the X-rays like a hand in a glove, co-author Maxim Markevitch of NASA\u0027s Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland, said in a statement. This is the clincher that tells us an eruption of unprecedented size occurred here.The blast is believed to be over by now: There are no signs of jets currently shooting from the black hole.More observations are needed in other wavelengths to better understand what occurred, according to the team.The findings appeared in the Astrophysical Journal.Additional reporting by agenciesBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This year, 14 states will vote on Super Tuesday, including the nation’s most populous states, California and Texas.\u0026nbspOf crucial importance, we will see the impact of former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg’s non-traditional, self-funded run, that has seen him invest up to $400m to win support in many of the states voting on Super Tuesday.In order to win any delegates (a candidate needs to amass 1,991 delegates to achieve the party’s nomination) candidates have to win at least 15 percent of the vote in the state.\u0026nbspSharing the full story, not just the headlinesThere are enough delegates at stake that a strong showing for senator Bernie Sanders could cement his spot as Democratic nominee. At the same time, should he fail to overcome his top rivals, the race could become a serious competition between two or potentially even three candidates.\u0026nbspHere’s a state-by-state breakdown to keep you informed heading into Super Tuesday.\u0026nbspAll demographic numbers are from the Centre for American Progress’ “States of Change” report.\u0026nbspThe Yellowhammer state has 61 total delegates – including 9 superdelegates – up for grabs on Super Tuesday.\u0026nbspDemographically, Alabama is one of six states – along with the District of Columbia – where black Democratic voters are the majority. Democratic voter composition in Alabama in 2016 was 71 per cent black, 26 per cent white and three per cent other races.\u0026nbspAccording to 2016 Census data, Alabama has a slightly higher than average population of iniduals 65 years of age and older – almost 20 per cent versus the 19 percent average. The state’s median household income is more than $10,000 less than the national average, $42,830 versus $53,657 nationally. \u0026nbsp\u0026nbspFiveThirtyEight predicts former Vice President Joe Biden will take the state, giving him a 61 percent chance at victory in the state. Mr Sanders is the next most likely to take the state with a 21 percent chance of victory, and Mr\u0026nbspBloomberg is in third with a 17 percent chance of victory.There are 31 pledged delegates available to win in Arkansas including five superdelegates. \u0026nbsp\u0026nbspDemographically, Arkansas’ Democratic voters are 69 per cent white, 36 per cent black, three per cent Hiic and two per cent other races.According to 2016 Census data, the state has a slightly higher than average population of iniduals over the age of 65 – 21 per cent versus the national average of 19 per cent – and a median household income of $41,262 more than $10,000 less than the national average of $53,657.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Mr Biden has a 25 per cent chance to win. \u0026nbsp \u0026nbspThe most recent poll examining the Arkansas electorate from Talk Business \u0026amp PoliticsHendrix College Poll reported that Mr Bloomberg had a 3.2 percent lead over Mr Sanders in the state.\u0026nbspJust under 20 per cent of respondents said they’d vote for Mr Bloomberg, while 16.4 per cent said they’d vote for Mr Sanders and 18.5 per cent said they’d vote for Mr Biden.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp \u0026nbspThis is a massive prize.

The state’s median household income is $61,933, which is $2,276 higher than the national average. Despite this, the state’s poverty rate, 14.5 per cent, is slightly higher than the national average of 13.6 per cent.\u0026nbspMr Sanders is overwhelmingly favoured in polling to win California. FiveThirtyEight gives Mr Sanders an 89 per cent chance to win, with poll averages predicting Mr Sanders will win between 24 per cent and 43 per cent of the vote and win an average of the state’s 227 pledged delegates.

Police officers rescued the residents and escorted them to a nearby station for their own safety but, outnumbered, retreated as the vandalism of the mosque began.“Look at my home, the whole thing is burnt, as well as all our possessions – clothes, utensils – everything,” he said. “There were 11 of us living here, what do I do now? Where will we go?”Videos then went viral of men chanting the Hindu nationalist slogan “Jai Shri Ram” (glory to Lord Ram) as the mosque was vandalised and two flags, one of India and the other showing the Hindu deity Lord Hanuman, were hoisted on its tallest minaret.Due to confusion over the name of the neighbourhood, the Delhi police mistakenly said on Twitter\u0026nbspthat this mosque had not been targeted and that the videos were “misinformation”, prompting the major right-wing channel Times Now to run unquestioningly a prime-time segment denouncing the “fake” footage – and those sharing it – on TV.Yet the buildings around the mosque were still smoking when The Independent met with the Muslim victims of the attack on Wednesday, as well as the Hindu neighbours who tried to protect them from the mob of “outsiders”.Khursheed, who works driving a battery-powered autorickshaw, said he does not blame Hindus for what happened, but rather the heightened tensions created by the Modi government’s new citizenship laws. Critics say the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), and a planned National Register of Citizens (NRC), discriminate against Muslims and threaten India’s secular constitution.He and other residents said they didn’t recognise the attackers.\u0026nbsp“I don’t know the people who came and did this – it is all just politics,” he said. “I am just very sad for the situation my family is now in.”Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Yet seeing it gutted by fire was still not as painful as what the rioters did to the adjacent mosque.“We were targeted because we are Muslim,” she said. “All the shops belonging to Muslims were burnt, while none of the Hindu shops were touched. They want to single us out, to separate us from the other religions.”She said Hindus and Muslims in the neighbourhood had “never had any problems”.“We have always prayed together, Hindus and Muslims, in mosques and temples. We have always believed that we are all equal.”Like the other residents, Parveen says she bears no ill feelings for her Hindu neighbours, saying that when the mob first came from outside “they tried to save us”.I am just very sad for the situation my family is now inBut she says she doesn’t know whether the situation will calm down across the city after what happened. She is just thankful she wasn’t home to see the mosque attacked. “It is totally broken and burnt, we feel worse about that than what happened to our own homes. We were so surprised when we heard they targeted the mosque, we never thought that people could be capable of such a thing.”A little down the road from the burnt-out mosque, shattered shop fronts and piles of debris, a group of Hindu neighbours watch the clear-up and are nervous about speaking to the media.Trump to press India PM on anti-Muslim law Labour MP Abrahams denied entry to India and ‘treated like criminal’Death toll rises to 24 in Delhi riots with mosque set on fireModi on course for big defeat as Delhi rejects ‘poisonous’ campaignA 39-year-old man, who asked not to be named, said he welcomed prime minister Narendra Modi’s call for calm on Wednesday afternoon, but that it should have come on Monday.He admits the situation is “very tense”.\u0026nbsp“We have always been living together amicably here, there was no tension, we spent our childhoods together. Now these outsiders have come in and this has happened, and it is the people living here who have to deal with the tension.”He points to four armed police officers sitting outside the burnt-out mosque. “At least there is some protection now, but we were expecting it earlier. There should have been some procedure in place,” he saidFor some, though, the four officers provide little comfort. A Muslim man whose house across the road from the mosque was burnt, who did not give his name, said the violence had turned into “the most terrible outcome possible” for this neighbourhood.We were so surprised when we heard they targeted the mosque, we never thought that people could be capable of such a thingClearly nervous, he says he is only returning briefly to retrieve any key documents that – he hopes – may have survived the fire. “All the documents, all the possessions we have, we had to just leave them behind and just run for our lives,” he said. “If they are not there, how will I get a job? These attacks are not just damaging property, they are ruining people’s lives.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

An inanimate object consisting of mesh and leaves bore the full, bilious brunt of virtue-signalling nastiness from those who have probably also been hash-tagging the crap out of #bekind for the past week.“If I was Yorkshire Tea I’d be very worried about my supporters all being racist Brexiteers — perhaps their super-Brit TV ad is responsible ” said one of the politer posts. Others advocated that the brand should be boycotted.A spokesman for Yorkshire Tea responded: “On Friday, the Chancellor shared a photo of our tea.Politicians do that sometimes . We weren’t asked or involved — and we said so the same day. Lots of people got angry with us all the same.”That’s because trolls aren’t interested in the whys, wherefores or, quite frankly, any context at all.They’re simply virtue-signalling from a position of self-bestowed righteousness to try to give meaning — via their target’s legion of followers — to their own sad existence.Yorkshire Tea’s response was impressively measured, but the last line has all of us thinking: “Who are these worrying idiots ”Last week it was reported that actor Freddie Fox was spat at in the street because of something his cousin Laurence said on the BBC’s Question Time.His cousin. Not even Laurence himself, who, by the way, should also be able to walk the streets without fearing physical or even aggressively verbal repercussions from someone who simply disagrees with his opinion.When moronic irrationality is restricted to the echo chamber of Twitter, it can be switched off and ignored.But when it spills out of the Twittersphere and impacts on a victim’s family or livelihood, then surely society as a whole must unite to stop it Because, one day, it could be you. Or, worse, your children.Former Met detective Philip Grindell was called in to help politicians deal with online abuse, which rose by  per cent last year.After retiring he helped a “global icon” who was scared for their le.“It was a famous person who was getting death threats,” says Philip, , who has now started a company called Dfuse Global to anticipate and assess the risk of online abuse.He discovered the death threats were coming from someone in the UK who had mental health issues and weren’t considered a risk to the personal safety of his client.Several years ago, Sky News confronted a woman who had repeatedly trolled the McCanns after the disappearance of their daughter Madeleine in .The woman, in her s, who had, “previously grappled with mental illness”, killed herself just days after being confronted.So tackling online trolling is clearly a minefield to navigate, but that doesn’t mean we shouldn’t try.Just because much of it comes from a place of deep sadness or instability in the troll’s le, why should that allow them to inflict damage on other people with impunity This isn’t about disagreeing with someone’s views in a rational, well-argued way.It’s about downright nastiness and threats to someone’s mental or physical well-being. And it needs to be tackled by the State, not just private companies.We have to provide full ID before we board a plane, so why not insist on it when setting up an online account which must include our real name followed by a unique number Then, currently anonymous trolls might think twice before whipping up hate about someone they don’t even know and we can all drink our teain peace.OH gawd, here it comes again – the tyranny of a “no make-up” photo posted by Hollywood glitterati.Stop. It. Now.The latest salvo was fired by Gwyneth Paltrow, who hosted a “natural” dinner party to promote her well-being website Goop and invited, among others, Demi Moore and Kate Hudson.Demi, who has spent £squillion on cosmetic surgery, looked great. As well she might.Equally, I once got in a lt with Kate Hudson, who is quite simply one of the most stunning women I have ever seen.And then we have Gwynnie herself, who has the radiant glow of a woman who spends the national debt of a small country on skin treatments and products.The reality, of course, is that there’s little meaning to this “no make-up” dinner party other than for the attendees to show how great they look.Meanwhile, those dealing only with what God gave them remain judged by the sentiment once expressed by beauty guru Helena Rubinstein.“There are no ugly women, only lazy ones.”THE McDonald’s Quarter Pound- er Fan Clubhas plans to launch a range of candles with smells such as burger, ketchup and onion.That’s as “eeeeeeew” as Gwyneth Paltrow’s Smells Like My Vagina candle.The, er, burning question is: What’s wrong with the old stalwarts of fig or gardenia A FORMER friend of paedophile Jeffrey Epstein’s right-hand woman Ghislaine Maxwell has told the FBI of a potentially relevant conversation they once had.“She said many things . . . ” reveals Christina Oxenburg.“Stuff like: ‘Jeffrey and I have everyone on videotape!’”Interesting.Could this perhaps explain Prince Andrew’s haste to cross the Atlantic and share a walk in the park simply to, he claims, break off the friendship with a man he also claims he didn’t know that well Or was it to find outthere were videos that he should be worried about from his time enjoying Epstein’s hospitality AL PACINO, , has been dumped by his -year-old girlfriend Meital Dohan.“I tried to deny it, but he is already an elderly man,” she says with refreshing candour.“So even with all my love, it didn’t last.”In other words, he’s very set in his ways, probably a little curmudgeonly at times and “the nursing years” are looming.THIS, believe it or not, is former “First Baby” Leo Blair – born when dad Tony was in situ at No Downing StreetIt feels like five minutes ago . . . but he’s now .Reasons to feel old: Part .THE maker of Barbie is bringing out three “inspirational women dolls” in the shape of ex-tennis champ Billie Jean King, hero nurse Florence Nightingale and singer Ella Fitzgerald, complete with “authentic clothing”.Nice idea, but let’s see how it pans out.Chances are they’ll end up in the “Barbie box” with all the others – dressed in a boob tube, sequined leggings and their hair in wonky plaits.Probably because we’d end up with a tuneless busker called Singy McSingface.THE WM Bar-B-Q Burger bar in Honolulu, Hawaii, has been serving its client favourite, the Royal Burger, since .Last time I looked they weren’t locked in litigation with The Queen.That’s because no one in their right mind would ever associate a burger restaurant with the British monarchy.The same, however, cannot be said of The Duke and Duchess of Sussex.One of them was born royal, they both enjoyed a breathtakingly expensive royal wedding, undertook royal dutiesand received money from the Duchy of Cornwall, which the reigning son of the current British monarchinherits.So while Harry and Meghan’s little barb that The Queen doesn’t have legal jurisdiction in the US over the word royal is correct, the notion that their use of the word isn’t inextricably linked to the British crown is patent nonsense and Her Majesty is right to insist they drop it.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The mob’s targets know no bounds.  This “woke elite” have made it impossible to have civilised conversation and debate.Take the feminist Germaine Greer, a woman who has fought tirelessly for some  years for women’s liberation. She is now considered by some to be too frightful to listen to and there have been calls to no- her — ban her from speaking at events, usually universities.Even companies such as Yorkshire Tea are getting stick.  The firm was bombarded with complaints at the weekend, with people expressing outrage because the new Chancellor, Rishi Sunak, posted a photo of himself on social media making a cup of tea with the brand.Sunak’s crime is being a Conservative. Yorkshire Tea’s crime was to allow the Conservative Chancel-or to drink its tea. This bizarre, unreasonable, moral crusading of what I see as the “woke elite” is part of the explanation for the Conservative landslide in the last election.In my view, the Labour Party lost  seats, the second largest number it has ever lost in a single election, because ordinary people look at the Left and think they have all gone mad.This isn’t true, of course. It is a great shame for sensible, left-leaning people in Britain that the woke are giving them all such a bad name.Those on the Left must cringe with horror every time there is a Twitter pile-on when someone does some- thing that “offends”.The woke march around asthey are police, bullying everyone into thinking and speaking in a way that they deem to be acceptable.If you don’t agree, they will write to your employer and get you fired, or they will bombard you with abuse until you give in and beg for forgiveness.I should know — it has happened to me more than once. If I tweet something that offends the woke elite, they write to my governing body, Ofsted, demanding my resignation.Luckily, on Twitter one can block these self-righteous radicals, giving oneself some peace. But there was a time when our school received so many savage and bloodthirsty emails that one of my office staff had a breakdown from having to read them all.We have even received death threats. Why  Because the woke elite don’t like how we run our school. As a headmistress, I believe it is important to teach children to hear all sides of any debate and encourage them to form their own, independent views.Butone side is constantly shutting down debate with bullying tactics, no-ing and drowning people out, then how are our children ever to hear both sides When we were first opening our free school, social justice warriors determined to stop us would infiltrate our parent evenings and stand up as I was talking, shouting over me so the parents couldn’t hear what I was trying to say.Why did they do this  Because in  I gave a speech at the Conservative Party conference. I am not a Conservative but that didn’t bother my detractors. As with Yorkshire Tea, simple association with the Conservative Party means you must be evil.The woke cannot imagine that the Conservatives want a better world, just as they do. They simply disagree on how to get there.So frequent and angry have the calls for someone’s dismissal or “cancellation” become that those who would have once argued the case, the “anti-woke”, are just rolling over. It’s not worth the hassle, they say with a sigh.The “anti-woke” weren’t always this way. They are ordinary people who have simply become fed up of being browbeaten by these pseudo-moral liberators.If the woke have something truly interesting to say, then why don’t they make their arguments, stand up on a stage and explain why their beliefs are worthy At least that would have the effect of persuading people, rather than alienating them.  But the woke don’t care about being virtuous. They want only to signal it.In , too many people live in fear of what they can and cannot say.

Of course, they could also just have a cold.But nevertheless traders, exploration and refining unit staff were told to work remotely – something that is not possible in many businesses.Some folk are being asked to self-quarantine for two weeks simply because they went on holiday to northern Italy.It’s getting even more needlessly dramatic within education.As it stands, Public Health England are NOT advising any schools to close.But eight now have been, while another  have quarantined pupils, forcing them to stay at home with their parents for a fortnight.In the most ridiculous case so far, an Essex primary school has been shut by its headmaster because one of its teachers spent half-term in Italy. That teacher is reportedly not sick or exhibiting any of the symptoms of coronavirus.We’ve already seen the very real cost to the market of such overreach, with £ billion wiped off the FTSE  in just  hours and the shares of travel companies like Tui and Easy Jet plummeting.The government is right and responsible to consider worst-case scenarios and plan appropriately.The Sun today revealed details of an official report showing that a catastrophic outbreak could see  per cent of Brits come down with coronavirus and , die.Of the  people tested for the virus in the UK,  have tested positive and eight of those have now been discharged.The reality is that for the vast majority of healthy people Coronavirus will not be fatal.Doing the basics right now – like washing your hands regularly and using tissues – will actually do more to help curb the spread than costly grand gestures.We must be vigilant and safe, but avoid Coronavirus hysteria.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And from the reaction we saw the people think the same, too.Good luck on this adventure in America and Canada — but I don’t think it will be long before he misses this country so much that he will want to come back and become a fully fledged member of the Royal Family.I hope his self-imposed exile is short-lived, but at the moment he is doing what his we wants and that is commendable. But the grass always looks greener over in the neighbouring field.So, Harry,you get fed up of making speeches to rich businessmen and you want to come back, just jump on the first plane and come home. We will welcome you with open arms.The love this country has for him has never stopped. As far as the nation is concerned he is still their number one member of the Royal Family.Harry is one of those instinctive people who do and say the first thing that comes into their head and when I saw him hugging people in Edinburgh I remembered why the public will always love him.Just before Christmas, when he visited a school in Luton, the students were queuing up to give him a hug before he left. That’s the Harry I know and love. We will miss him.Having toured with Harry for many years, he was a photographer’s dream — even when the tables were turned on me.In a youth club in New Zealand he was asked to put his painted hand on the wall, which he did.And then he rushed across the room and planted it on my head, as you see in the picture above.When we washed up afterwards he rebuked me for telling the whole nation on TV that morning he was going bald — just like his dad.I know his father, Prince Charles, is upset that his son is leaving and William, his best friend for many years, will also be sad to see his brother go.But the Queen has given him a year to review it and he will be welcomed like the prodigal sonhe decides his future is here back in Britain in the world’s number one family.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

At the end of the last decade, men could expect to live . years and women were still well ahead on ..But in my patch, the North East of England, le expectancy for women has actually fallen a little.The report comes from a bloke called Sir Michael Marmot. He blames economic inequality and austerity for what he calls the UK’s “lost decade”.I have no doubt whatsoever that poverty shortens theof a le. And low wages — especially in the North East — mean that for too long people have been struggling by on very little indeed.But Sir Michael also has a bit of skin in the game. He has been arguing for decades about social inequality and its effects upon health.Fair enough. But this has given rise to headlines about evil Tories killing people. The usual stuff.If you listened to the coverage of his report on the BBC, you’d think Boris Johnson and co were wandering around the country strangling impoverished pensioners as they queue up in food banks. And cackling maniacally.But is it really quite so simple as that  Is it really all about poverty Sir Michael admits that  per cent might be attributable to new flu strains which have arrived here as a consequence of increased globalisation.Bird flu, Sars and now the coronavirus.That’s not all, though. As we keep being told, the country is in the grip of an obesity epidemic.And the areas where obesity is at its greatest are also those where le expectancy is at its lowest. Being fat isn’t the consequence of poverty. It’s a result primarily of a lack of exercise and, secondly, a poor diet.Given that the NHS and Government have been banging on about obesity for a decade, might not that have something to do with it, Sir Michael Then there’s alcohol. We drink a lot of it. And by and large it’s not terribly good for us. The trend in the past  years is that women are catching up with men in their intake. I wonderthat might also have an effect on those le expectancy tables  Again, nothing to do with poverty.What about women working  Le expectancy for men always lagged behind women — and we were told that this was because men went out to work.Now that women work too, would we not expect the le expectancies for each sex to draw closer together And then this. During the past  years we have welcomed more than six million immigrants to the UK. The le expectancy in their home countries is way below that of the average in the UK —  years below in the case of Pakistan, for example, and three years in the case of Poland. Many will arrive still with the legacy of poor health treatment in their original countries. That must, surely, affect the statistics.My argument isn’t that austerity isn’t in there somewhere. Simply that there are a few more factors to take into account before we blame the Tories, once again, for killing people.The bloke had just got back from Iran, where the virus has been spreading. The experts have been warning of a possible , deaths in the UK. We need to remember that is a very-worst-case scenario based upon a lot of “s”.But just to be on the safe side, shouldn’t we be carrying out compulsory checks on all visitors flying in from flu-stricken areas Instead of allowing people to “self-report” IN the coffee plantations of Guatemala, Central America, kids lug sacks of coffee beans around for eight hours a day.For this they are paid the princely sum of £. The coffee is used by posh coffee company Nespresso in its overpriced capsules.Nespresso’s “brand ambassador” is the liberal luvvie actor George Clooney. He got more than £million from the company.How about you give some of that money back to the child labourers, George You want to change the world, make it a better place Then enable those children to live dignied lives without back-breaking work all day.I’M proud to have signed up to Toby Young’s Free Speech Union, to defend our freedom of speech.I had to break a pledge of mine to join it.It’s Lent right now – the season of the year when traditionally you give something up. Well, I’d decided to give up donating to charities for a month or so. But happy to make a very noble exception. Never before in our democratic country has free speech been so under threat.It’s OK for gobby old tossers like Toby and me – we have a  to speak. But too often people are hounded from their jobs simply for expressing an opinion. Or barred from speaking at universities in case they upset someone.Or get a midnight visit from the Old Bill because they happened to like a joke about a transgender person.The fightback starts here. Later next month I’ll be visiting universities to unveil a Charter for Academic Freedom, drawn up by my political party, the Social Democrats. Nothing is more precious than the freedom to express one’s opinion.If it offends someone , my suggestion is: OK, sure, now get over it.He was very right-on, was Harvey. Had all the politically correct opinions. Much loved by the Obamas, of course.Always the way, isn’t it  The more a bloke tells you he’s a liberal and a feminist, the more women should reach for the can of Mace.I HAD a bowl of Alpen this week, for the first time in  years.My daughter’s just got a hamster and its food reminded me of the cereal I used to eat as a young teen. Came in a black box with a mountain on it. My mum bought it because she thought it looked posh and foreign.Indeed, I thought it came from Switzerland. It was actually made in Kettering, Northants.Anyway, I had a bowl of the stuff and couldn’t work out why it wasn’t as nice as I remembered.My Facebook friends told me it was because they’ve cut the sugar content. Probably that’s right.But isn’t it also that NOTHING tastes as good as how you remember it  Not Alpen, not Mars bars, not Monster Munch.And definitely not Heinz Sandwich Spread, which tastes to me these days like paint stripper.Have to say, the site seems to me to be run as a kind of grooming parlour for the benefit of middle-aged pervs. But it’s not just that. The longer your kids – and especially the girls – spend online, the greater their chances of developing depression and other mental illnesses.They also end up with a much shorter attention span. Because they spend their days swiping backwards and forwards in a nanosecond.If we’re to avoid rearing a generation of doolally morons, we need to ration the time they spend online.It’s down to us parents to do that – not the State and not even the companies who run the godawful sites.WAS out walking with the dog this week. Saw this weird thing in the sky.Kind of a yellowy-orange. Circular. Looked up a few moments later and it was gone. I had this feeling that I’d seen it before – a long, long time ago. But can’t put a name to it.When will this miserable weather end If you knew you were a bee, would you be happy  I’m not sure I would.One bee told me yesterday: “Bit of a downer, really.“Suddenly realised I’m going to spend my entire le carting loads of pollen back to some enormous idle cow in the hive.“I’d much rather be a wasp, frankly.

happened on March , Canada will stop providing security for the couple.The announcement suggests the £m cost of the couples round-the-clock protection will fall on UK taxpayers.The Canadian government statement said: As the Duke and Duchess are currently recognised as Internationally Protected Persons, Canada has an obligation to provide security assistance on an as-needed basis, the government statement said.The assistance will cease in the coming weeks, in keeping with their change in status.It comes as it was revealed that Harry and Meghan will continue to require effective security to protect them and their son from the politan Police.In a statement on their website the Duke and Duchess of Sussex said they will continue to require effective security to protect them and their son which should fall on the UK taxpayer based on the Dukes public profile by virtue of being born a royal, his military service, the Duchesss independent profile.Police fear resources will be stretched while protecting the couple who experts believe could make £bn following their split from the royal family.Senior officers are understood to be drafting emergency plans to double the ­British protection team guarding the family.Former Met protection officer Dai Davies said: In their current state the plans are unworkable.Harry and Meghan’s ­situation has called for a complete ripping up of the ­rulebook and they are acting like none of the rules apply to them.There is already a severe lack of trained officers and this is only adding to the Mets woes.Scotland Yard refused to comment when contacted by the Sun Online.A spokesman for the Sussexes said: Buckingham Palace does not comment on the details of security arrangement.There are well-established independent processes to determine the need for publicly funded security.Robert Watts, compiler of the Sunday Times Rich List, estimates the couple are on course to triple the £million net worth of the Beckhams.After probing Harry and Meghans financial background, Mr Watts said: You cant underestimate the international appeal of being a Royal.And the appeal is even bigger in the US, Canada and the rest of the world.I think it’s possible that in ten years’ time, Prince Harry and Meghan could make it on to the Sunday Times Rich List with £m and £bn in the longer term.In their first joint UK event since their bombshell decision

The one that is far more biased, out of control and in need of immediate reform.But this week we were provided with a happy reminder that Channel ’s future is by no means certain.MPs close to the Prime Minister revealed a plan is on the table for the blatantly left-wing broadcaster to be privatised.That will be music to the ears of fair-minded folk everywhere who have seen the once-interesting and innovative station morph into a liberal propaganda network that believes it is there to humiliate the Tories and call out commercial media rivals.It’s a shocking anomaly that in the  broadcasting world, where choice for consumers is at an all-time high, C is publicly owned at all.The sort of quirky, culturally relevant, groundbreaking and erse programming that once made the channel worth having is a distant memory.Instead, we are left in the truly odd situation where one Government-owned broadcasterspent many millions of pounds to poach from another BBC a genuinely popular existing programme called The Great British Bake Off, with the result being the show’s biggest stars leaving and the ratings halving.Meanwhile, C’s lone recent success, Black Mirror, was lost to Netflix.Then there’s the sorry state of Channel  News, which makes even Newsnight look impartial.It was no surprise to me when I witnessed at the Bafta Awards last month Hugh Grant make a beeline for his pal Jon “F*** the Tories” Snow, no doubt to collude on even more coverage designed to undermine anyone who doesn’t share their anti-Press, anti-Brexit world view.Let me remind you of just a small portion of the smorgasbord of hit pieces served up by C in the past year alone.There was the “comedy” that imagined a character, based on Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage, was shot in the head while giving a speech about immigration.There was the real speech from the channel’s head of news and current affairs, Dorothy Byrne, where she attacked Boris Johnson as a “known liar”.Its news service then ly claimed the PM said “people of colour” while answering a question about democratically controlled immigration rather than “people of talent”.There was the climate change debate where C News replaced Boris with a chunk of melting ice and refused to let his stand-in Michael Gove into the venue to represent the Tories.And there was the most recent election night broadcast where a studio audience who they claimed fairly represented the political spectrum booed when the exit poll showing a massive Tory majority was announced.If any other channel had broadcast such slanted programming they would have faced sanctions from the regulator Ofcom many times over.There is literally no benefit for the Government to hang on to a broadcaster which has lost any sense of its real reason for being.C no longer provides any sort of public service broadcasting.To be completely honest, barring the odd gem, it hasn’t done since it became Big Brother TV in  and started a march towards hyper-commercialism.I am by no means saying C should not exist. Once privatised, the successful parts would be able to thrive.That would mean far more commercially viable hits like the soap Hollyoaks, and further series of popular factual series like Bake Off.And likely the end of a biased news service fronted by Mr Snow, that on Wednesday night saw its ratings plummet to just ,.HOLLYWOOD celebrity agents and PRs operate in a narcissistic system where the over-the-top needs and desires of their spoiled, A-list, millionaire clients are put above everything .There is not a moment to think of the greater good for humanity, nor even the other staff involved on a project.No constraints are placed on the ridiculous nature of the daily requests these staff members oversee, be it demands for millions of dollars more for a project, or a private jet, or three personal assistants.They know all too well thattheir famous client isn’t happy, there is a long list of other agents just waiting to step in to take their -per-cent cut of the star’s earnings.That’s why, for the past six months, there has been a growing sense of dread within the Royal Family about such a network of Hollywood vultures becoming intrinsically involved in the “business” of the monarchy.And there was most definitely reason to worry.As the Duke and Duchess of Sussex’s classless rebuke to the Queen over the use of the word “royal” showed, their new team will go for the low blow without a second thought for the damage it could cause to Crown or country.FOR years I have been campaigning for the BBC to overhaul the system that sees us put up a God-awful entry for the Eurovision Song Contest year after year.Sure, I acknowledge that we’re never going to do particularly well in the actual results, especially post-Brexit.But that’s no reason to put forward the type of total dross we have been.So this year I am celebrating – because the UK entry is actually an immediate piece of mid-tempo pop magic with a soaring chorus.Sensibly, the Beeb has signed up talented singer-songwriter James Newman to represent us with his tune My Last Breath.His record company BMG says it started the search for a song with the “sole aim of changing the perception of the contest by working with the very best UK songwriters”.James certainly has Eurovision pedigree.He won a Brit in  as co-writer of Rudimental hit Waiting All Night, has twice been nominated for Grammys and has written hit singles for Ed Sheeran, Calvin Harris and Jess Glynne.And his brother is the equally talented pop star John Newman.But now is his time to step into the spotlight himself and be able to proudly fly the Union Jack in Rotterdam this May.You can tune into Dan’s talkRADIO Drivetime slot on weekdays between pm and pm Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But the government would not accept any alignment with EU laws as the EU is demanding, with Mr Gove adding: We will not trade away our sovereignty. Today Ms de Montchalin explained: We all know thatwe feel the need, we have the legal capacity to extend which is why I called it articial. The EU has already set out its priorities ahead of the formal start of the talks on Monday. And earlier this week the government published a -page document outlining its priorities for the talks.  These include ruling out any role for the ECJ, refusing to accept any EU laws in the UK and aiming for a trading relationship with the EU similar to the ones the -nation bloc has with Canada, Japan and South Korea.  In what is the EUaposs first public response to the UKaposs negotiating de Montchalin mocked the UK governmentaposs insistence on an Australian style deal. You are not Canada, you are certainly not Australia - first of all because we can come to you by train, you are the United Kingdom, she said in a well-timed speech on the “future of the UK-EU and UK-France relationships” at Chatham House. She told the audience that the next phase marked a clear departure from the political negotiations of the withdrawal agreement but the next set of discussions are about building a relationship. We are not building the relationship for politicians, we are building it for companies, business, fishermen, researchers, we are building it for people, real people. It is for them, she said.  And she warned the UK not to underestimate the unity of the EU which had held firm in the first stage.In a matter-of-fact way the French Europe Minister insisted that Brexit has consequences, there is no such thing as Brexit only in name.She added: Our aim is, of course, not to punish or take any revenge on the UK. But de Montchalin insisted: Being sovereign means protecting our economies, our people, just as much as you do. The UKaposs guidelines for the negotiations, which cover trade and other aspects of the future relationship with Brussels, set the deadline for progress against a backdrop of deep isions between the two sides over issues including fish, state subsidies and standards.

As the virus continues to spread rapidly across the planet, the number of Covid- patients diagnosed in the UK slowly ticks upwards. This morning the Department of Health and Social Care announced that two Brits had contracted the virus while in Iran. Both have ed to London from the Middle Eastern country, which has had the highest number of deaths outside of China. The London patients are being treated at the Royal Free Hospital in the capital, where a number of infected people are also in quarantine. Someone from Swansea in Wales also has the disease following a trip to Northern Italy. Public Health Wales is working to identy those who have come into contact with the patient.  Dr Giri Shankar, incident director at the organisation, said: Public Health Wales is working hard to identy close contacts, and we are taking all appropriate actions to reduce any risk to the publicaposs health. The ages and genders of the newly confirmed patients have not been revealed by the authorities. Yesterday six more people tested positive for Cornavirus in the UK.The highest concentration of patients is to be found in London, where five have been quarantined after flying in from France, one from China, one from Italy and two from Iran. A Chinese student and their mum were diagnosed and quarantined in York, while Derbsyhire has one confirmed patient who spent time out in Tenere. Four people have been isolated at Arrowe Park Hospital in Merseyside having left the Diamond Princess Cruise Ship which became a hotbed for the virus.  Both Belfast and Cardf have a confirmed case each which originated in Italy. In the past day concerns have been raised about the NHSaposs ability to cope with the spread of the virus. It emerged last night that overstretched hospitals here in the UK would be forced to treat only the patients most likely to survive should the virus take hold. Former Health Secretary  Jeremy Hunt  said: “The NHS would find it hard to copethe pandemic took off.” Prime Minister Boris Johnson spent four hours visiting Kettering Hospital during the night sht on Thursday night."},{"url":null,"title":"first clip prince harry jon","story":"NewsFirst clip of Prince Harry and Jon Bon Jovis charity song - with disappointing newsPrince Harry spent the morning at Abbey Road Studios with Jon Bon Jovi recording a new version of his hit Unbroken in aid of the Invictus Games FoundationShareCommentsByZoe ForseyLestyle Editor:,  FEB Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news video first-clip-prince-harry-jon-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news uk-news first-clip-prince-harry-jon-\"\" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - Royal FamilySubscribeWe will use your email address only for sending you newsletters.

Thousands of young pupils took the day off school to see the Swedish teenager, , address a rally on College Green as part of a Youth Strike  Climate protest. The prominent campaigner walked on stage to chants of Greta, Greta from the crowd, estimated to total , by organisers. Wearing a white knitted hat and yellow raincoat, she said the climate emergency is being completely ignored by politicians and the media. Basically, nothing is being done to halt this crisis despite all the beautul words and promises from our elected officials, she continued.  I will not be silenced while the world is on fire - will you  Youngsters braved the rain to gather in the city centre ahead of Thunbergaposs arrival, holding placards with slogans saying Iaposm less of a baby than Boris and at this point education is pointless. Another read: when our world is dead where do we go  Ending her speech, Thunberg said: We will not be silenced because we are the change. And change is coming whether you like it or not. Thank you and letaposs march.The speech is due to be followed by a march through Bristol. I look up to Greta Thunberg and I want to show my respect, said protester Eve Nott, , from nearby Bath. I think she can help us in changing our ways. Speaking to Bristol Live as she arrived by train at Temple Meads Station, Thunberg said she chose to come to the city due to its strong environmental movement. She said she hoped the event would be a gathering of people standing together in solidarity.  Speaking before Thunberg addressed the crowd, Mya-Rose Craig, also , called for change. Mya-Rose was the youngest person to be awarded an honorary doctorate from the University of Bristol last week. The student called for greater ersity in the climate movement. She told the crowd: Greta, welcome to our amazing city and thank you for being with us today. We have to engage with all of our communities in order to properly fight climate change. An unequal world can never be a sustainable one.It comes after police raised safety fears over the numbers planning to attend the environmental protest from across the country. Parents, especially those with primary school aged children, have been told to be aware of the risks of falls and crushing. Saying a lack of information from organisers has made it dficult to make adequate preparations, Bristol City Council and Avon and Somerset Police warned: Do not underestimate the scale of this protest. Residents have been urged to avoid unnecessary travel, with many busy roads in the centre closed to accommodate the rally from am to .pm.Two schools are also closed today. But others have embraced the event, with the Old Vic Theatre in King Street opening its facilities to youngsters and their families - offering them use of loos, baby changing units and a place to take shelter from the rain. There will be major disruption to the city, the councilaposs executive director, Mike Jackson, and Superintendent Andy Bennett of Bristol Police said, asking parents to be responsible for their children.  Parents are responsible for their children. The council and police are not responsible for unsupervised children. In terms of big crowds, there is the potential for trips, slips, falls and crushing. People can easily be separated from their friends and family. Mobile phone signals can be intermittent due to saturation on the communications masts.  However Bristol Youth Strike  Climate - which organised the demo - says they have no time for being patronised by police. In a social media post, they say safety measures have been put in place, including  metres of festival barriers, a safe zone at the front for young children and more than  stewards. The worldaposs youth are waking up and taking action on the climate crisis, they continued.

A poll of , adults discovered what makes the nation prick up their ears, and what makes them tune out of a conversation.Rants about online dating, Brexit and diets are also likely to make people zone out. And while local and national news or the weather is most interesting to the over s, gossip, music, and climate change top the list for under s.The research, commissioned by high street hearing specialist Hidden Hearing to support the National Campaign for Better Hearing, also found the majority of us consider themselves to be aposactiveapos listeners rather than apospassiveapos listeners. Active listeners pay full attention to the conversation by listening and responding, but more than half admitted they often interrupt or fill in sentences when someone  is speaking. And under s are nearly twice as likely to switch off within three minutes of conversation than those over . GP and health broadcaster Dr Hilary Jones said: When weaposre talking to others we can often tell when someone isnapost really listening. As friends and family, itaposs vital for us to determinethis is because the listener is disinterested or unable to hear us.  We know that hearing loss can be linked to loneliness and isolation so making sure people are able to engage with us is important to keep our brains sharp and feel connected. Not enough people are aware of the common signs of hearing loss and what to do next, such as taking a hearing test and using hearing aids which can help people actively listen, be connected, and tune into conversations. The study revealed the most common occasions where people switch off including family gatherings, work meetings and watching the TV. Three quarters admit they interject into someoneaposs story with questions to show theyaposre listening properly, with  per cent nodding their heads at random intervals to highlight interest.  And a third respond with judicious aposhmmapossapos when they feel the opportunity calls for it. The research, conducted in the lead up to World Hearing Day on March rd, also revealed that during a typical conversation, Brits need to ask someone to repeat something twice - because they donapost listen properly or canapost hear the speaker. The most common reasons over s donapost listen include believing people are mumbling rather than speaking properly , background noiseand people talking too quietly , all of which are signs of hearing loss. Whereas under s are twice as likely than over s to struggle to hear because of distractions.  Over s are also less likely to let modern technology distract them, with only one in  distracted by their mobile phone, compared to one third of under s.

The Duke of Sussex and his bodyguards reportedly had the entire carriage to themselves on the way home from Edinburgh to London. No other passengers were allowed to use the carriage on the LNER service to Kingaposs Cross Station on Wednesday night, according to the Mail Online. He was on his way home from his eco-conference where he had asked attendees to drop his royal title, urging them to just call him aposHarry.apos Only the Queen conventionally travels exclusively first-class on the rail.  She typically has a small first class carriage to herself to and from her estate in Sandringham, Norfolk. Whereas Prince William and Kate Middleton earlier this month travelled to and from the new Defence Medical Rehabilitation Centre near Loughborough, Leicestershire, alongside ordinary commuters. Prince Harry had been speaking at the Travalyst event at the Edinburgh International Conference Centre on sustainable tourism.The Duke founded the Travalyst coalition, which is working to help tourists find more eco-friendly ways to travel. The conference this week focused on getting travel industry feedback on new sustainability ideas, such as creating an online scoring system to show the green status of aviation, accommodation and holiday experiences. The Dukeaposs train trip comes after the Sussexes were criticised for their private jet travel last year. Buckingham Palace has been approached for comment on Harryaposs travel arrangements. He and we Meghan Markle are beginning a new le split between Canada in the UK following their shock announcement the planned to step back from royal le.  The move has left questions over the pairaposs security arrangements, as they still require protection in their new lestyle. Today Canada confirmed police protection for the family, including baby Archie, would end within weeks. The Royal Mounted Canadian Police would end its protection services once the coupleaposs transition out of royal le is complete, leaving the question of how to protect the pair to the UK, and to the Sussexes themselves.

The group were being transported from Qatar, where Melda and Steve Ozel used to live, to their new home in Powys, North Wales when the Belgian authorities seized them. On February , the Ozels received the devastating news that their cat Hugo had been euthanised. The feline had been held by the Federal Agency for the Safety of the Food Chainin Belgium since Valentineaposs Day alongside nine other cats. After days of bitter legal wrangling, the couple remain terried the surviving, increasingly unwell animals could also be put down before they can be flown out of the country. Today is day  of our catsapos captivity, said Melda, a civil engineer. Hugo was a happy, healthy cat when he was put on the plane on  Feb. We have been extremely worried about the well-being of our other  cats and were not allowed to see them despite my husband visiting the facilities yesterday. To this day, the cats have not been released and are being held hostage by FAVV in what can only be described as an unlawful power play - or a demonstration of ineptitude to baffled law abiding cat lovers.  For the past four year the Ozels lived in Qatar, a country where cats do not share the same revered status as in the UK. After being shocked by the treatment of cats they encountered, the couple decided to start rescuing those they found battered and abused on the streets of Doha. By the time they decided to come back to the UK, Melda and Steve had amassed a litter of  cats. In order to transport the animals to their newly constructed Madcattersapos Haven shelter in Snowdonia they had to be flown back in batches of five. Twenty of the moggies successfully made the journey from Qatar to Belgium and then on to Wales, before the couple encountered dficulties on February .  Two friends of the couple, who had agreed to ferry the felines, were stopped in Brussels by border police, with one pal hauled in for four hours of questioning. She was repeatedly accused of trying to smuggle  cats into Belgium for sale, Melda claimed. She showed the paperwork, she said repeatedly she was not the ownerand she was only one of the two flight buddies. They didnapost listen and the cats were confiscated. The flight buddies were not given any documentation on where the cats were being taken and what the reason for the confiscation was.  The Ozels heard nothing until three days later, when they were informed the cats were seized because they were not accompanied by enough humans. They hired animal welfare lawyer Anthony Godfroid who attempted to have the cats released through the court system. After days of legal wrangling the Administrative Court of Belgium ruled that the cats should be sent back to Qatar. The couple accepted the decision and were preparing to fly with the felines when they received some unwelcome news.  Melda said: Our lawyer received communication from them stating that one of our cats was too sick, a decision was made on the spot and he was euthanized. I didnapost want to believe it. I was quite shocked. The shock death made the couple more determined to save the surviving nine. Fteen days into the catsapos arrest the Ozels have yet to clap eyes on them. Today the cats are due to be flown back to Qatar, where Steve hopes to be able to intercept them.

SallyAnn was just  when she welcomed her first foster child into her home - unexpectedly becoming mum to a -year-old girl who could have been mistaken for her friend.The new mother and her then -year-old fiance Ryan became so close to their daughter they gave her the special role of bridesmaid at their wedding. SallyAnn and Ryan, from the west Midlands, said the small age gap meant they formed a close bond. They went on to foster six more children in three years, as well as having a baby of their own.Speaking about their first foster daughter SallyAnn, now , told The Sun : Sometimes, Iaposd take a step back and think this is really bizarre - but it was really nice. Having her as our bridesmaid was one of our biggest highs as foster carers. SallyAnn had always wanted to be a mum and began work as a private nanny after studying healthcare in college. When she was made redundant, she became a self-employed nanny, working for several foster families. She said the experience gave her a real insight into how much vulnerable children can benefit from fostering and told Ryan it was something sheaposd really want to do.  SallyAnn said she didnapost see the point of her and Ryan waiting another decade or more to have kids, and wanted them to foster before having children of their own. After giving Ryan some time to think about it, she said he came back after just a few weeks with the response aposwhy not aposThe couple became foster carers through Britainaposs largest fostering and adoption charity, The Adolescent and ChildrenapossTrust. Sally-Ann, who had previously worked in early  education , initially thought she would foster a child under seven, but was delighted to welcome a -year-old into her family. At first, we were a little nervous about what to expect and how the match would work, SallyAnn told Coventry Live. Would she respect us as carers, would we get the balance between understanding her and parenting right   Fortunately, other than a few minor challenges expected with parenting a teenager, the placement was very successful and she fitted really well into our family. We found that people would just assume that she was our family member or a friend, which helped when transporting her to social activities with friends and to school, as she preferred to keep her peers from knowing that she was in foster care. We felt so honoured that she agreed to play such a key role on our special day after only living with us for just a few months, SallyAnn added.

Amy, a -year-old driver, said: We started talking to the landlord on WhatsApp and got really excited about the house. We were sent pictures of the inside and it seemed to have large bedrooms, a driveway, a big kitchen and garden, so we were really keen. Before the couple could look around the property, the landlord, who claimed to have recently moved from the area to Plymouth, said that he needed the security deposit in advance on the advice from his solicitor. He claimed this would ensure that the couple would be able to afford to rent the property. Amy said: We really wanted the house. So we paid £ in two payments on the understanding that we would get the money backwe didnapost like the house. On the day of the viewing, the couple were still extremely eager to obtain the property and were asked to pay a further £ as the first monthaposs rent. All of the emails and texts mentioned his solicitor and we had seen a copy of the tenancy agreement, so we had no reason to believe that something wasnapost right. The couple transferred the extra money. But when they went to the house, they found that the house was occupied by itaposs actual owner - who had no idea his home had been ly placed on the rental market. I was so annoyed, fumed Amy. I emailed the landlord straight away asking what was going on. They emailed back saying that they had injured their foot and that they would meet us the next day. We knew something was up. I asked for the money back, but have not heard from them since.  Matthew, , had already given notice on his current lodgings but was fortunately able to reverse this before they found a new tenant. However, he and his girlfriend had been left £ out of pocket. We will never do something like this again, said Amy. From now on we will only go through property management companies and never give money over before. We had our heart set on this place, we thought this would be our family home. Unfortunately, because Amy transferred the money willingly, her bank have said she is unlikely to get it back. Frank Ballinger has lived at the property in Brackla for around  years. The -year-old has described the moment he met the couple and realised that his home was offered for rent without his knowledge. The couple came here one afternoon and they said that they were here to look at the house, Mr Ballinger, a retired special constable at South Wales Police, said.

First time mother Emily Pritchard, , says she couldnapost get a full nightaposs sleep for more than three months and felt like a aposzombieapos after her son Jesse was born last September. In their exhaustion, she and partner Ross Jewitt, , from Braintree in Essex tried everything to help their newborn - who woke up every two and a half hours without fail - to settle down in bed. I was like a zombie and stayed in my pyjamas all day - it was exhausting, Emily, a salon manager, says. Ross was getting up for work completely shattered and Jesse was miserable, whingy and upset because he was so tired.  They tried playing white noise, getting him to sleep on his side, and even splurged on a £ course in  cranial osteopathy - but nothing seemed to help. However the new parents are now rejoicing after discovering a solution costing just £ in the form of a sleep spray from Boots. They claim that since they began using Bloom and Blossomaposs The Very Hungry Caterpillar Baby Pillow Spray, Jesse has snoozed through to the morning for  hours straight every night. As a result, Emily and Ross, who works as carpet fitter, have now enjoyed six weeks of undisturbed sleep.  No new mum wants to admit how hard it can be when you bring your baby home and not many people are honest about how hard it can be, Emily continued. I got a big shock when I brought Jesse home. He was waking up every two and a half hours, so I would be up three or four times a night. Lots of people told me it was normal for the first couple of months, but it was still happening in December, four months after he was born.  I genuinely thought something was wrong with him: I even took him to the doctors. The couple came across the magical spray after Emily shared her dilemma on social media, and it was recommended by her sister-in-law. It contains plants such as Sicilian lavender, jasmine and ylang ylang, which are known for their calming properties. The first time I used it, it was like magic. He slept through the whole night for the first time ever, Emily, who now uses the product religiously, said.  I woke up three or four times that night just out of habit, but every time I checked Jesse he was fast asleep. The following morning I woke up and checked the time. I couldnapost believe it when I realised heaposd slept for  hours. The second night I thought aposthis is the testapos but he slept through for eight hours, and he has slept through every night since. The infant now sleeps every night from :pm to am, something Emily, who is also now back at work, says has been transformational.

A spokesperson for the global health authority said the spread of the Covid- strain of the disease is getting bigger. On Friday morning the WHO said it could well reach all countries across the world. The stark warning came the day after Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the director general of the WHO, suggested the planet was at a tipping point. “This virus has pandemic potential,” he said. “We are actually in a very delicate situation in which the outbreak can go in any direction based on how we handle it.” So far more than , people in at least  countries have been infected by the disease. In the past few days more cases have been reported outside China than in the country, where the outbreak began in December.  The rapid spread of the disease, which is now in numerous European countries and has claimed lives in Northern Italy, has led governments to adopt ious containment proceedures. China has enforced a lock down of  million people to control the spread of the virus while Japan closed its schools for at least a month. Iran has canceled Friday Prayers in major cities and Saudi Arabia barred pilgrims from its holiest sites. Meanwhile three more people have tested positive for coronavirus in the UK, bringing the total to .  One patient in Wales and two in England have been diagnosed, officials have announced today.

The incredible moment was captured on video during Auckland Pride on February . The preacher - from the Torch of Christ Ministries church - had turned up uninvited to Our March, which celebrates New Zealandaposs LGBTQI+ community. The video shows him telling rainbow-glad revellers that today you can receive Christ in your heart and shouting religious beliefs on a megaphone. In response, two young women chose to show their love for each other and make out in front of him.  Other Pride-goers clad in brightly coloured clothing then slowly start to surround the preacher as he continues to shout his beliefs. He can be heard saying: You are controlled by the devil. The video was released by the church on YouTube, with a warning claiming that it includes lewd sexual acts, troubling images, and other sexually suggestive content. It includes a warning saying the video is not suitable for most children to watch. We preached the gospel of Jesus Christ and repentance while also telling people they are loved and cared about, it reads.  We did our best to approach people with the fruit of the Spirit while also standing firm on Godaposs truth.  Many people did very vile and lewd sexual acts on the camera while later having a conversation with us because of the conviction of sin that set in. Phillip Blair, the leader of Torch of Christ Ministries, was heckled at the same parade after accusing attendees of celebrating debauchery.  He was surrounded by revellers, who told him weaposre here, weaposre queer, get used to it. The preacher - who has spoken at LGBTQI+ parades in the USA, as well as New Zealand and Australia - was eventually asked by police to move on. Last year, Mr Blair was told to shut up by a commuter on a train in Sydney, Australia after telling him and other passengers to repent.

amalgamated.Bank bosses say the decision was made as a result of fewer customers using branches to do their banking.Mark McDonald MSP is now seeking a meeting with Clydesdale Bank bosses to discuss his concerns.The nearest alternative Clydesdale bank will be at the St Nicholas branch in Aberdeen city centre more than six miles away.Mark McDonald MSP said: “I have requested an urgent meeting with Clydesdale representatives to discuss the shortfall in service provision which will result following their departure from the area.“Following the recent closure of Dyce’s RBS branch, and the reduction of hours at the TSB, this is yet another major blow to the local community.“I am disappointed that local residents were not consulted before this decision was reached.“I will also be seeking assurances regarding the support that will be made available to older and more vulnerable customers for whom the journey to an alternative banking location will not be feasible, and for whom the transition to electronic banking will not be possible.“In addition, I am keen to understand the options which will be made available to support local residents who may, or may not, continue to bank with the Clydesdale Virgin brand.”The closure comes as Clydesdale Bank, which is currently being integrated into the Virgin Money brand, reported customer usage of the Dyce branch dropped by .% over an -month period.During the same time frame, it also saw an increase in mobile banking registrations of .% and an increase in mobile banking usage of .%.Clydesdale Bank advise that these changes in customer behaviour have resulted in the Dyce branch no longer being viable for the bank to stay open.A spokeswoman for Virgin Money said: “We fully understand the concerns some of our customers have regarding branch closures, and the inconvenience this will cause them in some cases, and recognise the need to provide our customers with a wide range of options through which they can continue to bank with us.“Our focus now is on ensuring that all customers at Dyce, particularly the most vulnerable, are supported through this transition.“We are writing to all impacted customers to let them know about the changes, and our staff in our branches and through our channels below will be on hand to help with any queries they may have.”They added: “While customers’ accounts will be transitioned to the Aberdeen St Nicholas branch, they are of course welcome into any Clydesdale Bank branch.“These will be integrated into the Virgin Money brand in the coming months.“In addition, customers can perform banking tasks through mobile banking, via the Clydesdale Bank app, internet banking, telephone banking or by visiting their local Post Office, where they can perform many day-to-day banking tasks at the local Post Office which is within ft of the Dyce branch.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2017/10/careinspectorate-140x67.jpg

Dferent scouts and dferent analysts have been given dferent leagues to look at.“They look after two or three leagues each and work along with head of recruitment Russ Richardson and myself to identy players and positions that we are looking at.“It is their call as well to flag up any players that jump out at them.“We then dig a bit deeper in terms of the contract situation and availability.“Then myself, Russ and the staff start to look more deeply at the players and all the rest of it.“Some get discarded very quickly for dferent reasons.“Ronald was one that was flagged up to us in the summer on our system.“He was the type of full-back we were looking to bring in.”McInnes’ scouting network identied Venezuelan Hernandez playing for Stabaek in Norway, before their link-up with Atlanta.However, the MLS side subsequently opened the way for the Dons to contact the South American’s agent.Due to the link up with Atlanta, the Dons will also have access to scouting data from the South American leagues which the MLS side have focused on.Ultimately the partnership is a two-way street as the Reds can also help Atlanta by identying European targets.McInnes said: “The South American leagues are an area where Atlanta have expertise and boots on the ground.”Aberdeen may now be casting the net far and wide in the hunt for talent, but McInnes emphasised that will not be to the detriment of sourcing Scottish players. The Reds signed teenage midfielder Mark Gallagher from Ross County on a two-and-a-half-year contract in January.Aberdeen also signed players like Kenny McLeanand Graeme Shinnieand developed them into full Scotland internationals.McInnes said: “It doesn’t mean to say we ignore what is on our own doorstep and what has worked for us in the past.“We did that with Shinnie, McLean and Lewis Ferguson.“Where players come from is irrelevant – I don’t care.“Whether it is our own academy bringing them through, other people’s academies, our own League, England or Ireland.“We have normally worked with British and Irish players in general.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2018/09/5baf24a8f1db7-e1538213846237.jpg ","title":"mcinnes this team can go all the way","story":"Aberdeen boss Derek McInnes believes his rebuilt squad is strong enough to win the Scottish Cup.Now he wants them to prove him right with the first step seeing off St Mirren in a quarter final in Paisley tomorrow night.Aberdeen have not won the Scottish Cup since , although McInnes led the Dons to the final in , losing - against Celtic.In a bid to deliver silverware success, McInnes overhauled the Reds last summer in the busiest transfer window of his seven years at Pittodrie.He insists injury problems throughout the season derailed the chance for his side to hit top gear with form in the Premiership this year inconsistent.The Reds received a double fitness boost with midfielders Funso Ojo and Craig Bryson both set tofrom injury tomorrow.McInnes said: “You are always learning about your squad.“When you see the injuries clear up a wee bit you can start to see the strength in the squad.“I believe this squad is good enough to go all the way although we obviously still have it all to prove.“Previous Aberdeen teams have got to Hampden and it is up to this one to prove they belong there. They know the standard that has been set and it is up to us to show this squad is capable of that.”Aberdeen battled back from the brink in the previous round when overcoming a - deficit with only four minutes remaining of extra time in Kilmarnock.Two goals in the final minute of the fth round replay secured a memorable turnaround and kept the dream of lting the trophy for the first time in  years alive.McInnes said: “That showed me and everyone just how important the Scottish Cup is to them.“Also how much they want to do well. People maybe thought we were down and out against Kilmarnock but we then scored those two late goals.“That win was no less than we deserved as we were the far better team in the second half.“We were the better team in extra time and there was that resilience about us.“Now we are down to eight teams left in the Scottish Cup.“It is a weekend for us to enjoy and we have to take the opportunity to hopefully get into the last four and get back to Hampden.”McInnes ended a -year trophy drought in his first full season as Dons manager when lting the League Cup in .Since then the Reds have reached a further three finals, two in the League Cup and the Scottish Cup in .He is under no illusion as to the demands from the supporters of a strong cup run and also the benefits that can deliver.He said: “I know the importance of cups to this club.“A good cup run brings a feel good factor, numbers swell and the anticipation and excitement gets greater.“There is also the financial side. There are so many benefits from a strong cup run.”Aberdeen will welcome back midfielders Ojo and Bryson tomorrow having been ruled out of the - loss to Ross County.McInnes said: “Ojo and Bryson have been back in training which is brilliant for us.“Ojo missed the game with stitches and Bryson had a knock but nothing which we thought would keep him out of this one.“Ojo had  stitches and the nature of where it is caused problems. He wasn’t ready for Ross County because the likelihood was that would have opened up againhe had played.“We were always hopeful he would be okay for the cup tie.“It is good to have that strength again and options through the middle.”Winger Ryan Hedges is ruled out with a thigh strain suffered in the development squad’s - Reserve Cup semi-final defeat of Motherwell on Monday."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column january 10 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsCouncillors wil be put in an unenviable position when they finally decidewhere the axe will fall on council services.But exactly how much Argyll and Bute will have to spend will not be known until the daffodils are beginning to pop through the ground.

Nearly three years later I fear the dream is still a long way from that reality.Mid Argyll Youth Development Servicescertainly seems to have ambitious plans for an indoor skate park and this is to be lauded, however a quick look online will show an apparent apathy with regard to moving forward with the project. A young man created the #Lochgilphead Skate Park Association# on Facebook in , yet a final post in  indicated how little the proposal had moved forward. If the project needs more money to actually get it built we need to know how much, so that appropriate funding can be sought.What is causing the project to take years to come to fruition The potential for help by the £ million Tarbert and Lochgilphead Regeneration Fund in  was dashed when councillors instead decided that improvements to road junctions, streets, a cycle track and indoor bowling were more important, and allocated a staggering £, to feasibility studies for these projects alone, this is before any work is actually done, you understand.That is a great deal of money for feasibility studies and design works.Let us be realistic # in nine long years the community has gone from the initial excited buzz about a skate park to finally managing to purchase a plot of land upon which to build it in early . From there it seems the project has not been able to move.In the meantime the youngsters who worked so hard to give momentum to the project appear to have given up hope and are now probably giving thought to employment prospects rather than having fun.It is a sad state of affairs.But rather than giving up hope, let us reignite this campaign for our children to have the dream of a skate park in Lochgilphead whilst they are still young enough to enjoy it.Nick MacIneskar, TayvallichSir,With regard to your story in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser #Inveraray seawall in need of attention#, would it be possible to contact BEAR Scotland and ask themthey could also create an access point to the shore Possibly at the bus stop at Barn Brae. Thanks very much.Marion McIntosh, InveraraySir,I should like to make an appeal to all MPs, MSPs, councillors and all lawmakers that in  they make no new laws.At the beginning of this new decade they should improve the laws they already passed. I would even like for them to go further and reduce the number of laws that are in existence.Now please don’t get me wrong, I am not against all laws. What I fear is that instead of addressing the issues which are negative to iniduals and society, legislators believing that by extending what are regarded as crimes changes society for the better. Their belief is wrong.We know that parking on pavements is wrong #upskirting# is horrying smoking in a car in which they are children is unacceptable dropping litter is shameful driving through a red light is dangerous.What we need is the range of social and cultural influences that help us feel that we should behave in a positive way. In the s, s and s the majority of people regularly attended churches and religious organisations. In these environments people developed feelings of what was right and wrong. Positive behaviour was also developed by participating in the extensions of these organisations through activities in young mother groups women#s guilds, choirs, and religious celebrations. These helped develop positive moral compass in people.Equally, most children and young people went to youth organisations such as the Girl Guides, Scouts, the BBs, army and naval cadets. Even into the s local authorities ran youth clubs and had excellent people called #youth leaders#. No more. #We cannot afford them# is the call of the day. Without them the honourable behaviour of society will continue to deteriorate.So my plea to politicians is simple # stop making us all criminals by passing more and more laws and start supporting and encouraging agencies, groups and people who indirectly and directly instil in iniduals behaviour of which all can be proud.Finlay CraigCoveSir,There is all the hoo-ha at the moment over the lesser royals deciding its going to be a better le that beckons from opting out from royal duties # perhaps wanting a less stressful, more normal, le for themselves and their family as ordinary people away from the media hype and national newspapers.It was lovely, however, to see in the same week front page on the local paper a real regional award for a less well-known commoner.An MBE given for services to the local youth community, making this two great awards for Lochgilphead in recent years and showing that local strong ladies in Mid Argyll do have what it takes.Hard work and true Scottish grit and determination in their hearts for the area and community.

A wee van and a motorbike were behind them at the time and they let them pass and they disappeared down the twisty road at an incrediblespeed.They reached Tighnabruaich at about  o#clock and saw Fulmar in the water, but when they stopped to speak to Johnny Malcolm and Donald Turner they were told she was not in the water more than # an hour and still not fully rigged. They were quite right but George Smith said they were busy getting Psyche ready for launchingbut they would be out first thing in the morning to bend on the sails and finish off the rigging.They got their storesin the yard and with these and their luggage went aboard in two trips. Things were soon put sufficiently enough in order to allow them to get to bed and after watching Psyche go down the slip they were soon in their bunks. It was a beautully clear evening but distinctly cold.Next morning they were up at sevenand about eight the yard men came out and finished up their jobs. Jimmy Smith fixed up the slipping clutch and suggested we do away with the present gear lever fancy arrangement which was not strong enough for its work. This the Skipper agreed to though it meant a less handy working but it did away with the pin and shield that broke up the dog-house seat, they being replaced by a removable hatch cover. It certainly made sitting in the dog-house more comfortable.The Skipper went ashore to the village for meat and some curtain hooks while Archie watered ship and the other two continued cleaning and clearing up aboard.At quarter to twelve they were away under full sail and in brilliant sunshine but with a cold north-westerly they ran to Ardlamont then beat up to Tarbert, being passed just outside Tarbert as an aeroplane flew close overhead, by Blink. They noticed a huge oil tanker doing trials just off Arran.They were anchored off the herring pier before  o#clock and they had supper-cum-lunch then went ashore. The Pilot to visit a friend, the others to get milk in the village then to walk to the end of the road on Loch Fyne. On their way they spoke to an enthusiastic English pair, working in their garden, who wanted to know off which yacht they had come.During the evening Arcturus and Tunnag came in and one or two motor boats. Zaidie was in when they arrived and Leonora was anchored across Loch Fyne in Buck Bay.All aboard, Margaret and Archie went off to the islet in the harbour to get some roots for their new garden then soon afterwards all turned in, for though it was a glorious looking evening it was perishingly cold and the stove, lit as soon as they anchored, had been very welcome.On Sunday they were again up early and found a dull overcast day. The Pilot, ashore for water, heard a poor weather forecastfrom a fishing board. On the strength of this they hurried breakfast and by  o’clock were away with a south-westerly breeze.The Skipper gave the first beacon a rap with the boom-end as they ran out of the harbour. The beat down to Ardlamontand thee ran the engine for five minutes to get out of a nasty lop. The sun came out for about five minutes but by the time they had reached the Carry Buoythe rain had started and it got heavier and heavier.The wind strengthened with the rain and they moved up very fast into Tighnabruaich Bay then up to Loch Riddon to anchor off the pier at Ormidale. As they passed Tighnabruaich they saw Torridon was on Fulmar’s mooring and they watched her crew panicking to get off before Fulmar arrived. They wondered what the Torridons said when they saw Fulmar pass on through and realised that they could have stayed where they were. As they passed Glen Caladh the new Jansi of Kames passed under a not very healthy-sounding engine.They had lunch and the stove was lit then Margaret and Archie went ashore to visit friends and when they came back they brought with them a big sack of coal . The late afternoon and evening were spent below talking and listening to the rain hammering on the deck.Monday morning it was dry but blowing hard. They got the anchor early and motored to the moorings. The sails were hoisted to dry them and St Roma came close by to make their number and at one time a big school of thrasher whales went through the Kyles heading east and at a great speed.About noon they went ashore for a visit to the hotel and for a run round the Ardlamont road . Back aboard they had lunch and soon after packed up and came home."},{"url":null,"title":"the cinema on wheels returns","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe screen machine will be rolling back into Mid Argyll at the end of the month.Bringing with it a host of movies for film fans the Screen Machine will be in Campbeltown Road car park in Tarbert from Wednesday January  to Thursday January  and Lochgilphead Resource Centre car park from Friday January  to Sunday February .Musical fantasy film Cats, based on the Andrew Lloyd Webber stage musical, features an ensemble cast including James Corden, Judi Dench, Jason Derulo, Idris Elba, Jenner Hudson, Ian McKellen, Taylor Swt, Rebel Wilson, and Francesca Hayward.Also known as Star Wars: Episode IX, Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker is an epic space-opera film.

So how did Britain look before human interventions  Dense forest  or open woodland Research now favours the latter.Plants and animals evolved in equilibrium for thousands of years before humans impacted the landscape. Essential to this balance were ‘keynote species’ including aurochs , bison and tarpan . By grazing, these animals trampled and eroded soils, dispersed seeds and redistributed nutrients, thereby keeping the forest open. This in turn encouraged growth of large trees while also creating numerous habitats and microenvironments for a wonderful ersity of plants and smaller animals.Now this bioersity is severely threatened by modern monocultures , and massive quantities of pesticides, fungicides, fertilisers and #weed# killers. It is no wonder that insect numbers have plummeted, many bird species are endangered and wild-flower meadows have virtually vanished. So could we recreate this natural order on unproductive land and save our wildle For Isabella Tree and her husband Charlie Burrell the answer is a resounding #yes#. In her book #Wilding#, Tree describes #wilding# their , acre farm at Knepp, West Sussex, that had been unproductive for years.They introduced longhorn cattle, Exmore ponies, deer and pigs but otherwise left well alone. Within months they saw a dference # most scrub was cleared, producing an explosion of plant and animal species.

This is a stunning route and the views over the Sound of Jura to the islands of Islay and Gigha are a rich reward for screaming muscles on the testing climbs.This will be the third year this increasingly popular event will take to the road. As it is a sportive, the Kilberry Loop is a non-competitive event and at just short of  miles long is perfect for a first-time competitor. Of course, for more competitive cyclists who want to push themselves or who are in training, the Kilberry Loop Sportive is a great event to get a personal best.The quicker cyclists in  managed the course # which has almost  metres of climbing # in under two hours, which is quick, and there are others who complete the course inside a comfortable four hours, so there is room for all abilities.Around  cyclists of all ages took part last year, with a couple of gentlemen in their early s and those in their twenties joining in # and organisers hope this year#s sportive will attract even more athletes.To make the event even more attractive Mid Argyll Cycling and Triathlon Club hopes to include race timing for the first time. And, for the third year, the Kilberry Loop Sportive is supported by British Cycling, the nation’s largest cycling organisation and national governing body for cyclesport, which actively helps and encourages people to get into cycling.If you’d like to sign up for this year’s Kilberry Loop Sportive or want more information visit the Mid Argyll Cycling and Triathlon Club website."},{"url":null,"title":"the voyages of the fulmar part four","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAs crew for our cruise we were lucky, as we have been for the four previous years, and were able to get both the Doctor and Pilot to come again. The Purser, however, found the lure of the theatre too great and she decided to spend her holidays working with a Repertory Company in Aberdeen.Again we were lucky in having a ready-made substitute in Chris Paterson, the Pilot’s we of nearly a year’s standing. We gave her the rank of Tanky – a piece of gunroom slang meaning the midshipman who trots around with the navigator or, in other words the Pilot’s Mate.As usual at the beginning of a cruise we got up early – .am – and quickly finished up our packing, loaded the car, shut up the house, and were on our road by ten minutes past seven. It was a fine bright morning with a light southerly breeze and quite promising though the weather forecast the night before had been not too cheerful. It was dead low water at Renfrew Ferry and as there was a big convoy of Army Transports crossing from north to south there was no delay in our getting across and at .am we were at the top of The Rest having had an easy and practically trafficless trip up Loch Lomond. Twenty minutes later we had Inveraray behind us.We called in at the BRS Depot at Lochgilpheadand collected our three boxes of stores and at ten to ten arrived at Crinan having passed several yachts already making their way east. The basin was busy with in it, amongst others, Arcturus, Vivien, Makoya, Boomerang, and Tookay, most of which were homeward bound. The Fulmar was lying at the back of the basin outside a motor boat and Vanda and as we unloaded the car we had a long carry round and everything was dumped on the basin wall before being taken aboard. Luckily it was turning into a lovely day. The only fly in the ointment was the poor Major – he had developed a paralysis of his back legs the day before and could do nothing but sit where put and look pitully about and only occasionally managed to drag himself a foot or two.The Mate and Bosun after being treated to tea on board Vivien got down to unpacking and stowing our gear and while they were about it the Doctor arrived with his gear and plentul supplies of Medical Comforts, a huge cake, packets of chocolate and a big box of chocolates. Dumping his stuff with the rest on deck he and the Skipper then went to the hotel and drank success to the cruise. They learnt that the night before had been a bit of a night and Arcturus was still showing its effects rather markedly.While the Mate continued the storing the Bosun got petrol and paraffin and the Tar went up to the farm for milk and at half past twelve they, with the Doctor, had lunch. Meanwhile the Skipper had gone to Ardrishaig and got a lot of fresh storesa new screwdriver, and meths. Being too early for the steamer he, after having had a beer at The Anchor, sat on a seat near the pier and had his lunch of six cookies and a sausage roll and listened to the Test Match on a portable set a man sharing the seat had with him .The Pilot and Tanky duly came off the steamer and by half past one all were aboard and the final gear stowing was completed. The car was parked on the steep hill between the farm and the basin and the batteries were disconnected then, while the Bosun, Doctor and Pilot, shted Fulmar to outside Melora on the east wall, the Skipper and Mate went up to the shop and got some strawberry tarts.At half past two the Karma came in from sea and we went into her water but had to wait in the lock for a wee motor boat whose owner had not turned up but was due soon. While we waited a man from a big Belfast motor boat that was lying in the basin spoke to the Skipper and complimented him on the sailing directions and thanked him for them. The Skipper did his best not to look smugly gratied. We filled in the waiting time by having a cup of coffee and one was handed up to the Doctor who was waiting to see us sail.At five past three we were away under engine being waved on our way by the Doctor and promising to be at Tobermory on the following Friday to pick him up. As the wind was light west-south-west we kept the motor going until we could fetch the Dorus Mor then up went the sails and beer was indulged in to mark the start of the cruise.We went nicely for a little but the wind fell very light. An unknown yacht and Mimosa were coming south and, against the flood tide, were making nothing of it. We passed close by the latter and spoke to John Hamilton then as we headed up for the Ardluing buoy we could see her being pushed slowly back to the northwards stern first. We, too, were being carried too far to the eastward and the engine went on to get us into the Scarba Sound stream and we kept it going till up to Leica Point where the wind came away again, this time from the true west.The tide rips at Fladda were in very good form and we fairly roared through the narrows and on up to Easdale but thereafter the breeze went flukey and light ying between north-west and south-west but, as the sun was shining brightly, it was very pleasant slipping along slowly in the smooth water. There was no sign of the usual heavy swell one expects to meet either side of Easdale Point. Away up to the north between Duart and Loch Don we could see half a dozen boats, led by Cerigo, making their way south.At six o’clock we heard a poor forecast promising rain and strong winds to come and listened for a while to the Test Match and heard of the collapse of the Australians in the st innings. The glass was slowly but steadily coming back and we feared the forecast was probably on the right lines.As we came round the north-west point of Seil Island and headed over for Dun Island off Puilladobhrain the wind died and the sea turned to glass so we got the sails down and stowed and the motor was started up.As we approached Puilladobhrain we saw a nished yawl coming down from the Oban direction under power and she passed in just ahead of us. As we were to learn later she was the Sol and at her helmwas a #bearded ancient# with a shock of white hair and a white beard. As we rounded the Fulmar Beacon we passed Kerlo coming out. In the anchorage were two motor boats and as we went slowly up to the south end of the pool we passed far too close to the bows of one of them owing to the Skipper misjudging the tidal drt. One of the crew came hurriedly out on to her forecastle and frowned at us as we slipped past with only inches to spare.It was dead calm when we anchored at half past seven but we were sorry to see that the drop in the glass was now being accelerated."},{"url":null,"title":"ormsary man in oman endurance event","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowAn Ormsary man is about to embark on the challenge of a letime as he cycles over ,km in a bid to be crowned BikingMan Oman .Lindsay McCrae, , will be one of only  cyclists to take part in BikingMan Oman, part of a series of ultra-endurance cycling events where competitors test their limits of strength and stamina.In , Lindsay bought a road bike through his employer#s cycle to work scheme and what started out as an active commute with a few local races thrown in for fun, soon became an opportunity to challenge himself in some of the toughest races on two wheels.His first big win came in the gruelling City to Summit duathlon from Edinburgh to Ben Nevis. The race was a half marathon of road running, km ride through Glen Coe then back on foot for the final off-road marathon summitting Ben Nevis and finishing in Fort William.Bitten by the cycling bug, he went on to win Revolve  at Brands Hatch race circuit, completing  miles and ascending , feet in  hours. Adding a second-place finish in last year#s BikingMan Portugal event against some of the sport#s top athletes means Lindsay has truly made his mark on the endurance scene.Lindsay said: #In my first few races I just wanted to see how I would get on but now I#m definitely in it to win it. I think I#m just stubborn and that#s what keeps me pushing on when other people take rest breaks.#Lindsay, who works in sales technical support for an aquaculture equipment company in Inverness, fits his training around his job, spending one to two hours on a turbo in his garage three or four times a week, with longer rides of two to five hours at the weekends. His father#s greenhouse in Ardrishaig proved to be a useful training venue to shelter from the elements over the Christmas holidays as he prepared for his biggest challenge yet.The BikingMan Oman race starts in Muscat, Oman#s capital city, before heading out on the Arabian Peninsula, through the Hajar Mountains, across the Ash Sharqiyah Desert and along coastal roads back to the capital. The competitors will climb over m during the race, that#s the equivalent of climbing Ben Nevis almost seven times.Unlike cyclists on the Tour de France, BikingMan athletes are unsupported so must carry all their food and equipment with them.For Lindsay, one of the biggest challenges will be the weather. #Temperatures at the moment are around - degrees but can reach higher which can be dficult to manage on the steeper sections of the course. That#s where my nutrition and hydration strategy will need to be spot on.#But in case it all sounds like hard work, Lindsay highlights one of the main benefits of his high-octane adventures: #The best part is definitely refuelling after the race. I will burn about , calories over the -hours of my target time, so my recovery will mainly involve eating cakes and other calorie rich foods.#Lindsay grew up on the Ormsary Estate and attended Lochgilphead High School. His family still live in the local area and will be following his adventures closely over the five days of competition.The race takes place from February  to  and Lindsay will cover ,km in a bid to take the title."},{"url":null,"title":"ceilidh to boost hall funds","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowToe-tapping tunes and a busy dance floor are on the cards for a Craignish ceilidh.Ardfern ceilidh band, All about the Cake, will take the stage and have the dancers reeling all night.

It was all so surprising.#I have never won anything for essentially just being myself.

As we stood about on deck while the dishes were being washed a boy from one of the motor boats passed in his dinghy. He was wearing blue shorts and red stockings which brought from the Pilot the remark: #In Brodickyou don’t wear red stockings you might just as well be in Lamlash.#All but the Skipper and Mate went ashore on Centre Island for a stroll. The Major was still completely paralysed in his hind quarters but he was full of spirit and when the Bosun held up his hind legshe galloped along. It was a quiet peaceful evening with a very light northerly breeze but it was distinctly chilly and there was a magnicentsomewhat lurid sunset. The shore party back aboard the Bosun took the Tar off in the dinghy and they landed on Eilean na Beithe and while the former explored the island the latter played on a shingly shore – it was long after dark when they ed.At half past ten we began to turn in and, as always on the first evening, this was a longer business then usual as pillows and blankets had to be allocated and pillowslips put on but by a quarter past eleven we were all in bed and shortly after that a light shower pattered on the deck. The problem of what to do with the Doctor’s mattress was solved by the Pilot double banking his bunk. We were all very glad to have had such a good day for the start.It was noticed that voices were still coming from the ladies’ cabin when the last of us in the main cabin fell asleep.The Tanky brought an innovation to the Fulmar # #Quickies# # a patent washing gadget that saved precious water.We had a dead quiet night with, as far as any of us knew, no rain but the forecast was not good, promising north to north-east winds, force  to  with frequent heavy showers. The glass had continued its steady drop. When we turned out, a light but cold north wind was blowing from a well broken up sky.We had a breakfast of bacon and eggs then the Bosun took the Major ashore for his walk. The latter was possibly a little better and was able to take a few steps on the deck, but ashore on the rough ground could do nothing. While they were ashore the big motor boat with the red-stockinged boy left after very nearly going ashore on Seil Island while getting his anchor aboard.At twenty past ten we were away under engine, but as soon as we were outside the sails went up to the north-easterly breeze and we set off for the Sound of Mull. There was no sign of the swell that is usually met south of Kerrera and we got along quite well, but we could not point any higher than a mile or so south of Loch Don. The Pilot went below and brewed a welcome cup of tea which warmed us up, then we took a tack right up to the south coast of Kerrera and had a close up view of Gylen Castle and the Skipper waxed historical.Putting about again we passed close south of the Potlid Island, but when we were about halfway across to Loch Don the wind died and the strong ebb began to force us south and about the same time the rain came on.The engine was started and we headed up for Duart, but our progress was pitully slow, and indeed at one period we but barely held our ground. The Lady Rock and Lismore Lighthouse seemed never to get any nearer closing. When the engine had run an hour we waited for the first sign of the old familiar falter but none came and we began to hope a cure for its stopping had been effected by replacing the HT coil.This change was a despairing effort made because it was the only thing we had not tried, though all the pundits declare it could not possibly be the cause. The engine would either go or not go, they said, and it would never startthe coil was defective. We got one scare when it staggered for a moment, but the Bosun, who was at the tiller at the time, said we had just passed though a big mass of floating seaweed and may have got some round our propeller.As we were to prove later the cure had been found and the engine ran impeccably all the cruise and the Skipper had a lot of unkind thoughts about all the many professional motor experts who had caused him a great deal of trouble, not a little acute anxiety and more than considerable expense through their failure to diagnose a not very obscure disease.As we came up to the Black Memorial Tower Leonora crossed our bows making for Oban and another yachtpassed close by south bound under engine though by this time quite a reasonable and, for then, favourable breeze was blowing from the north-east and our sails were drawing.We learnt later that the owner’s we would not allow a sail to be set under any conditions as long as she was aboard – a pity, we thought, as she certainly was a lovely job and we felt it would have been betterthe we had decided to stay ashore.At Duart we stopped the engine and were able to make good progress, but the rain got heavier and heavier and our sandwich lunch was taken below in relays. Then at about three with the turn of the tide the wind died completely and the engine was started again. Near the Grey Rocks we saw St Roma coming south under power so we altered course to intercept her then at slow speed turned back the way we had come for a few hundred yards while we exchanged news.We heard a thoroughly bad forecast at mid-day, the wind had gone, the rain was stotting in the glassy sea, and, though the glass had come back only a fraction, we decided to call it a day so, with the Bosun the only dissentient, made for Loch Aline. As we turned inshore at Ardtornish we saw Seewolf to the north of us, becalmed but heading south, and guessed she would be joining us later. Coming in, when between Morven Pier and the Ferry Pier, the Skipper held too close to the west shore and the bottom showed up suddenly far too clearly for our peace of mind and a quick sheer out was necessary.Through the narrows we turned to starboard and anchored at half past four in Kyle Bay in a flat calm and the rain coming down heavier than ever. Gratefully we realised that it was not quite as bitterly cold as it had been out in the Sound.Seewolf came in shortly after going very slowly and Hamish Lawrence called over that he had run a big end and was on his way to Oban for repairs and to hand over to brother Alec and his family. Soon after that we were joined by a small motor boat, Saguenay, flying a blue ensign which, in view of her size, the Skipper was sure she was not entitled to do and then a little later, while we were warming up with some coffee, Lindisfarne arrived and anchored close beside us with Guy Clephane in his usual tremendousform – he’s a proper marvel is Guy.Hamish Lawrence came across in his dinghy and came aboard for a gin and while he was there Guy called over inviting Tanky and the Pilot across to Lindisfarne then sent the Pilot back to Fulmar to fetch the Bosun. Hamish gone, the Skipper began to put nine inch tacklines into our line of flags as we had discovered at Rothesay at the Royal Clyde Centenary Regatta that without them our line was about fteen feet too short and we wanted them to be right for the Queen’s visit to Tobermory.When the Pilot came back he and the Bosun got the tents up as the rain was by then torrential.We had a supper of sausages and beans and while the dishes were being done the Bosun took the Major ashore.

We were, however, not allowed any biscuits with our tea as to have them would have meant opening a new box and broaching Alec Lawrence’s stores. The Tanky had not wanted anything but tea, but Hamish had given her a good strong gin which she tried to hide on a shelf behind her and it was only got rid of when the Pilot took it off her hands and quickly put it to its proper use. The Bosun was drinking beer and when he opened up the tin a goodly portion of it bubbled onto the fitted carpet in the cabin.On board Seewolf were, besides the two paid hands, Hamish’s mother and his two sisters. The old lady, well over eighty, was in grand form and waxed eloquent on #The old days# and the greatness of #Belshaft#. Also on board was a great big collie who was obviously petted and spoilt beyond measure and he behaved more like a lap dog than the great big clumsy creature he was.It was half past eleven before we went back to Fulmar all in one load with little enough freeboard for the dinghy considering the conditions. There was a nasty little lop on the water, the northerly wind was bitterly cold, and the rain was as heavy as ever. As quickly as possible we got below and into our warm bunks, not even the Bosun wasting any time about it, though he did read for some time after all the rest were sound asleep."},{"url":null,"title":"selkirk-gallery-strikes-gold-new-exhibition","story":"A BORDERS-based artist is bringing some Byzantine influence to a small museum in Selkirk.From next month gold will dominate Halliwells House as Alexandra Warren launches her exhibition in the Robson Gallery.Born in New York and raised in Greece, Alexandra developed a love of Cycladic sculpture and Byzantine icons.And despite spending the past  years in the Scottish Borders her work is still heavily influenced by the continuation of the Roman Empire.Her magnicent human figures and extensive use of gold leaf reflect a letimes influence.Alexandra told us: ldquoIrsquom very happy and honoured to have the opportunity of a solo exhibition in the lovely Robson Gallery in the historic Halliwellrsquos House, Selkirk.ldquoIrsquoll be presenting large figurative pieces and a series of small figurative paintings.\"Each piece is created with gold leaf, paint and shellac on wood , all inspired by Greek Byzantine icons - since I was lucky enough to have spent my childhood in Greece.rsquorsquoThe Traces of Gold exhibition opens on Saturday, March  and runs until the end of May.Assistant curator Phoebe Stewart said: ldquoWersquore delighted that Alexandra Warren is exhibiting with us in the Robson Gallery at Halliwellrsquos House.\"Her exquisite work, reminiscent of Greek Byzantine art, is a must-see.\""},{"url":null,"title":"across-pyrenees-melrose","story":"NEXT SundayMelrose Music Society continues its concert season with Across the Pyrenees: French and Spanish Music for the Saxophone.The concert, generously sponsored by the Tunnell Trust, will give the audience an exciting and colourful exploration of the cultural sympathy and musical styles of the two countries on either side of the Pyrenees.Saxophonist Jonathan Radford studied at Cheethamrsquos School of Music and the Conservatoire National Supeacuterieur de Musique de Paris with Claude Delangle, graduating in  with a Masters Degrees with distinction in both saxophone and chamber music.Pianist Eleanor Kornas, from Derbyshire, graduated with a First Class Honours Music degree from Cambridge University, and she was an Adami Award Junior Fellow in Piano Accompaniment at the Royal College of Music.

finances required for a new Peebles High School.Local Conservative council leader Shona Haslam and the local authoritys education portfolio holder Carol Hamilton hit out earlier this month at what they claimed was a financial snub from the Scottish Government.Their claims infuriated Deputy First Minister John Swinney, who reiterated Holyroods commitment to help following the school fire in November.But last weeks budget announcement by the Conservative Independent administration has now sparked a fresh row.According to the figures presented a new Peebles High will cost around pound million - with only pound million coming from an insurance settlement.The claim that there will be a pound million deficit has led to MSP Christine Grahame seeking clarication.The councils chief finance officer David Robertson has confirmed that Peebles High has an insurance value of pound million.And that the local authority is working with loss adjuster appointed by Zurich on a final settlement - expected to be made next month.But the correspondence has now thrown up more questions, with Ms Grahame demanding to know where a pound million deficit will occur.She told us: \"The claims being made by Councillor Haslam and her Tory colleagues are going to be massively concerning for the school community.\"As soon as the scale of the damage from the fire was apparent I wrote to SBC to check that insurance would cover the cost of rebuilding ndash I was told yes, it should.ldquoCllr Haslam has already been caught in one lie by saying the Scottish Government has refused funding for the rebuild when SBC have never requested it. And why would itit was covered by insurance ldquoIs it the case that the insurance company has rejected a claim for new build and will pay only for reinstatement of the damaged areas  If that is the case then she should come clean. She is claiming the school faces a pound million deficit.\"The only explanation I can offer is that this is the cost of replacement of damaged areas but on this Ms Haslam is silent.ldquoI await her response, but in the interim I would ask her seriously to desist in trying to play politics with this to get a disingenuous hit on the Scottish Government and SNP.\"It serves no one and is unnecessarily causing genuine concern amongst the local community when efforts should be going into ing stability and normality to students, parents and staff.Scottish Borders Councils administration has committed to delivering replacement secondary schools in Galashiels, Hawick and Peebles in the next six years.Councillor Haslam believes that an improved replacement school for Peebles school along with using parts of the remaining building needs to be factored in to the calculations.In a response to Christine Grahame, she said: \"As you are well aware the insurance will only pay to replace what was lost.\"This will still result in a music department in a windowless basement and a science department in labs that are not fit for purpose.\"Despite this our school continues to produce first class scientists and musicians but I believe they deserve more and better.\"We had planned to replace Peebles High School in the next  years. To only do part of the school now would be a  economy and impact on future plans to replace outdated buildings.\"I know how keen you are to see a new High School delivered in Galashiels so am perplexed as to why you are so against Peebles getting the same facilities  Perhaps you could clary  I am certainly not satisfied with half measures for our young people.\"We are also extremely keen to ensure that other towns developments are not held back as a result of this fire. So Galashiels and Hawick remain on schedule to be delivered. This means that our Conservative led council will be delivering three new High schools, two new primary schools in the next six years, quite an achievement as I am sure you will agree.\"This is held

It afforded him an invaluable insight into the business, supplemented by day release classes at the nearby Scottish College of Textiles in Galashiels.Additional work placements were undertaken at Ballantyne Sportswearrsquos Caerlee Mills in Innerleithen and at another family-run mill in Dalkeith. By his mid-s, Roly had been appointed mill manager at Ballantynersquos March Street Mills in Peebles.In  the Peebles operation was taken over by DawsonLtd ndash later to become Dawson International plc ndash before a restructuring of the Dawson empire in the mid-s saw Robert Noble Ltd take over as the new management company at March Street Mills.By now Mr Brett has risen to become the firmrsquos production director, and a further change of ownership came in the late s when Robert Noble was sold to Yorkshire-based textile company Moorhouse  Brook. Shortly afterwards Robert Noblersquos new managing director resigned, and Mr Brett was appointed his successor, remaining in post with the company until his retiral in  at the age of .Richard Ryley, a sales director with Robert Noble who worked alongside Mr Brett for  years, described him as a great colleague and incredibly approachable. ldquoHe was respected and well-liked not only by workers at the mill, but by associates in the textile trade throughout the United Kingdom and beyond.ldquoHe possessed great charm, but never shied away from making big or tough decisions. He was a wonderful mentor, and I will always be grateful for his sound advice and the support he willingly gave to myself and to all members of staff.In  he was appointed Deacon of the Scottish Borders Manufacturersrsquo Corporation, later serving as a Walkerburn Community Councillor, and for a time was a director of Live Borders, the culture, sport and leisure trust for the Scottish Borders.However, without a doubt the most important event in Roly Brettrsquos le was his marriage to Betty Taylor, at that time working as an auditor with Edinburgh firm Rolleston Somerville. They first met by chance, as Rolyrsquos cousin Alastair happened to be going out with Bettyrsquos flatmate Stroma.Love quickly blossomed, and Roly and Betty were married in Strathdon Church, Aberdeenshire, on September , . After honeymooning in Perthshire, the couple set up home in a rented cottage at Cardrona, then at Kaimend, Innerleithen, before a final move in  to the family home at Caberston House, Walkerburn.The couplersquos four sons - Chris, Jeremy, Mike and Alex ndash were all schooled locally and shared their fatherrsquos passion for sport and motor cars. Family le meant everything to Roly, with Betty and the boys always at the centre of his le.His exploits on the cricket field matched his business achievements. A member of the England Schools side that included future test stars Mike Brearley and Richard Hobbs, the young all-rounder turned down a county contract with Lancashire and opted instead to play his cricket north of the border.An elegant batsman and skilful off-spin bowler, Rolyrsquos cricket career included spells with the Dunfermline, Kelso and Selkirk clubs. He captained Selkirk on their ground-breaking tour to Barbados in , and the following year led the Souters to a Border League  Border Knock-out Cup double.Once his playing days were over, Roly qualied as a cricket coach, helping steer the South of Scotland u- side to its first Scottish Championship.A familiar adversary during his cricketing career was Gala wicket-keeper Ronnie Murray. ldquoRoly was a breath of fresh air when he first arrived on the Border scene, said Ronnie. ldquoHe was an excellent all-rounder, a true sportsman and also great fun to be with.ldquoHe played in a very good Kelso team that included players like John Rutherford and Michael Taylor, before helping inspire Selkirk to a string of successes in the s. You could always depend on Roly to anchor an innings, while he had a knack of picking up quick wickets when he came on to bowl.Golf was another sport at which he excelled, twice winning the Woollen Merchants  Manufacturers Cup, competed for annually at Sunningdale. The ornate trophy is kept on display at the British Golf Museum in St Andrews.As well as being a member of Peebles Golf Club, he also held memberships with Luffness Golf Club in East Lothian and Port Salon Golf Club in Donegal, close to Rathmullan where his father moved after retiring from the army.An interest in classic cars led to the ownership of a number of models being kept at Walkerburn over the years, including a vintage Daimler, Porsche and Mercedes SL.In  Mr Brett was diagnosed with frontal lobe dementia, a progressive condition affecting behaviour, personality and speech.As the disease began to take its inevitable toll, the love and support shown by Betty, members of his family and close friends , in addition to the kindness and understanding shown by staff in the BGHrsquos Cauldshiels Ward and at Murray House, Kelso, ensured Roly received the best possible care in his final months.Mr Brett is survived by Betty and their four sons, his sister Jo, brother Will, daughters-in-law Denise, Shona, Debbie and Mumba, and by eight grandchildren.A service of thanksgiving for Roly Brettrsquos le will be held in the Borders Crematorium, Melrose, on Tuesday, March , at pm.J.D.R.S."},{"url":null,"title":"dates-confirmed-2020-innerleithen-music-festival","story":"ORGANISERS have announced that this years Innerleithen Music Festival will take place during the weekend of August -to-.Now in its th year the festival continues to provide a great  for fantastic music in the heart of the Borders.True to its tradition there will be events taking place across multiple venues in Innerleithen.And, as usual, much of the activity will be centred at the Vale Club where lsquoLive and Localrsquo will be staged over the three days.Andy Wright from Innerleithen Music Festival said: \"The Innerleithen Music Festival has a strong reputation amongst artists and audience alike.\"Bands and singers approach us throughout the year enquiring about performance opportunities.\"Over the years we have showcased hundreds of bands and solo performers from across Scotland and farther afield, including such household names as Eddie Reader, Capercaillie, Skipinnish as well as traditional music favourites Phil and Aly.\"Last year one of our largest audiences was for local musician and rising star Tommy Ashby who is currently carving out a great reputation on the national music scene.\"Ahead of the festival this summer a fundraising concert will be held in the Union Club on Saturday, March .Already confirmed for next months concert are Redwood Rejects, Soul , All the Angels, Bobs Boiler Room and Dylan Paterson.Tickets go on sale from lsquoThe Hub on the High Streetrsquo, Innerleithen on March ."},{"url":null,"title":"gareths-newspaper-snaps-help-replace-peebles-high-camera","story":"A local photographer who captured haunting images of firefighters tackling the blaze at Peebles High School has donated the profits of his pictures to the school.Award winning photographer Gareth Easton was in Peebles when his children, both pupils at Peebles High, called to say the school was on fire.This week he spoke to reporter and former colleague Hilary Scott, about how he turned his pictures of the pupils running from the burning school, into an image of students with beaming smiles.INNERLEITHEN photographer Gareth Easton has snapped murder scenes, G riots, drugs raids, and even gambled with his own le aboard a trawler by capturing the danger inherent in commercial fishing ndash which netted him a national award.Never did he imagine that his next big job would be photographing the inferno of the secondary school both his children attend.ldquoOn the day of the fire I was working in Peebles.

You should self-isolateyou have travelled to any of the following places:to Hubei province in China in the last  daysto Iran, areas of northern Italy in lockdown or \"special care zone\" areas in South Korea since  Februaryto other parts of mainland China or South Korea, Thailand, Japan, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore, Malaysia or Macau in the last  days and have a cough, high temperature or shortness of breathto other parts of northern Italy , Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos or Myanmar since  February and have a cough, high temperature or shortness of breathHow do I self-isolate The best place to self-isolate yourself is obviously your own home, where you should stay for the duration of your quarantine.This means you shouldnt go to work, school or public areas, and not use any public transport or taxis.If you need something from outside your home, you canask friends, family members or delivery services to carry out errands for you.But youre advised to try to avoid visitors to your home, though it is OK for friends and family or delivery drivers to drop off food and other supplies.WhatIm not at home Of course, its possible that any coronavirus symptoms could arise while youre out and about.If this is the case, the official advice insists that you do not go to a GP surgery or hospital, as that could spread the virus inordinately.Instead, you should try to find a room to isolate yourself away from others. Ask for helpyou need to, but try to stay at least two metres away from other people.Open a window for ventilationyou can, but otherwise touch objects and surfaces as little as possible, and call  for advice.If you find yourself on public transport and become unwell, you should go back to your home or place of residence immediately.How long should I self-isolate for ,params: .pushYou may need to do

lsquoself-isolatingrsquo, can my employer deduct my pay for the time I am away from work This will depend on the facts.If you are otherwise fit for work but are taking precautionary steps by lsquoself-isolatingrsquo, technically you are not entitled to pay.However, it is good practice for employers not to deduct pay in these situations.An employee would usually be lsquoself-isolatingrsquo on the advice of a doctor and it is sensible for an employer to show understanding in order to fulfil health and safety obligation and maintain good staff relations.In addition, to withhold pay could encourage an employee toto work prematurely which might potentially risk spreading the virus.Many employers can allow temporary flexible working arrangements where employees can work from home.What are my rightsIrsquom quarantined and my boss refuses to pay my salary If you have contracted the virus, normal rules around sick pay will apply and you will either receive Statutory Sick Payor contractual sick pay.If your employer has specically told you not to come into the workplace as you have been in or to an affected area, you would ordinarily receive your normal pay.What is unclear is a situation where an employee remains off work as they have been quarantined or recommended to isolate themselves.In those circumstances, it would not strictly be considered as sick as the reason for the absence isnrsquot because the employee is unwell and therefore has no entitlement to sick pay.There may be a contractual clause relating to such circumstances and how this time off should be paid.In the absence of any contractual clause, the position will be that the leave will be unpaid .Can I be forced to use my annual leaveI am lsquoself-isolatingrsquo You cannot be forced to use

are being forced to take.For example, to force you to use  daysrsquo holiday, your employer must give you  daysrsquo notice.Again, this may risk good staff relations and given that employers and employees will likely be unfamiliar in dealing with a health crisis of this magnitude, it will be good practice for both parties to mutually agree how leave will be taken.,params: .pushWill I be paid

of the biggest in Scotland, with about , patients.Mr Beattie said: ldquoFrom correspondence with local constituents, it was clear to me that action needed to be taken to remedy the ongoing issues in relation to Riverside Medical Practice.ldquoI have spoken with Jeane Freeman, the Cabinet Secretary for Health and Sport, who is now working closely with NHS Lothian to ensure that a solution is

We felt it was a really positive opportunity to discuss many of the changes that have happened in Musselburgh over the last few years to stabilise and develop primary care services.ldquoIt is really important for us at Riverside to understand the views of the community we serve, which can be hugely supportive in improving services. For example, feedback on our old phone system helped us to understand the issues that our patients were experiencing and led to us developing a new telephone system that was more suitable for our patientsrsquo needs as well as those of the practice.ldquoRiverside, along with other practices in the county, are collaborating with and supporting East Lothianrsquos Health and Social Care Partnershiprsquos plan to grow health services to meet the needs of a growing population.ldquoWe remain keen to improve our engagement and communication with the local community, and the meeting was a positive step to build links with local groups.ldquoWe are grateful to the community council representatives and local councillors for taking the time to visit us at Riverside Medical Practice and we look forward to developing a closer and collaborative relationship with them.An East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership spokesperson said: ldquoWe thought the meeting with Riverside and the community council was very positive.

She was full of old stories. She had come to East Lothian when she was a young girl and lived there ever since. But she brought with her the stories she had been told when she was wee. They were tales told to her by her grandfather, a crofter from the west of Scotland, who had moved his family to the north east in hard times. Her grandfather had shared the stories collected by folklorist Donald Mackenzie, who wrote Wonder Tales from Scottish Myth and Legend.Now, in her old age, she loved sharing her version of these stories with her grandchildren. They were a mix of old legends and she knew that there were dferent versions. But the version told to her by her grandfather was of course her favourite.Her grandchildren settled around her fireplace and sipped their hot chocolate in anticipation. Their gran always sat in silence for a moment before speaking. It was asshe was waiting for a curtain to raise in their imagination.Then she began her story.ldquoBeria was the queen orsquo the dark times, the ruler of winter. She wis tall and strang. In fact she carried a great hammer, with which she made the Scottish mountains. She had a fearsome temper and looked scary, with one eye and lang white hair. There are mony stories aboot her, this is just ane orsquo them.ldquoYe see, while she ruled winter, at this time orsquo year, the signs orsquo spring began tae appear, and she felt she wis loosing her power. People grew less feart orsquo her and began tae resist her power. They looked forrit tae the arrival orsquo the summer queen, who wis carsquod Bride. She was the bringer of light and plentul times, and so people loved her and looked forward to her arrival. Beria was jealous orsquo her.ldquoThis is why Beria kept Bride a prisoner. She made Bride work hard and kept her in ragged claes.ldquoLike Cinderella! exclaimed the youngest, excitedly. Her gran smiled and nodded.ldquoBut Bride managed tae escape, helped by the man she loved, who became known as King Angus, and ever since people have celebrated that day. It wis oan February , but many years ago the calendar changed, and sae itrsquos February  that I celebrate Bridersquos day.ldquoAnd sae Bride wis free and wore new claes, which were bright and colourful. She set aboot sowing the seeds orsquo spring. She sprinkled snawdraps, and the blossom was encouraged tae bloom. The first bird tae sing in celebration of Bridersquos freedom was a wee linnet. Its sweet singing filled the air with the sound orsquo spring, and ever since folk huv carsquod the linnet lsquoThe Bird orsquo Bridersquo.ldquoBut what about Beria, wasnrsquot she mad that Bride escaped  asked one of her grandchildren.ldquoIrsquom coming tae that. She wis indeed. When she heard that Bride had escaped, she was furious, her rage knew no limits! She knew that this would end her power. She tried tae capture her again but she fled with Angus. Sae Beira took her great hammer and struck the ground with it, making ice and frost tae kill the grass and flowers that had dared tae start grawing. But the linnets continued to sing and this encouraged mair birds tae sing as well. It became a chorus.ldquoEnraged, Beria collected her servants, who were hags who rode on shaggy goats, while she rode on a huge black steed. They raised storms and winds tae silence the birds, and tae blow ower trees and strip them orsquo branches.ldquoThen she pursquod dark clouds ower the land, and ripped them open, sae cauld rain drenched the land, destroying food and making the soil drookit, killing livestock and ruining peoplersquos hames.ldquoWow, Beria was angry, and pretty mean too, said a grandchild.ldquoAye, she wis. She wanted tae keep winter going sae her power would last longer. She whipped up a gale wi a wind sae cauld and sharp it felt like a bird pecking at yer skin. It lasted fir mair than a week!ldquoWi arsquo these storms fishermen couldnae fish, the food orsquo folk was being wasted as the fodder and winter stores were ravaged by the storms.ldquoBut then March arrived and mair light filled the days. This increased the strength orsquo Bride, the summer queen, who ed with her husband Angus to sow mair seeds orsquo spring.ldquoIn a last desperate attempt tae keep her power, Beria took three days orsquo deep winter she hud kept aside, and used them tae bring blizzards and snowstorms. She coated the land in a white freezing blanket.ldquoBut after these three days, the winter queenrsquos power wis spent. Bride and Angus once again ed, riding through the countryside, chasing awa the hags and sowing spring wherever they went. The birds sang their heids off.ldquoIt wis arsquo over for Beria, at least for this winter. She fled, throwing her hammer underneath a holly tree, which is why nae grass grows under a holly tree. She hid for a while on top orsquo a mountain on the Isle of Skye, carsquod Beinn na Caillich. But she was weak now, and when the days and nights became equal inshe knew her reign was over.ldquoSae she retreated to the Green Island tae drink frae the magic well orsquo youth, tae replenish her strength.

All that wee and poor Scotland would be able to afford would be wall-to-wall White Heather Club, interspersed with speeches from Alex Salmond.You can see where Irsquom going with this, canrsquot you :He acts the clown but Boris Johnson is a Bolshevik about powerThe former BBC Director-General, John Birt, said that Scots might not be able watch the BBC at all. Well, as it turns out perhaps no one will. At the weekend No Ten declared war on the BBC, saying that timersquos up for the licence fee.ldquoWersquore going to whack them, said a Government source, quoted in The Sunday Times. Probably been watching too many episodes of The Sopranos.The future is subscription. People wonrsquot pay a video poll tax in the age of Netflix, wersquore told. The BBC should sink or swim in the market ndash probably the former. First casualties will be local and ldquoregionalldquo servicesWersquore assured that this has nothing whatever to do with Andrew Neilrsquos lecture on the PMrsquos integrity when he refused to appear on his show during the General Election campaignNow, itrsquos not yet clear that the Government will get away with this. Many Tory MPs remain friends of the Beeb .Contrariwise, there are many independence supporters who hate the ldquoYoon BBC so much they are egging Mr Johnson on. There is a broad coalition of contempt for the BBC.This extends from most Labour Party members, who took to social media to condemn Laura Kuenssberg for being a Tory spokesperson, to the Daily , which believes the BBC is owned by Gina Miller and the Peoplersquos Vote campaign.It was ever thus. The BBC always gets both ideological barrels. But the point is that all this makes a nonsense of the claim that only by remaining in the UK could Scots still tune in to David Attenborough. Hersquos all over Netflix anyway.And the curious thing is that now there actually is a Scottish dedicated TV channel it is not filled with mawkish sentimentality and tartan kitsch. Most of the Scottishprogramming is rather good. Documentaries like Poverty Safari presented by the rapper Loki, for example ndash something the UK BBC would never have done.And therersquos quality. The drama Guilt was as good as anything on Netflix. Scotland has a unique character that is well suited to sardonic noir.The BBC is only the latest example of Scotland potentially losing great British institutions that were supposedly threatened onlywe voted Yes. Remember Royal Bank of Scotland saying that it would up sticks after independence Well, without a trace of irony, or self-awareness, RBS has just renamed itself the National Westminster Bank, in recognition of the fact that  per cent of its business is in the South.Another pillar of the Scottish financial sector, Standard Le, also threatened to leave Scotlandthere was a Yes vote in . It has now shted pound billion in assets to Dublin.Scots have a highly-developed sense of self-deprecating humour. Just as well. Because otherwise we might get very angryndash like those French demonstrators in Yellow Vests. Wersquore used to it. Like the weather.But yoursquod think that there would be just a hint of contrition from those nominally Scottish institutions which sought so recklessly to damage Scotlandrsquos reputation and national self-confidence five years agoRBS was already effectively a London bank in , with the majority of its operations in England. The threatened departure was contrived for political purposes.The same goes for Standard Le. Without a momentrsquos reflection, it has shted a number of operations to Ireland the better to remain in the European Union.I need hardly remind readers that Scots were told that only by voting No in , could Scotland be sure of remaining in the European Union. David Nish, the boss of Standard Le said almost exactly that. Many Scots believed him. When the history of Scottish independence is written, that will be up there with the poll tax and Margaret Thatcher.The list of broken referendum promises goes on and on. ldquoAs near a federal system as possible in the UK was how the former Labour PM, Gordon Brown, described the constitutional future should Scotland reject independence. That was the substance of The Vow published by the Daily Record, in cod vellum, and signed by all three UK party leaders.Well, the powers of Holyrood have been substantially curbed in the UK Withdrawal Act. The UK Government, when it can be bothered, insists that those powers over agriculture, fisheries, environment and so on will come winging back once Boris has Got Brexit Done.Anyone who believes that hasnrsquot been listening. Scotland will be allowed to administer these s, but standards will be set by the UK the better to facilitate trade deals with countries like America. Similarly, Michael Goversquos promise that Scotland would get powers over immigration after Brexit look ridiculous now.Itrsquos enough to make you want another referendum. Nicola Sturgeon keeps saying that Indyref will happen later this year. But that is a heroic case of hope triumphing over experience, or reality itself.The joke is on us. There wonrsquot be another legal referendum now that Mr Johnson is home with an -seat majority in Westminster.It feels ashistory itself is trolling Scotland, seeing just how much humiliation Scots are prepared to take.:Boris-induced surge evokes electric shock experimentEnglish people werenrsquot so docile and biddable. When Brexiters were confronted with Project Fear, they scoffed and voted regardless for what they regarded as independence from Brussels.Scots were given an offer they couldnrsquot refuse in : a borderless independence within Europe. Unfortunately, we did refuse it. And wersquore stuck with it.And herersquos the kicker.

Imagine the nations bus routes do turn into a network of mobile gang huts, full of boozed up teens terrorising elderly passengers and swinging from the fold up seats where buggies with innocent bairns are meant to fit.At least theyd be off the streets, eh In my extensive bus experience, wild behaviour is normally the preserve of the adults aboard. Last week on my journey there were glorious scenes between a beleaguered mum and her grown up son. He insisted he would sit upstairs while she complained her knees wouldnt allow her to join him.From half way along the bottom deck she screamed up to him, \"Get yersel down here.\" He would not budge and so the conversation was carried on between them as though they were in the house and he was shut in his bedroom, she insisting he come down for his tea.\"Ye cannae choose yer family, eh \" she aimed at a hipsterish young man behind her, in an attempt to strike up some bonhomie. He would have absolutely none of it and kept his gaze focused on his phone screen. Beautully done.While I do not share the naysayers concerns that the Scottish Governments plans for a National Concessionary Travel scheme for those aged  and under will lead to moving hotbeds of anti-social behaviour, I do think this policy has aimed and missed.Or, perhaps, aimed and not landed at the feet of enough people.Of course, its a refreshing change to be using the bus itself to send a message rather than sticking meaningless messages on the sides of buses.Bus use has fallen by  per cent over the past five years, data released this week by the Scottish Government shows. At the same time, car travel increased with a record number - three million - of cars now registered in Scotland.Overall, journeys made by public transport have fallen by eight million over the past year.People have a peculiar snobbery about bus travel that they do not have about trains. That quote, oft attributed to Margaret Thatcher, about bus travel being a sign of personal failure casts a long shadow. And there arent leagues of bus spotters hanging about depots in the manner of locomotive lovers.There seems to be a notion that buses are for the working classes, and not the respectable ones. Those who choose other modes of transport already seem to think the bus is a wild west wilderness and thats before the marauding young folk are added to the mix.Bus clientele, though, are attracted by convenience. Not everyone lives near or within walking distance of a train station but most streets have a bus route to serve them.Certainly the customer base is not attracted by a bargain. To travel by train from my home to Glasgow city centre is pound. for a . To travel the same distance by bus is pound. Thats a signicant sum to travel just over one mile.When I moved into my flat in  the bus fare for a single was p and remained so for over a year. Its now pound., a  per cent increase.Im sure the operator would point out that I can get the fare marginally cheaper by downloading its app and purchasing tickets that way but to do so would involve buying an updated smart phone, which Im not inclined to do. Nor should I be - bus travel should be affordable.While the bus network is in the control of private companies, it will always be designed to serve profit over people. In Glasgow there have been several services threatened with the axe and others axed completely. First Glasgow says these routes are not well used enough to continue but, for those who do use them, they are a leline.Were I still a teenager, the new concessionary scheme would be nothing to mebecause the bus route that serves the area of Coatbridge where I used to live has been stopped by First Glasgow. I used to take it in one direction to get to school and in the other direction to get into Glasgow for work.It was vital because the local train line didnt - and didnt until  - run on a Sunday, which is extraordinary when you stop to think about it.The route that was stopped, the , was the only direct service from that part of Coatbridge in to Glasgow, the only direct service up to Airdrie and also served Monklands University Hospital, all the local supermarket, the main GP surgery and the town centre. Now the area is served by a selection of shuttle buses, some that dont run on a Sunday, some that take long weekends off and some that run once an hour.I cant imagine its a unique case but it does illustrate the need for buses to be publicly owned and designed to serve the public rather than monetise them.If one of the main aims of the National Concessionary Travel scheme is to improve the environment then extend it to make bus travel free for all. Driving is infinitely more convenient than taking the bus so its no wonder that car journeys are on the increase.Buses are slow and expensive. To get to a recent hospital appointment I could have driven in  minutes for free. The bus takes  minutes and costs pound. for an all day ticket. Where is the inducement to spend nearly a fiver to sit for more than an hour on a bus when you can do acommute in comfort for  minutes \"Environment benefits\" are an opaque concept to many commuters. So far government and local council policy has been to force drivers away from their cars by punishment - raising parking costs, say - when motorists may respond more to luring than force.Raising fuel duty to make car use more unattractive is the right way to go but, once out of their cars, drivers need to know that money is being invested in a coherent, high quality and extensive bus service that preferably runs  hours.Free travel for children is a solid start but the next step needs to be ensuring bus travel is still an attractive proposition once they hit the age of ."},{"url":null,"title":"msps-back-budget-tories-say-free-bus-plan-con","story":"THE Scottish budget has cleared its first parliamentary stage amid taunts the Scottish Greens have been ldquoplayed like a fiddle in their deal with the SNP.MSPs voted  to  on the general principles of the Bill for the   budget, with the second and final votes expected to be a formality next week.It followed SNP Finance Secretary Kate Forbes and Green co-leader Patrick Harvie announcing on Wednesday they had struck a deal to get the package approved.After telling MSPs three weeks ago that the poundbn at the Governmentrsquos disposal had been fully allocated, Ms Forbes found an extra poundm at the last minute to bring the Greens on board.This includes poundm for councils, poundm for the police, and poundm to develop a free bus travel scheme for under-s starting in January .In a lively debate before the vote, the Tories said ldquoPatrick the poodle and his party had been taken in by a ldquocon trick, with the bus travel scheme far from certain to be delivered.Tory MSP Donald Cameron said: ldquoWhat have the Greens received  Theyrsquove received funding to support preparations to introduce concessionary farespossible, subject to research and due diligence.

While the circumstances that leylandii are planted will not be conclusive as to whether there is a hedge, it is a relevant consideration.\"The judge said: \"It may well be, as the petitionersubmitted, that woodland is sometimes planted in discernible rows.\"\"The pattern of the planting in rows was nonetheless a relevant consideration in discerning whether the trees were a hedge. Hedges are generally planted in a line of some sort,\" she said.It was argued on behalf of Mr Rizza that the reporter was irrational in ordering the identied trees to be cut back to two metres without considering the effect of one row on another and in concluding that the height reduction would not signicantly alter the privacy or outlook of the hedge owner.But Lady Carmichael said: \"The reporter was deciding what action was required to remedy the adverse effects of the height of the hedge on the enjoyment of  Drummond Circus that its occupant could reasonably expect to have.\"\"Having reached the conclusion she did as to the adverse effects, it was reasonably open to her to decide that the appropriate remedy was to require the whole hedge be reduced in height,\" said the judge.Mr and Mrs Niven originally applied to Highland Council in  seeking that a high hedges notice be issued.Mr Rizza subsequently appealed to the Scottish Ministers who appointed the reporter and she gave her decision in December .The reporter concluded that the high hedge was a barrier to light which impacted on the garden and the windows of rooms at the rear of  Drummond Circus.ENDS"},{"url":null,"title":"thousands-due-join-greta-thunberg-bristol-climate-strike","story":"Bristol Youth Strike  Climate will begin with speeches, including one by the -year-old, on College Green at am.Greta is due to join protesters, including school pupils, on a march through Bristol city centre.Heading for the UK!

This is the best day weve had, I hope they come back again.\"Those with a visual impairment found the ponies to be really interactive, and because they were quite big they were easier to see than other smaller therapy pets.While the young service users and their families are usually dealing with sensory impairment from birth, the older group are generally learning to cope with age-related sight and or hearing loss.Both groups experience challenges which, without support, may result in low mood, loss of confidence and social isolation.Sharing this Joyful Ponies visit enabled these erse age groups to communicate, compare experiences and learn from each other, while benefiting from the mood-enhancing and confidence-building session.Sadly, the ponies couldnt stay for tea but the young and elderly group members had a great time talking about their experience over refreshments after the visit.For more information about NESS visit www.nesensoryservices.org.data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Judges James Taylor , Ronnie Kelmanand Caroline de Rouffignac \"  , Ronnie Kelmanand Caroline de Rouffignac \"  North East Scotland Food  Drink Awards finalists revealed viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\""},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"February ,  at : amA Shetland man, jailed last week for illegally recording court proceedings at Kirkwall Sherf Court, has gone on hunger strike, claiming he is “effectively a political prisoner.# Hill was sentenced to two months imprisonment for contempt of court, after refusing to delete the recordings.

More, of course, needs to be done, not leastwe are to meet the challenge of the climate emergency, but I have no doubt that farmers in Orkney and across the country are up for meeting that challenge.“In order to be able to do that, however, they will need access to a broad range of measures, reflecting the dferent circumstances and approaches to agriculture across the country. This will allow each to make a meaningful contribution to reducing emissions, improving sustainability while safeguarding a sector that plays a crucial role within our economy.“It is also important that any future trade agreements negotiated hold food imports to the same high standards we require of our domestic food producers. It makes no sense to demand standards of our own farming sector that we are prepared to ignore when it comes to those importing food into the UK. This is not an unreasonable demand from the NFUS and I am pleased it is one that enjoys cross-party support, including from Scottish Ministers.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

From the former perspective, the big positive about the Scots so far this year is that they have conceded the fewest tries and the least points of any of the six teams. Few would have predicted that a month ago.Hamish Watson got the nod for man of the match against the Italians, another indication that the open-side flanker is back to his very best. Others to stand out were loose-head prop Rory Sutherland, the find of the tournament, and Watson’s back row colleague Jamie Ritchie.Elsewhere at the weekend France proved just too good for Wales in Cardf, and are now the only side left with the chance of a Grand Slam. The French have been very impressive this season and have about five or six players who would be in a combined Six Nations team so far.At Twickenham there was a typical battle between two outfits who prefer brute strength to artistry. What little flair was evident mostly emanated from Ireland in the latter stages, but England had got so far ahead by half-time the game was really over.Sadly once again we had a referee, this time Jaco Peyper, seemingly unwilling to penalise a side which is consistently in breach of the offside rule.Irish fly-half Jonny Sexton, who had an awful game himself including making a complete mess of two kicks, could regularly be seen complaining to the referee. That even included pointing to players who were blatantly in the wrong place, but Peyper refused to take action.Only midway through the second half, when the Irish were all but buried, did Peyper appear to notice that so many white shirts were lying on the wrong side of the ball. I found that absolutely baffling.A week on Sunday Scotland will be in action again, this time back at Murrayfield against leaders France. That could be close, with the French chasing a clean sweep and the Scots still harbouring hopes of finishing third or fourth in the table.While the Finn Russell saga shows no sign of sorting itself out, and Adam Hastings likely to continue at number  despite being out of touch against Italy, it would be good to have a couple of players back from injury. The presence of either winger Darcy Graham and lock back row Sam Skinner would strengthen things in both departments.Team of the tournament so far: Elliot DalyJonny May , Robbie Henshaw , Gael Fickou , Mattia BelliniRomain Ntamack , Antoine DupontC J Stander , Jamie Ritchie , Gregory AlldrittAlun Wyn Jones , Bernard Le RouxRory Sutherland , Julien Marchand , Joe Marler .: : : : : : : :Two of my favourite footballers, in my opinion the greatest ever strikers from their respective international sides, celebrated their th birthdays over the past week.Last Thursday it was the turn of Jimmy Greaves, who sadly is not in good health having suffered a serious stroke five years ago.A documentary on BT Sport that evening covered all aspects of Greaves’ career, ranging from his early days at Cha, a big money move to AC Milan, theto Tottenham Hotspur, the shock transfer to West Ham and his final days in non-league football.The programme also touched on the hepatitis which he suffered from during the - season. He was warned that he would lose up to a yard in pace as a result of the illness, but bounced back with four goals in an away victory over Norway.Then came the  World Cup, an injury against France and Greaves’ omission from the side for the final. To see his replacement Geoff Hurst, who was an inferior player, score a hat trick and ultimately receive a knighthood, must have been dficult for Greaves. But typically he was magnanimous about the issue.At the end of his West Ham career Greaves succumbed to severe alcoholism, which brought his contract to an end. After four years away from the game he made a comeback with Barnet among other non-league clubs, and although still impressive his best was long gone.Greaves later forged a new career in television, first with Star Soccer and then more famously as the funny half of the Saint and Greavsie double act with Ian St John.I have to laugh when the likes of Gary Lineker and Harry Kane are sometimes compared to Greaves. Watching old footage reveals how a good number of his goals involved running from just inside the opposition half, beating two or three players and then rounding the keeper. Comparison  There really is none.On Monday it was the th for Denis Law, my boyhood hero and favourite player of all time.Law has also not enjoyed the best of health, suffering from debilitating eye problems and also from prostate cancer. But happily he appears to be in reasonable fettle at the moment, well enough to appear at the recent BBC Sports Personality of the Year event and attend former Manchester United team mate Harry Gregg’s funeral at the weekend.They say it is not always advisable to meet your heroes, but I would gladly pay money to interview Law.: : : : : : : :It was reported last week that Neil Fenwick is in the frame for the Shetland football manager’s job.If that turns out to be the case then good luck to the Lerwick Spurs player coach.When the position was first advertised last year the wording suggested it would be a dficult task, with the applicant likely to need a strong back-up team. That probably explains why so few people came forward.I’m not convinced anyone needs to be going through an interview process over this. None of the most successful people to have held the position were subjected to such scrutiny, and they mostly did the job very well.If Fenwick is indeed the man, let’s all get behind him.: : : : : : : :There is obviously still plenty of power in the conveyor belt which produces Shetland athletics talent, as evidenced by the success of young Layla Todd at the weekend.The -year-old’s fourth-place finish in the Scottish National Cross Country Championships was a tremendous achievement, a credit to both her and her coaches.With distance runner Seumas MacKay now too old for the junior inter-county squad and sprinter Katie Dinwoodie just having a year or two left, it will be necessary for younger competitors to fill the void. Todd will likely be one of those in the frame soon for the , metres event.: : : : : : : :Boxer Tyson Fury’s display against Deontay Wilder on Sunday morning, to claim the WBC heavyweight crown, was sensational.After the previous draw between the two, when Fury was ahead on points but floored twice late on, many predicted that this time Wilder would have his measure. No chance.Whatever you think of the so-called “gypsy king”, who has not always endeared himself to the general public, he is massive box-office entertainment.Wilder may still be given a third fight, which would be disappointing, or Fury’s next outing could be a unication battle with fellow Briton Anthony Joshua.That could well be a mismatch, as Fury appears to be in a dferent league from the muscle-bound Joshua. Butit goes ahead it should be in the UK, not in Saudi Arabia as has been suggested..."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Lewis-insulation-stairs-1-web.jpg","title":"lewis couple made to feel like complete idiots over botched insulation","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineJulie Child and her we Rachel live in North Shawbost on Lewis where they also run a small café. In early , they decided to have insulation work carried out in their home following a cold call by Mark Crilly. that Mr Crilly, a former footballer who played for the likes of Ayr United, St Mirren, and Raith Rovers, came to their bungalow in July  and offered to carry out ious jobs as part of a grant scheme. Underfloor and internal wall insulation and a staircase to allow insulation to their loft room – then only accessible by a loft ladder – was part of the package.The work began in February  after confirmation that Julie and Rachel were eligible for the insulation scheme grant as they were in receipt of working tax credits. Mrs Child claims that after initially stating that he was working under one of the warm home schemes, prior to the work being carried Mr Crilly said he now had his own company – the Central Heating Team. February  to begin the work and fitted the staircase. February that the remaining materials would be delivered on st February and that the fitters would then finish the staircase. February in which she outlined work outstanding and issues related to the work carried out along with photographic evidence of it. She also told him that she would leave a key for the workmen to access her house as she had to go to Inverness for surgery.: “They were very happy with their job, but I went in to have a look and the staircase was dangerously on a forward tilt. There was no headroom # you actually had to duck to get in the attic space. So I brought this all to Mark’s attentionand he said #yes, I’ll get them to do something about it# – but what they did was wedge in an extra bit of wood underneath the staircase to try and put the tilt backward. It’s not fixed to the floor, there’s no banister, there’s no handrail at the top. I started looking at building regulations and there isn’t two metres clearance.”She added: “The underfloor heating was fine, no problems –but I think that is really all they are capable of doing because they weren’tjoiners.”After multiple messages asking Mr Crilly what would be doneto recty the damage Julie conducted a search through Companies House to finddetails of the Central Heating Team. She discovered that it was a limitedcompany but that it did not mention Mark Crilly at all.She spoke to one of the company’s directors, David Mastertonwho told her that Mr Crilly was merely one of their lead generators and that itwas through them the underfloor insulation had been carried out. She added thatshe was told Mr Crilly did not have the correct certication in place to undertakethe internal wall insulation. Mrs Child said that Mark Crilly emailed her in April  to say that Mr Masterton would arrange for a joiner to sort the staircase as soon as possible. In June , Julie managed to track down the joiner in question.He told her that Mr Crilly had casually mentioned that there might be work for him but nothing more. Mrs Child claims that the joiner inspected the work at her home and said he was shocked at the poor workmanship and was not interested in trying to put it right.In September , Julie employed the services of theStornoway-based firm Alex Murray Construction.She said: “I went to Alex Murray Construction and they said ‘they have cut through ceiling joists, which they haven’t reinforced, it’s dangerous – you shouldn’t be using the stairs # that all needs to come out or be strengthened.’“They sent us a quote for about £, to put it back to what it was before. They suggested that we speak to the building inspectors.”In November  Comhairle nan Eilean Siar conducted a building inspection of her home.Mrs Child said: “They said ‘your home insurance is invalid. There are major structural ceiling joists that have been chopped through without any reinforcements –you have a problem and have an assessor come in, the first thing they are going to do is come up to the attic and your insurance will be void#.”Following the building inspection, Mrs Child contacted Mr Crilly to determine who was liable, to which she claims he said he was.After sending him the quote and building report, and withher house no longer insured and vulnerable to the winter weather, she sent aletter at the start of December. This explained that the couple would give MrCrilly fourteen days to pay the quote in full otherwise they would take legalaction.She said: “He did email us and offer the deposit and money on completion but as we had already told him, the construction company would not accept that. They needed the money paid up front. He never got a valid quote for the work with them nor took it any further. All he has done is stall at every opportunity.“He has made us feel very foolish and like complete idiots.We came over here for the quiet le and we’ve no mortgage – so that we can makea few changes with our little business. There is no money in the bank to repairwhat he has done.” contacted Mr Crilly for comment, but we have not received a response."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/001WH2102NCA.jpg","title":"west highland free press audio","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineEvery week service users at Tigh na Drochaid Resource Centre in Portree produces an abridged audio version of the West Highland Free Press.

He works extensively at Westminster, Dublin and Stormont.In the late s, he was music critic for the News Letter and contributed to the New Musical Express.He says he uses music to escape from the pain of supporting Everton, Cltonville and Ballymena Rugby Club, not to mention the politics.And he equivocates excellently in true political fashion over his choices - and how they could all change overnight!He says: “The problem with picking a Top Ten is my taste can change from time to time. So perhaps the best option is mixing some old favourites with a few which only made the grade recently.” . Anyone who knows me will not be surprised my first pick will be a Van Morrison track. There are so many which mean so much. Caravan, In the Garden, Tupelo Honey among dozens of classic songs. But I’ve decided to go with a track from the new album Three Chords and the Truth. Morrison thrives when he dips into spirituality and mysticism. At  the Man still has it. The song is Dark Night of the Soul, Van Morrison.  Glen Hansard’s music has been a source of much enjoyment in recent years. Great tunes but my choice is a track featuring Clarence Clemons’ son Jake. Drive All Night, Glen Hansard  John Martyn was a genius. His music transcends styles and fashions. Solid Air one of the finest albums ever produced. This song is just beautul.May You Never, John Martyn. .Nick Drake died a young man but left a powerful legacy of fine music. This song is particularly haunting. Northern Sky, Nick Drake  Following a pattern here, this artist is also dead. Sandy Denny remains a personal favourite. The combination of her voice and the genius of Richard Thompson leaves a song which will never grow old. Who Knows Where the Time Goes, Fairport Convention.  There has to be some sweet soul music. The Rev Al Green remains a voice without equal. Let’s Stay Together, Al Green.  In the same direction, Marvin Gaye could melt the hardest heart. His music both political and romantic. Of course, he’s dead too.What’s Going On, Marvin Gaye . Big fan of the Waterboys. Mike Scott is immensely talented. This is a wonderful version of a Van song from Astral Weeks. Sweet Thing, The Waterboys.  The Alabama Three never receive the plaudits which they deserve. Woke Up This Morning is generally the band’s signature tune but this is even better. Hello..I’m Johnny Cash, Alabama Three . Just love J J Cale. This track is magical. Cocaine by J J Cale My choice will probably change next week and I’m amazed I’ve missed Springsteen and Peter Green’s Fleetwood Mac. But that’s it for now, pop pickers.

Van Morrison – Tupelo Honey, lesser known song from the Belfast Cowboy that in all the times I have seen him live, he has naturally never played!. The Waterboys – Whole of the Moon - just a wonderful anthem of my youth and still such a great song today, took me a long time to realise the lyric was a comparison between two people, “I see the crescent, you see the whole of the moon”. Sam Baker – Broken Fingers, a Texan who “got caught up in someone ’s war” after terrible injuries learned to play the guitar again and wrote this song about the process, read the back story before listening.. Dr Feelgood – All Through the City – first live band I seen in Belfast at  years old, had a huge impact on me and after all these years, Jim Bolan thank you for taking me!. Foy Vance – Two Shades of Hope – a wonderful singer songwriter from our wee country, and what a song!. Linda Rondstadt – Your No Good - I have probably bought this album times in dferent formats, loved it from no age.. David Bowie – Heroes - A song and artist who came alive for me when I went to Live Aid with John Connor in , best performance of the day . Bap Kennedy – Working Man – from the fantastic Sailors Revenge album, sadly Bap is not with us anymore, greatly missed. Was lucky enough to have him play at my th birthday party in the BT club, Vincent Close got him to do some Energy Orchard stuff!. Van Morrison – Into the Mystic- is there a better song to raise the spirit, “let your soul and spirit fly into the mystic” ace.

For these were not just trad troubadours whose genius would grace any stage where Irish music is celebrated but each of them in turn was exemplary in passing on the tradition to the next generation.Mayo harpist Laoise Kelly, who reminded us that the cry in Ireland from our betters was once, ‘hang the harpists and destroy their instruments’, not only excels at our national instrument but has founded an international school for an cláirseach on Achill Island. No better person to pick up the Musician of the Year Award.Ned Kelly from Tipperary, a box player, has inspired an entire community to use music to give hope with his ‘In Tune for Le’ traditional orchestra — scores of whom played from the balconies at the Waterfront Hall as his accordion raised the roof in Béal Feirste Cois Cuain.Then there was the golden-voicedheartbroken Lilis Ó Laoire from the Donegal Gaeltacht whose voice and values connect us with an area where language and song are the very backbone of the community. Lilis had buried his mother the previous day and his presence paid homage to all those who had acted as a bridge of song from the past to the present day. His rousing closing number – a traditional ditty rewritten to mark the event — was a highwater mark of an outstanding evening. Ón osna is sine a thig an ceol is binne, as Seosamh Mac Grianna observed Full marks to the set-designers who used images of Belfast to illuminate a glittering gathering – the shards from the surface of the Titanic Centre, the dome from the Dome of Delight and the yellow cranes in comic-book style —and kudos also to TG for bringing these awards to Belfast for the third year in a row. Maximum Respect. Meas Mór.Both those who attended and those who followed the live broadcast on TG were, indeed, “immeasurably enriched” by the Gradam Ceoil Awards, as the VIP who opened the Waterfront Hall had predicted.And who was he Prince Charles, of course.You can watch back at Gradam Ceoil on the TG player at www.tg.ie"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"if you want to get ahead get a hat","story":"I LIKE hats. And caps. I have quite a nice collection of headwear, worn and aged, like myself, dispersed between Dublin and Belfast, Donegal, the car boot and all the places in between. It used to be customary for men to wear headware. Look at any old photos. Dunchers and flatcaps galore. Peaky blinders in multitudes outside factories, mills, shipyards, farmyards, public houses, marts, markets, country fairs. Hats were also popular. Paddy hats, trilbys, bowlers. Though bowlers were more for Orangemen on parade or English civil servants on The Mall. Country men were hat and cap people. Christy Ring even played hurling in a cap. So my grá for head gear used to be widespread. And now its coming back into vogue. Especially the omnipresent baseball cap. It is the preferred head covering for rappers, golfers, other sports people, urban youth.I have a couple of baseball caps. And a few hand-knitted wooly hats. Síle Darragh knitted me a dark blue tea cosy-type one. Lucilita a white one. Both were too big. But very warm all the same. Wooly ear warmers. There are really fine knitted yokes for sale in expensive shops in the west of Ireland. But they are very dear. I covet one of those. Hint hint. Extra Large.I also have a Stetson. It was presented to me in Texas. It has an enormous brim. I only wear it indoors, usually while watching Westerns on TV. I haven’t the nerve to wear it outdoors. Before the presentation our man in America, Larry Downes, was very concerned that the Stetson should not be a black one. Apparently the bad guys wore black ones. So he insisted that my Stetson would be white. So it is. I never told Larry but I preferred a black one. I favour Jesse James or Billy the Kid over Hopalong Cassidy or The Lone Ranger. But Larry had his way.I have another hat which I’m also shy about wearing outdoors although I like it very much. It’s not unlike the one Martin McGuinness wore during the Easter Centenary events. I wore mine as well. I would like to have the nerve to wear it more often the way Martin started to do. Martins hat now features in many posters and pictures of him. I think the hat darkens his face too much and he looks too stern. He was stern sometimes but my best memories of Martin are when he was hatless and happy.One day he and I were going to see Brit Secretary of State Peter Mandelson. On the coat stand outside his office a hat was perched. To Martin’s chagrin I put the hat on my head and we breezed in to talk to Peter.“I have a hat like that” Peter told me cheerfully. “I wear it in the grounds of Hillsborough House.”“If you want to get ahead get a hat,” I replied, removing it and placing it on my knee. “You have very good taste in headware. That’s something we have in common.”When we finished our meeting I put Peter’s hat back on my head and Martin and I left.“You can’t take his hat,” Martin hissed at me. “That’s stealing”.“Stealing! They stole our country,” I said. “In the gospel according to Cleaky, I’m liberating it. This is appropriating the Imperialist Misappropriators.” Cleaky was a great liberator. An outstanding appropriator.One time in Australia John Little gave RG and me some fine head covers. We picked up two Koalas as well. Ach is é sín scéal eile. But that’s another story. No Koalas were harmed in the telling of this tale.I like tweed caps. I have one which belonged to my friend, the late Kevin McKenna. We swapped caps one time. I wear Kevin’s cap regularly. I also have a cap belonging to another friend, the late Stan Corrigan. His lovely we Kathleen gave me it. It is that cap which triggered this column. I lost it last week after the recent Ard Chomairle meeting in Dublin which mandated Mary Lou to explore the possibilty of agreeing a Programme for A Government For Change.I was distraught about the loss of Stan’s cap. I realised very quickly after the meeting that it was missing. But where  I enlisted the help of Saint Anthony. Again.Was it in Dawn Doyle’s car  No she told me when I phoned her. Or out the back of Ard Oig where RG picked me up  No. There was no sight of it when Keith searched the back lane in the dark in the midst of Storm Ciara.Next morning the search continued. I prowled the back lane of Ard Oig before being summoned heartbroken into a meeting. While I was so engaged, that darling man Mick O Brien drove back to the CWU building where the Ard Chomairle met.He ed triumphantly.“I have your hat,” he declared and handed me a Russian Cossack type piece of hairy millinery.“That’s not my hat,” I told him as I tried it on.“It’s lovely on you,” Mick told me. And so it was.But I was still fretting for big Stan’s cap. Negotiations for Government  The Sinn Féin surge  The posturing by Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael’s leaders  Shadowy friggers running Sinn Féin  I focused with my comrades on all this but beneath my new, well nearly new, Cossack hat my wee mind refused to give up on big Stan’s missing cap. Apart from the sense of loss how could I face Kathleen  She’s a Tyrone woman. Hell hath no fury like a Tyrone woman chastising a man, particularly a Belfast man. My nerves were wrecked.“An bhfuil cead agam dul amach ” I asked Mary Lou. “May I go out ”“Tá” she said “Yes, but please take off that Russian hat#. and get your hair cut.”I exited despondently stage left, as sheepishly as Micheál Martin after Mary Lou scalped his arse. Out the back of Ard Oig the old Dominic Street flats, now demolished, are a building site. I made my way gingerly through the muck. A burly workman greeted me.“A great election result,” he said.“Yup,” I replied, “Did you find a cap ”“Is it a Bugatti ” He asked.I wonderedhe had a selection of caps. A Malloy. A Hanna. A Magee. But no he only had one. Stan’s Bugatti. He pulled it out – a grey wet crumpled item – from beneath his yellow high-vis vest.“That’s it!” I cried as I resisted the urge to hug him. Instead I told him about big Stan. His eyes welled up with tears.“I’m glad I found it,” he told me.“You look very like a painting my Granny had of Saint Anthony,” I told him.He looked at me warily.“Thank you,” I gushed.“No problem. Tell me one thing,” he asked.“Anything,” I replied.“When are you getting your hair cut ” He asked.“Soon,” I told him. After all he did find big Stan’s cap.He smiled at me and as he turned away I really could see that he looked remarkably like my Granny’s picture of Saint Anthony. I felt an urge to fall on my knees in the muck to offer a prayer of thanks to him but I suppressed this. So instead I just thanked him again. He smiled beatically.Now I’ve Mick’s Russian hat as well as big Stan’s cap. It’s great. No need to worry about the wrath of Kathleen. Or Mary Lou. Unlike Micheál Martin. If I had two heads I’d be landed."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"they just cant get enough of shirley","story":"PATHOS, poignancy, hilarity and a fortnight in Greece will collide once again as Tara Lynne O’Neill revives her Shirley Valentine on the Lyric stage this month.Before the initial Shirley run back in September, she had been approached to play one of Willy Russell’s most iconic creations by Lyric Executive Producer Jimmy Fay, a part, at the time, she had no hesitation in accepting., words of script later, Tara Lynne, along with director Patrick J O’Reilly, is preparing to bring the housewe back along with a lot of “sun shimmer” for a limited run at the end of this month.When we meet, Tara has just ed from Dublin where she was reading for Embrace a Giant Spirit, a Seamus Heaney showcase in Christ Church were she read his poem, Markings. In between dodging the last remnants of Storm Ciara, the former St Genevieve’s High School pupil and Derry Girls actress is warm, funny and straight talking about how her version of Willy Russell’s creation is “very much of this particular period in time”.She said: “Audiences have come with their friends, then they’ve come again and brought their mums, mother-in-laws, it’s phenomenal. Audiences feel like Shirley and it’s a gt that they want to give to other people. With the character of Shirley, I suppose it’s that thing that people always talk about, about being a ‘strong female lead’. Well, what is a strong female lead  To me, a strong female lead is someone who is flawed, they show their flaws. Shirley is just every woman and that is what is beautul about her. The character of Shirley has so many dilemmas that every woman faces, no matter what we are.“In the play Shirley talks about being back in school, she believed that good things were not meant for her.“A lot of us come out of school feeling like that or afraid to try stuff because we are afraid to fail.“I’ve been asked to contribute to a piece ITV are doing for International Women’s Day in March – what would you say to your younger self  The only thing I would say to my younger self is to try stuff, fail,you fail what is the worst that can happen  You get back up and you do it again, you do it better. This industry is constantly trying, but you can also play it safe. Shirley has been afraid to make mistakes her whole le. She’s got the . children, the nice house, it’s spotless, the husband, Joe, he’s out working, there isn’t much more she can do. It’s basically a question then of, ‘Is this it ’“Yes, Shirley is  and when I say that on stage people laugh because today, in , it’s so young. But actually  years ago  seemed older, people acted and carried themselves older. I’m  and I go, ‘Well, I’m young.’ We’ve come a long way, I think.”During the production’s initial run, Tara Lynne spoke of how, post-show, she had some “brilliant, absolutely incredible conversations” with women and men of all ages.“I had women in their s want to talk about the play, sixth form students talk to me about how they related to it.”Tara Lynne said that the revival of the play is also a fitting tribute to her friend and assistant director, Julie Maxwell, who tragically passed away last August during a night out in the city centre.“I know we all will truly miss her, I truly miss Julie, I have all the notes that she gave me during our first run of rehearsals. I feel that the success of the show and its second staging is a good way to honour her.”When the curtain comes down on this run, Tara Lynne will be preparing to start filming for the juggernaut that is Channel Four’s smash hit Derry Girls. Playing Ma Mary, the matriarch of the Quinn McCool clan, Tara Lynne has gained something of a cult following with her s perm, jumpers and ‘punt purse’ throughout the show’s two series.“We will hopefully be getting the script soon and I’ve no idea what is in them yet. We will be filming May through to July and I can’t wait to see everybody and the third series will be out later in the year. I’ve also written a play for the Belfast Festival later in the year so it’s very much a case of watch this space.”•Shirley Valentine willto the Lyric Theatre from February  until March .

The combination of a growing younger population, gently rising property prices, and some of the lowest housing costs in Ireland or Britain means that Belfast is a hub of activity for younger people in the property market.In order to gain a greater insight into the experience of these first-time buyers in the local property market, the ATN spoke to two young couples that recently bought their first homes in Belfast as well as real estate expert Colin Moran of Property People. Our goal was to investigate what motivates young people out of the rental market towards purchasing, as well as the factors involved in choosing their first property.Fionntan Smithof Ladybrook, and his fiancée Ciararecently purchased their first home, a semi-detached four-bedroom house with a back garden, in Gransha, in the heart of Andersonstown. They said their purchase was a reflection of their two main priorities: an advantageous location and the space to start a family.“Before we purchased we were both living at home with our parents and saving money: we weren’t keen on getting into the rental market and always having that insecurity over your head,” Fionntan said.“Once we knew we wanted to start a family together we looked at a number of locations and homes. I suppose we could have looked at something cheaper down the road, or a more modern home further out in the ‘commuter ring’, but we decided that our priority was the advantages of living in such an older, settled, well-established area like Gransha.“There’s barely any crime here and being in the middle of West Belfast gives you’re the proximity to the city centre, pubs, public transport, the shops. At the same time, we have plenty of rooms and we have a big back garden, which allows us to raise a family.”Chris Campbell-Palmerand his partner Yvonneon the other hand, decided to purchase their first property – a three-bedroom terraced house – just off the Ravenhill Road in Southeast Belfast after eight years of co-habiting in rented accommodation.“We took the step of getting our first home because ultimately we were sick of moving so often, sometimes due to poorly-maintained properties and disputes with landlords,” they told the ATN.“Financially at the end of the day it is more expensive to rent and that isn’t sustainable. We looked at flats first but there’s a real lack of affordable apartments in Belfast, so that’s when we expanded outwards to look at houses in South and East Belfast, where prices are affordable for first-time buyers.“Even though it’s an older property which needs a bit of work, the house we settled on has more space than a typical terraced house, so we can have friends visit or maintain a lodger. Eventhe area is new to us it’s only a mile walk to the Ormeau Road where most of our friends are as well as being close to the city centre for work.”Director of Property People, Colin Moran, concurred with both couples’ choice to move out of the rental market and into owning their homes.“Purchase every time would be my advice. Despite the flexibility of renting, is in my opinion not a good long-term housing option,” he said.“Owning your property gives you much more stability over the future of your home and an asset that can be sold or passed on to future generations. As far as location and the features of the home you settle on, buying a property is very exciting and provides the buyer the ability to choose their home to reflect their personality, le choices, and future. For dferent people that will mean dferent things but the priority is to make sure your home fits your le as it is much more than just the building itself but how it can enhance your le.“In terms of professional advice, I would urge people to get on the property ladder at an affordable entry point, and aim for a % deposit as you have plenty of time to pay it off,” he added.“In terms of an investment, a good investment property is in a location that will be desirable for tenants to ensure occupancy, be of a good standard or at price that reflects any refurbishments.

The regulator ordered the hospital to urgently review and resolve the issue.However, the RQIA carried out a further inspection in November last year and found limited progress in relation to arrangements for medical governance.It said the hospital should stop the practice of allowing doctors to assist with operations without providing evidence of revalidation and indemnity immediately during a serious concerns meeting in July.Revalidation is a safeguarding process all doctors must go through to prove their competence, while medical indemnity is insurance for doctors in the event of negligence.However, following a further inspection in November, the RQIA said it was not assured that sufficient safeguards were in place to protect the safety and wellbeing of patients.As a result, it put in place a failure to comply notice on the registration of the hospital, which had a gross income of £.m last year. Management of the hospital was given until February  to address the concerns.An unannounced inspection was carried out on Monday. While the RQIA found the hospital had addressed six of the nine failings, a number of concerns remain, including the governance systems to assure the fitness and competence of doctors working as surgical assistants.An RQIA spokesman said: Earlier this week, the RQIA conducted an unannounced inspection at the Ulster Independent Clinic to assess progress in addressing our concerns relating to medical governance at the clinic.While compliance was achieved in respect of a number of issues highlighted in the RQIA#s enforcement notice, further work is required to address a number of outstanding actions.As a result, the RQIA has extended the enforcement notice for a further four weeks. The safety and wellbeing of every patient at Ulster Independent Clinic is of paramount importance to the RQIA and we will continue to monitor this service through our ongoing regulatory activities.A spokesman for the hospital said: We continue to work with the RQIA to further strengthen our existing administrative and governance procedures.Whilst six of the areas previously identied have been completed, we welcome the short extension for full implementation of the remaining three actions.This includes us voluntarily engaging with the Northern Ireland Medical and Dental Training Agency to ensure robust arrangements are in place to support continued access for trainee doctors to observe and support our consultants as surgical assistants.Belfast Related Content\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland df .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_dd-f-b-a-adc_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland df .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_dd-f-b-a-adc_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland df .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_dd-f-b-a-adc_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland df .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_dd-f-b-a-adc_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland df .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_dd-f-b-a-adc_ w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"Northern IrelandUlster Independent Clinic urged to act to ensure patient safetyThe Ulster Independent Clinic needs to act by next month to ensure patient safety, a regulator said.,,,],\"customPriceBuckets\":[,,,,,],\"targeting\":Most ReadCoronavirus: Passengers in contact with Northern Ireland#s first case contacted by health officialsHealth watchdog RQIA gives Ulster Independent Clinic extra month to meet basic safety standardsJan de Vries passes away: Tributes paid to advocate of natural medicineDefibrillator prototype by Ulster medic still in working order  years onHand sanitiser in demand as Northern Ireland clerics fear the spread of winter viruses,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriMoneyTechnologyAnalysisTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleTravelSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

There is one confirmed case of coronavirus in Northern Ireland, while over  people have been tested.The patient in Belfast is an adult woman who ed from northern Italy to the Republic of Ireland before travelling to Northern Ireland.One person had also been diagnosed with the virus after travelling back to Wales from Italy, while there are also two further cases of coronavirus in England.– What is the UK Government recommending people ing from infected regions do The UK Government said that people ing from Hubei province in China, Iran, lockdown areas in northern Italy, and special care zones in South Korea in the last  days should immediately self-isolate at home and call NHS .Earlier this week five schools in Northern Ireland put precautionary measures in place after pupils came home from half-term ski trips to northern Italy.People ing from a number of other countries including the rest of China and Korea, Japan, Hong Kong and Singapore should self-isolatethey develop symptoms of cough or fever or shortness of breath.– What  is being done to tackle the spread of the virus Health minister Robin Swann said any confirmed cases in Northern Ireland would be admitted to the infectious disease unit at the Royal Victoria Hospital in Belfast.A Public Health Agency helpline specically for coronavirus concerns has also been provided and can be reached at   .– Is anyone benefiting from the outbreak Yes. On Thursday, consumer healthcare giant Reckitt Benckiser said the coronavirus has helped to drive greater demand for its Dettol and Lysol hygiene products. vw,vw,px, px\"Reckitt Benckiser has seen a greater demand for its Dettol and Lysol hygiene products – Is this a pandemic The World Health Organisationhas not declared a pandemic, but says coronavirus remains an international emergency.Stormont#s health committee has agreed to classy coronavirus as a notiable disease, which would allow a judge to legally compel someone suspected of having the disease to undergo medical testing.This power is highly unlikely to ever be used, it highlights the seriousness with which the Department of Healthis taking the situation.– What is a coronavirus Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that cause illnesses ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome .The strain that has recently emerged is a new strain that has not been previously identied in humans. The respiratory disease it causes has been named Covid- by WHO.– How is it spread The disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with the virus coughs or exhales.These droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person and can be picked up other people touching them then touching their nose or mouth. vw,vw,px, px\"Symptoms of the virus include fever, cough, tightness of the chest and shortness of breath – What are the symptoms Initial symptoms of the novel coronavirus include fever, cough, tightness of the chest, shortness of breath and breathing dficulties.More severe cases can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, sepsis and septic shock which can lead to death.There are no specic treatments or vaccines for a new coronavirus but symptoms can be treated.– What about my holiday Managing director of Gallagher Travel Heather Fielding said travel to Europe and further afield is continuing as normal. It is a fluid situation but obviously there are people going to Italy who are concerned. Tour operators and airlines are working closely with the Foreign Office. If people want to change or cancel their holidays, fees are still in place. Some airlines are a little more lenient than others when it comes to changes but that would fall under normal ticketing regulations anyway, she said. We are recommending that people take out adequate travel insurance that covers them when it comes to disruption. The majority of people who would book through us would have chosen an inclusive package which means they are fully protected, in the case of not being allowed to travel to a certain area with a tour operators I would be giving a full refund or helping them find an alternative. The majority of people are looking at it as they still want to get away to the sun and they realise in relation to the size of the population there#s a very small number of people being affected - the elderly or those with an underlying medical condition. Generally speaking we#re finding bookings are still coming through and people are still prepared to travel, it#s not a problem. – Are some groups more at risk The UK Government says that based on current evidence most cases appear to be mild and that those who have died in Wuhan appeared to have pre-existing health conditions.The World Health Organisation has said that about four in five people who contract the virus get mild symptoms and recover.But it added that older people or patients with pre-existing medical conditions such as high blood pressure, heart disease, or diabetes are more at risk of developing serious illness.Belfast Related ContentNorthern IrelandCoronavirus: Apology after Northern Ireland family told to isolate for fortnight by Public Health AgencyThe Public Health Agencyhas apologised to a Northern Ireland family after they were advised to isolate themselves in their home after their son ed from an Italian ski trip. \"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk cfcd .ece AUTOCROP wh cv.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk cfcd .ece AUTOCROP wh cv.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk cfcd .ece AUTOCROP wh cv.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk cfcd .ece AUTOCROP wh cv.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk cfcd .ece AUTOCROP wh cv.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"Northern IrelandCoronavirus in Northern Ireland to be classed as #notiable disease# - allowing legally-compelled testingStormont#s health committee has agreed to classy coronavirus as a notiable disease, which would allow a judge to legally compel someone suspected of having the disease to undergo medical testing.Northern IrelandGoods made in China are running low in Northern Ireland shops due to coronavirus Supplies of Chinese-made consumer goods, such as curtains and sofas, are expected to run low in shops here due to factory shutdowns triggered by coronavirus.,,,],\"customPriceBuckets\":[,,,,,],\"targeting\":Most ReadFrantic search for anyone tied to Northern Ireland#s first case of coronavirusThreats against Regent House pupils over #repulsive# video mocking Down#s syndromeSuspicious object found under teacher#s car at Belfast school a # alarm#Large number of hatchets and knives seized after disturbance at Strabane funeralBody recovered from sea at Antrim village,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriMoneyTechnologyAnalysisTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleTravelSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Workforce imbalances in large organisations and big companies can result from a iety of often complex factors which cannot be over looked or simply dismissed.Reducing an analysis of sectarian practice to a numbers game sheds no light and serves little purpose. So too with equating every adverse decision to a sectarian motive or using the accusation of sectarianism to address every ill.Mr Scullion added: There are a number of immediate steps which could and should be taken to starts to process of eradicating sectarianism from our society. An integrated and secular education system, a Bill of Rights , an integrated housing programme and the criminalisation of sectarianism would be a good start.However, for as long as institutionalised sectarianism forms the basis of government structures and practices, there will be no political leadership from Stormont and no pressure to address either sectarianism or the vested interests which help perpetuate it.

A row of terraced houses at Wapping Lane, close to the Fountain estate, have lain empty for a considerable number of years. Those properties are amongst , that are sitting empty across the Derry and Strabane council area. The Northern Ireland Housing Executive , says empty properties are a “wasted resource” for the owner and those looking for somewhere to live. “Vacant homes can deteriorate and become a nuisance for people living close by. They may also lead to neighbourhood decline,” NIHE added. googletag.cmd.push Potential benefits of bringing an empty home back into use include generating rental income to offset rates and the costs of maintaining the property, releasing capital from the sale of the property and protecting the long-term investment potential of the property. In addition, it reduces the risk of vandalism, squatting and anti-social behaviour, and liability for health and safety issues, or damage to adjoining properties. When planning permission was granted to convert the iconic former Sinclair factory building on Abercorn Road into  apartments, the proposal also involved the conversion of seven vacant terraced dwellings along Wapping Lane into  apartments. googletag.cmd.push DUP MLA for Foyle, Gary Middleton, told the Derry News that it is vitally important to develop this street. “I do want to see this area developed, it is my personal preference that they be kept as houses because I’d like to see more families move in to reinvigorate the area. In conversations I’ve had with the developer they have been positive about the possibility of houses. “I know parking was an issue, but I would encourage the developer to work as quickly as possible as it is in their interest to see them developed also.” The Foyle MLA said that homelessness figures show the need for housing in the city. “You don’t want to see any area sitting in derelictionit can be avoided. “It would also bring development of the streetscape which would complement the work that has already been done on the Abercorn Road – Wapping Lane needs to be part of that. “It would avoid problems with anti-social behaviour and environmental issues which have emerged while the properties have been vacant.” People Before Profit Councillor for the Moor area, Eamonn McCann, said it is “unacceptable” for so many houses to remain unoccupied. He believes that many housing units are being “turned over to Air BB” to take advantage of busy periods in the Derry calendar. It proves a lucrative business for property owners, he said, and means they don’t feel the need to let them out for the rest of the year. Cllr McCann is of the view that Stormont must implement a “crash programme” of house building for the Derry area and NI as a whole. “There is a serious shortage of housing, particularly rental properties for young people.” He suggested giving the Housing Executive powers to build again by using the , properties in its ownership as collateral to borrow money against. Councillor McCann supported development at Wapping Lane, adding: “The need for housing is as great as it was  years ago. Derry was the spark for progressive movements in the past and it must be again.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

It’s been a whole year since I spoke to her about setting up her own label and got another chat to her this week… googletag.cmd.push Womens Day coming up, how are things in electronicland for women behind the decks  “Things are definitely evolving in the music scene. “There are certainly more women getting involved. “Even from our workshops theres much more interest in ladies from all ages, long overdue, but its brilliant to see and be part of the #equalisingmusic campaign.” Are there other women dj-ing you like  “Of course, too many to mention. However, there are a few emerging acts that have come through the ranks at our courses. “I’m excited to watch their progress and looking forward to seeing them smash it at our label party. “Don’t want to make any names just yet...but keep an eye on our posters and events for some super next generation talent.” googletag.cmd.push Youre the brains behind a record label, no easy job, how has that been  “Honestly its been great. Delighted to be working with so many talented artists from all over Ireland and across the world. “We’ve signed over  artists, with our focus on pushing homegrown talent, but we’ve also welcomed established and emerging artists from USA, Spain, Portugal, Italy, UK, Malaysia, Serbia and India. “Initially, I had a three-year plan, but we accomplished all that and more within the first year... which was a pleasant surprise to say the least! “Selling out our label party events across the country, consistent radio play, hitting multiple charts with our tracks and almost  releases out within the first  months.” What have you lined up for this year  “Lots of label party events lined up nationwide as well as across the water.“Currently working with Arts Council, Blubell and ious groups delivering DJ skills digital workshops across the North West. As well as all the usual touring, looking forward to heading out to the Far East again through the year and playing across Ireland, Scotland etc. “Obviously, the big one this weekend DaCosta Records first birthday and looking forward to headlining Holi Colours Festival next month. My new track, Mermaid, is out th February.”Celtronic is  this year…. “Fantastic to see a local brand not only endure but go from strength to strength. “Long may it continue, more power to them.” What would you tell young women starting out  “Don’t be afraid to get involved. Go to a workshop, got to a course, go to events. “If you’re not invited to the party, then start your own. “Appreciate your local scene, learn and develop there. Be it, own it, do it!.” The latter obviously refers to New York’s Daddy Long Legs making a welcometo Derry this Friday night in Sandino’s. They’re the citys most beloved blues bashers have been huffing and puffing and blowing houses down on a nightly basis, on their infinite world tour and always bring an elevated level of rough and ready intensity to contemporary lo-fi blues, with their explosive fire ceremony. A Daddy Long Legs show is equal parts roots rock, blues and guttural soul, stripping down old standards and making them shiny and new again. Some of the originals are like an all-out spiritual revival, while others are hauntingly beautul. Also, on the bill are Protex, a Belfast punk band which formed in . Their first records were issued on Good Vibrations records. They formed part of the first wave of Belfast punk bands along with the likes of label-mates The Undertones and Rudi. Tickets are pound and can be acquired from Eventbrite. Asthat wasn’t enough, Stefan Murphy will be playing another intimate gig in the Grand Central this Saturday. If you were there for the last one you don’t need reminding of how special it was,you weren’t, he kicks off at ten on Saturday and it’s free.

You should never, ever accept defeat.“If youre able to show that comebackability youre never dead You saw it last year when we were away to Dundalk and away to Shamrock Rovers when it looked aswe were down and out but we came back. Theres that fighting spirit. “Its also got to do with the people who come off the bench. Its about making positive changes to try and get you back in the game. Its all down to the players and their appetite to not want to lose games. You would think thats a gimme in football but its not and were very proud that here we dont accept defeat and we keep going to the very last seconds of the game.”Despite last weeks game against Harps being televised, the Brandywell was packed to capacity and the supporters who stayed until the very end got their reward of a late goal. On reflection, Devine believes that the new players at the club may have been slightly overawed at their first experience of thousands of City fans cheering them on.“These bunch of players back themselves, they are good players,” he continued. “It was a wee bit of a culture shock for them seeing the crowd and the appetite and the expectation last Friday night but Im definitely sure that they will be ready for it this week. “The players were absolutely devastated that the game at St. Pats was called off because they were all going there confident.” googletag.cmd.push SignicantBoth Dundalk and Shamrock Rovers won on Monday night, maintaining their % starts to the new campaign. Bohs, who finished just ahead of Derry in third place last season, have also had a decent start, winning two from three. A win at the Brandywell would create a signicant gap between the two sides just a few weeks into the season, something which Devine is aware of.“These are the days in the season where we are all finding our way,” he said. “We have to make sure that we improve week by week and we cant wait for the games to come because the games are the biggest teacher. They show us what teams are right, what players are right, what formations are right. “The games will hopefully come thick and fast and hopefully we can start putting points on the board.“I dont think that anyone is ever going to be too concerned in the opening round of matches. Weve had a narrow defeat to Dundalk and weve drawn a Northwest derby so I dont think theres anything overly concerning at this moment in time.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The Brandywell was packed with fans celebrating that equaliser with him and Liddle admits it was a special night for him. “Im surprised how many people come down to these games,” he said. “The games are brilliant to play in and the league is brilliant. The crowd was great, you cant hear anything on the pitch which is something Ive never experienced before. “I love it here. I think its very competitive, its tough and I think its just a great place to come and get some first team experience.”Now Liddle is hoping that his goal against Finn Harps is the start of good times to come in a red and white shirt.“I’m absolutely delighted to come here and score on my home debut, getting the equaliser in the last minute, is brilliant,” he said. “I was itching to get on just to show what I can do and hopefully this goal will help me to continue to show people what I can do.Having started the  campaign against champions Dundalk before facing Ollie Horgan’s men last Friday evening, Liddle already knows the le in the League of Ireland is going to be tough, having been thrown in at the deep end.“The first two games have been tough,” he admitted. “Obviously we know that this league isn’t easy and to be honest every game we play we think is going to be tough for us, so we just have to take each game as they come and hopefully grind out results.”The -year-old is already a fan of team-mate Walter Figueira for his late equaliser, after the ex-Waterford man showed great skill to create the chance. “I saw him do a lovely piece of skill and get to the byline and I was thinking to get a little bit of movement so that he could cut it back, then I was just thinking to make sure I would get as much connect on it as possible and lucky for me it went in. It was brilliant to go over and celebrate with the fans.” googletag.cmd.push More paceMeanwhile, Declan Devine wants his players to show more pace in their build up play when they face Bohemians tomorrow night. City were lethargic at times against Harps last week and, to an extant, played into their opponents hands. “I think we were slow in our build up play last Friday night, theres no doubt about it, but thats credit to Finn Harps as well as they made it really dficult,” he explained. “We wanted to work down the sides of them and create overloads, but that didnt materialise and I think we got into a bit of a rut in terms of playing slowly, which suited Harps. “That said, I have to give the players massive credit because into a gale-force wind we were the dominant team and we kept going. The keeper has made a great save before Adam scored and we hit the bar. It was so, so dficult to keep the ball down and play through, but to be fair to the players they kept plugging and kept plugging and I think rightly so deserved their equaliser.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

However, McKnight was not to be denied and in the seventh minute he dispossessed Corey Laverty and hit a shot that squirmed through Leneghanrsquos hands and into the net.Albion had barely time to celebrate as, virtually from the restart, Tollymore won a free kick that was delivered into the box, by McLister, for Ruairi Toner to shoot into the net.United slowly began to take a stranglehold in midfield with Marty McCourt and Tommy Kane dominating Burke and Rooney. On the left wing, Marty Devlin was giving the Albion defence a torrid time with his pace and power.Just on the stroke of half-time Albionrsquos Ryan Beckett fired a free kick over the Bearsrsquo crossbar.Despite having wind advantage, Tollymore were unable to create any chances of note and they were rocked in the th minute when Albion centre half Allan Cousins found himself unmarked in the Tollymore area to head a corner kick past Leneghan.Despite this setback, Tollymore held their nerve and Jack McCourt and Matt McCormick linked up for McCourt to run through on goal. Unfortunately, Albion lsquokeeper Joel Collins made a superb finger tip save to block McCourtrsquos shot.United were well on top, but were lacking the guile to open up the Moira defence until the introduction of veteran striker Adrian lsquoSparkyrsquo Howard.Within moments of Howardrsquos arrival in the st minute he got on the end of a McLister flick to shoot past Collins in the Albion goal.It was now all Tollymore as the Bears pushed for a winner and Albion were reduced to ten-men after Darryl Irwin was dismissed for a cynical foul on Marty Devlin as the striker burst through on goal, after being put clear by Tommy Kane.Virtually on the stroke of full time, Corey Laverty picked out Howard with a superb pass only for Collins to make another excellent save. Extra time saw Tollymore playing with the wind and forcing a succession of corners that Albion did well to defend.Albion seemed content to play for penalty kicks and it was only in the last couple of minutes of the game that they came out of their defensive shell, but were unable to penetrate a resolute Tollymore defence.Albion netted their first penalty with Marty McCourt equalising and then the fun started. Leneghan saved the second spot kick and Albionrsquos Joel Collins then blocked Corey Lavertyrsquos effort to keep things level at -. Leneghan then saved the third Albion kick before Marty Devlin scored to nudge the Bears in front at -.The Moira men levelled things with a cracking penalty leaving United with two more penalties to win. Unfortunately, Howard shot wide to leave the scores - and one penalty apiece left.Once again Leneghan made an unbelievable save to hand the initiative to United and Adam Rea stepped up to blast the ball into the net to send United into the final.Match sponsor: Diamond Pats, Newcastle.Tollymore United Moira Albion MID ULSTER LEAGUE CUP S

South Down MP Chris Hazzard during a meeting in Berlin last weekend with representatives from the Executive Board of the European Left.The MP was warmly received by delegates from the EU member states who congratulated Mr Hazzard on Sinn Feinrsquos recent success in the Irish election.Mr Hazzard said that it was ldquofantastic to receive a warm welcome from representatives of the European Left.He explained that throughout the Brexit negotiations, European solidarity with Ireland was ldquoremarkable and it was fitting that he had the opportunity to thank representatives from across the EU for that support at their Executive Board meeting.Mr Hazzard said that it was also important to take the opportunity to call for continued support in the months ahead.ldquoBrexit is by no means complete and Ireland will need ongoing solidarity as European and British government officials commence trade talks next month, the MP continued.ldquoWe canrsquot allow the British government to adopt a casual approach to their international obligations and responsibilities to protect both the Good Friday Agreement and our all-Ireland economy.Mr Hazzard revealed that it was also ldquofascinating to be involved in a discussion regarding the need to deepen understanding and relations with all European Left parties in the time ahead, especially in relation to tackling the climate emergency, workersrsquo rights, gender equality and the increasing need to counter the growth in extreme, far-right politics throughout Europe.Also this week, the South Down MP described British government immigration proposals as ldquounpopular, unworkable and a direct threat to economic well-being in South Down.Responding to proposals confirmed by the Home Office that immigration policy in Northern Ireland will change from next year, the MP warned that far from strengthening the economic wellbeing of society, the proposals are a direct threat to the local hospitality, tourism, retail and agri-food sectors.Mr Hazzard declared: ldquoIt is hard not to view these proposals as an elitist, xenophobic attack on overseas and low-paid workers, the vast majority of whom we simply cannot live without.ldquoIndeed, most worryingly, these proposals are a cruel attack on our care sector the wonderful, selfless heroes whom we all rely on to take care of us and our families in our hour of need.Mr Hazzard said it is ldquoabundantly clear that the Home Office has completely ignored what he described as the ldquoNorthrsquos unique and special circumstances and has shown nothing but contempt for local business and industry leaders who have engaged constructively with British government officials in recent years.The MP added: ldquoSinn Feacutein will be raising these concerns directly with the British government in the weeks to come..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/26th February 2020 Down.jpg","title":"Down District has two of worst roads in NI  ","story":"TWO of the worst roads in Northern Ireland are in Down District and just miles apart, it has been revealed.They are the Shore Road in Strangford and the Blackstaff Road in Clough which are placed first and third respectively in the list of the provincersquos worst roads, the Department for Infrastructure has confirmed.New statistics revealed by the government department confirm that a total of  defects mdash including pot holes mdash were recorded on both roads last year.Government officials say that  defects were recorded on the Shore Road and  on the Blackstaff Road.The Department has confirmed that between  and  it paid out a staggering pound.m to drivers across Northern Ireland whose vehicles had been damaged by potholes.Years of underinvestment has led to a deterioration of Northern Irelandrsquos roads according to Stormont infrastructure minister, Nichola Mallon, who is making poundm available to help address the issue.The cash will also be used for winter gritting services and to help repair the tens of thousands of street lights that are out across the country.Ms Mallon explained that years of underinvestment as well as the impact of severe winter weather has led to deterioration in the road network and in recent years this has impacted on the level of vehicle damage compensation payments.Last year, Northern Irelandrsquos public spending watchdog warned that it would cost more than poundbn to deal with structural maintenance.The Northern Ireland Audit Office published a report highlighting how a lack of investment was having a deteriorating effect on the overall condition of Northern Irelandrsquos road network and found that a lack of funding had led to a signicant reduction in the number of potholes being recorded and approved for repair.Ms Mallon said that ldquofrustratingly for a number of years now not enough money had been allocated to her departmentrsquos budget to maintain roads and repairs were having to be

I started to do some practice tricks with Stella where she would move between and around my legs and she was fantastic.ldquoI loved the thought of going to a dog show with mum for the whole day and meeting lots of other dogs so I started going to class regularly with mum.Ann, Fiona and their dogs, Stella, Minty and Turfy mdash another Bichon Frise mdash are trained by Irene Hull, from KARC in Dromore,As Stella was going deaf when Ann first started to work with her, Irene knew that the OneMind Dogs method of training using body language would be perfect for Ann and Stella.Fiona said: ldquoI really donrsquot know how Ann does it, but she picked up the technique so fast and now her and Stella are so effective together. Ann has become a much better trainer that I am and Stella competes better with her than she did with me.Ann added: ldquoThe only problem I used to have is that Stella would run off to mumshe missed a weave and I couldnrsquot call her back.ldquoConnection is the most important thing for Stella and I at the moment as because she is deaf, I have to keep her looking at me and focusing on me when she is running. I guide her with my hands, feet and my chest laser point.Apart from training, Ann and Stella have a normal loving relationship between a child and a best friend who happens to be a dog.Ann said: ldquoStella loves snacks and as soon as the fridge door opens, she goes wild, spinning in circles of joy.ldquoShersquos allowed to sleep on my bed the nights she has a bath. Thatrsquos what mum and dad think but as soon as they turn off my light, she sneaks under the blanket for a proper snuggle.She has her eyes set on claiming her mumrsquos other dog, Turfy.ldquoMum had her eye on training Turfy as he is fast and very keen, but he loves me more and runs way better for me, said Ann. ldquoI have been training him as well and we should be ready for competitions this summer.Ann hopes to show what she and Stella can do in front of her classmates as her principal has said she can bring the dog into school for a demonstration..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/26th February 2020 This.jpg","title":"This Is Your Life surprise as David celebrates 100th birthday  ","story":"IT was a case of lsquoThis Is Your Lersquo for retired Carryduff farmer David Patterson when he was presented with a book chronicling  years of his amazing le.Mr Patterson, from the townland of Clontonacally, was surrounded by family, friends and members of his church, Trinity Presbyterian Church in Boardmills, when he celebrated becoming a centenarian at the weekend.For younger readers, This is Your Le was a famous TV programme where celebrities and people of note from all walks of le were surprised by the presenter with a book detailing the personrsquos many achievements.Mr Pattersonrsquos book, lovingly put together by his children, Margaret and Martin, was just one highlight of the weekend of celebrations hosted in his honour.The book shows the many changes that the diary farmer witnessed over the last  years, including pictures of him gathering in hay using horses and carts in the s and s, through to his international travels in later years.His family took him to Las Vegas for his th birthday, which included a helicopter flight over the Grand Canyon.

It affirms that religious officiants should not be able to solemnise a same-sex marriage in situations where their governing body has not approved same-sex marriage. Even where a governing body has approved same-sex marriage and made provision for it, a clergyperson should have the right to refuse to conduct such a marriage . Where a religious officiant refuses to marry a same-sex couple, that officiant should not be considered to have acted in breach of equality legislation.• Civil partnershipsThe church’s decision not to provide for same-sex marriage is unchanged. The doctrine of the Church of Ireland is that marriage is between one man and one woman this is therefore the only form of marriage which may be celebrated within the church. Anglican doctrine is expressed through liturgy, and the Church has no liturgy in relation to civil partnership or same-sex marriage. The context for the response is that there has been an alteration of the legal framework affecting a range of civil provisions, but this will not affect the church’s teaching.Your headline is entirely misleading in implying that the Church and Society Commission has decided to defy the doctrinal position of the Church of Ireland exactly the contrary was made clear in the response to the newspaper.The House of Bishops, in its statement following the  marriage referendum in the Republic, affirmed that the state is acting fully within its rightsit decides to alter its legal definition of marriage.This does not affect or alter the church’s understanding of how it celebrates marriage.The Rt Revd Dr Kenneth Kearon, Bishop of Limerick and Killaloe, chair, Church and Society Commission"},{"url":null,"title":"simple steps anyone can take help contain coronavirus ","story":"Sinn Fein says Gerry Adams can keep all £k Oireachtas pension – but it will slash all future retirement payments for TDsSudden death of person on NI railway line being investigated by PSNI - line now reopenedNewsLatestTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthOpinionPeopleRead ThisSportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats OnThings To DoArts and EntertainmentNightleRetroLestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensNewsOpinionSimple steps that anyone can take to help contain the coronavirusThat a patient in Northern Ireland has now tested positive for coronavirus is highly regrettable but hardly surprising.By The NewsroomFriday, th February , : amUpdated Friday, th February , : am\"\"News Letter editorialThe virus is spreading rapidly round the world, and has been identied in more than  countries.The details of the NI affected patient, believed to be a woman who travelled up to the Province from Dublin with a child, and her exact movements are not yet known.

Who they are will have a real influence on Welsh Labourrsquos prospects in  and beyond. We are the most successful part of the UK Labour family over the last decade in terms of winning elections and running a national government. However, that cannot be taken for granted. An unpopular UK leader could make our task much harder next May.The first and most important attribute the next UK leader must have is the ability to fulfil the mission of our party - to become a party of government again across the UK, not just a party of protest. I want someone who can implement our labour values in government, not just talk about them.That requires some honesty about why we took such a beating at the general election, together with the willingness and strength to do something about it. Offering more of the same would be a betrayal of people who need a UK Labour government and will condemn the UK [or what is left of it] to a further decade of the Tories.We didnrsquot get hammered in  for one reason alone - there were a number of them. Agreeing to the election in the first place when we plainly were not prepared. Agreeing to an election certain to be dominated by Brexit. Our vacillation on Brexit when people wanted certainty and leadership. The factional infighting. The demonisation of the last UK Labour government, asthat would encourage people to vote for us. I grew up with  Tory years in power and I know that things really did get better following Labourrsquos victory in .An overloaded manesto with some popular policies but without a key central message. A costed manesto that then had a huge extra spending pledge added to it, meaning that people didnrsquot believe that we were serious or credible one even the policies they liked. A staggeringly inept UK campaign that wasted the amazing dedication of our volunteers, prepared to go out in the cold and rain to campaign. Our abject failure on anti-Semitism. This and much more.Many people recognised that Boris Johnson is a dishonest man who is completely out of touch with most peoplersquos lives. Lots of people still voted for him or refused to vote Labour because they could not trust and support us. Our own people - long term Labour voters - struggled to support us. Our leader was undeniably part of the reason why. Blaming our defeat solely on the mainstream media or whichever side of the Brexit ide we favour isnt honest and will not help us to win in the future.I donrsquot much care whether someone claims they are from the left, soft left, centre or old right of the Labour Party. We all have a stake in our party and the countries of the UK. These are serious times and we need a serious figure who can nail the Tories and the clown in number ten.Irsquove been interested in what Lisa Nandy has to say and believe that Lisa and many other figures have a key role to play in rebuilding our party ndash first as a credible opposition, then as a credible alternative government at the next UK General Election.However, I think the person best placed to win the argument, and even more importantly to help us win an election, is Keir Starmer. Itrsquos not the protesting, or the taking part that counts. Itrsquos the winning and the decisions you get to make in government that can change peoplesrsquo lives and change the country for the better. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

But must also find a new UK Labour Leader who has what takes to unite, win, and ensure the UK Labour Party has a credible vision fit for the world of the s and s ndash and a Leader capable of speaking for and winning the confidence of the whole country.I was delighted to see so many talented and thoughtful colleagues putting themselves forward for election. There are things being said by many that we need to listen to.But, after speaking to many of the candidates personally, and asking them all tough questions - I am backing Keir Starmer for Leader. I think hersquos got what it takes to hold this government immediately and robustly to account to build a team of all the talents and crucially that he has the vision, ideas and credibility to win again.Keir joined me on the streets of Penarth speaking to voters and local businesses during the election campaign ndash and it was clear by the warmth of the reception he received that he is someone who has the immediate credibility and credentials to be our future prime minister, and would work in partnership with Welsh Labour.He has crucial experience of public service and confronting powerful vested interests for the good of the country. He acted to prosecute MPs who had abused expenses and Murdoch journalists in the phone-hacking scandal when he was Director of Public Prosecutions.We need to win back these voters that we lost in the last general election. It was heart-breaking on election night, to see Labour lose places like Wrexham and Bridgend.The UK Labour Party must get back to being a party that votersrsquo can trust. That means we cannot just have a ldquoone more heave approach. We need someone who can speak to the whole of our country, not just one region or subset of voters, with the values and vision to win.

Natural Resources Wales and the Welsh Assembly should not ignore the issue this time around.Responding to public concerns about the new plans, a spokesman for the Welsh Government said: ldquoIf EDF Energy submits a formal application, Natural Resources Wales will carry out a thorough assessment of the proposed activity before making a determination, having regard to the need to protect the environment and human health, as required by the Marine and Coastal Access Act .ldquoI know many constituents are very worried, said Stephen Doughty MP for Cardf South and Penarth.ldquoWe shouldnrsquot be a dumping ground for others, and I will continue to raise concerns on behalf of residents and report back any information I receive.To comment on the proposed sample plan, visit NRWrsquos consultation page before Wednesday, March  at: naturalresources.wales permits-and-permissions permit-applications-consultations-and-decisions current-consultations-marine-licence-applicantions hinkley-point-c-sediment-sampling-plan-sp  langen article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It was Captain Robertrsquos who did it.Mr Davies spent time conducting research in Bilbao, Durango, Gernika, and Alicante where he consulted Spanish historians and met with descendants of those involved in the civil war.Outwitting Franco: The Welsh Maritime Heroes of the Spanish Civil War can be purchased on Amazon for pound in paperback.Alternatively, it can be purchased digitally for pound on Kindle. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

I enjoy it all ndash from meeting the parents and their child on admission, to organising the annual budget and ensuring the school is well resourced and maintained.The school recently renewed its green status under the Welsh Governmentrsquos coloured banding system which recognises its high performance.The New Curriculum for Wales, which will be implemented in , has already been fully embraced by the school.Staff have been trained in co-operative learning and emphasis has been placed on active participation in class.The school prioritises the health and wellbeing of its students.Mrs Thompson said: ldquoThe school has a recognised ethos of warmth, care, and love with an inidual approach to all pupils and their families which ensures that children feel secure and make the best academic and social progress throughout their school le.In January, the school was invited to become a flagship school as part of the Jigsaw programme, a mindful approach to personal and social education.This is further supported by the schoolrsquos Values Programme which promotes values such as honesty through books, lessons and visiting speakers.There are also several wellbeing groups which support the childrenrsquos needs.As part of its movement towards the New Curriculum, the school developed a new project this year, CF: Our Local Area and Beyond.This encouraged children to explore their local community and express what they liked about it.As part of the CF project, Year  visited Peter Alan and are currently undertaking drawing work to be displayed in the estate agentrsquos window.Year  were invited to the opening of the play park in the Edenstone Woodlands housing development where each student planted a flower bulb as part of the CF project.The school received pound from Studio Response for their participation.As anyone who visits the school will know, books are highly valued. Mrs Thompson is personally committed to creating a culture of enthusiasm for reading and said that she enjoyed seeing children becoming readers and getting ldquohooked on books.ldquoTo be able to read opens all education to our children, she continued.ldquoResearch is forever reporting that a child who is read to or who reads for pleasure will become a success.The schoolrsquos library holds an extensive collection of literature and each term a portion of the school budget is allocated for the purchase of books.On World Book Day, the owner of Grfin Books, Mel Grfin, will bring a pop-up book shop to Dinas Powys Primary where children can buy a book for pound.The school also participates in eCalm in collaboration with Dinas Powys Library, meaning that every child is a member.The school has its own student council, Pupil Voice, which is active on both sites.The Eco Committee recently introduced an Eco Bear to encourage all pupils to be eco-friendly and this year the school had its Platinum Status renewed by Eco Schools.The school has invested heavily in Lego resources and iPads and has received grant funding from Dow Corning supporting this investment in promoting science, technology, engineering, and mathematics .As part of its commitment to the importance of STEM, the school participates in the National Primary Maths Challenge.Two students from Dinas Powys Primary have reached the Bonus Round in this yearrsquos challenge.The school has achieved the Cymraeg Campus Bronze Award Charter that commends its commitment to the Welsh language and culture.Strong links with outside agencies include CAVMS music tuition and JAFFA Club.Last November, students from Dinas Powys Primary School performed Shakespearersquos The Tempest at The Riverfront Theatre, Newport, as part of the Shakespeare Schools Foundation.They also sang at St Davidrsquos Hall with the Cardf and Vale Christmas Showcase Cluster Choir in December.The schoolrsquos two dance squads will shortly be performing at Barry Memorial Hall for Best Foot Forward on Wednesday, March .For more information on the school, visit dinaspowysps article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Of those who received the benefit,  per cent were unemployed.Universal Credit began in  and has been gradually rolled out across the country. It was designed to simply the benefits system for working age people by merging six separate benefits into one payment.But features such as the -week wait, the -child limit and the benefits cap, as well as public spending cuts, have been associated with a rise in rent arrears, food bank usage and child poverty.Local homelessness charity, Llamau, has expressed concern for young people who are being enrolled on the scheme.Joe Payne, head of vale services and family mediation for Llamau, said: ldquoPrior to the introduction of Universal Credit, a young person may have claimed Job Seekers Allowance or Employment Support Allowance but this is no longer an option.ldquoUndoubtedly, the five week waiting time and a very low National Minimum Wage for people under  is going to cause young people untold hardship and in a lot of cases, spiralling debt.A Department for Work and Pension spokesman said the increase in  to -year olds claiming Universal Credit is lsquoin line with expectationsrsquo as it has been rolled out to every job centre.Jane Hutt, AM for the Vale of Glamorgan, said: ldquoI am concerned at the rise in the number of claimants, particularly young people, who need to access Universal Credit.ldquoCare leavers in particular are being disadvantaged by the changes. I do not believe the concerns that have been raised by claimants, by employers and by organisations advising and supporting people affected, including those who are in employment, have been addressed and I will continue to raise them on behalf of my constituents.The government has committed to ending a four-year benefit freeze in April this year, meaning millions of people will see their payments rise by the same rate as inflation.Councillor Kathryn McCaffer, Vale of Glamorgan Council youth champion, said: ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council is working with a range of partners to mitigate any adverse impacts and offer a iety of support to young people in financial dficulties. Those classed as Not in Education, Employment or Trainingcan access the Inspire  Work programme, which provides financial help to pay for the likes of work clothes, training and travel costs.ldquoVulnerable tenants are protected from debt through the direct payments system. Currently around  per cent of tenants have this system in place, which allows a portion of Universal Credit payments to be made directly to the council to cover rent.ldquoThis year, the council has been able to secure over pound, of additional income for tenants by helping them secure backdated claims, ensuring the correct benefits are being received, assisting with appeals, and helping secure the best tarfs for utilities. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

If anything at all is playing on my mind, I never lose my appetite, but I will lose slumber. I have friends who similarly suffer. I use the word suffer quite deliberately, because lying there in the dark at am it can feel like everyone  is snuffling softly but for the wide-awake person, it can feel horrendous. As the time ticks closer to the alarm and still sleep will not come, it can feel quite anxiety-inducing and so the vicious circle whizzes, fizzes and flies through your brain making sleep feel further and further away.But, as this is a lelong way of living for me and I am overwhelmingly a lsquocrack on kinda womanrsquo, I have developed ways to use this time effectively. I listen to podcasts, and have learned about biohacking, how broccoli defends itself and the many twists and turns of the Brexit negotiations whilst the street snoozes. I catch up with messages . I also think a lot. I just lay there in the dark and puzzle though story ideas, events from the day and issues facing friends, family and myself. In a twisted way, this time and opportunity has become quite precious to me. I donrsquot know when  in the day Irsquod have the time and space to just ponder, muse, consider and percolate. It is during this time that I have considered my earlier point about jealousy. None of us know what is going on behind the closed door of either someonersquos home or their mind and whilst I hope you sleep well,you canrsquot, use that time wisely to think, to empathise and to learn. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Rather than adhering to a nationally prescribed learning program, schools and practitioners will be able to make decisions that best meet the needs of specic learners.As well as contributing to the framework, St Josephrsquos has also introduced their own bespoke curriculum, and is one of only  Curriculum Innovation Schools in Wales.The St Josephrsquos curriculum is based on findings in child development and cognitive science, with staff undertaking extensive learning on how childrenrsquos bodies and minds develop.Lessons have been designed to enhance pupilsrsquo personal, social and physical development, whilst also providing a detailed knowledge and understanding of the world, both past and present.The school has also benefitted from signicant on-site works, including the refurbishment of all classrooms, a complete reconfiguration of the Foundation Phase learning spaces and a state of the art new-build Nursery.Staff regularly deliver learning experiences outside of the classroom, as the schoolrsquos grounds include a playing field, wooded area, pond, orchard, wildflower meadow and polytunnel.The implementation of the schoolrsquos ambitious curriculum has seen standards improve year on year. Last yearrsquos National Reading Tests saw the average child in St Josephrsquos score within the top  percent of the country, with similarly high standards achieved in mathematics.Headteacher, Gareth Rein said: ldquoWersquore extremely proud of our achievements at St Josephrsquos. Everything we do is based on the best available research and is designed to help each inidual child thrive.Cabinet Member for Education and Regeneration, Councillor Lis Burnett, said: ldquoThe new Curriculum for Wales is inspiring schools to take a more holistic approach toward learning. It encourages them to focus more on how and why the curriculum is being delivered, rather than delivering specic content and academic results.ldquoSt Josephrsquos have done a brilliant job in helping craft this approach, and in turn have seen their own curriculum and learning practices blossom.St Josephrsquos will be hosting an open day on Wednesday March .

The short list of potential locations for e-bike stations includes Penarth Town Centre, Cogan Train Centre, Penarth Train Station, Llandough Hospital, The Esplanade, Cosmeston Country Park, Cardf Bay Barrage, and Pont-y-Werin Bridge.The scheme hopes to encourage people to switch from their daily car journey to e-bikes, saving on average g of CO for every  kilometre travelled.The average round trip from Penarth to Cardf is km, which would save ,g of COused daily.Nextbike Managing Director, Krysia Solheim, said the Penarth scheme would be great for those who commute into the capital.ldquoWe know from our research that a lot of commuters already cycle from Penarth into Cardf, said Ms Solheim.ldquoE-bikes will make that journey easier and quicker than ever before, which will hopefully persuade more people to switch from four wheels to two on a daily basis. Picking up an e-bike instead of jumping in the car is also a great way for people to reduce their own personal carbon footprints to help our communities tackle climate change.ldquoPenarth will play an important part in leading the bike share revolution in Wales - itrsquos an exciting time - and we want the community to be as involved as possible.\"Councillor Peter King, Cabinet Member for Neighbourhood Services and Transport, said: ldquoFeedback from the Nextbike consultation was overwhelmingly positive, with many residents hoping to see the expansion of the scheme to the wider Vale.ldquoHaving declared a climate emergency last year, and having recently proposed a pound.m investment into tackling environmental issues, the Nextbike scheme will be a leading example of our commitment to tackling climate change and improving the wellbeing of our residents. We hope this will inspire the launch of similar schemes in future.The Nextbike project is being funded by Section  sustainable transport contributions. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

With their parents Sam and Christina , they lived in Florence Court, Edenderry. A fth brother Bertie, tragically died at a young age.The four brothers shared an unbreakable bond centred chiefly around football. They played together for The Church Lads Brigade and were members of the Edenderry United Team which won the McKinney Cup in . Joe went on to play for three seasons for BanbridgeTown and during these seasons the team was unbeaten. Indeed, Joe had a trial for an Under  Intermediate Team.In his mid s he stood in for an absent member of a rugby team and ended up as a scrum half and team captain. He was a long associate of Chambers’ Park Rugby and wore his Club blazer with immense pride.Joe married Pearl Forde in  andever there was a ‘marriage made in heaven’ this was it.They adored each other and ‘sparred’ with one another as only true soulmates can. They had one adored daughter, Elizabeth, who tragically died aged  in  a sorrow Joe and Pearl bore in quiet faith. Le was never the same for Joe after his beloved Pearl died on  February .Joe, as with all his siblings, was raised in a Christian home and infused with a quiet yet unbending Christian faith. His willingness to bear the burdens of others and his desire to aid his fellow man manested itself in his role as a trade union shop stewart. His integrity and forthrightness earned respect and in most of his workplaces he was both foreman and shop steward. Physically tough he relied upon God in times of sorrow for the inner strength which toughness cannot supply.He was also, with his brothers, a member of Seagoe Church Lads Brigade Pipe Band and the quartet of three pipers and a drummer often practiced in the front room of their family home.Joe also thoroughly enjoyed the Lambeg Drums and Saturday nights in his mid to latter years were spent at ious drumming competitions. Joe was employed in ious weaving factories, one of which was Brookfield Mill in Banbridge and he was heartbroken when it closed down.Pearl and Joe and Elizabeth enjoyed many seasons at their caravan in Kilkeel and Saturday nights were taken up with playing pool with his good friend Sinclair Brown. Later they upgraded to a bigger caravan and continued their trips until Pearl’s death.Joe lived all his le in Edenderry and much of his married le in the house beside his parents in Watson Street.In his latter years after Pearl’s death Joe had a very structured schedule. A daily trip up the town included first stop Winnie’s Newsagent in Woodhouse Street for his paper, which had to be rolled up and secured with an elastic band. Next visit was to Gaynor’s Cafe in Church Lane where the staff didn’t even need to ask what Joe’s order was but once his foot crossed the door they had already started preparing it. His night time routine included a walk up around Portadown. But when family became concerned for his safety, he assured them that nobody would touch him and that he always carried his walking stick anyhow.As an avid Edenderry man, Joe was heavily involved in the generational annual construction of Edenderry arch. Mr Roney’s funeral was on Monday February  in Seagoe Parish Church following by interment in Seagoe Cemetery.\"\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bGbJRg bZbGUI\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-gtfDJT hQGsjX\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bGbJRg bZbGUI\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-gtfDJT hQGsjX\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportWhats OnLestyleMore from Portadown TimesAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-bYSBpT sc-elJkPf kHpvMx\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherEducationBusinessPoliticsHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessFollow us    "},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/EHP_20191205_4696_web.jpg","title":"pulse pr a decade in northern ireland communications","story":"Posted on Friday  January  by Ulster Business Pulse PR’s Grainne McGarvey sits down with Ulster Business at the Fitzwilliam Hotel in Belfast to chat about marking  years in business amid an evolving media landscape, growing from strong entrepreneurial family roots and the next step in her company’s journey A bold decision a decade ago to go out on her own and establish Pulse PR has seen Grainne McGarvey work with a range of clients to help sell their message to a wider audience. In the last few years Pulse PR has worked with clients include Applegreen, during the roll-out of its first stores in Northern Ireland, jewellery retailer Argento that has over  high street stores in Ireland and one of Ireland’s most iconic gt wear brands, Belleek. And with a business spirit which has helped take root due to her father’s own entrepreneurial background, Grainne’s developed her own firm over the last  years – growing with the changing media landscape, creating communications and marketing strategies, working with tech start-ups from the ground up and building on strong media relationships. “For seven years I had worked with PR agencies and businesses such as Barclays, Tayto and Tesco. I was approaching  and I decided it was now or never,” she told Ulster Business. Networking at Down Royal Racecourse with a pocket full of business cards saw her leave with three clients, and from that, the business was born. Although Pulse PR was initially centred around work with public relations and press, Grainne now works with a lot of start-ups, particularly those within tech – her business is also based at Catalyst, formerly the Northern Ireland Science Park, which is the largest technology park here. One of those she’s now working closely with is IRP Commerce – a £m turnover software development company which made it on to Deloitte’s Technology Fast  list of high growth technology companies seven times. “That relationship started eight years ago with a press release, and now I work with them to target retailers, manufacturers and distributors across the UK, promoting its e-commerce  at national conferences and building strategic relationships with key players in the e-commerce industry. When I started it was very traditional PR, and dealing with newspapers and magazines. Now, it’s also grown further into the digital sphere with online PR, blogging and video testimonials. “I’ve seen a big sht in how my time is spent from when I started  years ago. Although clients still value print coverage, there is definitely a demand to create engaging campaigns for social media. “Because of how the world is changing, I have had to ersy as well. It’s about being flexible and realising the developing trends, and trying to adapt. I’ve always been comfortable in front of the camera or with a microphone in my hand so turned this into a business opportunity to host events, commentate on radio or host  at tech conferences – there is an under-representation of women in this sector so it’s a gap I believe I fill.” As a self-employed businesswoman, Grainne extends her reach with clients by collaborating with freelance photographers, designers and videographers. “You have to get results for your clients. I purposely keep my client list manageable so I’m not competing against myself and I can broaden the scope of activity I do for them,” she says. Grainne also works with Catalyst on its Springboard programme as a marketing domain expert, giving start-up companies assistance when they are bringing their product to market. She says most of her clients come through referrals from other companies she’s been involved with. “Referrals are great as it means I’ve done a good job for the person referring me. I also find a lot of work comes from people I have previously worked with or went to school with. Northern Ireland is known for having two degrees of separation – this also applies in the business world.” She’s also been working with the Ulster Farmers’ Union this year to help promote the organisation’s Open Farm Weekend. It’s an initiative, sponsored by Bank of Ireland UK, to allow members of the public to pay a visit to a farm for the first time. “This is a new sector for me, but the principles are the same – find out the end user and then apply the right marketing tools to engage with them. “It’s about fitting in with a company and how that business thinks – being adaptable and working out what they want, and trying to help them grow. It’s about presenting a strong and clear message, developing strong media contacts and also working across digital and print media to boost reach.” In  years, the media and PR landscape has evolved, including how information is consumed. “But I’m still a firm believer in knowing the basics,” she says. “It’s about having the experience and the education to be able to do it. After my degree and Master’s, I studied to gain additional post-graduate qualications from the Chartered Institute of Marketing. I’m a firm believer in le-long learning. Too many people starting in the industry think all the need is a smartphone and an Instagram account. “It’s competitive, but there’s always enough business for everyone out there. You really just need a few clients and then you turn your focus to them, as well as working with others as and when they come. A few projects naturally ended last year so I’ll be expanding my client list in the coming months. It’s always exciting to start with a new company or entrepreneur. “It’s about being flexible and being aware of what is going on with your clients, and being proactive. Being a sole-trader means you are flexible and can work closely with companies, either in their office or remotely as an extended member of their marketing team. I have often thought about employing more staff, but I believe clients want to see me working on their account, rather than meeting me at the pitch and then being passed over to a junior member of staff. “There’s a great satisfaction in helping an innovative small business, which is set for bigger things, and working alongside them in getting their message out there, building, growing and creating jobs. You really want to work with them and help build their business. “It’s about building the relationships and contacts, and that’s something you can’t teach. People buy from people and I believe one of the reasons I have kept many of the same clients for  years is because I always go the extra mile and am true to my word.” Grainne’s desire  years ago to go it alone with Pulse PR is something she says is very much part of the family story. “My father Malachy is an entrepreneur, a mechanic by trade, but he’s always been able to turn his hand to everything,” she says. My sister Orla was also self-employed as a pharmacist. I’ve been brought up in that environment and we’ve always had support and a ‘can do’ attitude from our mother Geraldine. I had a baby, Gabriel, four months ago but didn’t get the option to take maternity leave. This is the downside of being self-employed, but the flipside means I can work from home when I need to.” As for the next  years, Grainne says it’s about trying to give something back, using her skills to help those who have little or no experience in knowing how to bring their message and products to the fore. “I’m still as passionate about business as I was  years ago. I’m excited to see how I can continue to use my skills to add value to clients to ensure their message and their voice is heard.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail_MM-Photo-1.jpg","title":"manufacturing month ni to showcase strength of sector","story":"Posted on Tuesday  January  by Ulster Business Economy Minister Diane Doods with Manufacturing NIs Stephen Kelly Northern Ireland’s burgeoning manufacturing sector will be showcased as part of a major initiative to highlight the strength and excellence of the industry here.

The event, sponsored by KPMG, Siemens, Willis Towers Watson, Barclays, and Invest NI, Manufacturing Month NI will bring together industry leaders, politicians and policy experts, young people and schools, and other business leaders to celebrate manufacturers and engineers, and explore and discuss the challenges which face the industry in Northern Ireland. “We are very pleased to be launching the inaugural Manufacturing Month NI, taking place this March,” Stephen Kelly, chief executive, Manufacturing NI, said. “The manufacturing sector in Northern Ireland is the foundation of our regional economy. Manufacturing Month is a celebration of the great people, in great local companies, making great products used at home and around the world. From food processing and pharmaceuticals to aeronautical technology and new, emerging tech like AI and machine learning, Northern Ireland punches well above its weight when it comes to producing world-class products and services.” “This new initiative not only celebrates the people who make our manufacturing sector the world leader that it is but will create a legacy and a pathway for the next generation of sector leaders. A key feature of Manufacturing Month NI will be a major outreach and engagement programme with schools and regional colleges, focused on promoting the sector to young people, developing the crucial skills they need as they enter the industry.” “We hope to see as many companies as possible across theand breadth of Northern Ireland get involved with Manufacturing Month NI. We are keen to highlight new products, new initiatives, workplace tours, business expansion, and everything  in between to showcase the strength and quality of our local manufacturing sector.” And Economy Minister, Diane Dodds, said: “I commend Manufacturing NI for this new initiative which celebrates one of Northern Ireland’s most vital sectors. Northern Ireland has a long and proud history of manufacturing and engineering brilliance. Manufacturing Month NI will highlight the immense talent of the local sector. By supporting innovative initiatives like Manufacturing Month NI, we are showcasing the best and brightest in one of our most important industries.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/cath1.jpg","title":"belfast city centre pubs facing m rates surge","story":"Posted on Thursday  January  by John Mulgrew The heart of Belfast’s pub and hotel scene could see rates bills soar by % and have a “crippling effect on the area” – amounting to an additional £.m a year – as part of a government revaluation, Ulster Business can reveal.A study of almost two dozen hospitality businesses in the popular Cathedral Quarter area – one of the main destinations for tourists visiting Belfast – could see a rates increase on average of almost % for pubs, while hotels in the area could see bills rise by more than a third.A survey of  bars shows the total expected rates bills could rise by £, a year, while five hotels in the area could see them in total rise by £,.It’s claimed the surge could have knock on effect on the area, including rising prices for the consumer. The revamp is part of the Department of Finance’s Reval – which is a reassessment of the rates system which businesses pay. While still a draft schedule of values, each council will also have to apply its own regional rate, based on the new proposed figures.“The Cathedral Quarter isn’t just about eating and drinking,” Gareth Neill, BID manager, Destination CQ told Ulster Business.“We have a vibrant ecosystem of arts and culture and fantastic built heritage that makes this area stand out, hospitality plays an integral part to the quality of le in this part of Belfast – for a city to be striving to attract new residents, increase our tourism offer these are crucial to the city’s success. “We are concerned about that the potential knock-on effects to the affected business owners and there’s a very real possibility it will have an impact on the price of a pint to the people who come to socialise in Cathedral Quarter. The knock-on effect of outdated methodology for calculation of rates on licensed premiseshas a potentially crippling effect on jobs and character of this area.”A spokesman for Land  Property Services said: “In Northern Ireland, nearly % of pubs will have no change or a decrease in their Net Annual Value .“Any business rate payer who thinks their new valuation may be incorrect, can contact LPS to arrange an informal review and supply any relevant information before the new valuation list comes into force on  April .”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/mip1.jpg","title":"mipim taking belfast to the world","story":"Posted on Friday  January  by Ulster Business Joe ONeill and Suzanne Wylie Belfast Harbour boss Joe O’Neill will help lead a private and public sector delegation to MIPIM – the world’s biggest commercial property event – as chairman of the taskforce. He chats to John Mulgrew about the big announcements, fighting off the competition and attracting a global giant to Northern Ireland For Joe O’Neill and the wider delegation heading to potentially warmer climates, the proposition of selling the city and wider region to major investors has gotten easier.In the five years since Belfast ed to MIPIM – an event which sees tens of thousands descend on Cannes in France for four days of real estate and development – the private and public team, and taskforce, have developed a “strong ” in which to sell the city and Northern Ireland, with hopes of attracting a big name insurance or tech firm on the list.“MIPIM is a great  for the promotion of city-wide initiatives, and demonstrating to investors and to occupiers the growth potential in the city, and the opportunities for them and that the key stakeholders are all aligned behind an appropriate growth agenda,” Joe says.“You see dferent sizes and scales of stands out there – you see some really ambitious stands and proposed developments, so Belfast has to see it’s entry point into that. Belfast first and foremost will be competing against peer group cities within the UK… but then it is a worldwide show, so you will be competing against other cities.”Belfast is leading a major delegation this year, and will also be joined by representatives from other Northern Ireland councils, including those that are part of the Belfast Region City Deal, such as Mid  East Antrim. That deal is also going to be a focus for announcements and development, during the event.This year’s delegation will be led by a host of top private sector developers in Northern Ireland, alongside Belfast City Council and organisations such as Belfast Harbour. That includes Bywater, Wirefox, Titanic Quarter, Tribeca, McAleer  Rushe and Graham Group, along with the two universities and others working within related fields from law, professional services and the supply chain.For Joe and the delegation, MIPIM represents an opportunity to announce some of Belfast and Northern Ireland’s wider major new infrastructure and commercial plans. Previous visits have included the announcement of major offices schemes, hotels and apartment developments.“We will have a series of announcements – some of those announcements will be new, and some will be progress, and demonstrating to investors or occupiers that progress has been madeit’s a multi-year scheme, to show we are delivering.“… we have new projects coming through the pipeline in ious sectors. This year we are looking at launching schemes around digital innovation. That aligns with one of the themes in the Belfast Region City Deal, for the city and councils in the deal. We have a particular focus on cyber-security as an investment and operating location – particular those from the US.”Joe says that would be in addition to the already well-established cyber-security development at Catalyst in the Titanic Quarter, and that new names are coming in to the marketplace creating a “cluster” around the sector, and setting up Belfast and beyond as a new global hub.“We are looking at announcing some details around the Belfast-Dublin-London corridor,” Joe says.“As an economic corridor, or triangle. Post-Brexit, there are clear synergies in developing a proposition where companies can avail of the three locationsthey are looking at a global footprint, and see advantages to locations in three cities.”The issue of increasing connectivity between Belfast and Dublin also remains high on the list – improving the speed and frequency, and making developers aware of the new Belfast Transport Hub, which will transform the city’s rail and bus connectivity when complete.For Belfast Harbour, it’s also bringing the expansion of its already successful film studios to MIPIM, amid further plans to grow and develop the hub to attract big names and become the largest of its kind outside London.“We will be revealing more of our expansion plans, which is being supported by NI Screen,” Joe said. Some of those delivering their own presentations to potential investors will include the Harbour, Belfast City Council, Catalyst and the universities. “We are out looking around, when we are there, at what dferent cities are doing – seeing whether something works well, and looking at our competitive advantage in that area.”As for the strengths and attraction for potential investors, Joe says: “Skills, talent and technology are very much at the fore. Agility as a small region and to be able to respond, and seeing that team Belfast is there and that we are aligned with a particular project. It doesn’t have to be taken back home and introduced to someone .“There is the emergence of Belfast as an attractive city – investment opening up, and people are always looking at new markets. “Part of the initial roll-out when I took on the chair of MIPIM, the role was to go around to ask those who were on board previously to ask about it,it had changed. Everyone noticed and recognised considerablechange over the last four years. “We were pioneering and establishing ourselves four years ago, now they felt we were very much a concerted and effective operating team… the collective was a powerful message, and having  or lunches involving all of the stakeholders at one time. It’s a really strong  to take on the next chapter.”So, for Joe and the rest of the MIPIM delegation, what would be considered a major goal or success on the back of the visit to the commercial property show in March  “A particular focus this year is to attract key institutional investors – the big insurance companies for example. That’s a chicken and egg situation… you need to have product, to have product you have to show that you have occupiers and a steady revenue stream. “What we have been able to say to the investment market is ‘we have product and we now have sustainable occupation coming through… now it feels like the right time for you as an investor, to come in, and to support further investment’.”Asked whether replicating the successes of our neighbours in Dublin in attracting tech giants such as Apple, Facebook and Google is also on the cards, Joe says: “Something like that, or a major investor. For them to do that – a technology or an investment company – they need to see that the public, private and third-tier sectors are all collaborating together to make an effective market, and I think we are good at doing that now.”And the timing couldn’t be better for the delegation – now able to go in with a clear mandate and message with the restoration of the Executive and ato day-to-day power-sharing politics.“The positive thing for us is with the government and secondly, somearound Brexit… it takes those two challenging issues off the table.” πView all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/johnm1.jpg","title":"companies must act quickly on new ir legislation reforms","story":"Posted on Monday February  by Ulster Business At the start of this year the government launched a review into the changes to IR legislation which will affect medium and large private sector organisations and have far-reaching impacts on the way they engage with non-permanent workers, writes John Moore, managing director, Hays NI.The timeframe between the review and the reforms coming into effect in April is shorter than many would have liked but with the reforms now on the horizon, companies need to act, particularly those in sectors such as technology, construction and finance where use of contractors operating as personal services companiesis common. At a basic level, the reforms to IR legislation sht the responsibility of determining the tax status of personal services company workers to the company that engages them where previously they could self-certy. The original rules required the freelance contractor to determine their tax status, but HMRC believed non-compliance was common.Now,a person’s assignment falls outside of IR legislation, they are deemed to be self-employed, so gross payment will be made to the PSC. Butthe assignment falls inside of IR, the professional should be treated as an employee, applying PAYE and NIC deductions from their payment. In simple terms, the tax arrangements for contractors are changing so that they won’t get such a good dealthey can’t demonstrate their work is out of scope and employers will have to pay more for using and keeping what were previously non-payroll workers.This will have a big effect on how people choose to work and who they choose to work for, not to mention how organisations plan and budget. An organisation’s policy towards contractors will affect how attractive they are to freelancers. But on the other side we’ve already seen some risk averse companies adopt a blanket ban on freelancers just to be safe – meaning they are missing out on skilled professionals they need to deliver projects.In Northern Ireland, as where, it’s likely the IR reforms will hit technology hardest, but the effects could be wide ranging across roles in construction, project management and finance.We’ve heard anecdotal evidence of IT contractors leaving the big banks and starting to view early stage tech companies with less than  employees more favourably because they fall outside the scope of the legislation. When similar legislation was introduced in the public sector in , hundreds of highly skilled contractors left roles to join organisations who were prepared, often leading to projects being scrapped. Now the private sector is catching up, preparation is key and anyone who hasn’t done a review of what it means for their capacity should do so urgently. A Hays survey showed % of private sector firms expect cost increases when IR reforms come into effect, % expect to lose key talent and % think it will be harder to bring in non-permanent workers. A third of organisations surveyed were completely unaware of the reforms – a big concern given how tight the labour market is.So, first you need to determine whether assignments are inside or outside of IR. You need to have full visibility of all workers your organisation engages who are paid via agencies and consultancies as well as knowledge of how they are paid. You will also need to have the expertise to determine the tax status of each assignment. When you know that you can then start communicating with freelance workers, renegotiating working arrangements, standardising onboarding procedures and decidingany specialist skills need to be brought in house to get projects over the line.If you expect to use a high volume of temporary workers in , outsourcing your temporary worker provision through a managed services programme could be an option, as an expert would carry out accurate assessments for every temporary worker placed with you.Whatever stage you are at, don’t ignore IR. It’s coming and you need to understand it.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/EHP_20200109_-3489_web.jpg","title":"nie networks keeping the lights on and a focus on the future of power","story":"Posted on Thursday February  by Ulster Business Paul Stapleton, managing director of NIE Networks, sits down with Ulster Business to chat about the future of energy here, huge investment across Northern Ireland and the responsibility of keeping the lights on for almost two million people In the last three decades, Paul Stapleton has already seen signicant sweeping changes across the energy industry, and is now helping lead the charge towards a carbon neutral economy with an ever-increasing focus on green power.He is now at the helm of NIE Networks – an organisation responsible for the electricity network here, delivering reliable power to , businesses, homes and farms right across Northern Ireland.“Our role is to provide a safe and reliable network – keeping the lights on  ,  days a year,” Paul told Ulster Business.And part of that responsibility and ability to ensure strong and reliable electricity flow is an investment of around £m each year, working towards a  ‘net zero’ carbon emissions target and embracing the key changes and evolution in power here.“Many dferent players need to work together to ensure the electricity system of the future can achieve what it needs to achieve in terms of zero carbon and remaining economically efficient, and reliable, at the same time,” he says.“We are the custodians of the electricity network – everything between where power is generated and up to and including the meter in your home or business.“Our network is connected to , customers – that’s every home, every farm, every business, and every organisation in NI. It’s a regulated utility business, and commercially, everything is regulated by the Utility Regulator.”Paul’s been in the energy industry for his entire working le. The Limerick man joined ESB in  where he held a number of senior management positions, before taking up his current role in May .He’s taken over NIE Networks as it’s hitting record performance targets, with those likely to improve further still this year.“The network is in as good as condition as it ever was, and we are giving a good service in terms of continuity of supply. “In , we achieved a ‘customer minutes lost’ average of  minutes, which is the lowest in our history. But we will continue to look at improving further. Where faults do occur, % are fixed within three hours and % within less than  hours. “We operate in business cycles around regulatory price controls. We are now just over two years into a six year price control. “There has been some downsizing, cost-reduction and efficiencies, while we are gearing up to deliver a signicant capital investment programme. We are investing more than £m a year in upgrading, refurbishing and maintaining the network.“The focus in present terms is about delivering for today and looking to enhance our services to customers.”But it’s the future of NIE Networks, power generation, and a new Strategic Energy Framework, which will become the focus for Paul and his team in the coming years.“A lot of my focus is about planning for the future, as well as the day-to-day,” he says. “The longer term horizon is now looking out to ,” he says. “The UK Government has enshrined in legislation the target that the economy will be entirely carbon neutral.”For Northern Ireland, it’s already broken recent records in terms of the move towards green energy. “There is a huge amount to be done and it’s a very challenging target,” he says.“It’s a huge change and transition. But I think all the scientic evidence regarding climate change suggests it has to be done, and maybe has to be done sooner.“The headline target was that we would hit % from renewable sources by . We actually achieved that target and are now at %. That is very signicant progress. It puts us ahead of GB and the Republic of Ireland.”NIE Networks has invested around £m in the network to facilitate this generation. In the last few years the number of power generators connecting to the network has grown to ,, whereas two decades ago it was reliant on the three main power stations here.“The bigger challenge is how do we use that green energy to displace carbon  That brings in transport and heat, and that’s something where the electricity sector will play an important role.“As we all start adopting electric vehicles, as I think we all will in the next decade, we have to make sure people have the ability to charge them, at home and in public spaces. It’s our role to connect the chargers and to make sure we have a network which has the capability to meet the demands.”But Paul says there’s signicant positivity out there, with a younger generation in Northern Ireland and throughout the world embracing the small everyday changes that have to be made in order to tackle an international problem.“We are in the policy framing stage and  is going to be key. There is a call for evidence now from the Department for the Economy to inform the development of a new Energy Strategy for Northern Ireland and I would encourage anyone who has any interest in energy or climate change to contribute into that.“Hopefully that will lead to the development of clear policy initiatives, targets and measures for Northern Ireland and that will set the context for the market to respond.“I think there is economic opportunity for Northern Ireland, but there will be some downsides. We need to minimise the downsides and maximise the opportunities.”NIE Networks is currently examining its role in the future energy market in Northern Ireland. That includes looking at how it can make the distribution network more open and accessible in order to allow burgeoning technologies, such as battery storage, heat pumps and electric vehicles, to be introduced and operate in a sustainable way.“We see our role as evolving. Historically, we were somewhat passive – we provided an infrastructure which shipped electricity from A to B. Now, we need to be much more proactive and we are part of an overall system.”That includes a role in balancing when green energy is available and when it is required and in high demand on the distribution system. “All of that needs a more connected and dynamic distribution system – rather than just being seen as a physical infrastructure,” Paul says.“We need private investment and developers who are willing to invest in new solutions, whether it’s wind, solar, electric vehicle charging or heat delivery. All of those need policy directions, but they also need a network to connect to, so we have a major role to enable all of that.”Paul says most businesses and iniduals now know that they “have to get on this journey” in order to play their part in tackling climate change, reducing their carbon emissions and improving energy efficiency.With Brexit, there have been concerns over the future of the all-island energy market. But Paul is confident that it will be secured, despite the UK’s exit from the EU. “That continuing is really important for businesses in Northern Ireland. Currently, all sides in the Brexit debate seem comfortable that the Single Electricity Marketwill continue, so we don’t see any specic threat around that.”As part of NIE Networks’ Northern Ireland-wide investment in infrastructure – of around £m a year – it has recently completed a £, investment in the Cathedral Quarter area of Belfast – where our interview took place – which is home to many of its best known pubs and restaurants. “That gives us a more resilient and reliable supply, as well as capacity for the future,” Paul says. Some of the other latest investments include projects in Enniskillen in advance of a new public realm scheme, along with another in Newry.“Right across Northern Ireland we are continuing to invest,” Paul says. “There is a lot going on. There’s a lot to do today, challenges, to keep efficient supply for the economy, but equally we need to plan for the future.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
