At the Miami-Pittsburgh men´s college basketball game, Pitt fans tossed purple and gold confetti - Lakers colors - in the air after the Panthers scored their first basket. And before a Serie A soccer match at Olympic Stadium in Rome between Lazio and Spal, Bryant´s photo was displayed on the jumbo video screens.At the PGA Tour´s Waste Management Phoenix Open, the tour joined players with a 16th-hole tribute to Bryant by using his two Lakers uniform numbers to cut the final-round pin position on the stadium par 3.The pin was placed 24 yards from the front edge and 8 yards from the left edge on the rowdy hole that holds more than 20,000 fans. The yellow flag had a 24 on one side and an 8 on the other, and large matching numbers were painted in the grass in front of the green.On Saturday night, Matt Dumba of the Minnesota Wild skated in a 24 jersey - another way of paying homage to Bryant.The NFL also announced that it was auctioning 20 autographed helmets and footballs to benefit The Mamba Sports Foundation. Some of those who autographed items included NFL MVP Lamar Jackson, Peyton Manning, Jennifer Lopez, Shakira, Ciara and Russell Wilson, Stephon Gilmore, Shaquill and Shaquem Griffin, John Harbaugh, Christian McCaffrey, Kyler Murray, Paul Rudd, Deion Sanders, Michael Thomas, and all members of 2020 Pro Football Hall of Fame class.Sherman ended his poem with \u0027We love you, Kobe.

By the time of this charming photograph at the World Match Play Championships in 1966, Nicklaus, then aged 26, had become a six-time major winner, the first man to retain the Masters and the youngest ever to complete a Career Grand Slam. He would go on to achieve a record haul of 18 majors in total. What was the secret of his success, you might ask. “I never try to actually hit the ball,” he explained in The Greatest Game Of All … “I try to swing through the ball”. Nicklaus is also fondly remembered for the charity he showed to Europe captain Tony Jacklin at the 1969 Ryder Cup, when he conceded a two-foot putt on the final hole, ending the tournament in a tie. Nicklaus reportedly told Jacklin: “I don’t think you would have missed it but I wasn’t going to give you the chance, either.” Little wonder, then, that when Nicklaus turned 80 last month, the golfing world saluted him as ‘the greatest’.Buy your exclusive print herePrintsPhotographs are presented on museum-grade, fine-art paper stocks, with archival standards guaranteeing quality for 100-plus years.

Market research firm Mintel predicts sales of meat-free foods will soon pass £1bn a year with the Co-op, Asda and Waitrose among the retailers to have launched new vegan ranges in time for this year."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d7af8d532c811349b3a7fc835305067ef4fa80d0/0_73_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=03496c4cd198bfd552871c71041dbd3f","title":"ikea close store jobs coventry city centre","story":"Swedish chain says Coventry city centre store loses money and will shut this summer Ikea is to close its Coventry city centre store this summer, marking the first closure of one of its large format UK branches.The Swedish furniture chain says the shop has consistently lost money since it opened in 2007, with a declining number of visitors as shoppers visit retail parks or buy online instead.The retailer says it will enter consultations with the 352 employees affected by the closure and would like to retain as many as possible in the company, although the closest outlets are in Birmingham and Nottingham, approximately 30 and 50 miles away.Coventry was one of Ikea’s first attempts at opening a new format, city centre store to respond to the changing habits of its customers. It blames the size of the seven-storey building for its higher operating costs and says it has been unable to make the store more cost-efficient or repurpose it.Peter Jelkeby, the country retail manager and chief sustainability officer for Ikea UK and Ireland, said the Coventry closure was not an easy decision, but was the right one for the long-term success of Ikea in the UK.“At Ikea we are constantly challenging ourselves to find ways to meet the needs of our customers and we will continue to try and test, investing in stores, fulfilment centres, city centre formats and our digital capabilities to make Ikea even more affordable, convenient and sustainable.,” he said.In recent years, the chain has trialled opening smaller city centre outlets, on Tottenham Court Road in central London and Bromley in south-east London, to attract a different range of customers who do not travel by car to visit its usual “big box” stores. Ikea currently has 22 UK stores and says it is still focusing on growth, despite what it calls a “changing retail environment”.In January, Ikea bought the Kings Mall, a shopping centre in Hammersmith in west London, which it plans to redevelop, and is understood to be looking for more malls in the UK. The chain already owns 44 malls globally, which it built itself. Ikea said last October it had strengthened its UK property team as it looks to take advantage of bargain prices in Britain’s crisis-hit retail property market to secure smaller and more accessible sites in city centre locations.Ikea’s Coventry store has a prominent position in the city centre and the city faces the challenge of how to repurpose a large and distinctive-looking building when the branch closes in the summer."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e6df6eadc6d71cd631a3fa666113bb9098b4babe/0_448_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=344089445f01d928bf5b173170955454","title":"labour france british steel hayange china jingye","story":"Paris reportedly opposes deal that would put Hayange plant in hands of China’s JingyeThe government must act fast to prevent the French government from scuppering a deal to save British Steel, Labour has urged, amid opposition in Paris to a sale that would put a key national asset in Chinese hands.The Chinese industrial firm Jingye, run by a former Communist party official, is in the final stages of negotiations to buy British Steel, including the Hayange plant in northern France.But the French finance minister, Bruno Le Maire, has reportedly told the UK chancellor, Sajid Javid, that Paris is opposed to a Chinese firm owning a plant that supplies track to France’s vast rail network.French ministers are expected to make a decision in the next two weeks and could veto the sale of Hayange, jeopardising the chances of a rescue that appeared to be in sight after more than eight months of abortive attempts to find a buyer.Several steel industry sources told the  that British Steel, which employs more than 4,000 people, would be a considerably less attractive prospect without the lucrative French arm.If the business is carved out of the transaction, it is unclear whether Jingye would be willing to proceed with its proposal to pay £50m for British Steel and invest £1.2bn.In a letter sent to the steel minister Nadhim Zahawi on Monday and shared with the , his Labour opposite number, Gill Furniss, said the government must now intervene to secure French approval.Furniss said suggestions that France could derail the deal were “deeply concerning given its importance for around 4,000 people employed by British Steel”.“The government has claimed that it is committed to the steel sector in the UK. Now is the time to put these words into action,” she said.She asked Zahawi to explain what contact he has had with French ministers and what plans the government has to convince Paris to approve the sale.Furniss also asked for details of the the government’s back-up plan.  revealed last month that Turkish industrial firm Cengiz Holding has been lined up as a potential white knight buyer should the Jingye plan fail. Cengiz has publicly stated that it is on good terms with the French government.Pressure to secure a sale is building, because British Steel is thought to be losing £1m a day, funded by a government indemnity that is due to run out at the end of February.Failure to secure a deal would put at risk nearly 4,000 high-value jobs in Scunthorpe, North Yorkshire and Teesside, mostly in constituencies won by the Conservative party in the general election.“We have lost far too many high-value steel plants in the past decade and the thousands of jobs that come with them, all while successive Conservative party leaders have talked up their commitment to workers,” said Furniss.“The steel sector and those who work in it are right to fear that, when it comes to it, the government won’t do what’s necessary to defend them.”A spokesperson for the department for business, energy and industrial strategy said the Official Receiver, a government employee running the sale, was “running an independent process”.“Like any sale of this nature, there are a number of regulatory steps that need to be taken over the coming weeks before the sale can complete,” he said.“The deal with Jingye is very much on track and we expect that the transaction will complete in the coming weeks.”A spokesperson for the French finance ministry declined to comment on the latest thinking in Paris about Hayange, which is seen as a strategic national asset because of its importance to the rail network."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4ad98fce3708d8a7041e4c0a1b8c71d5a05db754/0_10_5378_3227/master/5378.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=42ac933f67cb0bb112354250177069a6","title":"brexit referendum immigration trade devolution","story":"Brexit is – allegedly – done. The UK is no longer a member state of the European Union, so in this sense at least, the outcome of the 2016 referendum has finally been honoured. But how done is “done”? And what happens next? While Brexit to date has hardly been easy, a new report by the UK in a Changing Europe shows that much of the real work still lies ahead.First, there are negotiations. These will require trade-offs. The government now faces a choice between aligning with existing EU rules, which will allow for more trade, and regulatory autonomy, which grants the UK national control but makes trade harder. That choice will have consequences.Before those consequences really kick in, however, the government will need to start forming new policies in areas where the EU has played a significant role to date. Among the most obvious are agriculture, environment and immigration. Under Michael Gove’s leadership, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs developed radical policies on the first two, which it falls to his successor to implement. The EU will be looking on anxiously to see whether Britain’s future legislation on these areas signals its commitment to maintaining and enforcing the high standards that EU membership prescribes.On immigration, however, change could be rapid. The task facing the government – devising and implementing a new, points-based immigration system – is challenging and potentially disruptive to sectors that currently depend on a steady supply of labour from the EU.There will also be a simultaneous economic fallout to cope with. Brexit has already weighed on the UK’s manufacturing output and investment, and a bare-bones trade deal could spell trouble for just-in-time supply chains, which require frictionless delivery systems to work. Meanwhile, the apparent decision by the government to prioritise regulatory autonomy means that even a free trade agreement would present new barriers to trade. Tariff- and quota-free trade alone offers nothing for the service sectors, where the UK currently runs a surplus on trade with the EU.The government’s solid majority will end the legislative stalemate of the past two and a half years. Phase two of the Brexit process might prove less consuming than phase one. But the process of disentangling the UK from EU regulations will still demand much time and attention from ministers and civil servants. And the fiscal impact of leaving the customs union and single market will constrain the government’s ability to deliver on Boris Johnson’s promise to “level up” the United Kingdom. More broadly, there is little evidence that the government has a coherent strategy to reshape the British economy after Brexit – its emphasis seems to be on damage limitation on the one hand, and largely symbolic gestures on the other.Brexit has also cast light on the institutional structures of British politics, and questions of representation, legitimacy and democratic reform. Parliament will need to decide if – and how – to scrutinise what the EU is doing after the transition. For the civil service to deal with the next phase of the Brexit process it will need an expanded unit in the Cabinet Office (not to mention that some in government seem keen to bring about far more profound and wide-ranging reforms to the civil service). At the same time, the government’s intention to hold a review into constitutional issues could herald reforms to the relationship between politics and the judiciary.Which brings us to Britain’s territorial constitution. The events of the past three years have placed significant strain on the devolution settlement. Questions over the Northern Ireland border and Scottish independence show no sign of abating. There remains the real, politically contentious prospect of a border in the Irish Sea. After three years without a fully functioning executive or assembly, the newly restored Northern Ireland executive will have its work cut out implementing the NI protocol, and ensuring this is consistent with the deal to restore devolved government.As if this weren’t enough, we live in a country where social values as well as social class drive the electorate. Politics has changed – and will continue to do so. The interaction between values and class will be crucial for the strategies of inidual parties. Can the Liberal Democrats successfully target remainers now remain is now longer an option? Will the Tories be able to maintain their new voters, while winning back more traditional pro-business, pro-European Conservatives who abandoned them over Brexit?There is an awful lot to be done. But we are better placed than we have been in some time to have a serious debate about our immigration system. Brexit may have been the fillip that was needed to address long-overlooked constitutional issues. The referendum and its aftermath may finally force us to confront enduring economic problems, such as a lack of skills and profound regional inequalities. We may be out of the European Union, but Brexit is not, by a long stretch, out of our system.• Anand Menon is director of the UK in a Changing"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/80bc18d23ac1f56d55270cafb0ac0da21670d5a3/0_116_1920_1152/master/1920.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5048f7301d6e81e28ad7a1215406552e","title":"south african photographer santu mofokeng in pictures","story":"The documentary photographer, best known for recording everyday life in the townships of South Africa, has died.

The EU is the biggest bloc on the brink of signing up to net zero, but major economies including China, the US and India show little sign of doing so.As part of the push, the prime minister is bringing forward a target to phase out diesel and petrol vehicles by 2035, instead of 2040 as at present. The ban will include hybrid vehicles for the first time. Johnson’s call to other countries came as he launched the UK’s plans to host crunch UN climate talks in Glasgow this November. The talks, known as COP 26, are aimed at putting the world on track to fulfil the Paris agreement of 2015, as current emissions pledges are inadequate to stave off dangerous levels of global heating.The launch got off to a rocky start, however, as last Friday evening the former energy minister charged with leading the UK’s presidency, Claire O’Neill, was abruptly sacked. She was said to have provoked rows with officials, to have issued confusing messages to other countries, and to have lacked the diplomatic skills and experience to inspire confidence in foreign capitals.But her sacking led to consternation among observers, who feared the UK was losing its grip on the process.The UK will face a massive diplomatic challenge to make COP 26 a success, as the last round of talks ended in disarray and recriminations last December in Madrid: countries failed to agree on key agenda items, with only a partial resolve to come back with stronger emissions-cutting targets this year in Glasgow.No replacement for O’Neill has yet been officially announced, with candidates including Michael Gove and former Conservative leaders William Hague and Michael Howard all mentioned as possibles. Getting a strong leader in place is widely viewed as vital to demonstrating the UK’s seriousness of intent.“Hosting COP 26 is an important opportunity for the UK and nations across the globe to step up in the fight against climate change,” Johnson told dignitaries, businesses and campaigners. “As we set out our plans to hit our ambitious 2050 net zero target across this year, so we shall urge others to join us in pledging net zero emissions. 2020 must be the year we turn the tide on global warming – it will be the year when we choose a cleaner, greener future for all.”As part of the COP 26 push, the prime minister also highlighted the £2bn that the government has agreed to spend on meeting the net zero target, including up to £1bn to encourage the take-up of electric vehicles, £222m for research into nuclear fusion, and £26m for carbon capture technology.Edmund King, president of the AA, said the new target on car sales was incredibly challenging and asked whether there would be a proper supply of zero emissions vehicles in less than fifteen years. “We will also need a package of grants coupled with a comprehensive charging infrastructure at homes and in towns, cities, motorways and rural locations,” he said, adding concern about the ban on hybrids. Alasdair Roxburgh, of Friends of the Earth, said ministerial promises were no longer enough, however. Campaigners are frustrated that although Theresa May’s government agreed the net zero target last summer, little in the way of concrete measures have been brought forward since then, which they have said sets a poor example for inspiring action in other countries at COP 26.“If the government is honest about the scale and urgency of the problem then we won’t hear about plans and pledges any more, we will hear about definite actions being immediately taken,” said Roxburgh. “What the UK must do is drastically cut emissions in the lifetime of this parliament. With the bushfires raging in Australia and deadly flooding in Indonesia, the climate crisis is already claiming lives, destroying homes and wildlife. But we can stave off the worst impacts of climate breakdown, if we act together now, and the UK government have the opportunity to set the bar high.”A key aim for COP 26 is for rich countries to provide the necessary finance to the developing world to cut carbon in poor nations. But discussions on climate finance ran aground at last year’s conference, and little progress has been made on the issue in the four years since the Paris agreement was signed.“One strong and important thing that the UK government can do is provide funding for poorer countries, most affected by climate change, yet least responsible for it,” said Roxburgh."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eea90c4e92c59009fac259c170708f83e823de78/346_401_3880_2328/master/3880.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fdfd80f5e4ea73e9b161e3711557ac7d","title":"share your photos and stories of early signs of spring","story":"We want your help documenting the situation as record temperatures bring early signs of spring across EuropeWith warmer winters and seasonal changes we would like to know about any early signs of spring you have spotted near you.From joy at seeing beautiful scenes to concern about what it means for the environment, you can see what  readers told us last year.Tell us what the situation is like where you are in the encrypted form below.

The picture was taken by Jean-Baptiste Mondino in Paris in 1989 and styled by Judy Blame. We had done a photo session for my single Manchild, with the boxing bandages and the jewellery, and when we needed to shoot the cover for my debut album, Raw Like Sushi, we thought: “Let’s work some more with that.”We had a bunch of rails with things to wear, but Judy and I had been to Printemps – like a French version of Marks \u0026amp Spencer – and I had bought a nice bra, and I was wearing leggings, which were from Pineapple or somewhere. I went out to test the light and Mondino was like: “Don’t put anything else on. Maybe some more jewellery.” Then we did the picture that ended up being the album cover. In the same session I wore some BodyMaps shorts, which are in the pictures that ended up on the back and the inside, but it was a really non-wardrobe thing in the end.I have always felt that visuals are a very important part of telling a story. For a woman, this was quite a male visual.

I wore some dollar-sign earrings I had bought while I was there and snakeskin trainers. Judy would pull things out for me to wear – people like Rifat Ozbek. He always had his hand on the pulse.

It’s certainly my experience, but why is this, and how to avoid it?Ian, Ystalyfera, Swansea ValleyIan’s question was prompted at least in part by a Yotam Ottolenghi recipe in Feast last autumn for rye pancakes (to go with crispy duck, British-style) in which he admitted that, while the batter mix was ostensibly enough for 11 pancakes, “the first few attempts aren’t usually the best”, so it’s best to plan on getting only eight out of it. If even our culinary idols have issues with the first pancake or three, Ian wondered, what hope is there for the rest of us?“There’s no harm in just accepting that the first one will be bad, eating it there and then, and moving on to the next, better one,” says Henrietta Inman, chef at the newly opened Stoney Street in London, whose breakfast offering, in particular, has got the Instagram crowd snapping away like mad things. “I’m not entirely sure of the science behind it, but it’s all about creating a seal, getting the pan used to the mix and warming it up for the rest.”There are, though, a few tricks that may reduce the risk of first-pancake hell. According to restaurateur and food writer Bill Granger, one is not to overmix the batter. It might seem counterintuitive, he says, but “you actually want to see tiny lumps of flour in it – they’re a good sign that the end result will be a tender pancake, rather than a gluey one, because they show you haven’t overworked the gluten”.Granger is more responsible than most for changing British attitudes to breakfast and brunch, so take heed – he began spreading the word here as long ago as 2000, and a decade later put his money where his mouth was with the UK’s first branch of his Aussie chain, Granger \u0026amp Co, in London (he now has four here, and 14 others worldwide, from his native Sydney to Japan, Hawaii and beyond). Once the batter is made, he says, give it a rest: “Just 20 minutes, so the gluten relaxes. And, obviously, the more you’ve mixed it, the more time it needs: generally speaking, thin, crepe-like pancakes need longer than thicker ones, such as our ricotta hotcakes at the restaurants, because the batter tends to be worked more.”Inman, however, isn’t so sure a rest makes that much of a difference: “I’ve cooked them with fresh mix and day-old mix, and they’re just the same. I think it’s more important to get the batter to the right consistency, which for a basic pancake means not too thick and not too thin.”Of course, the pan plays a big part, too, Granger says. “Put it on medium heat before you add any fat, and for long enough to get an even heat distribution.” That’s because, when you heat metal, it expands, and you need the fat (with pancakes, that usually takes the form of butter) to fill any pores in the surface, or the first lot of batter will do so instead, which is why the pancake sticks and tears. Be wary of using too much, though, or the batter will simply soak it up, leaving you with a grease-sodden initial attempt. Treat it less as frying and more as seasoning the pan (much as you do a wok with oil), and you won’t go far wrong.“Brush the entire surface with butter,” Granger says, “then wipe away any excess with a bit of kitchen paper and add a touch more butter, just to be on the safe side.” When you now add the batter for that tricky first pancake, the pan ought to mimic the well-greased one you normally get when making subsequent ones. “In restaurants, the pans are used so much, they’re always well seasoned, but that’s often not the case at home.”At the end of the day, Inman says, pancakes are like any other kitchen skill. “You’ve got to get a feel for it, as we do with all the ingredients we cook with. It’s all about practice – and about not being defeated by first attempts that go wrong. That’s something that happens to everyone, however experienced.”• Do you have a culinary dilemma?

Here’s what some of you saidI signed up for Dry January because I wanted to cut down on my drinking. My wife and I usually drank a bottle of wine a night between us. She also signed up. I have tried a few non-alcoholic beers. Some are better than others, but it’s a matter of personal choice which ones an inidual enjoys. I enjoy the taste of beer, and am enjoying the taste of a few different non- alcoholic beers. No feeling sluggish in the mornings! I think I will carry on with my newly discovered drinking habit. By the way, we tried non-alcoholic wine, not nice. My wife has discovered non-alcoholic gin and tonics, which she quite likes. I wonder if pubs will sell a wider selection of non-alcoholic beers? John Lowe, 72, retired, HuddersfieldI’ve drastically cut down my consumption of alcohol over the past couple of years, with 18 months being the longest I have abstained. My experiences of going alcohol free over the past couple of years has taught me that Britain is not an easy place to not drink. If you don’t drink there are often attitudes of being a killjoy, not joining in, that you’re being judgmental or that you’ve been an alcoholic.I drink non-alcoholic beer as I feel I want to ‘join in’ when socialising. I enjoy the taste of a number of AF (alcohol-free) lagers and would usually only have one. Only after a long period of abstinence can you appreciate the mental and physical effects of not having alcohol in your system. I’m a much better person being a non drinker, and look so much better for it too. I feel non alcohol beer serves a purpose in bridging a gap between being a drinker and being stone cold sober. Natalie, ManchesterI simply prefer the taste of non-alcoholic beer. When I go for my weekly Sunday roast with friends, I always drink non-alcoholic beer, with the added benefit that I can drive home afterwards which is very helpful as I live in the countryside. Toby Carr-Verri, 35, Italian tutor, HullLast October I decided to try staying sober for the whole month. It’s not like I had a big drinking problem. I just realised that I spend too much time and money on booze. I experienced some difficulties like nausea and low mood, but overall my experience was pretty good. I tried to replace beer with diet coke, then soda, then tonic. Finally I tried Brewdog’s Punk AF beer. Bingo! It clicked and completely replaced my craving for a nice pint. I even decided to stay sober after the end of October and stop drinking at all. Maybe even forever. Non-alco beer was one of the reasons for me to realise that I simply don’t need alcohol in my life. Pavel, 34, journalist, LondonMy New Year’s resolution in 2019 was to have 16 days a month without drinking alcohol this roughly equated to not drinking for half the year but felt more flexible than only drinking on weekends for example. I assumed non-alcoholic beer would be a lowly alternative and pretty unpleasant so I had never tried it before. It was a game changer to be honest. Gone were endless evenings drinking ginger beer in the pub, now I could order half a pint and feel like I was actually out for the night like before.An alcoholic, I gave up drinking entirely almost exactly two years ago. I still like a drink in the evening but was worried non-alcoholic beers would just whet my appetite so I’ve only recently (about six weeks ago) allowed myself to drink them, and find I enjoy them without the threat of reverting to alcohol. What I particularly like is that they mean I don’t have to drink sweet drinks (the alternative for me is a mixture of fruit juice and sparkling water), and in fact drink less during an evening. Rick Johnson, 70, retired solicitor, LancasterI drink very cold alcohol-free beer from time to time. I like it because it delivers the refreshing hit of a beer at the end of a day spent in 40C temperatures, yet don’t disrupt my sleep, nor give me a hangover, which is great as I have to get up at 5am every day. There are a few nice tasting beers on the market, although I must admit they are scarcely as complex and interesting as alcoholic beers. However, on a recent trip to New Zealand I encountered a few craft breweries that offered some delicious choices. Jonny, 34, coffee shop owner, Alice Springs, AustraliaI quit drinking when I started my own business as I couldn’t afford to be hungover or off my game for a minute. Non-alcoholic beer allows me to be sociable while staying true to my values. It also gives me a placebo effect that alcohol used to. It helps mark the end of a stressful work day, and helps me relax as I move into my own time. I don’t miss alcohol nor the hangovers.

Here’s how British shoppers can track down high-welfare, eco-friendly produceVeganuary is over, leaving only the remains of a seitan burger and some cashew cheese in the back of the fridge. Perhaps you feel lighter and healthier you will certainly feel more virtuous. But do you also feel like a steak? It is OK – you can admit it. The campaign group behind this annual event estimates that only half of the participants plan to remain meat-free beyond the end of the month. However, it says that most of those will at least reduce the amount of animal products they eat for the rest of the year.Whether you call youself flexitarian, vegan-ish or whatever, it is possible to care about the planet while occasionally eating meat or dairy, as long as it comes from ethical sources. Even Jonathan Safran Foer, the author of Eating Animals, a book advocatIng veganism, has admitted to eating a small amount of animal produce after 6pm.So, if you are hungry for something other than plants, what should you buy? Here are some high-welfare, low-carbon options for post-Veganuary.Cows, or “carbon-releasing machines” as George Monbiot calls them, are the worst offenders when it comes to emitting greenhouse gases. Cow burps (not farts, as is commonly believed) release methane into the atmosphere, which traps more heat than carbon dioxide in the short term. Also, beef takes a lot more energy to produce than, say, tofu.However, much of the information you read about the planet-wrecking capability of cows is based on the most extreme scenario. Yes, grazing cattle on pasture that used to be rainforest releases a lot of carbon dioxide. Yes, cattle kept on feedlots in the US midwest use a lot of water. But there is an easy way to avoid this – buy British.In Britain, beef cattle tend to be kept outdoors on pasture, simply because we have so much wet grassland that is good for little other than grazing animals. Although feedlots are not unheard of, the average herd size is 28 to 50, as part of a mixed farm. If the cattle are pasture-fed, there is even an argument that they are less damaging to the environment, as permanent pasture stores carbon dioxide. Pasture-fed cattle also tend to have more omega-3 fatty acids.In terms of welfare, cattle are a fairly safe bet – again, if they are British. British beef tends to be from animals kept outdoors in a social herd for one to two years (a much longer life than chickens).Why British as opposed to, say, Irish or continental European? Although the EU has comparable standards to Britain, transport is stressful for animals, so it is always better to eat meat that was produced closer to home. Look out for country of origin labelling: this is a legal requirement for EU countries and shows where the animal was born and slaughtered.Of course, eating any meat involves the slaughter of animals. In Britain, the Food Standards Agency employs vets in all abattoirs to ensure minimum standards of animal welfare. Animals must be kept calm in holding pens, moved through the system without excessive force and stunned before slaughter, unless it is religious slaughter.If you want to know higher standards have been met, look out for RSPCA Assured, which is run by the animal welfare charity. This labelling scheme ensures that the transportation of live animals is kept to a minimum, that animals are kept in better conditions before slaughter and that they are killed as quickly as possible. Organic schemes include standards for the humane care and slaughter of animals they also prohibit the use of most pesticides, genetically modified feed and growth hormones. Organic cattle are not given antibiotics routinely.Almost all veal is a product of the dairy industry. Cows are put in to calf so they produce milk, then the calf is removed within 24 hours so that the milk can be taken for human consumption. In general, female calves are kept and male calves are slaughtered. There is an argument that using the meat from male calves avoids waste, but ensure it is British and meets a certain standard. In much of Europe, calves are kept in cramped conditions, sometimes without light, so the meat is pale. The RSPCA and other welfare charities have successfully campaigned against this in the UK and advise against buying imported veal.British veal is a different matter. Most of it is “ruby” or “rose” (so called because the meat is darker), from calves kept for up to a year. Even the RSPCA has approved veal from older calves that are kept free range during their lives.Labels to look out for: RSPCA AssuredWhere to buy: Peelham Farm Brookfield FarmSheep – or “woolly maggots”, as Monbiot would have it – are another animal blamed for environmental destruction because they were grazed on areas that were once ancient forest. As subsidies wind down and rewilding takes off, many of these areas are being allowed to return to scrub or forest.Many of the farms in these remote upland areas are part of our heritage. The Lake District was awarded Unesco world heritage status in 2017, largely – and controversially – because of the “cultural value” of sheep farming.Lamb, like beef and pork, is a meat you can buy directly from the farmer, thereby supporting some of these farms. Buying mutton rather than lamb means that the sheep lived longer such meat tends to be from smaller-scale farmers.Unlike chicken or pork, sheep are not generally reared intensively indoors. Although ewes are brought inside for lambing and some flocks are fed indoors during harsh winters, most spend their lives in fields.Pasture for Life is a new certification scheme that labels lamb, beef and dairy raised only on pasture. This means they are not fed any grain or manufactured feed and are kept outside throughout their lives. The farmers who set it up claim that grazing animals not only contributes to welfare and produces a healthier meat, but can also help wildlife such as lapwings. Most Pasture for Life farmers follow the same standards as RSPCA Assured or organic to make sure sheep have been slaughtered humanely.Labels to look out for: Pasture for Life RSPCA Assured organicWhere to buy: Camilla and Roly Yew Tree FarmVisit a British farm and you will see that pigs, with their curly tails wagging, enjoy living outdoors. But much of Britain’s pork is imported from factory farms, where those curly tails are docked and the animals spend their whole lives indoors on slatted floors without straw. The biggest sources are Denmark, the Netherlands and Germany, especially for bacon. The EU has comparable minimum standards to the UK, but British producers are beginning to meet much higher standards as consumer awareness increases. To eat high-welfare pork and support the farmers going the extra mile, look out for British pork and read the label carefully.“Outdoor bred” means the animals are born outdoors, but brought inside for the rest of their lives “outdoor reared” means they spend roughly half their lives outdoors and “free range” means they spend all their lives outdoors. Compassion in World Farming (CIWF) say all the systems can be humane – even indoor farming can be high-welfare if the animals are kept on plenty of straw.A good way to ensure pork is high-welfare is to look out for rare breeds such as the tamworth. Rare breeds tend to live longer and be kept outdoors, since, unlike more modern breeds, they are not bred for intensive systems. The Rare Breeds Survival Trust encourages the eating of rare breeds, because it is the best way of ensuring these animals continue to be farmed. Farmers’ markets are a great place to find rare-breed meats and to meet some of the farmers keeping interesting specimens. Alternatively, try to visit farms open to the public on Open Farm Sunday on 7 June.Labels to look out for: CIWF Good Pig awardWhere to buy: The Ginger Piggery PubbledubIntensive chicken and pork have been cited by UN reports as lower-carbon meats because the animals can be reared quickly using relatively little energy. But this raises questions about welfare.Most of the chicken eaten in Britain is from barn-reared birds. This can mean tens of thousands of birds in one barn, each with barely as much floor space as an A4 piece of paper. The most basic assurance scheme, the Red Tractor label, has recently improved its standards so that sheds must at least have windows. RSPCA Assured chicken will be slightly more expensive, but will have had more room, as well as toys and straw. These chickens live longer and are less likely to suffer from health problems resulting from growing too fast.Free-range birds must have access to the outdoors for at least some of their lives, but the label has come in for criticism because not all the birds in huge barns will go outside.Organic chickens will have access to more space and, since they are kept in smaller flocks, it is argued that they are more likely to go outdoors. They will also not have been fed genetically modified soya, imported from South America and routinely fed to intensive chicken (and pork). They are considerably more expensive – but if you learned to use less meat in Veganuary, this may be less of a problem.Labels to look out for: RSPCA Assured organicWhere to buy: Fosse Meadows DaylesfordIf we are going to eat meat, we should eat the whole animal. Thowing away less popular cuts is disrespectful as well as wasteful. They can also be very nutritious. Most butchers will sell liver, sweetbreads, kidney and black pudding. For more unusual cuts, go to specialist butchers or restaurants such as St John in London that advocate “nose to tail” eating.Where to buy: George Bower butchers St JohnThe Marine Conservation Society has a Good Fish Guide app that will tell you if a species is under threat, vulnerable or sustainable. The simple guide uses a traffic light system of red (avoid), amber (eat occasionally) or green (eat without second thoughts). When you are buying fish in the supermarket, look for the Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) badge that is given to fisheries with a sufficiently high population to take a regular catch. Many less fashionable fish are also more sustainable. Rather than cod or haddock, why not try coley or herring?Farmed fish such as salmon have a scheme similar to the MSC’s, run by the Aquaculture Stewardship Council (ASC) this is based on the impact on the wider environment of keeping fish in cages. It ensures that the fish do not escape into the wild and puts limits on numbers to prevent overcrowding. However, only a handful of fish farms in Britain meet these standards. The RSPCA Assured label can be given to salmon that were slaughtered humanely, but it doesn’t focus on environmental credentials.Labels to look out for: MSCASC fish labelled sustainable by the Good Fish GuideGame birds such as pheasants and partridge are problematic, since they tend to be from managed shoots. The birds are released into the wild as chicks, only to be shot later in the season. It is difficult to know if shoots are well managed and there are questions over the impact that so many non-native birds have on the countryside.Wild game meat such as rabbit, deer and even squirrel is more straightforward. All these species are shot as part of managing the landscape for conservation purposes, such as planting trees. They are truly free-range animals living in the wild. If you are lucky enough to live in the countryside, make friends with a gamekeeper, who will probably give you game meat for free.Eating British venison is good for trees, since the animals are a problem in areas such as the Highlands, where they ravage new forest plantations. However, a substantial amount of venison sold in British shops is from deer farmed in New Zealand, because the meat is more consistent. Look out for UK venison or track down a reputable butcher or game dealer.Where to buy: game dealers and independent butchers Borough Market, LondonYou need to know what you are doing, but is there a more ethical meat than that of animals that have been killed anyway and will otherwise be wasted?Technically, animals on a public highway are the property of the government, but that has not stopped advocates of “roadkill recycling” recommending eating pheasant, squirrel and even badger found on the road. Alison Brierly, an artist and roadkill recycler, offers safety tips on her website. She recommends carrying surgical gloves and a good knife and butchering smaller animals on the roadside – taking the breasts out of pheasants, for example, or the meaty legs from a rabbit or squirrel, and leaving the rest for the buzzards.Unlike meat, milk is very difficult to trace back to the farm, as it tends to be mixed together at centralised bottling plants. The label “free range” guarantees that cows have been kept outside at least some of the time, but one of the easiest ways to make sure you are buying higher-welfare is to invest in organic. Studies at the University of Newcastle have suggested that organic milk could be better for you, since it contains higher amounts of omega-3 fatty acids. Look out for dairies where calves are kept “at foot”, ie with their mothers.Labels to look out for: organic Pasture for Life free range ethical dairyWhere to buy: Cream o’ Galloway the Ethical Dairy Mossgiel FarmMost of the fresh eggs sold in Britain are free range. This means that the hens have access to the outdoors – as long as there isn’t a bird flu outbreak, when all birds are kept indoors. If you want to be sure that birds have a bit more space and access to pasture, buy organic.Eggs in a lot of processed food such as mayonnaise are likely to be from caged birds, so look out for products that state the use of free-range eggs on the label.If you want to be really ethical, get your own hens and eat the eggs. Rescued battery chickens are increasingly popular.Labels to look out for: organicWhere to buy: the Mac’s Farm Purton House OrganicsHumans and honeybees have lived alongside one another for millennia. The Vegan Society says honey is not vegan because, among other things, it is fundamental to the wellbeing of a hive, but others consider supporting bee keepers key to maintaining traditions that benefit both species. Bee farming in the UK is very different from the industrial-scale operations found in the US, especially among local producers, where honey is taken only when it is plentiful and appropriate. There is a movement towards “natural” beekeeping that uses a “bee-centred” approach to hive farming.Keeping bees is also good for the wider countryside, as it provides pollinators for flowers and food crops. But ethical honey doesn’t have to be British. Imported Fairtrade honeys support bee farmers all over the world and can be the best way to protect forests, by providing a livelihood for local people.

She accepted that, objectively, she was very good – the Golden Globe, Emmy and Screen Guild awards for her work in the Sopranos and Nurse Jackie gave that away – but struggled with her inability to explain why she was good. It all stemmed from her time at college, when she was surrounded by polished students who could articulate what made for great acting. But Falco was the only one who could produce it.After sustained success, and a chance encounter in an airport with a Meryl Streep biography, Falco became comfortable with the fact that, as she puts it: “There’s certain people who know how to act from a more intrinsic level than an intellectual one.” Probably more than she realises.The principle applies to almost all professional creativity. Those who can, do. But most of them couldn’t teach even if they wanted to. It’s rare to find somebody who is equally accomplished in theory and practice. The great performers usually rely on something else – an instinct which, at its best, verges on the supernatural.Take the example of everyone’s favourite improv theatre: association football. It is analysed like never before, but most of the really good stuff, the Emmy-winning stuff, remains almost impossible to articulate. Ask anybody who has produced a moment of inidual brilliance and the chances are they will struggle to explain why or sometimes even how they did it.Dennis Bergkamp, Kevin De Bruyne, Lionel Messi, Ryan Giggs and – if you want examples from a different sport – Ben Stokes and Michael van Gerwen are among the thousands of greats who attest to the importance of instinct. There’s no I in team, but there are plenty in inidual – and in instinct, improvisation, imagination and ingenuity. And every team benefits from the successful demonstration of those.Allen, like all great goalscorers, spent his career trying to find space. That generally involved running on to the ball rather than trying to manufacture it while in possession. But he did a nice sideline in goals that involved the sort of imagination and spatial awareness associated with hipster darlings. Bergkamp or Dimitar Berbatov would have been very happy to score this goal at Cambridge, and they would have loved the one at Upton Park.It started with the mundane act of stretching away from goal to control Mike Fillery’s cross, while trying to keep his balance on the muddy surface. Allen turned just outside the D and stopped to front up Billy Bonds, the West Ham captain. Bonds was leaning towards him like a sumo wrestler, waiting for the signal to engage. Their brief stand-off was interrupted when Neil Orr, appearing to Allen’s right, decided to stick his surname in. As he approached, Allen dragged his studs over the ball to move it slightly away from goal, thus partially shielding it from Orr and buying himself a split-second to work out what to do next.Allen’s instinct told him to drag the ball again, this time to move it completely away from Orr. As he did so, Bonds saw his chance and lunged optimistically towards the ball. Before he got there, Allen produced a third drag-back to take him out of the game. Orr, meanwhile, was transfixed just outside the area, engaging in a ferocious internal debate as to what day it was.“After the second drag-back I still had my back to goal, so I had to move it again,” says Allen. “That’s why I did another drag-back. Each touch led to the next one.”One at a time. It’s the footballer’s cliche, usually used for taking each game as it comes. But most inidual goals are created one step – or, in Allen’s case, one drag-back – at a time. There’s no bigger picture, no bird’s-eye view or medium-term planning. It’s like an arcade adventure game, where your only concern is to avoid being zapped by the nearest defender.For all Allen’s eye-catching drag-backs, the best touch might be the one that followed, an instant push into the space in front of goal. “The ball actually got away from me a little,” he says, “and I had to stretch to finish it.”The weight of the touch was less important than the angle. Had it been any straighter, Alvin Martin would have been able to beat Allen to the loose ball. Instead he arrived a split-second after the striker, who guided the ball past Phil Parkes and into the bottom corner.The finish was admirably clear-headed most of us would have been so high on our own skill as to over-excitedly leather it into Row Q. It was a goal of unique brilliance, a Zorroish swish through the West Ham defence, and even more striking in the context of 1980s English football. It belonged on the Copacabana.One of the most memorable things about Allen’s goal was his anti-celebration. He walked away, almost po-faced, with nary a hint of a smile. At first we assumed this was faux-nonchalance, the pose we all struck when we fluked a screamer in the park as kids. But it was actually because of the match situation.With Trevor Brooking producing the kind of masterclass that had some wondering whether he could be tempted out of international retirement at the age of 35, West Ham had battered QPR and should have led by much more than 2-0 when Allen scored. Allen’s wasn’t a consolation goal, as there were 14 minutes remaining, but at the time it probably felt like it.“It was because of the way the game had gone,” he says. “And maybe, in the moment, I didn’t realise quite how good a goal it was. I didn’t see it as a spectacular goal that I was gonna go crazy about. Now I look at it and think, yeah, the drag-backs were quite something.”It gave new meaning to the cliche of dragging your team back into the game. Allen did celebrate wildly when he scored a tap-in nine minutes later to give QPR an unlikely draw. He had missed much of the season, but the West Ham double came near the start of a brilliant run of 10 in 10 games. It had a huge impact both on him and his team. At the end of the season he made his England debut against Brazil in the Maracanã, and soon after moved to Spurs.Allen’s goals also helped QPR to finish fifth in their first season after promotion to the first ision. Had they won their last two games, they would have ended up in second. Fifth was still good enough for Europe, which was a shock to one journalist who had written at the start of the season: “The only way this lot will qualify for Europe is through the Eurovision Song Contest.”Much was made of their “magic carpet” – the plastic pitch that rubbed so many opposing teams up the wrong way. Many away sides in the old Second Division moaned about having to play on it, and that didn’t change when QPR were promoted to the top flight. “The only difference,” said their manager Terry Venables, “was that, being the First Division, we got a higher class of complaint.”They had a higher class of riposte as well. QPR won as many away games as any team that season, including the champions Liverpool. They could play on plastic and grass – or, as Allen showed at West Ham, on mud.• Up Front by Clive Allen is published by deCoubertin Books."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/769ed219d7186395791b5e859a2a6aa226d8e01c/95_2016_920_552/master/920.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=03f283feab76b14a0b1d613004544b13","title":"tell us about the pressures men are under to have children","story":"We would like to hear from men who are feeling under pressure to have children by a certain ageSome men feel pressure to have children by a certain age.

A thinktank run by Cummings in 2004 advocated an end to the BBC’s funding model and described it as a “mortal enemy” of the Tory party.Broadcasters have also been unhappy that the prime minister’s Brexit day “address to the nation” was filmed by Downing Street rather than a crew from a TV network, as would usually be the case.Some of Johnson’s recent hires as special advisers include those with specialisms in film production and photography, prompting speculation that he is increasingly intending to bypass the media. The prime minister has recently launched so-called “people’s PMQs” sessions in which he reads out pre-vetted questions and answers them himself in an attempt to speak directly to the public.There have also been signs that No 10 is trying to shake up its relations with political journalists, who are collectively known as the lobby. Political journalists have already complained about No 10 changing the location of its daily briefings with the prime minister’s official spokesman from a room in parliament to Downing Street, meaning they are now held on government territory.There have previously been problems with some journalists being denied access, but these have largely been to political, rather than government, events. During the election campaign, the Mirror was excluded from following Johnson’s campaign on his battlebus after Tory complaints that its online coverage was not balanced.Earlier on Monday, Downing Street also limited access to Johnson’s keynote Brexit speech to one journalist per outlet, which meant some sketch writers who satirise the prime minister were unable to attend.After the walkout, a senior No 10 source said there had been a normal briefing for all lobby journalists after the prime minister’s speech and that the later one was a “smaller, selected briefing for specialist senior journalists”. The source said “a number of uninvited journalists barged into No 10 and demanded to be part of it” but were told they could not attend.The banned journalists who tried to attend the briefing had passed through Downing Street’s security scanners, shown their parliamentary passes and knocked on the door to gain entry. All the invited journalists were political editors rather than Brexit specialists.Labour said the move by Johnson’s team showed the prime minister was “resorting to tactics imported from Donald Trump to hide from scrutiny”.Tracy Brabin, the shadow digital, culture, media and sport secretary, raised a point of order about the No 10 walkout in the House of Commons, prompting Eleanor Laing, the deputy speaker, to say journalists must be treated with respect. “Press freedom is a cornerstone of our democracy and journalists must be able to hold the government to account,” said Brabin. “The future trade agreement with the European Union is an issue of great public importance and interest. Those gaining access to such important information should not be cherry-picked by No 10.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fa8858647fac27a9f9c499246d44f31119c6f297/0_248_6240_3744/master/6240.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c26eba65cc893b14f92956dbeb246217","title":"brexit weekly briefing one chapter ends another begins","story":"UK’s departure from EU opens the door to bruising trade talks, as the briefing also bids farewellWelcome to the last  weekly Brexit briefing: after more than three and a half years and nearly 170 instalments, this – three days after the UK formally left the EU – is the final one. Thank you for subscribing.Full live and daily coverage of the key talks on the future relationship between the bloc and its first ex-member will, of course, continue in the  as they advance, while our Brexit Means … podcast will provide monthly in-depth insights.Meanwhile: Britain may have left Europe, but the  is doing no such thing.These two powers will remain neighbours, allies and closely entwined in each other’s affairs. And so, as the decade unfolds, we will be doubling down on the ideas, issues and interests that Britain shares with its fellow Europeans, and investigating and interrogating those in power – in London, Brussels and other capitals.Misinformation and misunderstanding remain big risks in this new era of withdrawal and disengagement. Our clear, independent, authoritative reporting has never been so vital in bridging the gap. We will be the publication that informs Britain about Europe, Europe about Britain – and the rest of the world about both.That’s it, then. We’ve left. Still a lot to sort out, of course, but after the European parliament ratified the withdrawal agreement, singing Auld Lang Syne as emotional British MEPs left the chamber for the last time, it all accelerated.In Scotland, Nicola Sturgeon called for unity and focus in the push for Scottish independence while playing down the chances of a referendum this year in England, leavers celebrated from Westminster to West Yorkshire.As Big Ben was projected on to the front of No 10 and the countdown to the 11pm exit began, Boris Johnson acknowledged there were “many … who feel a sense of anxiety and loss”, but promised to “spread hope and opportunity to every part of the UK”.On the continent, Emmanuel Macron warned that Brexit was an “alarm signal” of huge historic significance and said the leave campaign was based on “lies, exaggerations and cheques that were promised but will never come”.Ursula von der Leyen, the European commission president, said Europe would “defend its interests in a determined manner. Only those who acknowledge the rules of the internal market can benefit from the common market.”And so after 47 years, Britain’s membership of the EU came to an end. It did not take long for the ante to start being upped ahead of the next stage of the process: talks on the future relationship, due to begin in early March.The EU said it would back Spain over its territorial claims to Gibraltar by giving Madrid the power to exclude the British overseas territory from any trade deal with Brussels Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary, said legislative alignment “just ain’t happening” and denied that checks in the Irish Sea were “indispensable” .More or less simultaneous statements by the British prime minister and Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator, underlined the gulf between the two sides as officials prepared for the upcoming talks.Johnson made clear that he would push for a free trade deal with zero tariffs, similar to the EU’s with Canada, but said he was not prepared to accept EU demands for regulatory alignment in order to get it. Instead, the UK would prefer the kind of relationship the EU has with Australia, which involves tariffs.Barnier said Johnson had already agreed in the political declaration to stay true to EU rules on state aid, competition, social and environmental standards, climate change and tax. “There can’t be possibly any surprise on the British side to hear that,” Barnier said. “He and his team paid attention … to the text that commits us both.”Negotiations due to start on 3 March will be ided into 12 strands with parallel talks on a rolling three-week basis before then, the two sides will be in “scheduling and scoping” discussions to prepare for the talks.A 40-person taskforce inside No 10 will run the negotiations on the UK side, headed by Johnson’s Europe adviser, David Frost. The EU will be led by the familiar figure of Barnier.The priority for both sides is to negotiate a free trade agreement that will form the basis of their new future economic relationship, with the objective being zero-quota, zero-tariff trade in goods. The EU has said it will only agree to that if the UK pledges zero dumping Johnson has said the UK will not be bound by the EU rulebook.Other clashes can be expected over the EU’s refusal to bring financial and other services into the trade deal, and over fishing, as the EU seeks to link goods trade to continued access to British waters. The talks will also include many non-trade issues such as security, foreign affairs, data, and cultural and educational ties, some of which are likely to prove equally tricky.My colleague Jennifer Rankin has a very good summary of the two sides’ positions.Brexit has happened, the  editorial said. It is a defeat to be mourned. But the country will face big choices about its place in the world:Our departure is a tragic national error, against which this newspaper has consistently argued. It is still opposed by around half of the population, by majorities in Scotland, Northern Ireland and London, and by most young people, all of whom are just as patriotic as those whose cause has won the day. It is a defeat to be mourned and learned from … , at least, is not leaving Europe. We are a European news organisation. Europe is our back yard. It’s in our hearts and it’s in our DNA. We will do everything we possibly can to report on Europe, to Europe, and for Europe. Perhaps, like many pro-Europeans, we haven’t done everything we could have done over the last 47 years to burnish the links. The lesson for us all is to do more, and to do it better. Long live Britain. Long live Europe."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9ab748c414da5c7edba2716434178553a9a4593a/421_576_2729_1637/master/2729.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=046a283650d1469a13dfaac8a2b1a3ab","title":"no 10 reporter ban civil service chief must investigate says starmer","story":"Labour, SNP, Lib Dem and some Tory MPs criticise exclusion of journalists from briefingMPs have raised concerns that Boris Johnson is undermining press freedom after certain reporters were banned by his top media adviser from attending a government briefing on the EU.A series of Labour, SNP, Lib Dem and some Tory MPs raised concerns about the events of Monday afternoon in 10 Downing Street, when selected journalists were invited to a briefing and others were excluded.It prompted a walkout by all the senior journalists invited to the briefing, including the BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg, ITV’s Robert Peston, and reporters from Sky, the , Sun, Mail,  and Financial Times.The incident was debated in the House of Commons, after Tracy Brabin, the shadow culture secretary, was granted an urgent question. Chloe Smith, a Cabinet Office minister, defended the briefing as a normal way of informing some journalists about specialist technical subjects, in addition to routine lobby briefings to be held twice daily.Sir Peter Bottomley, the Conservative father of the House of Commons, advised ministers that there was a “problem” which needed resolving with the media, although he said the behaviour of New Labour spin doctors was worse. “I do believe that it would be sensible for the government to consider having a talk to the senior political editors who did walk out and see if there’s a way of getting over this problem and resolving it,” he said.Bim Afolami, another Tory MP, asked the minister to ensure “briefings are done in a sensible way with the agreement of all members of the lobby over the longer term” and that the Commons should be committed to “no political interference in the media as that is a foundation of our democracy”.Opposition MPs were even more critical. Brabin said: “The ability of the lobby to have access to briefings without favour is a longstanding tradition and one that is vital to the health of a functioning democracy… What was the selection criteria and if that decision was made by a special adviser, are they in violation of the code of conduct of special advisers and the civil service code?“The government’s behaviour in these matters threatens the civil service’s core values of impartiality and objectivity. It also brings into question the integrity of future government-media briefings and the conduct of its special advisers and damages a free and vibrant press.”Pete Wishart, an SNP MP said the minister’s attempts to defend the selective briefing were “woeful and desperate” and “would make Comical Ali look like a Pulitzer prizewinner”, calling it a “black day for press freedom”.The government’s actions have been condemned by the Society of Editors and the National Union of Journalists.Keir Starmer, the Labour leadership candidate, has also written to Mark Sedwill, the head of the civil service, asking him to urgently investigate what happened and whether government officials are being politicised.He warned that the decision to exclude some of the media from a briefing with David Frost, the government’s chief trade negotiator, had “undermined the civil service’s ability to comply with its core values of integrity, objectivity and impartiality”.Frost is a former senior civil servant who was made a political special adviser under Johnson but a previous briefing on security was conducted by intelligence and security officials bound by the civil service code.“The actions of the prime minister’s director of communications, whois a political appointee, are deeply disturbing,” Starmer said. “I am concerned that they have undermined the civil service’s ability to comply with its core values of integrity, objectivity and impartiality. Equally, banning sections of the media from attending important briefings about important matters of government is damaging to democracy.“For instance, the government’s post-Brexit trade plans are matters of national importance. The media’s access to the prime minister’s chief negotiator should not be determined by political favouritism.”Earlier, Michael Gove, a senior cabinet minister, refused to comment on the decision or say what he as a former journalist would have done in the same situation.He told Sky News that he did not know the full circumstances but he was sure the dispute could be sorted out."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2b4fc83a6b3a2ee956c017f77967906c2f1fad8c/0_108_3244_1946/master/3244.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6db4a47cbded5aaeb3acc9f9f88b954c","title":"mindfulness in the mountains does your winter holiday hold the key to wellness","story":"Research shows that skiing not only improves fitness and tones you up, it also boosts your mental health. So book your winter holiday to the mountains safe in the knowledge that you’ll return home healthier and happierNo matter how much time you spend on the slopes, the pleasure of being in the mountains never gets old. Emily Sarsfield, skier and Olympic ski cross athlete, says: “Skiing makes me feel peaceful, relaxed and at one with myself. It’s almost like dancing – it’s unreal.”When Sarsfield isn’t skiing competitively she shares her passion for the sport through private ski instruction. Accustomed to stilling her own nerves ahead of global competitions, she’s ideally placed to bring some mindfulness to her lessons. “When I’m teaching, my clients sometimes get stressed and fearful. I’ll stop and encourage them to take a moment to take a few breaths, soak up the views, absorb the calm and remember why we’re skiing – to explore this beautiful world – and those fears invariably disappear,” she says.It’s a sign of the mindful times that resorts and winter sports companies are increasingly catering to those eager to combine skiing and boarding with erse non-ski activities, from dog-sledding and ice-climbing to outdoor yoga and qi gong. In response to demand from its clients, the all-inclusive Club Med is launching a new initiative this winter at properties in France where guests can swap half days spent on the slopes for wellness experiences such as yoga, swimming and spa treatments.It’s a trend that Rosie Cardale, a qualified physiotherapist, yoga and pilates instructor, has experienced first-hand while working in the French Alps. “Incorporating physio treatments, yoga and pilates classes into ski holidays is fast becoming the norm for many holidaymakers,” she says.“My clients, who range from veteran skiers accustomed to regular physiotherapy and yoga at home, to infrequent skiers seeking to recover from an injury quickly, consistently report feeling more energised and stronger, both physically and mentally, after time spent in the snow.”According to Cardale, setting aside some time for mindfulness is actually the secret to getting the most out of your winter holiday. “Find some downtime to fit in some gentle breathing exercises – ideally in the warmth of your hotel or chalet or even on a long chairlift. It can do wonders for your body and mind,” she says. “And if you get a chance in the evening, stretching will really help you to make the most of the next day on the slopes.”Finally, if the stress still creeps in while you’re on the slopes, just remember Sarsfield’s mantra: “If you’re lucky enough to be in the mountains, you’re lucky enough!”Club Med, founded in 1950, is the pioneer of the all-inclusive concept, offering nearly 70 premium resorts in stunning locations around the world including North and South America, Caribbean, Asia, Africa, Europe and the Mediterranean."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d2cfb76265d34c6243019f32b58347f34c2dfaf8/0_162_5050_3030/master/5050.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=85bcfb928e77bc3260bce40c979d2859","title":"leap day 2020 do you have special plans","story":"Share how you will mark the first February 29 falling on a Saturday since 1992 2020 is a leap year, which means we’ll have a 29th of February, also called Leap Day.

For a fortnight the pretty face of the gentle game took a battering in Melbourne, bouncing from one public relations disaster to another, and the bruises will last.The image meltdown began with the reluctance of the Australian Open to acknowledge with sufficient speed and clarity what everyone in the city – everyone in the country and around the world – knew about the choking effects of bushfire smoke. It then moved on to the similar impact the twisted moral rectitude of Margaret Court had on everyone not born in the 19th century, most publicly Martina Navratilova and John McEnroe, who objected to the 77-year-old legend’s hardwired homophobia and almost forgotten apartheid apologia. Holy smoke, indeed.Presentation is everything. While the cheerleading television companies covering the first slam of the season for a worldwide audience of many millions could hardly ignore what their viewers saw through the yellowbrown haze on the screens, most dramatically the on-court coughing collapse of Dalila Jakupovic, it took the tournament days to satisfy the curiosity of the media and the inquiries of worried players and spectators about what constitutes safe air in Melbourne Park.The pollution eased Court got guarded semi-apologies from Navratilova and McEnroe, but she did not reciprocate. The tournament and TV pretended, risibly, that Navratilova and McEnroe had broken hitherto unknown “safety protocols” – not what they actually did, which was to embarrass Court. Navratilova talked to TV and McEnroe put out a statement, agreeing.But there was one exclamation mark left to put on the sentence of embarrassment. It arrived at the end of the ninth game in the second set of the men’s final on Sunday evening when Novak Djokovic had his Serena Williams moment. He was enraged, with minor justification, that two violations for slow serving had shredded the steel grip he normally has on his emotions. So, with all the assurance of an entitled champion, he tapped the foot of the chair umpire, Damien Dumusois, and, to borrow from Australian argot, “gave him a serve”.When he should have “let it go through to the ‘keeper”, Djokovic had “a nibble outside off” and exploded. “You made yourself famous in this match,” he said to the dignified Frenchman. “Great job. Especially in the second one. Great job. You made yourself famous. Well done man.”The damage was done. Again. Because he is playing tennis from Mars (albeit via Hades), Djokovic recovered to beat Dominic Thiem, cast in the Naomi Osaka role here (except, unlike the Japanese player in the 2018 Flushing Meadows final against Williams, the Austrian lost, and that matters in this tale). In the euphoria of Djokovic’s eighth Melbourne victory, the moment was briefly parked, to resurface only when the winner remembered his obligation to put a sheen on the event. Correctly again, he apologised for his crassness. Sort of. Trying to patch up the image thing with a smile, he said: “For touching his shoe? I mean, I didn’t know that’s completely forbidden. I thought it was a nice, really friendly touch.”It was not a good look, for himself and for the tournament that had just made him A$4.2m (£2.1m) richer. Because he is charming and intelligent, he reckoned he’d pulled it off. However, like the fire smoke, there was a lingering whiff of something being not quite right. The headlines were awful. Someone looked up the rules. He could be fined A$30,000 for that sort of thing – like Williams, who had to pay a little less in the end.So on Monday, when he should have been glorying in his victory, he apologised again. “Sometimes you do things that you’re not happy with and you go through different emotions. You go through ups and downs. Of course, I’m not happy that I touched the chair umpire. And I’m sorry if I offended him or anybody else.” Put to bed. Done. Move on. Image saved. Or maybe not.Court will regard her visit as a triumph, honoured on the 50th anniversary of her Grand Slam, with her eponymous stadium still in place – despite Navratilova’s campaign to have it changed to Evonne Goolagong Arena.Court will be back, saying whatever she wants. So will Djokovic. Will Navratilova? Will McEnroe? They were backed into a corner to stop rocking the bloody boat, guys. Maybe they won’t bother to make the trip next time. It’s a long way to go to be humiliated when you know you’re right.The odds are Djokovic will win the men’s title again. At his best, nobody can touch him, except Rafa Nadal on clay if fit. Federer couldn’t beat him with two match points at Wimbledon last summer. Nor could he protect a 4-1 and 5-2 lead in the first set against Djokovic in the semi-finals.Djokovic, on 17 majors now, could add two of the remaining three slams in 2020. So, this time next year, if he won a ninth Australian Open, he could sit alongside Federer on 20 career majors – with Nadal, if the Spaniard wins in Roland Garros this summer. All three of the Big Three sharing 60 grand slam titles, equally and nervously, each wondering which of the other two will leave the party first. That’s some image.And it’s some party. For all the nonsense of the past fortnight, tennis continues to amaze. If only it would lighten up a little. If only it would say in public what it says behind closed doors, like Navratilova and McEnroe – and, probably, Djokovic."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eff20f6663b827cb08de407af22734b8887c6fbb/0_15_4245_2546/master/4245.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=790d3702daf2b42943bce2c30ad430c7","title":"olympic hopefuls work life balance","story":"Some athletes in Olympic sports live in a world of certainty with steady incomes and access to resources. These four dreamers are from a different placeSome Olympic sports athletes live in a world of certainty. They know they’ll make the team. They have steady incomes within their sports, with ample access to any resources they need to compete. The following four athletes don’t dwell in that world. They have a delicate balance of work and sports in their quest to earn a trip to the Olympics that is far from guaranteed.Pitts’ pursuit of an Olympic track and field berth has been made possible in part by a surprising activity.No, the 5ft 8in triple jumper from Louisiana State University hasn’t changed sports to try something that isn’t on the Olympic radar. She has just trained a couple of rodeo athletes, all part of the employment scramble that has kept her going in the sport more than five years after graduation.“Their main thing was getting off the horse and running to the calf,” Pitts said of her rodeo clients. “You have to think outside the box. We don’t have a horse we can train on all the time.”Pitts is employable, having graduated from LSU in 2014 with a degree in kinesiology and a minor in psychology. She has trained athletes, not just in rodeo, who have a need for speed. She also has worked as a personal trainer in a retirement community and as a career counselor in middle schools.And she has been the bearer of bad news for a few people.“Being a career coach, I’ve had to crush a lot of dreams,” Pitts said. “Sometimes, unfortunately, I talk people out of being a professional track and field athlete.”Pitts isn’t being mean. Just realistic. She knows how tough it can be to stay in the sport without top-tier USA Track and Field funding, big-time sponsorship or the prize money offered at the world’s best meets.But she’s able to keep expenses down most of the time. She’s able to use the facilities at her alma mater, where she works with Boo Schexnayder, one of the coaches in the powerhouse LSU program.She also doesn’t travel much for competition. LSU hosts a couple of meets each year, including an indoor meet that usually kicks off her competitive year in January. (She tends to win.)For national championships, she can qualify for “pre-allocation” money if she gets the right results beforehand. For other meets beyond Baton Rouge, LSU’s home city, she usually pays her own way.Medical bills are also a challenge. She has phased off her parents’ insurance and gets Medicaid, but she had to pay a lot out of pocket to have ankle surgery to deal with bone spurs.Given all these obstacles, she has had the passing thought of taking her own career advice and choosing another path, especially when she balanced training with a job that kept her on her feet all day.“Boo even asked me, ‘How are you doing this physically?’” Pitts said. “I was working 32 hours a week and doing track and field. I was just coming back off surgery. I was frustrated with my marks.”Still, she has made some national teams, thanks to a series of fourth-place finishes in the US championships. She hasn’t been to the Olympics or world championships, but she has competed in the NACAC (North America, Central America and Caribbean) championships a couple of times. She took third in the 2015 NACAC meet with an official personal best of 13.83 meters and a wind-aided mark of 14.02.With her fourth-place finish in the US championships last year, she earned a spot in The Match, a Ryder Cup-style competition between the USA and Europe.“We went to Belarus,” she said. “It was really fun. It got pretty competitive in the end because Europe started pulling away. I was able to end my season on a seasonal best.”Now she’s looking toward the Olympics and next year’s worlds.“(The Match) gave me that kick in the butt, like, this isn’t it. You have to get on your horse.”Just like her training clients.Grossman is the fourth-ranked climber in USA Climbing’s overall tally and has earned a spot on the national team.The bad news for this year is that USA Climbing only gets two berths per gender in the 2020 Olympics, and the women’s berths are taken.The good news is that she has plenty of time to get to the Games down the road. She’s a 19-year-old student at the University of Colorado.She didn’t have to leave home to go to school. She and her family moved to Boulder, the city with the most appropriate name for a climber and a strong youth team in Team ABC, when she was young.“I moved to Colorado right before I started high school,” Grossman said. “There’s a lot of (climbing) gyms here. There’s one here every 10 minutes.”That’s a shorter commute than she faced growing up in Santa Cruz, California, where she sometimes had a two-hour trip. Getting back and forth between a gym and college quickly is important for someone balancing an elite climbing career with a couple of psychology courses, biology, ethics and philosophy.“I have class every day, so I normally get out around 2.30ish,” Grossman said. “Once I’m done, I’ll normally study for a little bit. Then I’ll go to the gym after that, normally around 4, and I’ll be there for around 3 hours. Then I go back to school to 7.”Her three-hour workouts include some sort of conditioning – abs, arms or legs, depending on the day – and she bikes around campus for extra cardio work. But the bulk of her training is climbing, climbing and more climbing. Her gym sets new climbs on its walls twice a week, and she can dial up thousands of different climbs through the Moonboard, a wall that lets climbers pick their own routes through the multitude of holds.“I go to the gym and have a plan,” she said. “That way I can stick with it and be efficient and not just play around and go, ‘Oh, it’s been two hours.’”Weekends are spent on even longer workouts or competitions, which usually force her to miss Friday classes. She only goes to overseas competitions in the summer.So in general, she has the time-management capability to train and study. What she doesn’t have is financial support beyond the occasional bit of free equipment or prize money – perhaps $1,500 for a first-place finish somewhere.“I have to pay for everything – my gym membership, flights to competition, hotels,” she said. “I’m trying to get a shoe sponsorship.”She’s unlikely to follow the Alex Honnold path and have a camera crew record something like Free Solo, the Oscar-winning documentary tracing Honnold’s daring ascent up El Capitan.“Competition is my main focus,” she said.Imagine juggling a job with a sport.Now imagine juggling a job with five sports.That’s the life of Sam Ruddock, an Olympic modern pentathlon hopeful who lives, works and trains in a city where you’d expect to find more actors than athletes.New York? Not Colorado Springs or one of the other hotbeds of Olympic sports training in the USA? Not someplace cheaper?“The way points are skewed, it’s become more and more skewed toward fencing and the run-and-shoot,” Ruddock said. “If you look at Olympic champions, the winners all won the fence. The best fencing in the country is in New York.”But Ruddock has to do more than fence. He has to swim, run, shoot and ride – a horse, not the subway.So Ruddock’s typical day may start around 6 or 7am in the pool at the New York Athletic Club. After he swims and stretches, he heads to work. After work, it’s time to run and lift weights. By 6pm or so, he’s fencing. That’s not every day, but he generally swims five to six times a week and fences three to five times.Riding is a bit tougher. New Yorkers can’t just hop on a horse and head to Central Park. Instead, he takes the occasional weekend at a friend’s house north of the city.The shooting aspect of the run-and-shoot is also a little tricky, but he can get a little bit of practice in the comfort of his own apartment, from one end of his bedroom to the fridge, or down a long hallway in a relative’s house. Fortunately, the shooting competition was revised several years ago so that athletes use electronic “guns” rather than bullets, so he’s not putting a few holes in the wall, Pulp Fiction-style.And about once a week, Ruddock heads to a track with his laser gun, a target and a bunch of duct tape, allowing him to mimic the pentathlon’s mix of running and shooting.When he’s not shooting, riding, swimming, running or fencing, Ruddock can be found putting his economics degree to work.“I work at a small consulting firm,” Ruddock said. “We’re an incubator, essentially. We help start-ups scale quickly. I work mostly on the fund-raising side. For me, it’s kind of like a dream job. The guy started the business about a year ago. He’s fairly flexible with my training. I can go in and out as I please, almost. It keeps me intellectually stimulated as well.”In case all that’s not enough, he recently started playing squash, which gives him a break from the more solitary pursuits of pentathlon.“It’s tough socially because all I do is work and train mostly,” Ruddock said. “Most social life revolves around bars and drinking and staying out late, and I can’t really do that.”Ruddock is a second-generation pentathlete who first competed in his teens. He’ll be 27 this summer, and this may be his last attempt to reach the Olympics.But after 2020, you may still find him in a pool in New York – or perhaps a squash court, tennis court or golf course.“To take a day without working out would be odd for me,” Ruddock said.In a Colorado gym last summer, some NFL players were put into a training group along with other athletes. Among them was a 33-year-old Colorado native who had just moved in with his girlfriend and worked at a start-up.This group of men who make a living in a sport filled with violent collisions were stunned to learn what their training partner does in the colder months.“They all think I’m crazy,” said Stephen Garbett, who competes in the head-first sledding sport of skeleton. “They’re all like, ‘What do you do?’”A decade ago, Garbett didn’t know much about the sport himself. But then came a life-altering experience. On a trip home from Beverly Hills, where he was managing a gym, he started to feel ill. He wound up in the hospital for more than three weeks, with appendicitis just part of the problem.“It showed me how precious life was,” Garbett said. “Since then, I’ve set high goals for myself.”One goal was straightforward – he would go to college aged 24 and become the first person in his family to earn a degree. The other goal had to do with what was on TV during his hospital stay – the 2010 Olympics. Skeleton was the sport that caught his attention.Off he went to the University of South Carolina, notably not near one of the USA’s two sliding tracks but home to some business programs that appealed to him. He got his degree in sports and entertainment management, then headed for the hills to take part in a combine for prospective sliders.“They’re normally looking for college athletes,” he said. “I was 27. I was the oldest age that they allow incoming athletes.”When it was done, he became one of the handful of Americans who compete in skeleton. His status as an international competitor gets him free ice time at Lake Placid or Utah Olympic Park, but it doesn’t give him a steady income. Nor does it pay for his summer training with NFL players and other athletes. Or his travel.Good thing he did the college part first.“That (education) has helped me understand gaining sponsorship,” Garbett said. “You have to understand how to negotiate.”His personal sponsors, USA Bobsled and Skeleton’s team sponsors, and a summer golf tournament help him generate the money he needs to stay on the ice. So does a novel job with a start-up called Hotel Carbon, which is opening hotels that cater to athletes – including esports stages and viewing areas, Garbett’s department within the company.His offseasons are important. Not only is he able to train, work and be with his girlfriend, but he’s also able to get outdoors and away from the ice for a few months. All of that keeps him from burning out while making a run at being one of the older members of the US team headed for Beijing in 2022, when he would be 36 years old.“In high-level sports, there’s a ton of pressure from the sport, and financially there’s a huge burden,” Garbett said. “When you don’t have an escape, you’re not able to perform as well as you could.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4a17c83731803af42071af88f9284b36db5c2bd3/0_117_4014_2408/master/4014.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=460e6aa89b4ee026646c1193f62aff6e","title":"south africa v england first odi live","story":"Joe Denly’s outstanding innings comes to an end. He lifted a slower ball miles in the air towards long on, where Reeza Hendricks backpedalled to take a well judged catch. Denly made 87 from 103 balls, including 51 from his last 39 deliveries.49th over: England 253-7 (Denly 87, T Curran 11) An excellent over from Ngidi is tarnished when Denly smears the last delivery over mid-off for his second six. That takes England past 250.48th over: England 243-7 (Denly 79, T Curran 9) Hendricks misses a run-out chance off his own bowling, missing the stumps with Tom Curran halfway down the pitch. And then Denly is dropped by Smuts, a simple chance when Denly clothed a full toss straight to him. A terrific over from Hendricks nonetheless, only four from it.47th over: England 239-7 (Denly 77, T Curran 7) Yeeha! Denly charges Ngidi and launches a big six over wide long on. Of all the gin joints in all the world, surely he’s not going to finally make his first century for England here? I doubt there’s enough time. But he has played a gem of an innings, vaguely reminiscent of Michael Bevan at his best.46th over: England 231-7 (Denly 70, T Curran 6) This is turning into a handy score for England, who were 131 for six after 28 overs. If they get de Kock early, I think they’ll win. Meanwhile, the legspinner Shamsi ends with splendid figures of 10-0-38-3. 45th over: England 226-7 (Denly 68, T Curran 3) Tom Curran, who played some cracking cameos in the Big Bash League, gets off the mark by rifling Sipamla down the ground for two. A single to Denly off the last delivery takes him to his highest ODI score.The debutant Litho Sipamla gets his first ODI wicket when Woakes holes out to mid-off. His mother leads the celebrations, springing to her feet to hug those next to her in the crowd. Woakes, at his no-frills best, made a very useful 40 from 42 balls.44th over: England 221-6 (Denly 67, Woakes 40) Shamsi returns to bowl his last two overs. After three singles from the first five balls, Denly launches a superb drive to cow corner for four. That means he has equalled his career-best ODI score, which from memory was against Ireland at Belfast on his debut in August 2009.43rd over: England 214-6 (Denly 62, Woakes 38) Denly, hit painfully in the ribs earlier in the over, makes room to slap a short slower ball from Sipamla over mid-off for four. After an understandably slow start, he has hit 24 from the last 19 balls.42nd over: England 205-6 (Denly 55, Woakes 37) JJ Smuts’ last over goes for eight, all in ones and twos. This has been such a well-judged partnership. Smuts, the debutant, finishes with decent figures of 10-0-43-1.41st over: England 197-6 (Denly 53, Woakes 31) Denly brings up a patient half-century, his first in ODIs since 20 September 2009. England are scoring off almost every delivery now the last six overs have gone for 43.40th over: England 191-6 (Denly 48, Woakes 30) Woakes survives a potential run-out chance when Bavuma fumbles in the covers. Five singles from Smuts’ penultimate over.39th over: England 186-6 (Denly 45, Woakes 28) Phehlukwayo is back. Denly picks one of his many slower balls and launches it over mid-off for four, a superb stroke that brings up an intelligent, humble fifty partnership. The next ball is treated similarly, this time a little straighter, and all of a sudden England have scored 32 from the last four overs.38th over: England 176-6 (Denly 36, Woakes 27) Denly has stealthily become England’s top scorer. It’s been a sensible innings, tailor-made for the pitch and match situation, and he has ushered England towards a competitive total on a very slow pitch.37th over: England 173-6 (Denly 34, Woakes 25) Woakes blasts Hendricks just over extra-cover for four, the start of an excellent over for England. Eleven from it, most of them to Woakes, who has sped to 25 from 25 balls. Here’s Matt Dony. “Following on from Ian Copestake, maybe if John Starbuck has been on the side of a bus, sans kit, it would all have been so different...”Or it would have been an even better advert for the NHS urgently needing £350m a week.36th over: England 162-6 (Denly 34, Woakes 16) Woakes gets his first boundary, making room to slash Smuts wide of backward point for four. It was in the air, and not quite where he intended, but he got four for it.35th over: England 154-6 (Denly 33, Woakes 9) Beuran Hendricks, on for Sipamla, beats Denly with a good delivery from around the wicket. Three singles from the over. This is such a struggle, and the England batsmen aren’t exactly motoring either, honk.33rd over: England 149-6 (Denly 31, Woakes 6) Denly plays a lovely cover drive for four off Sipamla. Every little helps, and Woakes contributes a couple more with a drag over mid-on. That’s drinks.32nd over: England 140-6 (Denly 26, Woakes 3) The left-arm spinner JJ Smuts returns to the attack and hurries through another parsimonious over. England are crawling towards a vaguely competitive total.“I see Brian Withington has succumbed to blame culture by laying the cause of this national debacle at my door,” says Ian Copestake. “Well I’m here to tell him he is spot on. You can’t envision Starbuck naked without repercussions. See also Brexit.”31st over: England 138-6 (Denly 25, Woakes 2) Sipamla tries to york Denly, who digs it out calmly. One from the over, which means England have scored 32 from the last 10. I’ll level with you: it’s not riveting.30th over: England 137-6 (Denly 24, Woakes 2) Two runs from Shamsi’s eighth over. This is his first game as South Africa’s premier spinner, following the retirement of Imran Tahir, and it couldn’t have gone much better. He has figures of 8-0-26-3.29th over: England 135-6 (Denly 23, Woakes 1) This innings turned on the run-out of Joe Root, who looked in lovely touch and had breezed to 17 from 21 balls without recourse to boundaries.28th over: England 131-6 (Denly 20, Woakes 0) The new batsman is Chris Woakes, who is playing his 100th ODI. Denly and Woakes... if any pair can sex down England’s batting approach, it’s these two. Sam Curran is bowled round his legs! He missed a sweep at a ball that turned just enough to clip the outside of the leg stump. Shamsi has his third wicket!27th over: England 127-5 (Denly 19, S Curran 5) It’s all very low key at the moment: a single here, a dot ball there. Lutho Sipamla, 21, comes on to bowl for the first time in an ODI. After an accurate start, he drops short and allows Denly to nail a swivel-pull through midwicket for four. Shot! “Banton Banter,” warns Adam Hirst. “If Banton had been given not out on review, would the umpire have said ‘Baby, come back’?”26th over: England 121-5 (Denly 14, S Curran 4) England have hit only four boundaries in the last 17 overs, three of them from Banton. It’s not an easy pitch, this, and the odds of 21 on an England win look pretty generous.25th over: England 118-5 (Denly 12, S Curran 3) England bat pretty deep - Parkinson at No11 is the only donkey - so they could still reach the magical target of 240ish. Their celebrated lower order failed under pressure in the World Cup, but this is a more relaxed situation. And most of the players are different.24th over: England 115-5 (Denly 10, S Curran 2) The left-arm wristspinner Tabraiz Shamsi has had a fine day so far. His figures are 5-0-18-2. England are going nowhere at the moment but that’s understandable in the circumstances. They need a partnership.“Hi Rob,” says Damian Burns. “If my £2 a month contribution to the  isn’t being used to fly you to Cape Town to cover the cricket, I really don’t know why I bother donating at all…”23rd over: England 111-5 (Denly 8, S Curran 1) Lundi Ngidi returns to the attack. His first spell was that of a fast bowler returning after a hamstring tear. He should be able to relax a little more this time, especially as he won’t be bowling to Roy and Bairstow, and starts with an uneventful over. Three singles from it.“Am I alone in still reeling from the disturbing Starbuck imagery induced by the mischievous Copestake (over 14)?” says Brian Withington. “Could even have provoked the loss of quick wickets (and now Sky’s coverage) by a mysterious process of tangled quantum disturbance. In passing, young Banton looks outrageously talented (and rubber wristed).”He does. I’m surprised more hasn’t been made of that Darren Lehmann comment. The best player he has ever thrown to. 22nd over: England 108-5 (Denly 6, S Curran 0) England will never win anything unless they learn how to bat on slow pitches.Banton misses a firm sweep and is given out LBW. Shamsi didn’t even bother appealing he just ran down the wicket in celebration. Banton reviewed, presumably hoping he was outside the line. He wasn’t: it was Umpire’s Call, so England do at least keep their review. But they’ve lose their Banton.21st over: England 106-4 (Denly 5, Banton 17) The TV picture returns just in time for us to see Banton drive Phehlukwayo sweetly down the ground for four. It’s been an eye-catching cameo, 17 from 20 balls.19.3 overs: England 99-4 (Denly 3, Banton 12) A confident reverse sweep for four off Shamsi takes Banton into double figures.The TV picture has gone now, so I haven’t a clue what’s happening. You’re welcome!19th over: England 94-4 (Denly 3, Banton 7) Banton gets his first boundary, cuffing a short ball from Phehlukwayo over midwicket. Phehlukwayo responds by going past the outside edge with three consecutive deliveries, a high-class bit of bowling. 18th over: England 89-4 (Denly 3, Banton 2) Banton gets off the mark from his eighth delivery, working Shamsi for a single. England will be revising their target with each passing over. At the moment I suspect they’d be happy with 250.17th over: England 84-4 (Denly 1, Banton 0) England’s mini-collapse - four wickets for 30 - at least means Banton has time to play himself in on his debut. We’re barely a third of the way through England’s innings.This week’s Spin has landed, and it looks like a cracking read."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1cad1901d09a720d6c9acf84392988f20e5abe76/0_0_5500_3298/master/5500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bc91e809a7dcdf03b1d1c085a1536ee8","title":"councils let firms track visits to webpages on benefits and disability","story":"Investigation finds 400-plus councils let at least one third party track use of their sitesCouncils are sharing information about users of their websites – including when they seek help with a benefit claim, or with a disability or alcoholism – with dozens of private companies.More than 400 local authorities allowed at least one third-party company to track iniduals who visit their sites, an investigation has revealed.Some councils were found to be letting companies track use of sensitive sections of their sites, such as when people were seeking financial help or support for substance abuse.Data obtained from cookies tracking where users go online can be sold by data brokers for profit.Critics have argued that council websites serve a public purpose and should not let outside firms monitor their users’ activity, especially given the sensitive nature of some visits.Wolfie Christl, a technologist and researcher who has been investigating the ad-tech industry, said: “Public sector websites and apps should not use invasive third-party tracking at all.”Johnny Ryan, the chief policy officer at the anonymous web browser Brave, who analysed council websites and shared the findings with the , said: “Private companies embedded on council websites learn about you. This happens even on the most sensitive occasions, when you might be seeking help from your council.”Brave used open-source tools to see what companies were present on certain webpages. They found 409 council websites in the UK allowed private companies to receive data about their visitors.Companies track online activity through cookies, pixels and other trackers. When embedded in a browser, these bits of code can let users be traced around the web. While they don’t identify personal details such as name or address, they identify a user’s viewing habits – such as which page was loaded at a specific time.While many websites including the  use cookies, Ravi Naik, a data lawyer at AWO, suggested that their use on council websites was problematic because of the nature of the details being shared. He said: “We have most of our conversations with the state through local authorities and because of that involve more sensitive and personal information.”It is now prohibited for companies to share data on protected categories without explicit consent. This means before information on health, sexual orientation, race and political opinions is collected, the user must agree to the specific sharing of their “special category” data.Companies say they have consent via people accepting cookies. However, Brave’s report found that while some websites may have stated they used cookies, no users clicked on any buttons to accept or opt out of this process.The law states consent must be informed and based on an explicit affirmative action. The Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) said: “To be valid, consent must be freely given, specific and informed. It must involve some form of unambiguous positive action – for example, ticking a box or clicking a link – and the person must fully understand that they are giving you consent.”Ryan said: “We used an automatic system to load each council’s webpage. All it does is load the site. It is not able to click buttons. All of the tracking revealed in our research happened without consent.”Mark Gannon, the director of business change and information solutions at Sheffield city council, said cookies were used on its website, “and we require the consent of all customers to store or retrieve any data on a computer, laptop, smartphone or tablet”.The report states that when the Sheffield council website was loaded, companies could track someone without clicking on anything.Sheffield council said it used an Internet Advertising Bureau (IAB) transparency and consent framework tool provided by the Council Advertising Network. The network said: “No cookies whatsoever are installed for data brokerage purposes – this suggests that data collected from the website is being sold on, and it is not.”Ealing council said it believed its approach was “compliant with the requirements of GDPR”. However, it noted: “This is a complex and ever-evolving area which needs to be kept under review.”Enfield borough council in north London did not provide a comment.LiveRamp said it was no longer a part of Acxiom and it had never “sold UK electoral profile information to Cambridge Analytica”. It said it operated in compliance with jurisdictional laws and worked “diligently to detect and prevent the misuse of data”.A further 198 councils use real-time bidding (RTB) – when a web user loads a page, thousands of potential advertisers bid to serve them an advert in the blink of an eye. It means people’s data is being broadcast all over the internet to hundreds of companies. The ICO has been investigating the practice.Naik said there were two main issues. “The micro issue is: are councils really informing people about what is going on? The macro thing is the real-time bidding ad industry. There is an ongoing complaint to the Information Commissioner’s Office about this practice. They have already said they consider the practice unlawful.”Naik said it was hard to tell whether councils were making money from it. “But I imagine to councils it seems like a win-win situation.”A Google spokesperson said it did not build advertising profiles “from sensitive interest categories, including from sites offering help to address personal hardships, and we have strict policies preventing advertisers from using such data to target ads”.They told the  that third-party cookies could be used to better enable basic site functions or to serve and measure advertising.

The event was organised by Europe’s largest radio company, Global, which owns Capital and LBC, among others.“I was going to say big up Capital,” Stormzy announced, as he took to the stage to collect the award for best R\u0026ampB, hip-hop or grime artist. “But big up Magic as well. Magic are my Gs, you know what I mean.”The statement was a faux pas. The easy listening station Magic Radio is not a Global brand. In fact, it belongs to one of Global’s competitors, Bauer. “Stormzy shouts out Magic FM … at a rival radio company’s awards night,” ran a headline in .But Stormzy’s love of Magic is sincere and profound – and sometimes it cannot be contained. A year earlier, at the Mercury prize, an interviewer had introduced themselves as a reporter from Magic. “Magic Radio – are you mad?” responded a visibly amused Stormzy. “Before my career’s over, I need to have a song that Magic just play. ’Cos that’s when you know you have a legacy. If your song is just on the Magic playlist, and it sits there for the next 30 years, you have made something special.”Tune into Magic Radio and you will hear Rio by Duran Duran and Don’t Stop Me Now by Queen and Careless Whisper by George Michael. You will hear Moving on Up by M People and Don’t You Want Me by the Human League and Hello by Adele. And you will hear them over and over again. In the week beginning 20 January, the station played the 1997 Natalie Imbruglia track Torn no less than 10 times.In the popular imagination, particularly in London, where it began broadcasting under its current name in 1998, Magic Radio is still often referred to as Magic FM. “Magic FM is my life,” said James Corden in 2018. “I genuinely miss it when I’m away.”Since 2016, the Magic empire has expanded. The main station now broadcasts nationwide on digital radio (it is available on 105.4 FM in London), while five digital-only subsidiaries have appeared: Mellow Magic (lower tempo), Magic Soul (focused on soul and Motown), Magic Chilled (“fresh, laid-back hits,” aimed at a slightly younger audience), and the newest additions to the slate, Magic Workout (high-energy songs for the gym) and Magic at the Musicals (show tunes), both of which launched last year.Magic is hot property. Each week, 4.2 million listeners tune in to one of its stations, according to the latest available figures. That may not be as many as its immediate commercial rival, Smooth (5.75 million listeners and counting, across several regional and national stations), nor the most comparable BBC station, Radio 2 (14.18 million each week), but since Magic moved beyond its London origins, it has proved capable of rattling its bigger rivals. “The powers-that-be at Radio 2 are obsessed with Magic FM and the appeal it has to the middle-aged women,” reported the Radio Times in 2018. “Magic’s music policy doesn’t pretend to be particularly forward-looking. ‘More of the songs you love,’ is the station’s promise, and they deliver, from George Michael to Lionel Richie.”Looking back on the tectonic changes that have hit the music and media landscape in the past two decades, it seems a minor miracle that Magic, and music radio in general, still manages to pull in millions of listeners each week. Smartphones and streaming mean that anyone can instantly find just about any song ever recorded. And where, once upon a time, a favourite DJ might have been the person to introduce a listener to their new favourite song, nowadays streaming services such as Spotify can serve up endless personalised recommendations, based on your previous listening taste.All this makes it hard not to wonder why, when you can just listen to what you want to listen to, would you want to listen to a radio station that may play songs you don’t like, punctuated by adverts for Great Western Railway and Mr Kipling, traffic updates about the M25, and, in between the songs, chitchat of dubious interest? (“American houses have a lot of bathrooms. I don’t know why. Do they have weak bladders or something?” mused Nick Snaith, host of Magic’s mid-morning show.) What, in short, makes Magic magic?There is some data to suggest that in troubled times, consumers turn to music radio for comfort. “I saw some research on avoidance of news,” says David Lloyd, a former executive at Virgin and the BBC who now works as a radio consultant, “and one of the key things was: ‘I feel I can’t do anything about it’. And it’s that powerlessness that drives listeners to seek a bit of solace in formats like Magic.”Magic does carry news, but in its own way. In one week last autumn, when Brexit was dominating the wider headlines, the 8am news bulletin on the main station led on consecutive days with a plan to stop serious criminals being released from prison halfway through their sentences, Meghan Markle commencing legal action against the Mail on Sunday, Dina Asher-Smith’s silver medal at the World Athletic Championships in Doha, and Katarina Johnson-Thompson’s heptathlon gold at the same event. (Brexit news did follow later in the bulletins.) In general, Magic does not cover sport, but makes exceptions “when a sporting event captures the nation’s attention”, a spokesperson told me.Alongside the desire to escape the grim headlines, the expanding reach of Magic is testament to the power of musical nostalgia the extraordinary emotional hold that the songs we hear when we are young have on us when we are older. Everyone loves the music they grew up with, says Matt Deegan, the creative director at Folder Media, a radio consultancy. “Particularly 11 to 19. It’s the time you when discover yourself as a person, you go out for the first time, dancing, nightclubs.” When we switch on Magic, we are looking for memories. We are looking for sounds that trigger the feeling: “This was the song where I … ” Listeners, says Magic’s director of music, James Curran, are “coming for the warmth, the nostalgia of those songs that they love”.“If you drill right down, the ultimate drive to any radio station listening is mood,” says Lloyd. “Magic is very definitely a mood listen,” he adds. “It’s very consistent. You turn it on and there’s that sort of nectar you know, you’re not going to have a nasty shock. It’s always going to be a comforting, consistent sound.”One of Magic’s most dependable moods is Abba. “You know, there aren’t that many stations that would play Abba,” noted Curran. “If you think of all our main competitors, Heart doesn’t play them Capital doesn’t play them. Radio 1 doesn’t play them. Smooth will only play downtempo Abba. So they will play The Winner Takes it All, they might play Knowing Me, Knowing You or Fernando or Chiquitita. But no, they won’t play Gimme! Gimme! Gimme! (A Man After Midnight) or Dancing Queen, or Mamma Mia. So all those songs are covered by the Magic database.” On Magic, you can expect to hear Dancing Queen and Mamma Mia about four times a week.Even if you have heard a song a thousand times, there is something special about hearing it on the radio. “It’s a different experience when a song plays for you on the radio,” says the chart analyst and pop critic Chris Molanphy. “That combination of comfort and the occasional surprise, and you just sitting back and experiencing it passively, that’s still an experience that people want to have.” People have been predicting the death of radio since the 50s, but as Molanphy pointed out, “it continues to survive like a bacterium it’s still alive, even in the 2020s”.The origins of Magic Radio run back to July 1990, when Lord James Hanson – a corporate raider who acquired the nickname Lord Moneybags and was once engaged to Audrey Hepburn – launched a London station called Melody. It was inspired by easy listening stations Hanson had come across during his time in the US, where stations were based around a particular sound – something that took off in the US much earlier than it did in the UK. In 1998, Melody was sold to a magazine publishing company, which rebranded it as Magic 105.4. Ten years later, the station was acquired by the media conglomerate Bauer, which also publishes magazines such as Grazia, Empire and TV Choice.Today, Magic broadcasts from Bauer Radio’s headquarters in Soho. Bauer seemingly has a station for every age range. For 15- to 34-year-olds, there is Kiss. For “reluctant adults” between the ages of 25 and 54, there is Absolute. And for less reluctant adults, there is Magic. “The type of music we play, the type of presentation that we do, the topics that the breakfast show or another show might pick, the way we interview guests, all that sort of stuff, is trying to make this feel effortless, but also feel like a very warm and welcoming place,” Tony Moorey, the group content director for Magic and Absolute, told me. In the office, a screensaver on a desktop computer showed a whale surfacing in front of forests and snow-capped peaks. Mood-wise, very Magic.In the Magic studio early last year, I watched Tom Price, an actor and standup, present the weekend breakfast show. Price was accompanied by the producer Adam Herringshaw, who goes by the name Adam K professionally. Herringshaw, then 38, was wearing a backwards baseball cap and red high-top trainers. (Before Magic, he worked at Kiss, but moved, he explained jokingly, when the bosses felt Price needed ‘reining in’ he has since left the Bauer group altogether.)Just after 8am, Tina Turner’s 1984 track What’s Love Got to Do With It? was playing. The show had been on air for two hours. It had begun with Two Hearts by Phil Collins, passed through Hero by Enrique Iglesias, and Greatest Day by Take That. The newest songs were two 2011 tracks: Adele’s Someone Like You and Christina Perri’s Jar of Hearts.As Tina Turner played, Herringshaw spoke to a caller off-air to prime him for an interview. A theme for the show was “things you have accidentally broken”. The phone call remains a key tool for the Magic model of broadcasting. Phone-ins create a feedback loop, or at least the impression of a feedback loop, between presenter and audience, fostering a feeling of companionship. (“Your radio gives you something that your streaming list can’t,” Curran told me. “You’ve got a connection there.”)Price went live: “Loads of text messages coming in, for things that you have accidentally broken. Hello to Carol from Norfolk. ‘Hi Tom. Many years ago I was at my nan’s house. I went to use her bathroom. As I stood up to flush the chain, my wristwatch fell off into the pan.’”Later, off air, Price and Herringshaw gave their read on the appeal of Magic. Price argued that the station transcends its target listener base. “Every time I’ve told people I work on Magic, when I first started especially, no matter who I told – people our age, or people who are 20 – go: ‘I fucking love Magic,’” he said.Listeners love the Magic canon – from Queen’s Somebody to Love to I Wanna Dance With Somebody (Who Loves Me) by Whitney Houston – but their sense of what should go into it is imperfect. On the School Disco feature, a part of Price’s show during which the audience can request records, someone often asks for Saturday Night by Whigfield.“There are other songs that we kind of make a view on,” Curran told me later. “It’s like – that is just a bit too cheesy for where we want to go.”There is an art to curating musical nostalgia: one wrong move and the mood is lost. Not long ago, Price played Chesney Hawkes’ earnest power pop classic The One and Only. But he said he had to “build up a head of steam,” before unleashing it, referencing the song over a period of time, hyping it up, before finally pressing play.Herringshaw agreed, just about: “Once a year, for like two minutes, maybe it’s not the worst thing.”In 2015, a brand consultant named Charlotte Melford, received a call asking whether she would help Magic better understand its audience. Rather than the kind of clinical environment in which a focus group is observed through a one-way mirror, Magic wanted something more organic. “They called me,” Melford remembered, “and said: ‘We need to go meet them, experience them, and actually get under the skin.’”Melford sensed that the executives at Magic thought listeners viewed the station as “a guilty secret – something they felt a little bit apologetic about listening to.” Beyond that, they didn’t seem to know much about their audience. At the time marketing research concentrated on millennials and older people. But, Melford said, the audience in between – the core demographic for Magic – was under-researched.Melford set up WhatsApp groups for listeners to discuss the station. She also went into listeners’ homes, hosting six dinner parties in London, Leeds and Birmingham. For Seb Clark, Magic’s marketing manager, the experience was surreal. “I was sitting in someone’s living room, watching them eat,” he said. “She was probing. But it wasn’t just all about radio it was their lifestyles.”One assumption of the research had been that people turn to Magic not because they care much about the music, but because they want to feel warm and cosy. But what Melford discovered was that listeners genuinely loved the songs Magic lined up, and weren’t afraid to say so. “We’d radically underestimated the sense of personal confidence,” Melford said.In September 2016, Melford delivered her findings in a document titled “Magic – Introducing the Luminaries – living life in full colour and rewriting the rule book”. It is aimed at potential advertisers, but it is strangely revealing. The “Luminaries”, as Melford branded the audience, are indeed “living life in full colour”. (This page in the report is yellow, blue, red and purple.) The study aims to convey that Magic’s listeners are vivacious and sociable, enjoy music and have money to spend. (The words of the listeners themselves occasionally suggest a slightly different reality. “We regularly head to bed at 9pm, open our laptop and watch a box set together,” says one 38-year-old woman.) There are, apparently, 9,979,000 Luminaries in the UK, of whom 5,728,000 are reached by Bauer radio stations.Melford is conscious that her research, conducted in 2015 and 2016, reflected a less fraught world: it was pre-Brexit, pre-Trump. But it had an impact on how the station sounds today. Until Melford’s study, Magic had focused more on the 60s, 70s and 80s now, in its relentless pursuit of listeners between the ages of 35 and 55, Magic’s playlist moved its focus to the 80s, followed by the 90s. (That decision matches up with research by the American data scientist Seth Stephens-Davidowitz, which suggests that “strongest adult musical preferences” set in at 13 for women and 14 for men.)On a Saturday night in February last year, queues of Luminaries snaked outside the Eventim Apollo in west London for Magic Soul, one of the live events the station organises. The hosts were Angie Greaves – an afternoon show presenter, who has since defected to arch-rivals Smooth – and Lemar, a singer who came to fame on the BBC talent show Fame Academy. The lineup included Gabrielle and Tommy Blaize, “the voice of Strictly Come Dancing”. Towards the end, Gwen Dickey, the lead singer of Rose Royce, who injured her spinal cord in 2010, was carried on stage and performed seated, flanked by energetic dancers.At the interval, the audience crowded around the bar. “It takes us back to a time when we were younger, when we had fun, we loved the music, we were out,” Suzanne Hirst, a woman in her 50s, told me as we queued for drinks. “It takes me back to a time where it made me happy.”The foundation of Magic’s success is its playlist, which runs to about 650 songs for the main station. That figure includes songs that only play on the evening ‘Mellow’ show – the daytime playlist is about 400 songs. Stations that concentrate on new music tend to have smaller playlists – Magic executives say Capital plays about 250 songs on extensive rotation, or possibly even fewer. Global, Capital’s owner, would not confirm that figure, sternly stating: “We never comment on editorial decisions.”Among contemporary music, Adele and Ed Sheeran are firmly established Magic favourites. Curran points to these artists as properties who could pass “the festival test” – if you’re a rock festival, could you put them on? It’s music that can work in any context. “No disrespect to One Direction – but could I put them on at a rock festival? No,” Curran said.On a Wednesday morning in September, I attended a monthly playlist meeting for Magic Chilled, which aims at a slightly younger audience than the other branches of Magic. Each month, Chilled will add about five new songs to its playlist. The first order of duty at the meeting was to assess the previous month’s new tracks: Lover by Taylor Swift, Beautiful People by Ed Sheeran (ft Khalid), two versions of the Freya Ridings song Castles (one acoustic, the other not), How Do You Sleep? by Sam Smith, and Señorita by Shawn Mendes and Camila Cabello. The question was which of these would stay on the playlist and which would not, and what would replace them. In attendance were Curran and Brogan Hubber, a 25-year-old producer who also presents shows on Magic Soul.Magic presenters, with a few exceptions, do not get to pick their music. That is largely Curran’s domain and he has, in a way, been preparing for this role for most of his life. As a child in Edinburgh, Curran would listen to the Top 40 on Radio 1 on Sunday afternoons and write down the charts in order to discover their secrets. He would study how singles moved up or down, who was doing particularly well, or what genres were taking off. “I loved the statistical side of it,” he told me.Curran’s starting point for thinking about what music to schedule for Magic is the target audience – that, after all, is the demographic that the stations must deliver to potential advertisers. These days, Curran has a gut sense of what will appeal. Partly that stems from experience, but he also pays very careful attention to all the data he can get his hands on: official chart positions, midweek chart positions, airplay charts, iTunes downloads, numbers from Shazam (the app that identifies songs by listening to just a snippet), and the results of music library research, where listeners are asked to rate short clips of songs online. Above all, Curran and Brogan wanted to assess if the tracks were on their way up or down, and by extension, whether they should stay or go. In the end, the Sheeran and Ridings songs were axed, Smith survived, and Dermot Kennedy’s new track Outnumbered was added to the playlist.For Molanphy, the chart historian, this kind of curation remains essential to the success of music radio. “By and large, streaming is still a very active medium,” he told me. One of the attractions of music radio is that it is more passive. When someone else is picking the hits, you have “something comforting and familiar, yet with some element of surprise”, Molanphy said. “There’s a ‘lean-back’ aspect to radio that is hard to replicate with digital media, and I suspect that is the reason why terrestrial radio holds on.”The heart of Magic, and the show that is closest to the old, pre-Luminaries, lower-tempo days, remains Mellow Magic, presented by Lynn Parsons from 8pm to midnight every weeknight. One evening last year, I watched Parsons, a radio veteran who has worked across BBC and commercial stations, present the show. She is small and blond, and stands up behind her microphone as she speaks, a trick her first ever manager in radio insisted on. “As a presenter, you’re a bit of an actor,” Parsons said off air. Another of her broadcasting tricks – taking off her security pass to avoid on-air rattle – misfired one night not long after she had started on the show. She left the studio to go the lavatory and could not get back in.“So after 10 seconds of silence, an emergency tape kicks in, which starts with Beat It by Michael Jackson, which is not very mellow,” she said. “And I was running up and down those stairs. It went through Abba’s Gimme! Gimme! Gimme! (A Man After Midnight) and all these really fast songs. And I was just thinking: ‘What am I gonna do?’ I can’t get through any door without a pass.” Eventually, after 20 long minutes, Parsons was able to borrow a pass from a cleaner and get back into the studio.On Mellow Magic you are sure to encounter a lot of saxophone, a lot of crooning, and, in the words of one fan on Twitter, “banger after banger”. On the night I visited, Parsons played Anything for You by Gloria Estefan \u0026amp Miami Sound Machine Crazy for You by Madonna Because of You by Kelly Clarkson and Missing You by John Waite.If one of the qualities that the station offers is companionship, then Mellow Magic provides it in its purest form. “What are you up to right now? Are you working? Are you playing? Are you just drifting off under the duvet? Whatever brings your ears our way, you’re very welcome here,” Parsons tells listeners. In between the music, the show is a gentle stream of names and very low-drama anecdotes. “We have Mark the courier … Mark the courier, great to hear from you!” Many songs get a dedication. “A little bit of Abba for Emily Curtis. Have a peaceful night and a good weekend won’t you?” Solace is offered to listeners still at work. “Super cold out there. Really super.”Parsons told me about night owls who tune in: “It’s cabs, but also paramedics, the AA, Green Flag, all the people that are in their vehicles waiting for call outs.” A typical bit of Parsons patter, from a recent show: “It’s Friday evening. So good to have your company. If you’re working for the emergency services tonight, thank you so much for all you do. We really appreciate you being there.”Parsons asks listeners to email her their “whispers and windows”. The former are a mellow version of shoutouts (“Dave in Rayleigh in Essex. You wanted a whisper out for Joanne, who you’ll be marrying soon. She’s the most beautiful girl you’ve ever seen, and I love these songs. Dave in Rayleigh in Essex, thank you.”), the latter are photographs from listeners. Parsons posts them on her own channels, and Magic will occasionally retweet. Social media is a big part of the show. Instagram, Twitter and Facebook are Magic’s “big three”, says Ian Bridgeman, who runs social media strategy for the station. Facebook is the most important, Twitter less and less so. “For our audience it’s still a bit impenetrable,” Bridgeman said. “It’s now quite an aggressive place to be it’s a very politically charged place to be.”Parsons constantly encourages listeners to get in touch. Occasionally, this has unintended consequences. Within a few weeks of Parsons starting at Magic, one obsessive listener began leaving threatening comments on Twitter and Facebook. The station contacted the police, who warned the stalker off. These days, following advice from her employers, Parsons responds to messages that seem a little bit too keen or intense with the sign-off “Strong Hug”. She explained: “They just wanted to make sure there was a real proper cut-off, after the stalker.” (Parsons made clear she had stalkers at other stations the phenomenon was not unique to Magic.)Still, for most listeners, Mellow Magic is a place of comfort and solace. Earlier this month, listeners tuning in at 8pm were greeted with a classic Parsons welcome. “I’m Lynn Parsons, here until midnight, with gorgeous laid-back songs. Whatever sort of day you’ve had, the evening is going to be so much better. That’s a promise.” Then she played Total Eclipse of the Heart by Bonnie Tyler, and for a little while at least, everything was so much better.• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, and sign up to the long read weekly email here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8243618c6586c20070e2acfdf53972709890dfbe/34_0_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3234382a203d2c3ad74f2120d22c76ab","title":"the good place was this the most devastating tv finale ever","story":"With so much to pack in, Mike Schur’s afterlife hit often felt like hard work for viewers. But its poignant ending proved this show could still be heavenly – and heartbreakingWarning: this article contains major spoilers for the final episode of The Good PlaceFittingly, Jason (Manny Jacinto) was the first to leave. He was, after all, the least complex of the four lost souls at the heart of The Good Place, so the ennui of eternity was bound to creep up on him relatively quickly. But it was still a shock when, after finally achieving his lifelong dream of playing the perfect game of Madden NFL, our boy decided it was time to check out. He did so after throwing a party at which he played particularly heinous EDM all night. “Great. Now I’m bummed about two things”, deadpanned Eleanor (Kristen Bell).The Good Place has always aimed high. Ambition was the greatest strength of the NetflixNBC hit – and occasionally its biggest flaw. Attempting to combine a convincing exploration of practical moral philosophy with sitcom wit and narrative drive was always likely to lead to the odd wheelspin. Much of season three felt like wading through treacle. Many viewers seduced by the early seasons of Mike Schur’s warm, inventive metaphysical comedy fell by the wayside. And yet the show’s saving grace was always knowing that an endpoint was in sight. It gave the stories weight and context, and made the journeys matter.This was the real wonder of the finale. Before our heroes arrived, the Good Place they were searching for was both perfect and wholly flawed, inhabited by bliss-zombies who were unable to do anything but stagger endlessly on forever. But former demon Michael (Ted Danson) and “Busty Alexa” Janet (D’Arcy Carden) had a solution. They devised a terminus through which sated inhabitants of heaven could pass into the great beyond at the moment of their choosing.This simple device was the key to one of the most poignant, perfectly constructed and occasionally heartbreaking hours of TV you’ll ever see. Jason’s departure was sad but also kind of okay. He was one of the least introspective characters in small-screen history and in love with Janet, an eternal being. But we all knew what was coming next. At the beginning of the series, Chidi (William Jackson Harper) had battled with hesitancy and Eleanor with selfishness. Somehow, Schur contrived a conclusion to their love story that was perfectly symmetrical, gut-wrenching and eventually, just utterly exquisite - a moment of pure clarity, as Chidi acted with absolute decisiveness and Eleanor tearfully understood the true meaning of the philosophy tomes she had absorbed. TM Scanlon’s What We Owe To Each Other is The Good Place’s key text. And this was Eleanor enacting its implications. After various extravagant attempts to make Chidi stay, she understood that she owed him the freedom to leave.This could easily have toppled over into gushy sentimentality. Yet somehow, it maintained a perfect balance. The fates of these characters mattered. But their journeys towards infinity were also undercut by the relentless comic beats of the show, and humour that was always sharp but never harsh. We met a super-evolved version of Janet’s virtual boyfriend Derek (“the nexus of Derek is without dimension”). We got a glimpse of Tahani’s (Jameela Jamil) magnificently eccentric celestial bucket list, which included everything from breaking longstanding cricketing records to “Fixing the Jesus Fresco that lady messed up”. And, after his apparent departure, we learned that Jason actually spent eons in the woods looking for a trinket he had made for Janet, and meditating. When Janet pointed out that he had effectively returned to his initial incarnation as a monk, he gazed at her uncomprehendingly – he had learned everything and nothing.It is rare that TV feels nourishing. But at the moment, surrounded by corruption, bad faith, antagonism and winter, it sometimes feels that we might be stuck in our own intractable Bad Place. But things change. The Good Place never forced a moral message but it carried one all the same. We can always do a little better. As Eleanor drained her last margarita and Michael began a new life as a (middle-aged) human, The Good Place felt definitively and satisfyingly complete. It ended with a tiny act of kindness, as Michael’s neighbour delivered a letter that had been left at the wrong address. Because The Good Place is wherever you find it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e0c701356be42cf37a596bcb920c71e75f44bda5/0_18_4986_2992/master/4986.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2ce56e7b68df27880fd77ff4eedd38ca","title":"iowa vote latest news democratic caucuses","story":"Hours after voting began there were no results as the state’s Democratic party said it was ‘simply a reporting issue’The Democratic presidential primary contest has got off to a disastrous start after results from the highly anticipated Iowa Democratic caucuses were dramatically delayed due to “inconsistencies” in the reporting of the data.The state’s Democratic party said it was performing “quality control” on the numbers “out of an abundance of caution”, after reports on Monday of problems with a phone app used to relay vote tallies.After more than a year of campaigning, ideological clashes, policy debates and tens of millions of dollars spent, the Iowa results offer the first chance to see what support each of the Democratic presidential candidates actually has among voters.But by 11pm local time, no results had been released. Caucus voting got under way across Iowa’s more than 1,600 precincts at 7pm local time, with voters declaring which Democratic presidential candidate they believe is best positioned to beat Donald Trump in November.“We found inconsistencies in the reporting of three sets of results,” said Mandy McClure, the Iowa Democratic party’s communications director.“This is simply a reporting issue. The app did not go down, and this is not a hack or an intrusion. The underlying data and paper trail is sound and will simply take time to further report the results.”The state party said it would release the results on Tuesday but did not give a time. It had earlier said it was carrying out “quality control checks, making sure the numbers are accurate”.On 3 February, the midwestern state of Iowa will kick off the long process of choosing the Democratic party’s presidential nominee, who will take on Donald Trump in the US election in November.\u0026nbspMost US states hold primary elections, in which voters go to a polling place, mail in their ballots or otherwise vote remotely. But a handful of states hold caucuses – complicated, hours-long meetings with multiple rounds of balloting until one candidate emerges as victor.Both Democratic and Republican caucuses will take place on 3 February. But because Trump doesn\u0027t face any serious Republican challengers, all eyes will be on the Democratic contest.\u0026nbspPut simply, Iowans aged 18 (at the time of the November 3 election) and over who are registered Democrats will gather in caucus sites (school gyms, churches, community halls) in their designated precinct, and vote with their feet by splitting into groups based on their preferred candidate.\u0026nbspOn the night, the candidate with the most SDEs is considered the winner.Eleven Democratic candidates are competing to be the candidate to take on Donald Trump. Recent polls have showed four of the 11 remaining candidates knotted together at the top – the Vermont senator Bernie Sanders, the former vice-president Joe Biden, the Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren and the former South Bend, Indiana, mayor Pete Buttigieg.Despite the lack of results, all candidates sought to claim a form of victory, before resuming their campaigns on Tuesday in New Hampshire, which will hold the next primary election next week.Sanders, who appeared to have a narrow lead heading into Iowa, predicted he would do “very, very well” once results were finally released.“I imagine, have a strong feeling, that at some point the results will be announced,” Sanders said. “The first state in the country in this has voted and today marks the beginning of the end for Donald Trump.”Standing above a forest of camera phones amid chants of “We love Joe”, Biden told his supporters: “Folks, well it looks like it’s going to be a long night, but I’m feeling good.”In a letter to the Iowa Democratic party obtained by the , lawyers for Biden’s campaign demanded “full explanations and relevant information regarding the methods of quality control you are employing, and an opportunity to respond, before any official results are released”.Warren told her supports that the results were too close to call and launched into a speech that sounded pre-written in anticipation of a strong performance. “Iowa, tonight, you showed that big dreams are still possible in America.”Speaking to his supporters, Buttigieg said: “So we don’t know all the results. But we do know, by the time it’s all said and done, Iowa you have shocked the nation. Because by all indications, we are going on to New Hampshire victorious.”The Buttigieg and Sanders campaigns released incomplete internal voting data that they said supported their claims of strong performances. The Biden camp responded by warning that no official data had been released, adding: “Our own model shows that Biden over performed in key districts … and we feel confident that this is a tight race with bunched up candidates.”Joe Rospars, a top strategist on the Warren campaign, said: “Any campaign saying they won or putting out incomplete numbers is contributing to the chaos and misinformation.”Meanwhile, the Trump campaign sought to paint Democrats as disorganised and chaotic, and suggested – without evidence – that the delays had raised doubts over the fairness of the voting process.“Democrats are stewing in a caucus mess of their own creation with the sloppiest train wreck in history,” said Brad Parscale, Trump 2020 campaign manager. “It would be natural for people to doubt the fairness of the process. And these are the people who want to run our entire healthcare system?”Trump himself followed this up on Tuesday with a tweet calling the shambles an “unmitigated disaster”. Republicans were also technically caucusing on Monday night, but with no serious competition for the nomination, Trump was quickly declared the winner.Hundreds of thousands of Iowans – many of them still undecided when they walked into their precinct – had gathered on Monday evening in gymnasiums, libraries and churches to participate in the caucuses, the first official nominating contest of the 2020 primary.But Democratic caucus officials reported struggling to report results using the phone app, and spending a long time waiting to deliver vote tallies via a backup phone hotline. In Howard county, which swung from Barack Obama to Trump in 2016, precinct officials said it was taking 20 minutes or more to get a call through to give results.In the run-up to the caucuses, there had been a growing sense that Sanders had taken the lead while the other frontrunners were locked into a battle for second. A highly anticipated Des Moines RegisterCNNMediacom poll that might have shed some clarity was canceled on Saturday night due to concerns with its methodology.Biden has pitched himself as a steady pair of hands and the strongest choice against Trump, a view polling suggests is shared by a large constituency of Democrats, particularly among African Americans, who play a critical role in later contests. But he faces competition for moderate voters from Buttigieg, 38, who has risen from relative anonymity.Warren, a former public school teacher and Harvard law professor, has pitched herself as an unabashed liberal with an arsenal of detailed policy proposals for “big structural change”. But in the last days of the Iowa race she has also sought to emphasize what her allies argue is her unique capacity to unite and excite Democrats from the party’s ideological factions, even as she confronts doubts that a woman can beat Trump.On 3 February, voters in the midwestern state of Iowa will kick off the long process that will eventually choose the Democratic party’s presidential nominee, who will take on Donald Trump in November\u0027s US election.The primaries and caucuses are a series of contests, in all 50 US states plus Washington DC and outlying territories, by which each party selects its presidential nominee.Iowa is extremely influential in US elections because, since 1972, it has voted first. After months of campaigning, this will be the first chance to see what support each of the presidential candidates actually have among voters.Winning Iowa matters because it can give candidates a huge boost in momentum and name recognition before the other states cast their votes. Underdogs can triumph, and frontrunners can fall. Since 2000, every Democratic winner of the Iowa caucuses has gone on to win the party’s nomination.Tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang had predicted that he would “shock” the country.The former New York mayor and billionaire Michael Bloomberg was not competing in Iowa, having spent more than $100m on a gamble that he would win big in later contests. Trump has fixated on Bloomberg and on Sunday their campaigns aired dueling TV ads during the Super Bowl.The Senate impeachment trial added an additional layer of uncertainty to the already unusual Iowa caucuses, pulling Sanders, Warren and Amy Klobuchar – and the long-shot Senator Michael Bennet – back to Washington in the final weeks. Republicans are poised to acquit Trump on Wednesday, leaving the fate of the presidency in the hands of the Democrats running to defeat him.“We better not screw this up,” Klobuchar, the senator from Minnesota who has staked her candidacy on a strong finish in Iowa, told supporters.Additional reporting: Joan E Greve, David Smith and Adam Gabbatt in Des Moines and Chris McGreal in Cresco"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d9837dbfffccbec1a47faf6bb7eebada79035cc6/0_198_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e9597f418c429fe31646e0305c994eab","title":"african students stranded in wuhan coronavirus","story":"More than 80,000 African students are in China, with 5,000 thought to be in WuhanThousands of African students in Wuhan, the centre of the coronavirus epidemic, face dwindling food supplies, limited information and lockdowns restricting them to their campuses or hostels.Two weeks after restrictions on movement were imposed, residents are running short of basic necessities, say students in the central Chinese city.It is a member of the coronavirus family that has never been encountered before.

Many complained about the lack of assistance received from their own embassies but refrained from criticising Chinese authorities.There are more than 80,000 African students in China, often attracted by generous government scholarships. About 5,000 are thought to be in Wuhan, where there are scores of further education establishments offering qualifications that are prized in Africa. More than 56 students from Malawi, mostly on scholarships, are among those trapped in Wuhan.Bright Chipao, the president of the Association of Malawians in the city, said the students were desperate. “There is panic among us as we don’t know how long we are going to survive. We are also increasingly running out of foodstuffs,” he said.Chipao said the students lacked masks, food and water. Prices had tripled in the city, he said.The students have asked the Malawian government to airlift them out of the city and return them home, citing the example of other countries in Africa. However Chinese authorities have asked local embassies to tell their citizens not to seek to return home to avoid further spread of the disease.Many educational establishments have imposed rigorous curbs on students, restricting them to their campuses or hostels. A statement from one colleges read: “Considering your safety, please stay inside your dormitory during this period … Most of the materials are in short supply. Please save resources, cherish your life.”Kondwani Chembezi, a Malawian student at Wuhan University of Technology, said he and his roommate had only 2 gallons (9 litres) of water and some food.He said: “Wuhan is becoming a death zone each passing day as the numbers of infected persons, as well as death toll, keep rising. There’s a great atmosphere of panic and despair as others have been repatriated to their nations, yet others remain here trying to survive this unpredictable period.A Kenyan postgraduate student who has been in Wuhan for five years said the biggest problems were a shortage of reliable information and of food.He said: “The worst part about it all is not knowing what is going on because all the information we are getting is from online sources or from friends from other universities … We have been forced to have one meal a day.Many students contacted by the  were reluctant to talk or be named, as they feared expulsion or other sanctions.A Ugandan doctor in Shanghai said she and her colleagues felt better on Monday after a “worrying weekend”.“We’re wearing our masks, washing our hands and avoiding crowded places,” she said. “But most importantly we’re trying to be positive and not live in constant fear and panic.”Additional reporting by April Zhu in Nairobi"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/282ad227196d8da03ebaaa9647a9cf9ba7203cd9/0_255_5760_3457/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=675e1e664c42141f72908749eaddac98","title":"its national preservation greece offers baby bonus to boost birthrate","story":"€180m-a-year scheme launched in response to projections of ageing and shrinking populationAs the new year dawned, Maria Pardalakis was in the throes of labour. The clock had barely struck midnight when she delivered a healthy boy in a clinic on Crete.With her son’s birth – the first in Greece this year – Pardalakis and her husband, Christos, became the first people eligible for a €2,000 (£1,700) government baby bonus. “It’s been a new year like no other, the best gift my wife could give me,” Christos enthused. “And, sure, the benefit will help – not just us, a lot of families.”“People might think this is an issue of national pride but it’s actually one of national preservation,” said Domna Michailidou, a former Cambridge University academic and the deputy minister of labour and social affairs, who has pushed for the bonus and other benefits for parents. “Given that high productivity rates are associated with young populations and not actively ageing ones, it’s also an economic growth priority. The picture becomes even more gloomy when compared with the difficult state of our pensions system.”Greece is far from alone in facing such demographics. Declining birthrates in Spain, Italy and Cyprus have spurred fears of Europe’s north-south economic ide deepening, but Greece is also living with the impact of its troubled last decade.Chandakas, a British-trained fertility expert, said that while visiting more than 30 islands at the height of the budget crisis, he and his team were shocked at the lack of pregnant women. Schools, similarly, were bereft of children. At some schools, parades took place with a single child.“In the case of Fourni, which has a population of 1,000 people, there were zero births in 2014 and 2015,” he recalled. “Now that we are offering medical services and have this safety network in place, we are convincing more to have children. Today there are 11 ongoing pregnancies on Fourni.”Michailidou, who at 34 is the cabinet’s youngest member, has championed opening more nurseries and creches. “We have to ensure that women re-enter the labour force,” she said. “I feel very strongly about this. We have seen how in countries like France it works.”Greece’s frontline role as an arrival point for Europe-bound migrants and refugees has raised hopes that newcomers from Africa, Asia and the Middle East will further help boost the population. “Greece has to accept that in the next 20 years it is going to be multicultural, like other European societies,” said Chandakas. “It’s going to have to adapt, our education system is going to have to change, it will be a challenge for the young as well as old.”Greece has the advantage of history on its side, according to George Prevelakis, a professor at the Sorbonne and Greece’s permanent representative at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development in Paris. “Greece has repeatedly renewed itself both demographically and economically through migrant waves that were not part of a state plan but the result of geopolitical developments,” he said.These included millions of refugees arriving from Turkey in a massive exchange of populations after Greece’s disastrous military campaign in Asia Minor in 1922, and an influx of 500,000 Albanians after the collapse of communism.“If the Greek government pursues an intelligent migration policy, the country can function as a demographic pump,” he said. “It can both receive and integrate immigrants while sending Greeks abroad who in turn can strengthen the global Greek presence through diaspora communities. The brain drain is not a loss. These people will never lose their sense of Greek identity. In an age of networks, they can act as a bridge between Greece and the outside world.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cac8e39a0141876ffe799a976082becbfff9c6e5/1514_927_1973_1184/master/1973.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e924c503cb68413c0b3337b8a0fa5c29","title":"wild and free five camping holidays in europe to help you reconnect with nature","story":"Get some winter cheer by planning your spring or summer camping getaway. From France to Belgium,  Dixe Wills discovers five ‘no-fly’ camping holidays in Europe, all accessible by ferry Aaah, camping. A chance to slow down, unwind and gently ease back on the throttle of daily life. So it makes no sense to bookend the experience with stressful airports and conscience-troubling flights. Thankfully, there are plenty of great campsites that are easily accessible by ferry, a far more relaxed way of travelling that can become an enjoyable part of your holiday …Mini Camping de Hooiberg, the NetherlandsThe Dutch are inveterate campers and so it’s no surprise that so many campsites in the Netherlands are run by people who really get the whole “life under canvas” vibe. Set on an idyllic organic dairy farm, Mini Camping de Hooiberg is one such site. It’s not just any old dairy farm, either, but an organic one that produces its own unpasteurised cheeses. They’re for sale in the farm shop along with locally made bread, and fruit and vegetables from nearby farms. Open all year, the tree-lined campsite, which has just 25 pitches, has its own cafe, and is situated in Brabantse Kempen, a region of forests, heathland and meadows criss-crossed with walking, cycling and mountain biking routes. And if your idea of camping heaven means not being woken at the crack of dawn by yelping children, then you’re in luck – this site is for grownups only.How to get thereP\u0026ampO Ferries operates daily overnight crossings from Hull to Rotterdam. Mini Camping de Hooiberg is a one-and-a-half hour drive from there.Camping Scheibeekhoeve, BelgiumBelgium isn’t a country that one automatically associates with camping, but this makes Camping Scheibeekhoeve an even more joyful find. Set on a farm, with the Scheibeek waterway running around it, the campsite offers some welcome peace, tranquility and fresh country air. There are excellent facilities for those with disabilities, while children can burn off some energy in the play barn or on pedal-powered go-karts. The campsite is situated in rural Sint-Rijkersstraat, half a mile from the small village of Alveringem. It’s also less than 15 miles from the coast, making it well placed for those who fancy a swim in the sea, or a visit to Dunkirk and Ostend, both within easy reach. On the doorstep, there are some excellent cycling routes through Alveringem and the neighbouring municipalities of Veurne, Diksmuide and Lo-Reninge.How to get thereP\u0026ampO Ferries operates daily overnight crossings from Hull to Zeebrugge. Camping Scheibeekhoeve is an hour’s drive from the port.Camping du Val-d’Oise, FranceSet among woodland where the deer roam free, Camping du Val-d’Oise has just 40 spacious camping pitches, so it’s never overcrowded. Bread is delivered straight from the ovens of a local bakery, and there are waymarked hiking trails through the Thiérarche countryside to the region’s rather magnificent fortified churches. Or you can follow in the paddle strokes of Robert Louis Stevenson by hiring a canoe and setting off down the often frisky waters of the Oise River.How to get thereP\u0026ampO Ferries operates up to 23 crossings a day from Dover to Calais. From here, Camping du Val-d’Oise is two and a half hours’ drive away.Etangs du Moulin, FranceA little farther afield, in the Aisne countryside, the Etangs du Moulin campsite is truly one of a kind, and perfect for those with children who are resistant to conventional camping. A soupçon of the wild west come to Picardy, the site resembles an old frontier town and offers accommodation in wagons, tipis, log cabins and gypsy caravans (but if you’d rather take your own tent, there’s plenty of space for that too). Twenty-first century comforts include a heated outdoor swimming pool and a Texan-style pub and restaurant, while just beyond the grounds there’s the 9,000-hectatre (22,000-acre) Saint-Gobain forest to explore, which is perfect for both hikers and casual walkers.How to get thereP\u0026ampO Ferries operates up to 23 crossings a day from Dover to Calais. From here, the campsite is less than three hours away by car.Maddybenny farm, Northern IrelandRun by the White family since the 1950s, Maddybenny farm makes an excellent rural base for a coastal adventure. The campsite, tucked behind trees beyond a 17th-century farmhouse, enjoys views down to Portrush, a seaside resort two miles away. There’s a playground for children and, if the weather doesn’t play ball, a games room too. Nearby attractions include the clifftop Mussenden Temple, with its vistas along Downhill Strand, while the pretty seaside town of Ballycastle comes complete with a sandy beach and a harbour. Boats leave there for Rathlin Island, a must for both nature lovers and fans of Robert the Bruce (he reputedly stumbled across his “try, try, try again” spider while in hiding there). The Roe Valley country park is a great place for rambling along the riverbank for a summer picnic or you can head to the ancient market town of Limavady, famous for the Londonderry Air, the tune to Danny Boy.How to get thereP\u0026ampO Ferries has the shortest, fastest and most frequent crossing between Cairnryan and Larne, with up to seven sailings a day and a journey time of two hours. Maddybenny farm is just over an hour’s drive from the port. Alternatively, take the train from Larne, then cycle or walk from the station at Dhu Varren (two miles) or Coleraine (four miles).Sail awayMemorable holidays start with P\u0026ampO Ferries.

Video: Kathleen Harris\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTeachers who are members of the TUI picket outside Greenhills College on Tuesday as part of a one-day strike over pay.  Photograph: Nick BradshawThe The next government is facing potentially more industrial unrest in schools as the Association of Secondary Teachers Ireland (ASTI) on Tuesday said it expected its members to resoundingly back industrial action in a forthcoming ballot.About 450 second level schools as well as institutes of technology and centres of further education were closed on Tuesday as a result of a one-day stoppage by members of the Teachers’ Union of Ireland (TUI) over lower pay arrangements for staff recruited since 2011.ASTI members are also to ballot for strike action on the same issue with a result due on March 20th, the union said on Tuesday.The TUI said it would “take stock” following the stoppage on Tuesday.However its general secretary John MacGabhann said that while it was not threatening more stoppages it could not say day for definite that there would not be further strikes as part of its campaign against a two-tier pay system in schools.He said 19,000 members of the TUI had gone on strike “out of exasperation, frustration and a deep sense of manifest injustice being experienced by a significant proportion of teachers”.“We took the action on Tuesday because for the past year we have been shown from door to door and behind none of them was anything that had been promised.”Mr MacGabhann said that the issue of pay equality had to be addressed and addressed very promptly.PromiseHe said the Minister for Education Joe McHugh had promised last year that the issue would be addressed without delay.“Unfortunately we have seen nothing but delay”, he said.Mr MacGabhann said teachers appointed in recent years had been disproportionately affected by cuts compared with other groups in the public service.He said the Government had “come after teachers twice” during the years of austerity. He said in 2011 new entrant teachers like other public servants had experienced a ten per cent salary cut.However said in 2012 the Government followed this up by abolishing allowances for new entrants.He said in total new entrant teachers had experienced a 27 per cent cut in pay overall and were disproportionately affected compared with other groups in the public service.The ASTI executive decided last month to ballot its members on industrial action over the two-tier pay system.If the union secures a mandate for industrial action, this is expected to take place as part of co-ordinated campaign with at least one other education union.ASTI has said it expected there would be “a resounding yes vote” from secondary teachers to industrial action in the forthcoming ballot.The union’s general secretary Kieran Christie said it would be asking members to give consent to take further industrial action over the two-tier pay system.“I would expect that it would be a resounding ’yes’ vote for the ballot,” Mr Christie said on Tuesday. He said the type of industrial action would be decided after the ballot and that “nothing would be ruled out”.ProtestASTI members protested outside the Department of Education on Tuesday, calling for an end to the two-tier pay system.“There’s a recruitment and retention crisis in schools, younger, new recruits are not joining teaching. They are looking for work elsewhere and going abroad,” Mr Christie said. He said the bulk of teacher shortages were currently in the STEM subjects and languages“But the list seems to be growing very quickly,” he added. “I would expect that in a couple of years every subject area will have a difficulty with shortages and schools will be advertising and there are no applicants for posts.”Deirdre Mac Donald, the president of the ASTI said the two-tier pay issue must be resolved “once and for all”.“Inequality of pay is unacceptable, it’s morally unacceptable, but also it is having severe repercussions for education and the evidence of this is the recruitment and retention problem that we have in teaching,” she said.“The fact is we have certain subject areas where it’s virtually impossible to get a teacher...we are losing quality, from people who would like to teach but obviously you have to have a decent workplace, decent work conditions and pay equality is just a basic.”Helen O’Reilly, a secondary school teacher at Oatlands College in Stillorgan, said she would consider moving abroad due to pay and conditions.“I started teaching in 2013 and unfortunately to this day I am still paid less than less than my colleagues who qualified before 2011,” she said.“The cost of living in south Dublin is astronomical, people can’t afford to move up to be close to the school where they work, they’ve to commute long distances...people are exhausted, they have to work second jobs to try and make up the shortfall to try and make up the lesser pay scale. It’s just really stressful.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4161294.1580816564!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"cork lagging behind on cycling infrastructure","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tWhile the perception in Cork is that things are better in Dublin, cyclists in the capital continue to cite issues with poor infrastructure, limited funding and regular hostility from motorists.    Photograph. Nick Bradshaw “Cork was really ahead of the game in terms of cycling infrastructure,” says Dr Dean Venables, chairman of the Cork Cycling Campaign, as he recalls the introduction of segregated counterflow cycle lanes in the city about five years ago. These “made a huge difference,” he says, “but since then there has been very little and the city council seem to be turning a blind end to continual and persistent abuse of cycle lanes.”Venables, a UCC-based atmospheric chemist, believes Cork now lags behind other Irish cities in terms of cycling infrastructure. There are not enough places to lock bicycles and he regards people parking vehicles in cycle lanes as a problem. This led to just 241 fines being issued in the first 10 months of last year, and Venables believes enforcement is an issue. “We contend that when a person parks in a cycle lane, not only is it a loss of revenue to the city, but it’s an act that endangers vulnerable road users,” he says. A recent survey conducted by the cycling group found that fewer than 5 per cent of cyclists believe cycling infrastructure in Cork is fit for purpose, with nearly 75 per cent of respondents citing safety concerns as the biggest obstacle to cycling on a regular basis.In spite of these issues, Venables is heartened by the rising number of cyclists in the city, and elsewhere, in recent years. Cycling featurs in election manifestos, but the campaign believes there has been a lack of serious political dialogue about it on the election campaign trail, as it is not perceived as a vote getter. Apolitical“We an are apolitical group. We want all political parties to engage with us on this,” Venables says. “But it hasn’t really been emphasised.”While the parties may not be saying a lot about cycling, Cork South Central Green Party candidate Cllr Lorna Bogue says constituents are exercised about the matter. Emails, calls and Twitter messages come in every day asking about related issues, she says. “It’s getting increasingly difficult to believe that this government really cares about cycling, or anywhere outside of Dublin,” she says. Bogue says a key part of combating the climate change crisis is getting people to cycle or use public transport instead of cars. “How can we expect people to make this change if they can’t be sure of getting to work on time, or if they feel like they’re taking their life in their hands by just cycling down the road?” she asks. While the perception in Cork is that things are better in Dublin, cyclists in the capital continue to cite issues with poor infrastructure, limited funding and regular hostility from motorists. The numbers cycling into Dublin city centre had been rising - from 5,000 people a day in 2006 to 12,447 in 2017 - but following more than a decade of year-on-year cycling increases, the figures took a dip in 2018, down to 12,227. While this is more a plateau than a plummet, and with the figures for last year not yet available, it is still a cause for concern for Dublin City Council, which wants to double the numbers cycling by 2030.Just 1 to 2 per cent of the Department of Transport’s capital spend goes on cycling, and cycling advocates say this needs to increase to 10 per cent - a level pledged by some political parties in their manifestos. Safe and segregatedThe Dublin Commuter Coalition has published its own manifesto, which puts the development of the Liffey Cycle route, planned since 2011, at its centre. The group also advocates for sustainable transport nationally and insists all new road projects “must include the provision for safe, segregated and continuous walking and cycling infrastructure”.Green Party cycling spokesman Patrick Costello, who is seeking election in Dublin South Central, says cycling has to be made an attractive option for people of any age or ability. “Dublin is flat city, we are drier than the Netherlands, warmer than Denmark, there is no reason that we don’t have similar number of cyclists except for the lack of decent infrastructure.”While greenways have been very successful in rural areas, particularly Mayo and Waterford, Costello says rural towns need cycling infrastructure too.“Improving and providing links from town and villages to near by greenways can help both improving existing infrastructure as well as creating new infrastructure.”One prominent cycling advocate recently promised his vote to “anyone who can stop people using the Rathgar Road cycle lane as a left turn filter” .A fellow campaigner responded that it would only take one bollard to force motorists take that turn legally. One bollard, one vote, sounds like a fair enough deal."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"TUI says it cannot rule out more strikes over two-tier pay disputeDoctors believe man lacks capacity to manage his person and finances and should not be allowed marryMcDonald borrows a phrase from Boris while Super Bowl fails to excite TD\u0026rsquos brotherSF will \u0026lsquopay a price\u0026rsquo if they go into government with FF or FG, Paul Murphy saysCoveney accuses both parties of populist policies \u0026lsquowith disregard for future consequence\u0026rsquoFine Gael hoping to hold two seats with Regina Doherty and Helen McEnteeAccused deleted message after she realised it was \u0026lsquosinister\u0026rsquo but video remained on phoneOrder for costs made against 35-year-old who took \u0026euro60,000 damages case against MIBIMove follows consumer complaints over how search giant Google processes location dataInquiry heard Co Cork primary teacher had thousands of images and videos of abuseCycling advocate says only Greens, Labour and Social Democrats \u0026lsquoplaying senior hurling\u0026rsquoINMO says figure is highest since record overcrowding in early JanuryTwo-tier pay system \u0026lsquodiscriminatory\u0026rsquo, Teachers\u0026rsquo Union of Ireland saysStephen Teap urges overhaul of register after reports of similar incidents on social mediaRise in hate speech towards LGBTI people a \u0026lsquopan-European problem\u0026rsquo, says report\u0026lsquoSerious concern\u0026rsquo new Tusla guidelines overly weighted in favour of accusedChild protection experts say new procedures could retraumatise victimsSave Our Hedgerows campaigners are demanding that all work ceases"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4161286.1580817508!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"data commissioner starts investigations into google and tinder","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe Data Protection Commissioner  says it has  received ‘a number of complaints’ from  consumer organisations across the EU regarding how Google  processes  data. Photograph: Getty Ireland’s Data Protection Commissioner (DPC) has opened investigations into search giant Google and Tinder, the matchmaking app.Both investigations relate to how the companies’ process and retain different types of data held on their users.In a statement the DPC said it was starting the investigation into Google after it became concerned about issues relating to how the company processes location-based data and the transparency measures it employs on the data.The DPC said it had received “a number of complaints” from various consumer organisations across the EU regarding how the search company treats the data.“The issues raised within the concerns relate to the legality of Google’s processing of location data and the transparency surrounding that processing,” the DPC said.Regarding Tinder, the DPC said it launched the inquiry into MTCH Technology Services, the corporate name for Tinder, after “a number of issues” were identified by iniduals in Ireland and across the EU.“The identified issues pertain to… ongoing processing of users’ personal data with regard to its processing activities in relation to the Tinder platform, the transparency surrounding the ongoing processing and the company’s compliance with its obligations with regard to data subject right’s requests”.A subject request is when an inidual consumer asks a company to release the data held on them.The inquiries will also examine whether either company has a legal basis for processing its users’ personal data.Both investigations have been started by the DPC under its “own volition” powers, rather than in response to specific complaints, although complaints have been received on both counts.Under strict European data protection laws, Ireland’s DPC is the lead regulator for both companies as they have their main legal European establishment here and decision making for data processing takes place here.The DPC plays this role for many of the largest tech companies in the world.The DPC has been subject to criticism recently from other data protection bodies. Germany’s federal data commissioner last week suggested the DPC was overwhelmed and “insufficiently equipped for its task”.Helen Dixon, the Data Protection Commissioner, said last year she was disappointed that her office had received just €1.6 million extra in budget allocation, one third of what she had sought."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4144411.1580825996!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"election 2020 dublin west constituency profile","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDublin West is home to Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and a former tánaiste in Joan Burton, both of whom are running again.  File photograph: Tom HonanFine Gael has never really threatened to add a second seat in the constituency in addition to the one held by the Taoiseach since his election in 2007, despite throwing considerable resources – and former Olympic athlete Eamonn Coghlan – at the constituency over the years. The biggest impediment to Cllr Emer Currie, Varadkar’s running mate, bucking this trend is obviously the presence of Burton and another politician with national profile, Solidarity’s Ruth Coppinger, in the remaining seats. Also blocking her way, and presenting a clear and present danger to both Coppinger and Burton, will be Green Party candidate Cllr Roderic O’Gorman, who has been running in elections in the constituency since 2004.O’Gorman has outperformed his party’s national performance in the last two general elections but has never really been in the shake-up for a seat come polling day. If he can successfully court the wealthier, centre-left vote that has traditionally coalesced around Burton, he is in with a strong shout. However, Burton will not be easy to turn over, despite the lack of momentum around the Labour brand.Polling numbers\u0026nbspThe last seat was seen as a tussle between former Burton and Coppinger. However, if Sinn Féin’s polling numbers are borne out on Saturday, it is hard to see how the party’s candidate, Paul Donnelly, will not come into the equation. Burton, then Labour leader, benefitted from a major resource push by the party in the closing days of 2016’s campaign when it seemed her seat was in danger. The electorate also seemed to respond to a threat to their sitting minister. The party has no such resources to dedicate to her now, and of course she is no longer a minister.If Coppinger can stay ahead of her, and O’Gorman attracts Labour-friendly centre-left first preferences, Burton is the most likely candidate to be squeezed out by a strong showing from Donnelly. A wild card here is Peter Casey, who may siphon off some anti-Government votes from both Coppinger and Donnelly, but he is unlikely to make a meaningful difference in the final reckoning.On a local level, candidates will have to handle the thorny issue of BusConnects, balancing the utility offered by an improved bus network against the perceived impact on local and residential amenities. Co-living will be another rallying point, with permission just given for a significant development in Castleknock, as will the construction of schools and other facilities for growing families in the area.Other declared candidates include Aengus Ó Maoláin (Social Democrats) and Edward McManus (Aontú).Prediction: Varadkar (FG), Chambers (FF), O’Gorman (GP), one from Burton (Lab), Coppinger (S-PBP) and Donnelly (SF)The best news and analysis from the campaign trail"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4161256.1580815457!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"election 2020 fact check how is the clampdown on airbnb style lettings working","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe Minister for Housing published new rules on short-term lettings at the end of 2018, which came into force last July. Photograph: Cyril ByrneHave resources been made available to enforce new laws on AirBnB-style lettings?Who is making the claim?“We will back up local authorities with specific staff for enforcing new rules. In addition, a standardised approach to enforcement will be rolled out nationally and unit ownership identification strengthened”.The party also promised to allocate €10 million to fund some 200 staff to “tackle the problem across Ireland”.Upon what is Fianna Fáil basing its claim?Asked for evidence to substantiate its claim, Fianna Fáil pointed to two sources.The first is a reply to a parliamentary question put down by Darragh O’Brien, the party’s housing spokesman, to Minister for Housing Eoghan Murphy. Mr Murphy responded to the question by saying that his department planned to allow local authorities to hire new staff from funding to be provided in 2020, and that the Department would try to recoup the cost of additional staff hired in 2019.Fianna Fáil also referred to a Freedom of Information request. It didn’t share the full FoI response, but did send a press release based on it from November last year. The press release claimed no additional staff were in place in 17 of 18 local authorities which contain rent pressure zones.The disruptive effect of short-term lettings (STL), led by websites such as AirBnB, on the housing market has been a contentious political topic for several years. Strong incomes from such lettings have led many property owners to place houses and apartments on such platforms, rather than being made available for long-term rent. Critics say this has exacerbated the housing crisis and made the shortage of rental properties more acute.To counter this, the Minister for Housing published new rules on short term lettings at the end of 2018, which came into force last July. Under the new rules, owners of properties in rent pressure zones have to get planning permission to use them for more than three months a year.Fianna Fáil’s claim is that no “actual resources” have been made available to monitor enforcement. The  contacted the Department of Housing as well as local authorities in Irish cities (where most RPZs are) to ask what resources had been made available.In the capital, Fingal County Council has received approval for €518,800 for 2020 and 2021 to assist with short term letting provisions in the county Dublin City Council has filled nine of 12 positions that have been approved by the Department of Housing for enforcement and monitoring South Dublin County Council confirmed that it requested and received resources for management of short-term letting, but did not elaborate Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown received funding of €185,170 for 2020 and 2021 and is putting resources in place to regulate STLs.Galway City Council has been allocated over €500,000 for 2020 and 2021, including staffing. Cork City Council requested funding for three additional staff to enforce the new rules for 2020 and 2021, which was approved. Waterford City Council is recruiting three members of staff. Limerick City and County Council said it had received funding for additional staff of 1½ “whole-time equivalents”.The Department of Housing confirmed it had received €2.5 million to fund enforcement of the new rules, and said all local authorities where RPZs are located (excepting Sligo, where RPZ designation only occurred in December) have received their funding allocations. In total, it said local authorities have estimated that over 60 additional staff will be required.While it might be a legitimate argument that the resources are not sufficient, or that better practice should be developed for enforcement, as the party does, it is clearly not correct to say no “actual resource” has been made available for enforcement.Therefore we find that the Fianna Fáil claim is untrue.The best news and analysis from the campaign trail"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4161381.1580823549!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"election 2020 left wing tds say sf should rule out coalition with ff or fg","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t3(L to R) Paul Murphy,Brid Smith, and Conor Reddy during a press brieifng were People Before Profit called on Sinn Féin to categorically rule out coalition with Fianna Fail or Fine Gael following general election 2020. Photograph: Gareth ChaneyCollinsPaul Murphy, hoping to be re-elected as a Rise TD in Dublin South West, said the Sinn Féin surge is being driven by those who want a change from Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael-led governments.Mr Murphy also predicted a strong turnout in working class areas on polling day on Saturday because voters want change.He said the turnout in “working class areas in South Dublin County Council, in west Tallaght” was 25 per cent at the local elections last year.“The turnout will be at least doubled,” Mr Murphy added in a prediction of this Saturday’s turnout. “The mood is for change.”However, he issued a warning to Ms McDonald that her vote, if it is in line with recent strong poll showings, is “a vote for a government without Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael”. “The voters are clear they don’t want Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael in government.”“What is very clear is that those voting for Sinn Féin want to get rid of Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael and that is a very strong motivation, combined with breaking inequality and the housing crisis.“If Sinn Féin end up using those votes to go into coalition with Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael, their voters will be very disappointed. Because they are effectively in government together and have been in power for the last 100 years.Mr Murphy pointed to the findings of the Ipsos MRBI opinion poll, when respondents were asked what their preferred coalition option would be. The various permutations featured either Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael but the biggest percentage – 23 per cent - chose “none of theseother”.“The biggest percentage of all said none of the above,” Mr Murphy said. “People want neither.“If Mary Lou came out and said I am not going into government with Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael that would still make a difference.”Solidarity’s Mick Barry, hoping to hold his seat in Cork North West, made similar arguments.“The rise of Sinn Féin reflects a strong desire for change and for an end to the Fine Gael-Fianna Fáil duopoly,” he said. “This desire is particularly strong in working class areas. Solidarity-People Before Profit will in no circumstances do any coalition deal with either Fine Gael or Fianna Fáil. I think Sinn Féin should follow our example and rule it out too.”Sources on the left, however, say they may benefit from the Sinn Féin surge if Ms McDonald’s candidates post significant surpluses and then transfer to the left in later counts."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4161389.1580824246!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"election 2020 outtakes rent freeze remains a hot topic","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tFianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin and candidate James Collins speak to the media while on a general election canvass at Crescent Shopping Centre in Limerick City.  Photograph: Niall CarsonPA WireRent freeze a hot topicAt least one campaign issue has managed to bring the debate temperature down, in a manner of speaking.When it comes to the mystery surrounding the legality of rent freezes, there appears to be as much consensus as there is on the broader issue of how best to address Ireland’s overall housing crisis.It could leave the greatest legal minds cold. Outlining her party’s housing policy on Monday, Sinn Féin president Mary Lou McDonald was unequivocal, saying such a move would be constitutional on a “time-limited” basis. “I have heard others argue a different case I think they’re wrong,” she said. “It’s entirely doable.”Cold comfort, though, for anyone already caught in the rental market trap.Meanwhile, Varadkar was cunningly distracting from the issue by warning that future governments may have to “freeze pensions”.Super snooze at Super BowlIf the general election doesn’t put you to sleep, the Super Bowl will. Well, judging by this picture doing the rounds on social media, that might be the view of Declan Kelly, brother of Labour TD Alan Kelly.An ardent sports fan, the chief executive of consulting company Teneo was filmed by an American football fan at what is arguably the biggest and most sought-after game on the US calendar.It was been dubbed “the world’s most expensive nap” by New York Times writer Amy Chozick.“Somehow this man is sleeping through the #SuperBowl,” another Twitter post attached to the footage said with naked disbelief. “We’re still only in the first quarter.”5,000 – The number of birch tree saplings being handed out by Mayo Labour candidate Kamal Uddin in place of campaign leafletsSinn Féin learns from BorisAs Sinn Féin’s stock rises in the polls, it is especially strange to see them follow the campaigning lead of Boris Johnson and hardline Tories.In what appeared to be a considered move, party leader Mary Lou McDonald accused Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael of adopting a “project fear” approach to the general election, evoking a very effective turn-of-phrase widely used during the UK’s bitterly fought referendum on EU membership.“I believe that project fear from the two big parties is now well and truly under way,” McDonald wasted no time in saying on Monday when asked her views on anticipated attacks from the two largest parties.By contrast, she said, Sinn Féin would set out its economic policies “calmly”.Boris would be proud. Although the phrase also popped up in the Scottish independence vote, the British prime minster gave it a new lease of life in the Brexit build-up as a cutting phrase used to turn public opinion on remainers and their prophecies of economic doom in the event of an EU departure.“This is all part of the attempt to spook people. I think actually it will be very calm,” he said at the time, in a comment not a million miles from McDonald’s.A rhetorical, if not political, match made in heaven.The best news and analysis from the campaign trail"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4160556.1580755382!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"election 2020 parties prepare for final leaders debate","story":"\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tA mood for change has clearly gripped the electorate and Sinn Fein is the main beneficiary.

And what exactly are they promising?  File photograph: Nick BradshawThe . Cycling is being embraced by most political parties as a means to lessen the problems of urban congestion and transport-based carbon emissions. It’s also a way of improving people’s health, an increasingly popular pursuit and a relatively inexpensive thing to make promises on. The numbers saddling up to get to work increased by 43 per cent between the 2011 and 2016 censuses from 39,803 to 56,837. However, this represents just 3 per cent of all commuter journeys, is less than half the proportion recorded in 1986 (6.8 per cent) and is well short of a 10 per cent target set under the Irish National Cycle Policy Framework published in 2009. Poor infrastructure, low funding and a perception that it is a dangerous way to travel are seen as major impediments to raising the numbers further. Ahead of the general election, what exactly are the parties promising to do to change this? And what do cycling advocates make of their pledges? It has promised to give cyclists priority at lights and to improve access to the bike to work scheme by reducing time limits for availing of the scheme between purchases from the current five years . Fianna Fáil also wants to establish a bicycle register to tackle bike theft. Fine Gael: Fine Gael says the configuration of streets in urban areas is a major impediment to the building of cycling infrastructure. The party promises that, if returned to office, it will develop cycle network plans for Dublin, Cork, Galway, Limerick and Waterford. It says it would publish a five-year plan to more than double the numbers cycling to work on a daily basis from the current 57,000 to at least 120,000. An initial €6 million a year from the proceeds of the carbon tax would be made available to fund improved cycling infrastructure and initiatives based on local need. As part of this, Fine Gael would ensure that all children in primary school are offered cycling training.Sinn Féin: The Sinn Féin manifesto is light on detail when it comes to cycling. It promises to improve cycling infrastructure (all the parties do) and implement the Greater Dublin Area Cycle Network Plan and the Athlone to Galway Euro Velo network. Labour: The party pledges to dedicate 10 per cent of the national transport budget to the development of cycling infrastructure, to expand the public bike schemes to large towns and to give local authorities funds for maintaining bikes. It says it would prioritise the creation of a network of off-road “cycling highways”, incentivise the purchase of bicycles by school children and regulate the use of electric-scooters to “ensure safe usage for all road users”.Green Party: The Green Party puts huge emphasis on cycling in its manifesto. The main promise is to assign 10 per cent of the capital transport budget (€167 million a year at present) to cycling, and to make every local authority draw-up a cycling policy. It wants to introduce a programme of bicycle maintenance and safe cycling education in schools to improve behaviour and safety on the State’s roads. The manifesto says cyclists should be allowed to make a left turn when traffic lights are red, people to be allowed bring bicycles on all trains and that electric bicycles should be incentivised. Social Democrats: The Social Democrats also put a heavy emphasis on cycling in its manifesto. The party commits to cycleways and greenways such as from Baldoyle to Portmarnock in Dublin, a Naas Greenway and other projects including the Galway Cycle Bus and the Liffey Cycle Path. It also wants 10 per cent of the capital transport budget to be allocated to cycling initiatives. Solidarity-People Before Profit: People Before Profit proposes a one-off investment of €165 million to create major cycling lanes across the country. There are no details in the manifesto as to how this money would be spent. The verdict: The Irish Cycling Advocacy Network is calling for political parties to allocate 10 per cent of the transport capital budget to cycling, and a further 10 per cent for walking, to put Ireland in line with a UN environmental target. This would amount to about €147 million this year. “We can’t build safer infrastructure without it, ” said the network’s spokeswoman Martina Callanan. “The Greens and Social Democrats have promised this. Labour is on the senior hurling pitch too. It offers 10 per cent for cycling and walking in the next government, and will increase to 20 per cent,” she says. “Fianna Fáil is really disappointing - only an extra €50 million for ‘urban cycling’. They seem to have cast aside their 2018 cycling policy, Keeping Cyclists Safe. “Fine Gael’s manifesto continues with their programme for government. They’ve offered a very attractive sounding ring-fenced 10 per cent of carbon tax to cycling and walking and a headline figure of €600 million - but looking at the finer detail reveals that’s only €60 million per year, far short of even half of what we want.” Callanan says Solidarity-People Before Profit’s promises are limited beyond the once-off €165 million pledge for infrastructure and that Sinn Féin does not give a funding commitment.The best news and analysis from the campaign trail"},{"url":null,"title":"sinn f%C3%A9in leads way in irish times ipsos mrbi poll with highest support ever","story":"Sinn Féin has surged into first place in the general election race, with a quarter of all likely voters now saying they intend to vote for the party, according to the final Ipsos MRBI opinion poll of the campaign.The poll puts Fine Gael back in third place at 20 per cent, behind Fianna Fáil on 23 per cent and Sinn Féin on 25 per cent.The findings of the poll, which was taken on Thursday, Friday and Saturday of last week, will shock the Government party and suggest that Ireland is on the brink of an historic general election result on Saturday.In addition, Sinn Féin is limited by running\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspby running just 42 candidates in 38 constituencies\u0026nbspand is unlikely – even on these figures – to be the largest party in the next Dáil.MomentumBut the findings will add further momentum to Sinn Féin’s campaign ahead of tomorrow’s final televised leaders’ debate, to which RTÉ today invited party leader Mary Lou McDonald in a u-turn prompted by the party’s unprecedented run in the opinion polls.The state of the parties, when undecided voters and those unlikely to vote are excluded, is as follows: Sinn Féin 25 per cent (up four), Fianna Fáil 23 per cent (down two), Fine Gael 20 per cent (down three), Greens 8 per cent (no change), Labour 4 per cent (down one) and Independents and small parties 20 per cent (up two). The comparison is with the most recent Ipsos MRBI poll at the beginning of the election campaign in mid-January.Among the Independents and smaller parties, the breakdown shows a number of groups all within the margin of error of each other.Solidarity-People Before Profit is at 2 per cent (no change), the Social Democrats is at 2 per cent (no change), Independents4Change is at 1 per cent (no change), the Independent Alliance is at less than 1 per cent (no change), Aontú is at 1 per cent, non-party Independents are on 10 per cent (no change) and other groups and parties are on 3 per cent (no change).The survey was conducted face to face among 1,200 adults at 120 locations in every constituency. The accuracy level is estimated at plus or minus 2.8 per cent.Satisfaction slumpSatisfaction with the Government has slumped again, from 27 per cent at the beginning of the campaign to 21 per cent today. Approval for both Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and the Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin has also fallen, with Mr Martin’s rating falling by three points to 30 per cent and Mr Varadkar’s by five points to 30 per cent.Mr Martin remains narrowly the favourite choice to be the next taoiseach at 24 per cent, with Mr Varadkar at 23 per cent and Ms McDonald at 20 per cent.Mr Martin enjoys a more significant advantage, however, when it comes to the choice of taoiseach. A coalition of Fianna Fáil, the Green Party and Labour is narrowly favoured as the most popular option for government, with 17 per cent of voters saying they would like to see it forming the next government.This is ahead of Fianna Fáil and Sinn Féin (15 per cent), Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael (14 per cent), Fine Gael, Labour and the Greens (14 per cent) and a Fine Gael-Sinn Féin combination, favoured by just 7 per cent of voters.Taken together, these figures show that 46 per cent of voters favour a coalition involving Fianna Fáil – ahead of Fine Gael on 35 per cent and Sinn Féin on 22 per cent, among the options offered.The best news and analysis from the campaign trail"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons february 2020","story":"Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2019 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514.  ​To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to https:telegraph.newsprints or call 0191 603 0178.Iowa Caucus 2020: Democratic Party ridiculed over delay in declaring winner, citing \u0026#39inconsistencies\u0026#39 in resultsPolitics latest news: Britain has a \u0026#39responsibility\u0026#39 to lead the charge on climate change, Boris Johnson saysChristians urged to plant trees and twin toilets in Church of England\u0026#39s first official green Lent campaignBrian Wilson in row with other Beach Boys over performance at trophy hunting convention Wuhan football team in Spain sees matches cancelled over coronavirus fearsDuke and Duchess of Cambridge arrive in blustery South Wales for series of engagementsComment: Frictionless trade with the EU is there for the asking Foreign Office urges British nationals to leave China as coronavirus spreadsIslanders on Lesbos demand Greek government tackles growing refugee crisis Inside the Wuhan hospital built in 10 days to treat coronavirus patientsVirus hunters: A race against time to stop the next pandemicBreast cancer scandal: \u0026#39dysfunctional\u0026#39 system allowed rogue surgeon to perform hundreds of needless operations Coronavirus: a quick guide to the outbreak sweeping the world Sinn Fein surges into first place in Irish election pollRussia mulls over ban on priests blessing weapons of mass destructionPrimary school teacher hurt in Streatham terror attack is \u0026#39devoted to her pupils\u0026#39 say shocked parentsManchester Arena bomber\u0026#39s brother Hashem Abedi \u0026#39just as guilty\u0026#39 for murder of 22 people, court hearsComment: It\u0026#39s far from clear how close and special the UK and EU\u0026#39s relationship will be post-BrexitDangerous terrorists should be detained rather than released from jail, says ex-police chiefComment: What this Iowa Caucus farce tells us about the impending 2020 presidential electionWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"saudi has become north korea mbs says satirist suing kingdom","story":"It was an offer Ghanem al-Masarir should not have had to consider for long before accepting.A weekly column with the Washington Post would be great exposure for the Saudi Arabian comedian and satirist, who had made a name for himself in the Arab world but was struggling to break through to Western audiences.Yet it was exposure he has been avoiding since the last man in the job was murdered 16 months ago by agents of the Saudi government.“There is a lot to think about. Of course I want the platform, but I risk becoming a second Jamal,” Mr Masarir told the , referring to Jamal Khashoggi, the late Saudi journalist and dissident who was killed in his country’s consulate in Istanbul in October 2018.Mr Masariri, 39, became famous for his YouTube channel “The Ghanem Show”, which he hosts from exile in the UK. The show, which criticised the Saudi royal family, earned him a legion of fans but also one powerful enemy - Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.As the channel’s popularity increased - at one point his videos were receiving tens of millions of views - so did the harassment.The offer of a column came the same week as reports that Jeff Bezos, the owner of the Washington Post and the world’s richest person, had seen his Twitter and other social media accounts allegedly hacked by the crown prince or MBS, himself.One of few not surprised by the news was Mr Masarir, whose own phone is suspected to have been infiltrated by Saudi hackers he is now suing. “What was interesting is that we seem to have all been hacked in the same period of time - mid-late 2018,” said Mr Masarir. “Me, Jeff Bezos, Jamal, Omar (Abdulaziz, a Saudi activist in Canada), and that’s just the people we know about. “Something was going on with Saudi at this time, a paranoia,” he told the  via end-to-end encrypted messaging service Signal - the app of choice for the privacy-conscious as it is virtually impenetrable.He first suspected something was wrong when his iPhone’s iOS software was not updating, so he sent it off for analysis at Citizen Lab, the cybersecurity organisation at the University of Toronto.Experts assessed the phones of both Mr Masarir and Mr Abdulaziz and found spyware infections with identical elements — both were surreptitiously installed through a fake DHL package delivery link — and led to the same Saudi-controlled server.“Absolutely nobody in Saudi would do such a thing without the approval of MBS,” said Mr Masarir, suggesting he believed the hacks had been ordered at the very top.“I’m not Bezos, they didn’t blackmail me. I don’t have anything interesting enough,” he jokes. “What they want is to know everything about you: who you are contacting, what you are doing and saying. It gives them complete access to your private life in.”Mr Masarir, who has been living under police protection in north London since Mr Khashoggi’s assassination, last month filed a lawsuit against the Saudi government at the High Court in London, in an extremely rare case against the ultra-conservative kingdom.He wants an apology and unspecified damages. Saudi has three months to respond to his lawyers before they take the next step.There are few legal precedents and should the case reach court it will shine an uncomfortable spotlight on Riyadh’s alleged campaign of harassment of its critics. Not only that, it could broaden the scope of liability for cyber attacks.“He (MBS) has been running a campaign to silence critics and he has been successful,” Mr Masarir said. “For years it has seemed like the regime could not be touched by the legal system but finally I have the opportunity to hold them to account.Despite the reforms taking place under MBS, including women’s right to drive, the loosening of male ship restrictions and the opening up to tourism, he claims the kingdom has never been more repressive.“I speak to people inside Saudi and they tell me ‘we are like North Korea,’” he said. “The only difference is we have money and a good relationship with America and the West.”Mr Masarir, who has long been vocal of his government, arrived in the UK in 2003 to take up a place on the University of Portsmouth\u0027s computer science course. When his student visa ran out he applied for political asylum in 2012, though it would not be granted until 2018: a delay, he claims, that was down to Saudi pressure on the British government.He has taken a break from filming The Ghanem Show but still worries about his safety in the UK, pointing to his host country’s close relationship with the kingdom.The two are important trade partners. The British government even licensed the sale of £600 million worth of military equipment to Saudi six months after the murder of Mr Khashoggi. The hacking attempts on Mr Masarir have not stopped either. Just minutes before our interview he received prompts from Google to change his email passwords, suggesting someone was trying to access his accounts.He also continues to be targeted by an army of pro-Saudi government “bots” on Twitter, which send him hundreds of messages a day intended to intimidate him.But Mr Masarir is determined to not let them succeed, publishing his first op-ed in the Washington Post last week. “(At first) I kept my opposition to the Saudi regime quiet, but as time passed I felt the need to speak up for those who still suffered,” he told the Post’s readers.“It felt good to speak out,” he said of the column this week, “and I’ve missed writing, but I don’t know yet whether it can be a regular gig.”More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"bernie sanders pete buttigieg claim victory first democrat primary","story":"The Democratic race for the presidential nomination was left in turmoil as results at the first vote in Iowa were indefinitely delayed.Issues with a mobile phone app and “inconsistencies” in reporting were blamed for the disaster on a frustrating night for the party. But despite the absence of official results, leading candidates seized the moment to declare victory.Pete Buttigieg, the 38-year-old former mayor from Indiana and wild card of the campaign, announced to his supporters that he was victorious.Bernie Sanders, the socialist Democratic senator who was favourite to win, then released internal data suggesting he was in the lead.Mr Sanders\u0027 campaign said it had results from 40 per cent of caucus sites, and had a clear lead.Candidates said they were receiving detailed reports of early results from their precinct captains. At Mr Buttigieg\u0027s results party one of his precinct captains told The : We absolutely crushed it.Of the four main candidates, Mr Buttigieg waited until last to speak publicly, suggesting he felt he had won, and delivered what appeared to be a victory speech.Smiling broadly he said: We don\u0027t know all the results... but we know, by the time it’s all said and done, Iowa you have shocked the nation.Because, by all indications, we are going on to New Hampshire victorious. I say with a heart full of gratitude, you have proved the sceptics wrong. Tonight, an improbable hope became an undeniable reality.His words were greeted with deafening chants of President Pete from hundreds of supporters in yellow and blue t-shirts packed into a hall at Drake University in Des Moines. Mr Buttigieg later re-iterated that he had been victorious on Twitter.However, Mr Sanders also appeared happy with how he had done.He told supporters: Let me begin by saying that I imagine, I have a strong feeling, that at some point the results will be announced.And when those results are announced I have a good feeling we\u0027re going to be doing very, very well here in Iowa.And the message that Iowa has sent to the nation, the message shared by the American people, is that we want a government that represents all of us not just wealthy campaign contributors and the one per cent.The data his campaign released showed him with 28.62 per cent compared to Mr Buttigieg’s 25.71 per cent at the first 40 per cent of caucus sites declaring.Jeff Weaver, Mr Sanders’ adviser, said: “We recognise that this does not replace the full data from the Iowa Democratic Party but we firmly believe our supporters worked too hard for too long to have the results of that work delayed.”Joe Biden, who was the first of the main candidates to address his supporters, said: Well, it looks like it\u0027s going to be a long night but I\u0027m feeling good.The former US vice president and long-time front-runner, had appeared to be underperforming in some precincts, though it was hard to get a statewide picture. His campaign issued a letter ahead of any other team criticising the considerable flaws in the results logging system, saying both the app and back-up phone line for reporting failed. None of the candidates admitted defeat and instead pledged to move on to New Hampshire, the state which votes next Tuesday.Elizabeth Warren, the US senator, told her supporters the race was too close to call.She added: Tonight as a party, we are one step closer to defeating the most corrupt president in American history. Amy Klobuchar, the US senator who has been in fifth place in polls, said her campaign had punched above our weight and she was staying in the race.She told supporters: “Even in a crowded field of candidates, even during the well-earned impeachment hearing of Donald J Trump, which had me bolted to my senate desk for the last two weeks, we kept fighting and you kept fighting for me.Somehow, some way, I’m going to get on a plane tonight to New Hampshire, and we are bringing this to New Hampshire.Donald Trump’s sons and his presidential campaign jumped on the voting blunder, suggesting the party was somehow “rigging” the results and arguing that if the Democrats cannot even run a statewide election they are not fit to lead America. Sign up for our brilliant US 2020 newsletter and get up to date news and analysis from our US team sent straight to your inbox each week. More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2020/02/04/TELEMMGLPICT000223644825_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"iowa caucus farce tells us impending 2020 presidential election","story":"University of Iowa students hold up numbered cards while they caucus, Monday, Feb. 3, 2020, at the Iowa Memorial Union in Iowa City, IowIowa is traditionally the first important hurdle that winnows down the presidential primary field. It did not serve that purpose this year.  The fact that we did not learn the result when the caucuses ended is an apt metaphor for this entire campaign. The Democratic electorate has not been able to settle on who they see as the best challenger to Donald Trump, and Iowa has not helped make this picture any clearer.It was nearly anyone’s game going into these caucuses.  Four different candidates – Joe Biden, Pete Buttigieg, Bernie Sanders, and Elizabeth Warren – each held the lead in pre-caucus polls at various points over recent months. Amy Klobuchar was making a strong showing in recent polls.  At this point it’s not quite certain whether she hit her mark and turned this into a five-person race, but she seems to have played a key role in iding the centrist vote among multiple candidates.Caucuses tend to attract younger, more ideological activists than primaries do. These are groups with whom Sanders is strong and Biden is weak. Couple that dynamic with the lack of ethnic ersity in Iowa and you have a recipe for a strong Sanders showing in the initial preference counts.Sanders’s key groups tended to be in the minority among all caucus-goers, but provided him exceptionally high levels of support.  For example, according to the Edison Research entrance polls, about 1-in-4 caucus-goers were under the age of 30, but Sanders won nearly half of that group’s vote.Contrast this with the other end of the age spectrum – a slightly larger number of caucus-goers were seniors over age 65. Biden won this group, but with just one-third support while about one-fifth backed Buttigieg.National polls leading up to this race indicated that Democratic voters were willing to put electability ahead of issue alignment in making their choice.  This held true in Iowa, where 6-in-10 voters said that finding a nominee who can beat Trump was more important than selecting someone they agree with on the issues. Buttigieg (24pc) and Biden (23pc) are basically tied among the larger group of electability voters.But among the one-third of caucus-goers who prioritized issue alignment, Sanders took 36pc, which doubled the support any of his nearest rivals got from this group.Buttigieg was a strong performer because he appeared to be the top second choice among supporters of other candidates. Buttigieg’s popularity in Iowa had fallen off his peak poll position in December, but he had a very good organization in Iowa. He may have been helped by the fact that the US Senators in the race were taken off the campaign trail due to the impeachment trial.This is especially true for voters who may have has some affinity for Warren and Klobuchar. Buttigieg offered these voters a similar type of appeal as a fresh, yet pragmatic face who they got to see in the final few weeks. It also looks like Biden did not reach the viability threshold in many precincts and most of his supporters went to either Buttigieg or Klobuchar.Even though the Iowa results are inconclusive, Buttigieg may benefit from the veneer of being an acceptable compromise choice. But at this point we don’t know until we get a better picture of what actually happened in Iowa. If the field doesn’t narrow significantly by the end of the month, then the contest faces a new wildcard in the candidacy of Mike Bloomberg.  The former New York mayor made a conscious decision to stay out of the first contests in case a centrist frontrunner did emerge. Without that clarity, his presence in the Super Tuesday contests in early March is likely to muddy the waters even more.Patrick Murray is director of the Monmouth University Polling Institute in New Jersey, USAThe  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

The 18-34 year old cohort are also less likely to associate Sinn Fein with its previous role as the political wing of the Provisional IRA.Sinn Fein has also made a referendum on Irish unity within five years a pre-condition for entering government, although it is not an issue that is gaining any traction with voters.It currently has 24 MPs in the parliament and it is expected that at best it will add another five after Saturday’s election. If the party had run more than one candidate in constituencies where its support is strongest, then on these polling numbers it could potentially have returned with the largest bloc of MPs.The threshold for a parliamentary majority is 80 seats and both Fianna Fail and Fine Gael have ruled out forming a coalition with Sinn Fein after the election.Sinn Fein’s past regularly comes back to haunt the party. It has been embroiled in a controversy over the past few days. Paul Quinn was murdered in county Armagh in 2007 allegedly by members of the IRA. Breege Quinn, the mother of Paul, has claimed that senior members of Sinn Fein know the identities of the murderers and has called on them to hand over what they know to the police. Mrs Quinn said that voters should “think of her son” when they enter the ballot box on Saturday.Last week, it emerged that all Sinn Fein MPs have to sign an oath of loyalty to the party’s ruling council. The party’s critics say Sinn Fein is still controlled by the IRA’s army council. Sinn Fein denies the claims.In Sam McBride’s book ‘Burned’ about the RHI scandal in Northern Ireland he described how Mairtin O’Muilleoir, the Sinn Fein minister for finance in the province, had to ask permission from two unelected party figures, one of whom had been in the IRA, to close down a botched renewable energy scheme which was costing the exchequer millions.The leaders of Fine Gael and Fianna Fail have said Sinn Fein is not a normal democratic party and that is one reason for ruling out coalition. They also describe the party’s economic policies as “dangerous.”Sinn Fein has said that it would ramp up spending on health and housing by €22 billion over the next five years. According to estimates provided by the Department of Finance there is €11 billion available in spare fiscal capacity over that period.  After the last general election in February 2016, it took four months to form a government. A minority Fine Gael administration was kept in office by Fianna Fail in a confidence and supply arrangement. The Irish political landscape is very fragmented. There are eleven political parties and groupings contesting the election. Fianna Fail and Fine Gael are both centrist parties. All but one of the remaining parties are left leaning with some on the hard left. Yet Ireland is an anomaly in the EU. It has never had a leftwing government.Based on current polling numbers, a grand coalition between Fianna Fail and Fine Gael may be the only prospect of stable government after the election.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2020/01/31/15/terraced-street.jpg","title":"housing market england mortgage approvals lending","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.Bank of England figures follow hold on interest rates and\u0026nbspreports of rise in house prices following electionFurther evidence\u0026nbspthat\u0026nbspthe housing market is picking up came from Bank of England figures on Friday as\u0026nbspmortgage approvals hit their highest level in nearly two and a half years in December.The number of mortgages approved for house purchase rose to 67,241 – the highest since July 2017 – from 65,514 in November.

That plan was pulled with just two weeks to go, the paper reported.Very quickly, users started reporting glitches and errors, and organisers were able to input the information as intended. Many complained that they were being shown error messages and that the app would not load properly, forcing them to call in rather than use the app as planned.The Iowa caucus fiasco is a metaphor for the state of US democracyJonathan Green, who chaired a precinct in Lone Tree, said that when he tried to put the results into the reporting app, he kept getting a confusing error message: Unknown protocol. The address specifies a protocol (e.g., wxyz:??.) the browser does not\u0026nbsprecognise, so the browser cannot properly connect to the site.The backup plan of having people call in their results also ran into trouble because the phones they had been asked to use in case of problems were not being answered, according to Des Moines County Democratic Chair Tom Courtney.Issues were further exacerbated by the fact that the app was only made available at a later stage, in an attempt to stop outside interference. That meant it had not been fully tested, and that organisers had little experience of it before the caucuses.Officials have stressed that the delays and problems are not the result of a hack or intrusion, and that the results will remain safe despite the problems.We found inconsistencies in the reporting of three sets of results, the party said in a statement. This is simply a reporting issue, the app did not go down and this is not a hack or an intrusion. The underlying data and paper trail is sound and will simply take time to further report the results.The creation of the app still remains mired in some mystery: very little is known about the process of its creation, or where it came from. Though it is reported to have been made by a company called Shadow, the exact details of that startup are still unclear.In fact, many of the organisations – such as nonprofit Acronym, which was reported to be an investor – have actually distanced themselves from the creation of the app in the wake of the mess.All of the information is also kept in paper backups, and officials can now scour through those to find less high-tech but more reliable results for who has won. Local Democratic officials have claimed that means that the result will still arrive as normal, and will be reliable when it does, with the problems only meaning that they will take longer to actually report.But the fallout could have broader implications beyond Iowa – into the rest of the primaries and caucuses, and even into further elections. As well as further scrutiny of the app, it could lead to yet more questions about why Iowa gets to be the first state in the country to declare, and whether that privilege should go to somewhere else in the wake of such high-profile mistakes.Additional reporting by agenciesBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

That’s a next generation leader.’ And I don’t want to be judged.“I still get angry and chat s**t sometimes,” he explained. “I want to say, ‘Yo, don’t be thinking I’m the one. I’m a f***ing dumbass. I’m not f***ing Gandhi.”Created with Sketch.The 50 best albums of 2019 Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The debut solo album of the art-punk pioneer was never going to be predictable, easy-listening. No Home Record channels the dissonance and avant-garde vibe of New York’s experimental no-wave movement in a nine-song, genre-defiant collection that jumps between industrial, minimal electro-rock and abrasive art punk. Uniting the tracks is their creator’s restlessly questing, non-conformist spirit. It’s great to have her back. (EB)Nilüfer Yanya isn’t down with the “wellness” industry. On her debut album, Miss Universe, the singer-songwriter makes this perfectly clear, tearing into all those “improve yourself” schemes littered across social media and parcelling up that angst as cerebral, skewed alt-rock. ​Synths and saxophone play their part on the smoother, more soulful “Paradise” and “Baby Blu”. Listen to the driving groove of “Heat Rises”, meanwhile, and you’ll be instantly reminded of Kelis and Andre 3000’s “Millionaire”. That said, Yanya is very much her own artist: original and bold. (PS)Five years since their last album, the Ohioan duo have gone back to basics. Gone are the subtle inflections and lacquered psychedelia of Turn Blue Let’s Rock is all about simple hooks and nagging choruses, “an homage”, in the words of drummer Patrick Carney, “to the electric guitar”. Get past the terrible title, and you’ll be rewarded with a viscerally entertaining album that never lingers for more than four minutes per song. If this is genre pastiche, it’s genre pastiche done with skill and savvy. (PS)450 47) Bat for Lashes – Lost GirlsMusically, Lost Girls couldn’t be more Eighties if it were playing a Commodore 64 while eating Angel Delight. Like Stranger Things, everything about it is unashamedly nostalgic: the power drums, the moody atmospherics, the arpeggiated synths. Close your eyes and you can practically see Jason Patric on the Santa Cruz boardwalk in The Lost Boys​. Yes, nostalgia is a fairly generic formula. But listened to as a whole, the album positively thrums with sonic invention, managing to feel both fresh and full of intrigue. Khan once again demonstrates a knack for uncanny storytelling. (PS)On his debut album, the 24-year-old mixes sultry jams that recall the electronic funk of MGMT with nods to the greats: Prince, James Brown, Led Zeppelin and Marvin Gaye. Throughout, Collard exhibits his extraordinary voice, which swoops to a devilishly low murmur or soars to an ecstatic falsetto. On the lustful “Hell Song” he sings “less is more… but more is good”. You’re inclined to agree with him. (RO)When the Missouri singer broke out in 2014, she became known for her lo-fi, introspective sound and the staggering range and power of her voice. On All Mirrors, she dials things up even further than 2016’s Sixties-leaning My Woman, and turns her focus outwards – it is an album, she says, “about losing empathy, trust, love for destructive people” and “owning up to your darkest side”. It is also balletic and haywire, refusing to follow traditional rules of song structure. Listening to it feels like accidentally pressing play on two songs at once, and finding the combination strangely inebriating. (AP)750 44) Lizzo – Cuz I Love YouThis is a polished, playful album, though it has a DIY edge to it: “S**t, f**k, I didn’t know it was ending right there,” she chuckles in the final few moments of “Like a Girl”. “Girl, run this s**t back,” she says after a vivacious flute solo on “Tempo” – a song featuring a guest verse from Missy Elliott, the person who, Lizzo said on Twitter, “made this chubby, weird, black girl believe that ANYTHING was possible”. (AP)There’s no attempt to chase someone else’s wave here no token drill, afroswing or trap beats to satisfy playlist algorithms. Instead, his cold grime sonics are rendered down to their no-frills essentials – brutalist blocks of sad angular melodies and hard, spacious drums. The result is a quintessentially London record, as dark and moody as it is brash and innovative. “We used to do young and stupid,” Skepta concludes on “Gangsta”. “Now we do grown.” (IM)It lacks a centrepiece to match the arresting depth and space of Sweetener’s “God Is A Woman”, but Grande handles its shifting moods and cast of producers (including pop machines Max Martin and Tommy Brown) with engaging class and momentum. One minute you’re skanking along to the party brass of “Bloodline” the next floating into the semi-detached, heartbreak of “Ghostin’”, which appears to address Grande’s guilt at being with Davidson while pining for Miller. She sings of the late rapper as a “wingless angel” with featherlight high notes that will drop the sternest jaw. (HB)The Chicago-born singer’s ninth album is a furious reaction to the social and political events of 2018 – over 11 breathless tracks, he turns that anger into a howl of resistance. Each song feels personal yet relatable – the deep-rooted despair felt on “Trauma” at the sight of wealthy bullies rising to power is a universal one, as is the sense of liberation in just letting go on “What Can You Do But Rock n Roll”. Twelve Nudes is Furman’s most urgent and cathartic record. (RO)On his studio debut, YBN shows off his versatility, but not to the point that it distracts from the underlying message of each song. You have the menacing “Broke as F***”, where the beats and stark piano hook contrasts with Cordae’s rags-to-riches rap. Aged 21, the North Carolina artist flecks songs such as the Anderson .Paak-featuring “RNP” with an endearing kind of nonchalance over the woozy, psychedelic soul of opener “Wintertime”, meanwhile, he wonders how Corretta Scott King felt upon learning Martin Luther had cheated on her. It’s by no means a perfect album in the grand sense of the term, but it is a perfect demonstration of everything Cordae is capable of. (RO)Big Thief’s frontwoman Adrianne Lenker has an uncanny ability to make you feel like you’re in on a secret. Her whispering, spectral delivery and deeply personal lyrics are the key to this. Even on the band’s third album UFOF, with an audience that has grown exponentially in the past few years, the songs are still immensely intimate affairs. The album’s deathly intrigue is drawn from her own personal traumas, which she successfully spins into something that feels universal. But you don’t come away from this record feeling downcast. It’s more a reminder of how fleeting yet beautiful life is, and an appeal to make the most of it. (RO)1350 38) Jenny Lewis – On the LineHere, Lewis does what she does best: adds the glossy sparkle of Hollywood and a sunny Californian sheen to melancholy and nostalgia, with her most luxuriantly orchestrated album yet. Even when she’s singing, “I’ve wasted my youth”, it’s in that sweet voice, with carefree “doo doo doo doo doo doos”, and at a pace that’s so upbeat that it masks the sentiment. It’s a bittersweet mourning of her past. (EB)Few people have had as big a year as Billie Eilish. The first – and currently only – artist born in the Noughties to have a US number one single, she also released her double platinum debut album, the innovative and multifarious, if irksomely titled, When We All Fall Asleep Where Do We Go? There are some missteps –  “Wish You Were Gay” being one of them – but for the most part this is an album as full of charm and bite as Eilish herself. And with a melody that ducks and es in between the beat like a bank robber dodging lasers, the dark, dank pop-trap masterpiece “Bad Guy” is surely a contender for song of the year. (AP)One of the biggest new rap stars to emerge in 2019, AJ Tracey’s variety and the scale of his ambition on this album is breathtaking. Fans will be surprised to discover he sings almost as much as he raps, in pleasingly gruff tones. Each track is a standout, none more so than “Ladbroke Grove”, a hat-tip to classic garage in which Tracey switches up his flow to emulate a Nineties MC. It’s a thrilling work. (RO)The former Chairlift frontwoman’s solo debut (at least, her first under her own name) is an eccentric, experimental delight – PC music by way of classical pop. The product of a orce and a series of adrenal rushes she refers to as “pangs”, the album is musically agile and often lyrically stark: Sometimes I wonder Do I love you too much? Then I tell myself ‘Caroline, shut up’”, she sings on “Caroline Shut Up”. Polachek’s voice is her secret weapon – so jolting and elastic she had to prove it wasn’t autotuned in an astonishing Twitter video. (AP)Simpson recently said he wanted Sound \u0026amp Fury to “hit like a Wu-Tang record”, so each intro is like a one-two punch loaded with brilliant hooks. Then there’s the rollicking “A Good Look” and “Last Man Standing” – it’s pure rock and roll: sleazy, slick and lots of fun. Sound \u0026amp Fury marks another milestone for a remarkable artist. (RO)Of all the excellent bands to emerge out of Dublin’s booming music scene over the past few years, Fontaines DC are the best of them. Perhaps it’s the fact that they’re technically outsiders, having grown up on the borders of the city (or in their guitarist Carlos O’Connell’s case, between there and Spain). Frontman Grian Chatten eschews punk’s tradition of valuing shock value over songcraft and instead offers searing, literary observations of a city with which he has a lovehate relationship. (RO)1950 32) Vampire Weekend – Father of the BrideAlready subject to manic shifts in style and tempo, this hour-long LP roams in lounge pants from Deadhead jams to Zombies-catchy hooks, infectiously kitsch prog, highlife samples and – on “Sunflower” – a scat breakdown. An unfashionable record, then, and that may be its best asset. With such low stakes and barely any emotional intensity, Father of the Bride won’t cement Vampire Weekend’s legacy. But after a highly strung decade on the indie-rock A-list, it gives them room to breathe. (JM)“Making this album has allowed me, for the first time, to find compassion when I have been at my most ungraceful, confused and fractured,” FKA twigs writes in the album’s press notes. “I stopped judging myself, and at that moment found hope in MAGDALENE.” At times, MAGDALENE is just as ungraceful, confused and fractured as its creator was – a rush of baroque electronics, industrial noise, opera, synths, autotune and precarious falsetto. The follow-up to 2014’s LP1 is the sound of a woman teetering on the brink of collapse, gathering herself, and then erupting into a kind of defiance. (AP)2150 30) Bill Callahan – Shepherd in a Sheepskin VestBill Callahan returns after six years with this homely, career-best album in which he sings of his own contentment. “The panic room is now a nursery,” he observes on “Son of the Sea”. Death still looms – often in the form of a black dog that follows Callahan around various tracks – but its inevitability seems more of a comfort than something to be feared: “Everybody must walk the lonesome valley,” he sings firmly. “Yeah, they must walk it by themselves.” (RO)Arriving three years after the release of her debut, Nothing’s Real, Shura’s excellent second record is camp and theatrical, pivoting between a big, poppy sensibility and a minimalist, lo-fi one – sometimes on the same track. Lead single “Religion (U Can Lay Your Hands On Me)” is a slinky shoulder roll of a song, laden with passionate blasphemy: “I wanna consecrate your body, turn the water to wine, I know you’re thinking about kissing, too.” It’s laced, too, with piano – an instrument she’d always been “allergic to” before this record – and opulent orchestral strings. (AP)2350 28) Cage the Elephant – Social CuesOn Cage the Elephant’s fifth album, Social Cues, frontman Matt Shultz reacts to the breakdown of his marriage and the loss of three close friends. He undergoes a kind of Jekyll and Hyde transition through the 13 tracks, the result of which is the band’s best work to date. Single “Ready to let Go” is by far the most explicit – a moody swamp-rock jam where Shultz comes to terms with his impending orce. He bares his soul on Social Cues, and apparently shakes off a few demons in the process. (RO)Howard listened to Brazilian artist Jorge Ben – “where there’s literally, like, 18 different things happening in the song” – while she was making the album, and it shows. “13th Century Metal” builds like an alarm, while “Baby” is scatty and scattered, like something off The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill. Sometimes, there is one instrument too many, but usually the components crash together well. (AP)Written during her recent pregnancy and the birth of her first child, Remind Me Tomorrow shows Van Etten dimming her spotlight on toxicity and instead casting a warm glow behind the record’s psychic overview. As well as expectations of confessional singers, she subverts folk music’s focus on bare-bones songwriting. But the daintiest composition “Stay” is her most perfectly realised yet, over music box chimes and heel-clicking percussion she coos: “You won’t let me go astray You will let me find my way.” After years of making peace with drift and uncertainty, she’s never sounded more sure of anything. (JM)Inspired by the improvisations he was creating while on tour with The xx in 2017, Sam Shepherd found himself making “some of the most obtuse and aggressive music I’ve ever made”. This newfound drive can be heard in singles such as “LesAlpx”, a mind-melting track that climbs breathlessly towards its summit with a pounding bass beat and high, whistling chirps that punctuate the tension. It’s an insight into his brilliant mind and – such is the sheer variety of the album – a way to inspire one’s own imagination. (RO)2750 24) Stormzy – Heavy is the HeadThere are three themes that run through the record: his defiance in the face of doubt the pressure of high expectations and his efforts to lift others up as his success continues to grow. He reminds himself constantly of who he is beneath the gloss that fame has brought: he’s “Rachael’s Little Brother”, “Big Michael”, a guy who likes to watch Avengers and Game of Thrones. All of his best traits are present and correct: sincerity, a smooth flow and forensic-like analysis of societal ills, laced with pathos and humour. The lasting impression is of an artist whose only way is up. (RO)A blunt, bold album on which Hackman’s beatific voice sits atop methodically messy instrumentals. Songs such as “All Night” are so candidly carnal it feels inappropriate to listen to them in public notes of riot grrrl, pop and rock come together throughout the record to create something that is, at times, quite striking. (AP)2950 22) Solange – When I Get HomeThe decade’s second great Solange album churns several deformed, jazzy aesthetics – including Brainfeeder’s gloopy electro-funk and the concoctions of DJ Screw – into a lustrous cloud of R\u0026ampB. The result hints at Seventies soul voyagers like Stevie Wonder yet retains its future-shock, celebrating Houston futurism without pandering to fans of its explicitly political predecessor. (JM)For her fifth studio album, Cate Le Bon went to live in a secluded cottage in the Lake District, where she sang to an empty house and took lessons in wood-carving. Yet her compositions on Reward are lush, warm and whimsical opener “Miami” is resplendent with stately horns and percussion that reminds you of childhood. There’s a fantastic sense of space, too, spun from diaphanous arrangements such as “The Light”, where she meanders delightfully from a clear, lilting call to a deep vocal rumble. It’s an album by an artist intent on readdressing her relationship with her own existence. (RO)Fender drew plenty of early comparisons to Bruce Springsteen – on Hypersonic Missiles they’re entirely warranted, as much for the instrumentation as the lyricism and his vignettes of working-class struggle. There are sax solos (more than one), and pounding rhythms that make you want to jump in a car and drive down a highway at sunset, and blistering electric guitars next to classic troubadour acoustics. He has Springsteen’s rousing holler, and the early indications of someone who could be the voice of a generation – not because he wants to be, but because he sees things and understands. (RO)Swift’s sixth album Reputation was camp and melodramatic, killing off “the old Taylor” and waging war on anyone and everyone who dared to criticise her. It was sincerity veiled as self-parody, insecurity veiled as breeziness – and all the better for that uneasy paradox. But Lover, her new, seventh album, feels like a partial resurrection of the Swift of old: moony romance and earnest earworms abound. It’s the sound of a singer excited to be earnest again. Taylor Swift is dead. Long live Taylor Swift. (AP)The record is an introspective mix of psychey soul, blues, rock and funk, which skips and strolls and swaggers through its 13 tracks – but it is not simply an exercise in nostalgia. Its influences  decades Gil Scott-Heron, Fela Kuti, Kendrick Lamar and Bobby Womack are all recalled. “I’m not going to have an alter ego, or becomes Sasha Fierce or Ziggy Stardust,” says Kiwanuka. “I can just be Michael Kiwanuka.” With an album this good, it’s hard to argue with that. (AP)On his sixth album, Kano’s powers of observation are at their peak. Home has always been at the heart of his music, so he maintains the close-quarters perspective of his 2005 debut Home Sweet Home the swaggering confidence of that record, though, is replaced by a more thoughtful gravitas. He’s an elder statesman of grime, and you can almost see his furrowed brow and shake of his head on “Trouble”, while the frenetic “Class of Deja”, starring fellow veterans D Double E and Ghetts, reminds the listener how he lit the path for future generations. (RO)3550 16) Hot Chip – A Bath Full of EcstasyLyrically, the band offer up some of their most poignant phrases to date on this – their seventh and best record. Second single “Hungry Child”, a trance-y floor-filler, contains the plaintive, “Dreaming never felt so bad Lonely never felt so wrong before” while, over the shuffling beats of “Echo”, Alexis Taylor sings of leaving your regrets behind while seeming to understand the effort required to achieve this. For all its glimmering synths and the robotic pathos of Taylor’s idiosyncratic vocals, this is a record with both heart and soul. (RO)3650 15) MUNA – Saves the WorldSaves the World should see MUNA joining the ranks of those who have brazenly borrowed their sound. Lead single “Number One Fan” banishes intrusive thoughts – “Nobody likes me and I’m gonna die” – just in time for a lavish, self-celebratory chorus, one part earnest, one part tongue-in-cheek. Elsewhere, they are downright defeatist, laments the inevitable pull back to a recent ex (“Stayaway”) or reflecting on a lover’s similarity to an adulterous father (“Taken”). “Hands Off”, meanwhile, toys with temptation before slamming the door shut. It is fierce and forthright. (AP)Fans have already drawn comparisons between We Are Not Your Kind and Slipknot’s seminal 2001 album Iowa. While the latter was even heavier (it would be difficult if not impossible to outdo), the sheer ambition on We Are Not Your Kind is just as staggering. If anything, the dynamic created by placing a bigger emphasis on melody allows you to consider everything without being engulfed by noise. Critics may question how relevant Slipknot are in 2019. The pummelling force of We Are Not Your Kind should be enough to silence them – this may be one of the band’s most personal records, but the rage they capture is universally felt. (RO)Each song is titled after a black woman Rapsody admires: Serena Williams, Sojourner Truth, Maya Angelou, Aaliyah, Oprah Winfrey… and for each one she explores these women’s traits, successes and strife. As on Laila’s Wisdom, Eve conveys Rapsody’s natural feel for funk – “Michelle” (Obama) bounces in on a jaunty piano riff – but other tracks, such as “Afeni”, are pure soul. Nina Simone said an artist’s duty, “as far as I’m concerned, is to reflect the times”. This is precisely what Rapsody has done, in the most resonant way possible. (RO)There’s a deeper sense of personal connection to anchor Julia Jacklin’s lyrical and melodic smarts. That snare drum on “Pressure to Party” keeps a relentless, nerve-snapping pulse throughout, while “Don’t Know How to Keep Loving You” nails a depth of intimacy while acknowledging relationship ennui. Grunge-rinsed, feminist-flipped, upcycled Fifties guitar an’ all: Crushing is a triumph. (HB)Philippakis’s voice is shrouded in the smoke from society’s wreckage. Lead single “Exits”, six scintillating minutes of Eighties “sledgehammer” pop that lumbers into view like a heavy artillery vehicle covered in sequins, concerns the one percenters building underground cities to escape global warming. “Syrups” has Yannis howling a passionate post-apocalyptic vision of robot invasions and sand-clogged towns over a corroded Gorillaz dub that builds to a motoric charge as global panic sets in. An inspired album of scorched earth music. (MB)A talented pianist as well as a rapper and singer, Dave often spits over discordant chords to amplify the urgency of his chosen subject, or else raps in gruff, assertive tones across an emotional sequence that complements his stoic intensity. On “Environment”, he talks about the conflict between what people see of his apparently glamorous life, and the reality behind the scenes where the blood and sweat is drawn out of him. He’s put everything into this album. (RO)Weyes Blood, whose real name is Natalie Mering, accompanies her instrumental idiosyncrasies with strong, luscious melodies and unfussy lyrics. “No one’s ever gonna give you a trophy for all the pain and the things you’ve been through,” she sings on “Mirror Forever”. “No one knows but you.”And then there’s that voice – at once warm and haunting, controlled and untethered. It’s no wonder she’s lent it to the likes of Perfume Genius, Drugdealer and Ariel Pink: it adds a touch of profundity to everything it meets. (AP)The warm splashes of piano that washed over that song also break through the anxious rattle of dance beats on the album’s eponymous opener, the singer so regularly reviewed as “vaporous” promises to “leave the ether, assume form” and “be touchable, be reachable”. His own sharpest critic, he winks at the journalists who’ve called him glacial as he drops from remote, icy falsetto into a richly grained, deeper tone to ask: “Doesn’t it seem much warmer?” (HB)Following the traumatised chaos of 2016’s Skeleton Tree, Ghosteen is a warm cloud of ambient solace – a sonic evocation of the communion he has experienced through his newly porous relationship with his audience. He sounds buoyed, not weakened, by exposing his wounds. (HB)4550 6) Tyler, the Creator – IGORThe production here is superb. Tyler has never been one for traditional song structure, but on IGOR, which is undoubtedly a break-up album, he’s like the Minotaur – luring you through a maze that twists and turns around seemingly impossible corners, drawing you into the thrilling unknown. Its lack of resolution at the close – surely the most torturous element of a great love lost – makes it all the more powerful. (RO)The indie-rock band’s second album in the space of five months (the first being UFOF), was described as the “earth twin” and, indeed, they sound utterly grounded – to each other, and to their surroundings in the arid Chihuahuan Desert of Texas, near the Mexico border. In contrast to her fragile performance on UFOF, here Adrianne Lenker sings in lusty whoops and calls on “Forgotten Eyes”, while “Not”, the record’s dark, brooding soul, caterwauls with feedback screeches and a merciless, two-minute guitar solo that leaves you simultaneously devastated and enthralled. (RO)Bruce Springsteen seems to have told almost every tale in the grand old storybook of American mythologies, except perhaps one: a wide-eyed Californian dreamer finds the Golden State turns sour and flees back east, to some romantic speck of a town, to pine and rehabilitate. It’s the classic pop plotline of Bacharach and David’s “Do You Know the Way to San Jose?”, and it’s a tale Springsteen taps repeatedly here, on his sumptuous, cinematic 19th album, which is nothing short of a late-period masterpiece. (MB)Few albums in 2019 have been as eclectic, or with as singular a vision, as Simz’s GREY Area. She flips between two tones: formidable and reflective. On tracks such as “Offence” and “Boss” she drips with venom delivering lines in a low, deadly buzz over killer bass hooks and punk distortion. On “Selfish” and “Flowers” she’s softer – allowing herself to be vulnerable because she knows she doesn’t have to ditch all sentiment to compete with her male peers. She’s better because she embraces every facet of herself, and offers it to the listener in as clear a statement as possible. (RO)Lana Del Rey has always been obsessed with the past. Hers is a sound rooted in nostalgia, a paean to everything she was born too late to live through: old Hollywood, Sinatra, beat poetry, Sylvia Plath and Fifties Americana. At her best, she mines something fresh from it all. At her worst, she wallows in it. Her new album Norman F**king Rockwell!, named after a 20th-century American artist, does both. (AP)When Aldous Harding performed in London this month, an enamoured fan cried out that they loved her. “I appreciate that,” she replied softly. “But, I’m busy.” The response is Harding to a T – wry, weird, introspective, focused. Her spectacular, singular third album, Designer, is all of those things. Taking the left-field folk that made her name and splashing post-psych pop and jittery orchestral flourishes onto the canvas, the New Zealander harbours secrets while beckoning you in. The debut solo album of the art-punk pioneer was never going to be predictable, easy-listening. No Home Record channels the dissonance and avant-garde vibe of New York’s experimental no-wave movement in a nine-song, genre-defiant collection that jumps between industrial, minimal electro-rock and abrasive art punk. Uniting the tracks is their creator’s restlessly questing, non-conformist spirit. It’s great to have her back. (EB)Nilüfer Yanya isn’t down with the “wellness” industry. On her debut album, Miss Universe, the singer-songwriter makes this perfectly clear, tearing into all those “improve yourself” schemes littered across social media and parcelling up that angst as cerebral, skewed alt-rock. ​Synths and saxophone play their part on the smoother, more soulful “Paradise” and “Baby Blu”. Listen to the driving groove of “Heat Rises”, meanwhile, and you’ll be instantly reminded of Kelis and Andre 3000’s “Millionaire”. That said, Yanya is very much her own artist: original and bold. (PS)Five years since their last album, the Ohioan duo have gone back to basics. Gone are the subtle inflections and lacquered psychedelia of Turn Blue Let’s Rock is all about simple hooks and nagging choruses, “an homage”, in the words of drummer Patrick Carney, “to the electric guitar”. Get past the terrible title, and you’ll be rewarded with a viscerally entertaining album that never lingers for more than four minutes per song. If this is genre pastiche, it’s genre pastiche done with skill and savvy. (PS)450 47) Bat for Lashes – Lost GirlsMusically, Lost Girls couldn’t be more Eighties if it were playing a Commodore 64 while eating Angel Delight. Like Stranger Things, everything about it is unashamedly nostalgic: the power drums, the moody atmospherics, the arpeggiated synths. Close your eyes and you can practically see Jason Patric on the Santa Cruz boardwalk in The Lost Boys​. Yes, nostalgia is a fairly generic formula. But listened to as a whole, the album positively thrums with sonic invention, managing to feel both fresh and full of intrigue. Khan once again demonstrates a knack for uncanny storytelling. (PS)On his debut album, the 24-year-old mixes sultry jams that recall the electronic funk of MGMT with nods to the greats: Prince, James Brown, Led Zeppelin and Marvin Gaye. Throughout, Collard exhibits his extraordinary voice, which swoops to a devilishly low murmur or soars to an ecstatic falsetto. On the lustful “Hell Song” he sings “less is more… but more is good”. You’re inclined to agree with him. (RO)When the Missouri singer broke out in 2014, she became known for her lo-fi, introspective sound and the staggering range and power of her voice. On All Mirrors, she dials things up even further than 2016’s Sixties-leaning My Woman, and turns her focus outwards – it is an album, she says, “about losing empathy, trust, love for destructive people” and “owning up to your darkest side”. It is also balletic and haywire, refusing to follow traditional rules of song structure. Listening to it feels like accidentally pressing play on two songs at once, and finding the combination strangely inebriating. (AP)750 44) Lizzo – Cuz I Love YouThis is a polished, playful album, though it has a DIY edge to it: “S**t, f**k, I didn’t know it was ending right there,” she chuckles in the final few moments of “Like a Girl”. “Girl, run this s**t back,” she says after a vivacious flute solo on “Tempo” – a song featuring a guest verse from Missy Elliott, the person who, Lizzo said on Twitter, “made this chubby, weird, black girl believe that ANYTHING was possible”. (AP)There’s no attempt to chase someone else’s wave here no token drill, afroswing or trap beats to satisfy playlist algorithms. Instead, his cold grime sonics are rendered down to their no-frills essentials – brutalist blocks of sad angular melodies and hard, spacious drums. The result is a quintessentially London record, as dark and moody as it is brash and innovative. “We used to do young and stupid,” Skepta concludes on “Gangsta”. “Now we do grown.” (IM)It lacks a centrepiece to match the arresting depth and space of Sweetener’s “God Is A Woman”, but Grande handles its shifting moods and cast of producers (including pop machines Max Martin and Tommy Brown) with engaging class and momentum. One minute you’re skanking along to the party brass of “Bloodline” the next floating into the semi-detached, heartbreak of “Ghostin’”, which appears to address Grande’s guilt at being with Davidson while pining for Miller. She sings of the late rapper as a “wingless angel” with featherlight high notes that will drop the sternest jaw. (HB)The Chicago-born singer’s ninth album is a furious reaction to the social and political events of 2018 – over 11 breathless tracks, he turns that anger into a howl of resistance. Each song feels personal yet relatable – the deep-rooted despair felt on “Trauma” at the sight of wealthy bullies rising to power is a universal one, as is the sense of liberation in just letting go on “What Can You Do But Rock n Roll”. Twelve Nudes is Furman’s most urgent and cathartic record. (RO)On his studio debut, YBN shows off his versatility, but not to the point that it distracts from the underlying message of each song. You have the menacing “Broke as F***”, where the beats and stark piano hook contrasts with Cordae’s rags-to-riches rap. Aged 21, the North Carolina artist flecks songs such as the Anderson .Paak-featuring “RNP” with an endearing kind of nonchalance over the woozy, psychedelic soul of opener “Wintertime”, meanwhile, he wonders how Corretta Scott King felt upon learning Martin Luther had cheated on her. It’s by no means a perfect album in the grand sense of the term, but it is a perfect demonstration of everything Cordae is capable of. (RO)Big Thief’s frontwoman Adrianne Lenker has an uncanny ability to make you feel like you’re in on a secret. Her whispering, spectral delivery and deeply personal lyrics are the key to this. Even on the band’s third album UFOF, with an audience that has grown exponentially in the past few years, the songs are still immensely intimate affairs. The album’s deathly intrigue is drawn from her own personal traumas, which she successfully spins into something that feels universal. But you don’t come away from this record feeling downcast. It’s more a reminder of how fleeting yet beautiful life is, and an appeal to make the most of it. (RO)1350 38) Jenny Lewis – On the LineHere, Lewis does what she does best: adds the glossy sparkle of Hollywood and a sunny Californian sheen to melancholy and nostalgia, with her most luxuriantly orchestrated album yet. Even when she’s singing, “I’ve wasted my youth”, it’s in that sweet voice, with carefree “doo doo doo doo doo doos”, and at a pace that’s so upbeat that it masks the sentiment. It’s a bittersweet mourning of her past. (EB)Few people have had as big a year as Billie Eilish. The first – and currently only – artist born in the Noughties to have a US number one single, she also released her double platinum debut album, the innovative and multifarious, if irksomely titled, When We All Fall Asleep Where Do We Go? There are some missteps –  “Wish You Were Gay” being one of them – but for the most part this is an album as full of charm and bite as Eilish herself. And with a melody that ducks and es in between the beat like a bank robber dodging lasers, the dark, dank pop-trap masterpiece “Bad Guy” is surely a contender for song of the year. (AP)One of the biggest new rap stars to emerge in 2019, AJ Tracey’s variety and the scale of his ambition on this album is breathtaking. Fans will be surprised to discover he sings almost as much as he raps, in pleasingly gruff tones. Each track is a standout, none more so than “Ladbroke Grove”, a hat-tip to classic garage in which Tracey switches up his flow to emulate a Nineties MC. It’s a thrilling work. (RO)The former Chairlift frontwoman’s solo debut (at least, her first under her own name) is an eccentric, experimental delight – PC music by way of classical pop. The product of a orce and a series of adrenal rushes she refers to as “pangs”, the album is musically agile and often lyrically stark: Sometimes I wonder Do I love you too much? Then I tell myself ‘Caroline, shut up’”, she sings on “Caroline Shut Up”. Polachek’s voice is her secret weapon – so jolting and elastic she had to prove it wasn’t autotuned in an astonishing Twitter video. (AP)Simpson recently said he wanted Sound \u0026amp Fury to “hit like a Wu-Tang record”, so each intro is like a one-two punch loaded with brilliant hooks. Then there’s the rollicking “A Good Look” and “Last Man Standing” – it’s pure rock and roll: sleazy, slick and lots of fun. Sound \u0026amp Fury marks another milestone for a remarkable artist. (RO)Of all the excellent bands to emerge out of Dublin’s booming music scene over the past few years, Fontaines DC are the best of them. Perhaps it’s the fact that they’re technically outsiders, having grown up on the borders of the city (or in their guitarist Carlos O’Connell’s case, between there and Spain). Frontman Grian Chatten eschews punk’s tradition of valuing shock value over songcraft and instead offers searing, literary observations of a city with which he has a lovehate relationship. (RO)1950 32) Vampire Weekend – Father of the BrideAlready subject to manic shifts in style and tempo, this hour-long LP roams in lounge pants from Deadhead jams to Zombies-catchy hooks, infectiously kitsch prog, highlife samples and – on “Sunflower” – a scat breakdown. An unfashionable record, then, and that may be its best asset. With such low stakes and barely any emotional intensity, Father of the Bride won’t cement Vampire Weekend’s legacy. But after a highly strung decade on the indie-rock A-list, it gives them room to breathe. (JM)“Making this album has allowed me, for the first time, to find compassion when I have been at my most ungraceful, confused and fractured,” FKA twigs writes in the album’s press notes. “I stopped judging myself, and at that moment found hope in MAGDALENE.” At times, MAGDALENE is just as ungraceful, confused and fractured as its creator was – a rush of baroque electronics, industrial noise, opera, synths, autotune and precarious falsetto. The follow-up to 2014’s LP1 is the sound of a woman teetering on the brink of collapse, gathering herself, and then erupting into a kind of defiance. (AP)2150 30) Bill Callahan – Shepherd in a Sheepskin VestBill Callahan returns after six years with this homely, career-best album in which he sings of his own contentment. “The panic room is now a nursery,” he observes on “Son of the Sea”. Death still looms – often in the form of a black dog that follows Callahan around various tracks – but its inevitability seems more of a comfort than something to be feared: “Everybody must walk the lonesome valley,” he sings firmly. “Yeah, they must walk it by themselves.” (RO)Arriving three years after the release of her debut, Nothing’s Real, Shura’s excellent second record is camp and theatrical, pivoting between a big, poppy sensibility and a minimalist, lo-fi one – sometimes on the same track. Lead single “Religion (U Can Lay Your Hands On Me)” is a slinky shoulder roll of a song, laden with passionate blasphemy: “I wanna consecrate your body, turn the water to wine, I know you’re thinking about kissing, too.” It’s laced, too, with piano – an instrument she’d always been “allergic to” before this record – and opulent orchestral strings. (AP)2350 28) Cage the Elephant – Social CuesOn Cage the Elephant’s fifth album, Social Cues, frontman Matt Shultz reacts to the breakdown of his marriage and the loss of three close friends. He undergoes a kind of Jekyll and Hyde transition through the 13 tracks, the result of which is the band’s best work to date. Single “Ready to let Go” is by far the most explicit – a moody swamp-rock jam where Shultz comes to terms with his impending orce. He bares his soul on Social Cues, and apparently shakes off a few demons in the process. (RO)Howard listened to Brazilian artist Jorge Ben – “where there’s literally, like, 18 different things happening in the song” – while she was making the album, and it shows. “13th Century Metal” builds like an alarm, while “Baby” is scatty and scattered, like something off The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill. Sometimes, there is one instrument too many, but usually the components crash together well. (AP)Written during her recent pregnancy and the birth of her first child, Remind Me Tomorrow shows Van Etten dimming her spotlight on toxicity and instead casting a warm glow behind the record’s psychic overview. As well as expectations of confessional singers, she subverts folk music’s focus on bare-bones songwriting. But the daintiest composition “Stay” is her most perfectly realised yet, over music box chimes and heel-clicking percussion she coos: “You won’t let me go astray You will let me find my way.” After years of making peace with drift and uncertainty, she’s never sounded more sure of anything. (JM)Inspired by the improvisations he was creating while on tour with The xx in 2017, Sam Shepherd found himself making “some of the most obtuse and aggressive music I’ve ever made”. This newfound drive can be heard in singles such as “LesAlpx”, a mind-melting track that climbs breathlessly towards its summit with a pounding bass beat and high, whistling chirps that punctuate the tension. It’s an insight into his brilliant mind and – such is the sheer variety of the album – a way to inspire one’s own imagination. (RO)2750 24) Stormzy – Heavy is the HeadThere are three themes that run through the record: his defiance in the face of doubt the pressure of high expectations and his efforts to lift others up as his success continues to grow. He reminds himself constantly of who he is beneath the gloss that fame has brought: he’s “Rachael’s Little Brother”, “Big Michael”, a guy who likes to watch Avengers and Game of Thrones. All of his best traits are present and correct: sincerity, a smooth flow and forensic-like analysis of societal ills, laced with pathos and humour. The lasting impression is of an artist whose only way is up. (RO)A blunt, bold album on which Hackman’s beatific voice sits atop methodically messy instrumentals. Songs such as “All Night” are so candidly carnal it feels inappropriate to listen to them in public notes of riot grrrl, pop and rock come together throughout the record to create something that is, at times, quite striking. (AP)2950 22) Solange – When I Get HomeThe decade’s second great Solange album churns several deformed, jazzy aesthetics – including Brainfeeder’s gloopy electro-funk and the concoctions of DJ Screw – into a lustrous cloud of R\u0026ampB. The result hints at Seventies soul voyagers like Stevie Wonder yet retains its future-shock, celebrating Houston futurism without pandering to fans of its explicitly political predecessor. (JM)For her fifth studio album, Cate Le Bon went to live in a secluded cottage in the Lake District, where she sang to an empty house and took lessons in wood-carving. Yet her compositions on Reward are lush, warm and whimsical opener “Miami” is resplendent with stately horns and percussion that reminds you of childhood. There’s a fantastic sense of space, too, spun from diaphanous arrangements such as “The Light”, where she meanders delightfully from a clear, lilting call to a deep vocal rumble. It’s an album by an artist intent on readdressing her relationship with her own existence. (RO)Fender drew plenty of early comparisons to Bruce Springsteen – on Hypersonic Missiles they’re entirely warranted, as much for the instrumentation as the lyricism and his vignettes of working-class struggle. There are sax solos (more than one), and pounding rhythms that make you want to jump in a car and drive down a highway at sunset, and blistering electric guitars next to classic troubadour acoustics. He has Springsteen’s rousing holler, and the early indications of someone who could be the voice of a generation – not because he wants to be, but because he sees things and understands. (RO)Swift’s sixth album Reputation was camp and melodramatic, killing off “the old Taylor” and waging war on anyone and everyone who dared to criticise her. It was sincerity veiled as self-parody, insecurity veiled as breeziness – and all the better for that uneasy paradox. But Lover, her new, seventh album, feels like a partial resurrection of the Swift of old: moony romance and earnest earworms abound. It’s the sound of a singer excited to be earnest again. Taylor Swift is dead. Long live Taylor Swift. (AP)The record is an introspective mix of psychey soul, blues, rock and funk, which skips and strolls and swaggers through its 13 tracks – but it is not simply an exercise in nostalgia. Its influences  decades Gil Scott-Heron, Fela Kuti, Kendrick Lamar and Bobby Womack are all recalled. “I’m not going to have an alter ego, or becomes Sasha Fierce or Ziggy Stardust,” says Kiwanuka. “I can just be Michael Kiwanuka.” With an album this good, it’s hard to argue with that. (AP)On his sixth album, Kano’s powers of observation are at their peak. Home has always been at the heart of his music, so he maintains the close-quarters perspective of his 2005 debut Home Sweet Home the swaggering confidence of that record, though, is replaced by a more thoughtful gravitas. He’s an elder statesman of grime, and you can almost see his furrowed brow and shake of his head on “Trouble”, while the frenetic “Class of Deja”, starring fellow veterans D Double E and Ghetts, reminds the listener how he lit the path for future generations. (RO)3550 16) Hot Chip – A Bath Full of EcstasyLyrically, the band offer up some of their most poignant phrases to date on this – their seventh and best record. Second single “Hungry Child”, a trance-y floor-filler, contains the plaintive, “Dreaming never felt so bad Lonely never felt so wrong before” while, over the shuffling beats of “Echo”, Alexis Taylor sings of leaving your regrets behind while seeming to understand the effort required to achieve this. For all its glimmering synths and the robotic pathos of Taylor’s idiosyncratic vocals, this is a record with both heart and soul. (RO)3650 15) MUNA – Saves the WorldSaves the World should see MUNA joining the ranks of those who have brazenly borrowed their sound. Lead single “Number One Fan” banishes intrusive thoughts – “Nobody likes me and I’m gonna die” – just in time for a lavish, self-celebratory chorus, one part earnest, one part tongue-in-cheek. Elsewhere, they are downright defeatist, laments the inevitable pull back to a recent ex (“Stayaway”) or reflecting on a lover’s similarity to an adulterous father (“Taken”). “Hands Off”, meanwhile, toys with temptation before slamming the door shut. It is fierce and forthright. (AP)Fans have already drawn comparisons between We Are Not Your Kind and Slipknot’s seminal 2001 album Iowa. While the latter was even heavier (it would be difficult if not impossible to outdo), the sheer ambition on We Are Not Your Kind is just as staggering. If anything, the dynamic created by placing a bigger emphasis on melody allows you to consider everything without being engulfed by noise. Critics may question how relevant Slipknot are in 2019. The pummelling force of We Are Not Your Kind should be enough to silence them – this may be one of the band’s most personal records, but the rage they capture is universally felt. (RO)Each song is titled after a black woman Rapsody admires: Serena Williams, Sojourner Truth, Maya Angelou, Aaliyah, Oprah Winfrey… and for each one she explores these women’s traits, successes and strife. As on Laila’s Wisdom, Eve conveys Rapsody’s natural feel for funk – “Michelle” (Obama) bounces in on a jaunty piano riff – but other tracks, such as “Afeni”, are pure soul. Nina Simone said an artist’s duty, “as far as I’m concerned, is to reflect the times”. This is precisely what Rapsody has done, in the most resonant way possible. (RO)There’s a deeper sense of personal connection to anchor Julia Jacklin’s lyrical and melodic smarts. That snare drum on “Pressure to Party” keeps a relentless, nerve-snapping pulse throughout, while “Don’t Know How to Keep Loving You” nails a depth of intimacy while acknowledging relationship ennui. Grunge-rinsed, feminist-flipped, upcycled Fifties guitar an’ all: Crushing is a triumph. (HB)Philippakis’s voice is shrouded in the smoke from society’s wreckage. Lead single “Exits”, six scintillating minutes of Eighties “sledgehammer” pop that lumbers into view like a heavy artillery vehicle covered in sequins, concerns the one percenters building underground cities to escape global warming. “Syrups” has Yannis howling a passionate post-apocalyptic vision of robot invasions and sand-clogged towns over a corroded Gorillaz dub that builds to a motoric charge as global panic sets in. An inspired album of scorched earth music. (MB)A talented pianist as well as a rapper and singer, Dave often spits over discordant chords to amplify the urgency of his chosen subject, or else raps in gruff, assertive tones across an emotional sequence that complements his stoic intensity. On “Environment”, he talks about the conflict between what people see of his apparently glamorous life, and the reality behind the scenes where the blood and sweat is drawn out of him. He’s put everything into this album. (RO)Weyes Blood, whose real name is Natalie Mering, accompanies her instrumental idiosyncrasies with strong, luscious melodies and unfussy lyrics. “No one’s ever gonna give you a trophy for all the pain and the things you’ve been through,” she sings on “Mirror Forever”. “No one knows but you.”And then there’s that voice – at once warm and haunting, controlled and untethered. It’s no wonder she’s lent it to the likes of Perfume Genius, Drugdealer and Ariel Pink: it adds a touch of profundity to everything it meets. (AP)The warm splashes of piano that washed over that song also break through the anxious rattle of dance beats on the album’s eponymous opener, the singer so regularly reviewed as “vaporous” promises to “leave the ether, assume form” and “be touchable, be reachable”. His own sharpest critic, he winks at the journalists who’ve called him glacial as he drops from remote, icy falsetto into a richly grained, deeper tone to ask: “Doesn’t it seem much warmer?” (HB)Following the traumatised chaos of 2016’s Skeleton Tree, Ghosteen is a warm cloud of ambient solace – a sonic evocation of the communion he has experienced through his newly porous relationship with his audience. He sounds buoyed, not weakened, by exposing his wounds. (HB)4550 6) Tyler, the Creator – IGORThe production here is superb. Tyler has never been one for traditional song structure, but on IGOR, which is undoubtedly a break-up album, he’s like the Minotaur – luring you through a maze that twists and turns around seemingly impossible corners, drawing you into the thrilling unknown. Its lack of resolution at the close – surely the most torturous element of a great love lost – makes it all the more powerful. (RO)The indie-rock band’s second album in the space of five months (the first being UFOF), was described as the “earth twin” and, indeed, they sound utterly grounded – to each other, and to their surroundings in the arid Chihuahuan Desert of Texas, near the Mexico border. In contrast to her fragile performance on UFOF, here Adrianne Lenker sings in lusty whoops and calls on “Forgotten Eyes”, while “Not”, the record’s dark, brooding soul, caterwauls with feedback screeches and a merciless, two-minute guitar solo that leaves you simultaneously devastated and enthralled. (RO)Bruce Springsteen seems to have told almost every tale in the grand old storybook of American mythologies, except perhaps one: a wide-eyed Californian dreamer finds the Golden State turns sour and flees back east, to some romantic speck of a town, to pine and rehabilitate. It’s the classic pop plotline of Bacharach and David’s “Do You Know the Way to San Jose?”, and it’s a tale Springsteen taps repeatedly here, on his sumptuous, cinematic 19th album, which is nothing short of a late-period masterpiece. (MB)Few albums in 2019 have been as eclectic, or with as singular a vision, as Simz’s GREY Area. She flips between two tones: formidable and reflective. On tracks such as “Offence” and “Boss” she drips with venom delivering lines in a low, deadly buzz over killer bass hooks and punk distortion. On “Selfish” and “Flowers” she’s softer – allowing herself to be vulnerable because she knows she doesn’t have to ditch all sentiment to compete with her male peers. She’s better because she embraces every facet of herself, and offers it to the listener in as clear a statement as possible. (RO)Lana Del Rey has always been obsessed with the past. Hers is a sound rooted in nostalgia, a paean to everything she was born too late to live through: old Hollywood, Sinatra, beat poetry, Sylvia Plath and Fifties Americana. At her best, she mines something fresh from it all. At her worst, she wallows in it. Her new album Norman F**king Rockwell!, named after a 20th-century American artist, does both. (AP)When Aldous Harding performed in London this month, an enamoured fan cried out that they loved her. “I appreciate that,” she replied softly. “But, I’m busy.” The response is Harding to a T – wry, weird, introspective, focused. Her spectacular, singular third album, Designer, is all of those things. Taking the left-field folk that made her name and splashing post-psych pop and jittery orchestral flourishes onto the canvas, the New Zealander harbours secrets while beckoning you in.

These aren’t old mistakes – they are the same old mistakes.“It’s not as if there are so many non-white MPs, candidates and knights of the realm that they cannot keep it straight.”In its reporting of the BBC gaffe, the Evening Standard was also put in the firing line after it used a photo of shadow immigration minister Bell Ribeiro-Addy on its social media instead of Ms Cordova.The newspaper apologised after the mistake was pointed out by journalist Omar Baggili on Twitter and said: “It had been wrongly captioned by one of our picture suppliers, Getty Images. We have apologised to both @MarshadeCordova and @BellRibeiroAddy this morning.”Mr Lammy criticised the Evening Standard’s oversight and called for more ersity in newsrooms.

You can\u0027t do anything\u0027Awais\u0026nbspRaza\u0026nbspisn’t sure how old he is. He barely remembers anything from his early years, or perhaps he blocks it out. What the Afghan national does know is that his father, mother and sister were killed when he was very young, and he was subsequently taken to a children’s home – but what he describes sounds more like a prison.“They would tell me to work: ‘Clean the house, take this rubbish, take this bag here,’” says\u0026nbspAwais, wincing at the memory. “They told me to go outside and take this bag, small and big bags, and would tell me to take it somewhere. If I didn’t do it they would beat me, or burn my feet. They were treating me like this for a long time, doing these things to me.” He parts his hair to reveal a long scar embedded into his scalp, before pushing down his socks to reveal burns on his ankles and feet.\u0026nbspSharing the full story, not just the headlinesAround 15 years on,\u0026nbspthe Afghan national sits on a bench in east London. He arrived in the UK nearly a decade ago after an “uncle” – the term he uses for older men of his nationality – helped him escape the violence, labour exploitation and sexual abuse he was subjected to for most of his childhood. He has since been saved from his exploiters, but faced a different challenge – the battle\u0026nbspfor protection from the Home Office.When Awais\u0026nbsparrived in Britain he was housed by an Afghan man in Luton.\u0026nbspHe was at some point given a passport which indicated that his date of birth was 1 June 1994 – making him 24.\u0026nbspHe stayed with the man for just under a year until the man left the country, then he went between various friends he had met in the UK. After two years helping with cooking and cleaning in people’s houses, he came to realise that, in order to access education and employment, he had to apply for asylum.Torture victim unlawfully detained by Home Office speaks outHome Office keeping torture victims in detention, finds watchdogAsylum seeker detained for half a decade released to homelessnessAwais, at this point aged 20, was invited to a Home Office interview, where he was asked to recount experiences he had learned to bury. After several hours, he was shocked to discover that he was being detained.He was held in the detention for 13 days, during which a doctor prescribed him medication to relieve flashbacks to the abuse he had suffered as a child. It has since transpired that Awais’s detention was unlawful – forcing the Home Office to pay him £10,000 in compensation.“I struggled to sleep in the night time,” he remembers. “It was like being in the house again. Sometimes I would sleep for five or six hours in the morning, but at night it was a big problem. I\u0026nbspwanted to forget the past – but I couldn’t.”Awais\u0026nbspwas released from\u0026nbspHarmondsworth\u0026nbspfollowing intervention from his solicitor. A medical report was carried out into his physical and mental health which found that he was suffering from\u0026nbspPTSD\u0026nbspand depression, which would both “worsen significantly” were he to be threatened with return to his country of origin.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailIt also found that during his childhood he had been a victim of\u0026nbspbeatings,\u0026nbsplabour exploitation and child sexual abuse.Home Office to pay £25,000 in damages for unlawful deportation attemptOn the basis of the medical report, his solicitor had referred him to the National Referral Mechanism (NRM), the Home Office’s official framework for identifying victims of modern slavery. The system aims to decide on cases within 49 days – but in Awais’s case took a year to confirm that he was a victim. During this time he was\u0026nbspmoved into asylum accommodation in Newcastle, where he was able to study English at college for two years. When this period ended though, he was left in a rut for two years, unable to work and left to wallow in the fear that his asylum claim would be refused.“It was good when I was going to\u0026nbspcollege because I was busy. But after two years they said I had to stop, and then I just stayed all day at home,” Awais says, quietly. “You don’t know where your life is. You spend all day at home. You wake up in the morning, same day, same thing. I couldn’t do anything.”The year after a decision was made on his modern slavery case, he was invited to another asylum interview at the Home Office. “They asked me what would happen if I was sent back to Pakistan or Afghanistan,” he remembers. “I said I don’t know, maybe they’d kill me maybe I would kill myself. I said … maybe if I go there they will make me work and beat me. They wrote it down.”Yet Awais was refused asylum in May 2019, with the Home Office saying that it had been decided he should instead be granted temporary leave to remain for 30 months. His solicitor intervened, and in August of that year an immigration judge overturned the decision, stating that it was unlawful to reject his asylum claim.When asked about Awais’s immigration case, the\u0026nbspHome Office\u0026nbspsaid it did not routinely comment on inidual cases, but said that being referred to the NRM did not automatically result in asylum being granted or refused if an asylum claim has been made.Gabor Nagy of Duncan Lewis Solicitors, who represented Awais, says the Home Office claimed to\u0026nbsptreat victims of trafficking as a priority in relation to their asylum claims, but that he was seeing a growing number of cases – such as that of Awais – where, despite identifying people have suffered abuse, the department continue to question and delay their right to be granted protection and support in the UK.“The whole process from start to finish took the Home Office an unacceptable five years while my client was left in limbo with his severe PTSD. The waiting around has affected him so much that he still required counselling and psychological intervention long after he had been granted refugee status in the UK,” he adds.Mr Nagy also accused the Home Office of “disregarding” the medical report and for granting Awais “tenuous” discretionary leave when in fact the immigration judge had found him to be a refugee.With his newly granted refugee status, Awais\u0026nbsphopes to finally move on from the past and establish a happier life for himself.“It’s taken five years – in 2014\u0026nbspI claimed asylum, in 2019 I got my status. It was a long wait. You don’t know where your life is,”\u0026nbspsays the 24-year-old, looking down at the floor. Then he looks up again:\u0026nbsp”But now it\u0026nbspis better than before. Every day brings something new. I want to start working. I want to\u0026nbsponly look towards my\u0026nbspfuture, not my past. I’m hopeful for the future.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

I’m not sure European leaders, let alone leaders here in the UK would actually welcome that kind of language.”Renewed calls for Scottish independence follow UK’s departure from EUIn response to accusations there was no plan for Scotland, Mr Raab added: “I don’t think that’s right, we want to make sure, with the levelling-up agenda, with the opportunities of Brexit right across the board, that Scotland’s got the great opportunity to take advantage of all those benefits.“At the same time, we obviously expect the SNP to deliver on its commitment to honour the outcome of the independence referendum and not keep coming back and asking for a second one.“But a lot of this is a distraction from the standards in schools, the high level of taxes, that actually the job of the Scottish government in discharging its responsibility to the Scottish people ought to be focused on.”The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Expect independence to surgeThousands march to demand Scottish independenceOn Friday, Nicola Sturgeon, the SNP leader, who has been demanding Boris Johnson grant the Scottish government the powers to hold a second independence referendum, said Brexit was a “profound moment of sadness” for many who did not vote to Leave in Scotland.The comments from Mr Tusk come after a YouGov poll which showed 51 per cent support for independence – a majority for the first time in five years.However, a majority of Scots surveyed also said they would not like to see another vote on the issue in 2020 or 2021, but most said they would like to see another referendum within the next five years.Also speaking on the issue, Labour’s shadow chancellor,\u0026nbspJohn McDonnell, told the BBC: “I desperately don’t want them to, I want a United Kingdom. I will always argue for that UK and I’m hoping they don’t go along that path.“But I just say to Boris Johnson and his colleagues, do not do things that will threaten the unity of our country – and the language that we’ve heard even in the last 24 hours is isive, rather than holding the country together.“And if he can’t secure a good deal, it will again encourage others therefore in Scotland to go their own way and I think it would be completely counterproductive for the Scottish people.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

But it appeared to be hit by outages and issues, apparently delaying and perhaps undermining the process.The Iowa caucuses are the first time voters have input into choosing the Democratic candidate for president, who will stand for election later this year. The process is already somewhat complicated, requiring a series of votes in different places across Iowa and beyond.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe app issues brought further confusion and meant that the party was unable to declare a winner hours after the results were expected.An Iowa Democratic Party official pointed to inconsistencies in the reporting of the results and said quality control efforts were holding up the results as voters had their first input in the process to determine the party\u0027s presidential candidate.Created with Sketch.World news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Sri Lanka\u0027s military march with national flags during the 72nd independence day ceremony, in ColomboRefugees and migrants confront riot police during a demonstration outside the Kara Tepe camp, on the island of Lesbos, Greece, February 3, 2020An Iraqi demonstrator sits amid burning tires blocking a road during ongoing anti-government protests in Najaf, IraqHorses panic as a spot fire runs through the property of Lawrence and Clair Cowie near Canberra, Australia.

The entire Democratic PartyGlitches with a new mobile app caused confusion, they said, and some caucus organisers were forced to call in results for the state party to record manually, introducing human error and delays.Des Moines County Democratic chair Tom Courtney said he heard that in precincts across his county, including his own, the mobile app was a mess.Precinct leaders were instead phoning in their results to the Democratic Party headquarters, and they weren\u0027t answering the phones, Mr Courtney said.The problems were an embarrassment for a state that has long sought to protect its prized status as the first contest in presidential primaries and the nation\u0027s first vetter of candidates.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Officials were left using photos of results to validate results and ensure accuracy.Jonathan Green, who chaired a precinct in Lone Tree, said that when he tried to put the results into the reporting app, he kept getting a confusing error message: Unknown protocol. The address specifies a protocol (e.g., wxyz:??.) the browser does not recognise, so the browser cannot properly connect to the site.He said he ultimately gave up and tried to call in the results to the party.Like others, he was put on hold for an extended period of time.In the end, it took hours to report results from his small site, he said.The slowdown was exacerbated by the fact that the party was for the first time attempting to report three different sets of data, an initial headcount of each candidates\u0027 support, a count after supporters had realigned, and the state delegate winners.We found inconsistencies in the reporting of three sets of results, the party said in a statement.This is simply a reporting issue, the app did not go down and this is not a hack or an intrusion.The underlying data and paper trail is sound and will simply take time to further report the results.President Donald Trump\u0027s campaign quickly seized on the issue to sow doubt about the validity of the results.Quality control  rigged? Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale tweeted Monday evening, adding a emoji with furrowed brows.Additional reporting by agenciesShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

It will also screen Chinese and Hong Kong passport holders and people showing flu-like symptoms.\u0026nbspThe decision comes as thousands of\u0026nbsppassengers and crew on a US-operated cruise ship are tested for the coronavirus\u0026nbspin Japan after one passenger was found to have contracted the virus.Japanese health officials are\u0026nbspconducting extensive medical checks on all 3,700 passengers and crew of a cruise ship that returned to the country after one passenger tested positive for the new coronavirus.\u0026nbspA number of people on board are ill, officials have said,\u0026nbspthough no one else has yet tested positive for the fast-spreading virus.\u0026nbspThe US-operated Diamond Princess returned to a port in Yokohama, near Tokyo, late on Monday, ending a 14-day tour during which it stopped at Hong Kong and several other Asian ports before returning to Japan.\u0026nbspJapanese government and tour company officials say they were notified by Hong Kong that an 80-year-old male passenger who got off the boat on the island tested positive for the virus.A coronavirus vaccine is a long way off, a health expert has warned.\u0026nbspSuch a vaccine will not be ready in time for the current outbreak said David Heymann, professor of Infectious Disease Epidemiology, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.\u0026nbspA vaccine is a long way off, Prof Heymann told a briefing at Chatham House in London. There will not be a vaccine probably to deal with this outbreak, but there is work being done on coronavirus vaccines in general. I\u0027m confident that there will one day be a coronavirus vaccine.\u0026nbspHe continued: Sars caused major outbreaks when it was exported from China, major hospital outbreaks - that hasn\u0027t yet happened in this outbreak, this disease so that\u0027s one point to compare.That\u0027s not to say it won\u0027t happen in the future but it hasn\u0027t happened yet. The world is much more prepared to deal with these things now than it was then.More than 100 Malaysians have been quarantined after being evacuated from Wuhan.An AirAsia plane carrying 107 Malaysians and their non-Malaysian\u0026nbspspouses and children landed at the Kuala Lumpur airport early on Tuesday.They immediately underwent medical screenings, and the National Disaster Management Agency said two people who did not pass the screenings were immediately taken to the hospital.Medical workers in Hong Kong have gone on strike for a second day to demand the border with mainland China is shut completely in an attempt to limit the spread of the coronavirus.\u0026nbspAll but two of Hong Kong\u0027s land and sea crossings with the mainland were closed at midnight after more than 2,000 hospital workers went on strike on Monday.\u0026nbspBut on Tuesday, health authorities reported two additional patients without any known travel to the virus epicenter, bringing the number of locally-transmitted cases up to four.\u0026nbspAccording to the Hospital Authority Employees\u0027 Alliance, the strike organizer, more than 7,000 members joined the strike to demand closure of the border across which tens of thousands of people continue to travel daily.Britain\u0027s National Union of Students has said it is concerned about reports of Chinese students experiencing discrimination and hate amid the coronavirus outbreak.\u0026nbspErica Ramos, from the NUS, said: The NUS believes that all forms of hate and prejudice are unacceptable and shall continue to support students’ unions on any issues they may face around hate crime and xenophobia.\u0026nbspWe have a continued responsibility to ensure our spaces are inclusive and accessible to all students, any student facing these issues should get in touch with their student’s union.”\u0026nbspMalaysia has reported its first citizen to be infected with the coronavirus, bringing the total number of confirmed cases in the country to 10.\u0026nbspHealth authorities said the 41-year-old Malaysian had travelled to Singapore for a meeting last month with colleagues from China, including one from Wuhan, the epicentre of the epidemic.\u0026nbspHe only showed symptoms on 29 January, nearly a week after returning to Malaysia.More coronavirus cases are expected in the UK, the health secretary has said.\u0026nbspSpeaking before a meeting with Germany\u0027s health minister, Jens Spahn, Matt Hancock said the UK was working with other countries to research a vaccine.\u0026nbspWe haven\u0027t seen the peak of the coronavirus by a long stretch and we expect more cases in the UK, he said.We have a full plan in place to treat all those who have symptoms and test positively for coronavirus and we are working with international partners both to slow the spread and also to do the research that we need to do to find a vaccine.\u0026nbspMr Spahn said no matter the future relationship between the UK and EU it was important they continue to co-operate.He added: The virus obviously knows no borders and is a threat to all our citizens. What\u0027s important for the international community is actually to join forces when it comes to research, when it comes to detecting the virus and combating it.\u0026nbspWhatever might happen for the future between the EU and UK I find it important that there is good co-operation.Singapore has announced its first local coronavirus transmission, with six more cases being reported.\u0026nbspFour of those were local transmissions, linked to a health products shop that primarily serves Chinese tourists, the country\u0027s health ministry said.\u0026nbspThe other two were Singapore residents evacuated from Wuhan on Thursday.\u0026nbspThough four of these cases constitute a local transmission cluster, there is as yet no evidence of widespread sustained community transmission in Singapore, the ministry said in a statement.\u0026nbspIt takes the country\u0027s total number of infections to 24.On Monday,\u0026nbspChina accused the US\u0026nbspof spreading fear by pulling its citizens out and severely restricting travel.Washington has unceasingly manufactured and spread panic, said Hua Chunying, spokeswoman for the Foreign Ministry, noting\u0026nbsp the WHO had advised against trade and travel curbs.It is precisely developed countries like the United States with strong epidemic prevention capabilities and facilities that have taken the lead in imposing excessive restrictions contrary to WHO recommendations, she said.\u0026nbspThe US\u0026nbspCentres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) defended the measures taken by the US, including suspending the entry of foreign nationals who had visited China within the past 14 days.New coronavirus cases have been reported in the US, including a patient in California infected through close contact with someone in the same household who had been infected in China.It was the second instance of person-to-person spread in the US after a case reported last week in Illinois.We expect to see more cases of person-to-person spread, said Dr Nancy Messonnier, director of the National Center for Immunisation and Respiratory Diseases at the US\u0026nbspCentres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).Six new cases of coronavirus have been reported in Thailand, including four Thai nationals, the country\u0027s health ministry has announced.\u0026nbspThe four Thai people included a couple who had visited Japan and two drivers who had picked up Chinese passengers in Thailand, the ministry said.Vietnam has assigned the military to quarantine 950 Vietnamese returning from China at two military camps outside Hanoi for at least 14 days,\u0026nbspthe official Voice of Vietnam Radio reported.\u0026nbspDuring the time of quarantine, anyone of them showing symptoms of fever will be transferred to a hospital for treatment, the report cited Nguyen Viet Thang, Hanoi\u0027s military chief medic as saying.The total number of coronavirus infections in China rose by 3,235 to 20,438, and there were at least 151 cases in 23 other countries and regions.\u0026nbspThe World Health Organisation (WHO) has declared the flu-like virus a global emergency.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Anti-Brexit comedian Nish Kumar hosted the Horrible Histories “special” song on CBBC, branded on Twitter as “British things . . . turns out there’s hardly any”.Its desperately unfunny attempt to present a “woke“ version of history by sending up the Royal Family while highlighting the slave trade was little more than thinly-veiled propaganda.It is grotesque that children should be subjected to such brainwashing.BRITS stranded in snake flu-ridden China have been going through hell.So it’s bizarre that our man in Wuhan had flown back home just as the deadly epidemic swept through the area.Consul Gareth Hoar apparently boarded a plane hours before the city went into lockdown when it should have been blindingly obvious that an emergency was developing.So which bungler thought it was a good idea to let the consul come home before stranded Britons Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Brexit parties were held from Cornwall to Cumbria.Parliament Square was awash with Union Jacks as Nigel Farage had a beano that he had been planning for  years, chucking a metaphorical milkshake over everyone who ever dissed him.But this was not VE Day.Where Brexit was celebrated, the mood was one of patriotic pride rather than euphoria unbound.This was a very British departure — respectful, self-effacing and anxious not to cause offence.We refrained from sticking up two fingers. We were scrupulously polite.The UK started le outside the EU with no Big Ben ringing the chimes of freedom, no firework display setting the post-Brexit sky ablaze, no laser show on the white clfs of Dover.The big moment came at pm rather than midnight — the UK, now as always, a little out of step with our continental cousins in Brussels — so it did not even feel like New Year’s Eve.By midnight — already am in sleepy old Brussels — the party was winding down.As we left the EU, Downing Street lit up with red, white and blue lasers and an image of Big Ben, complete with a recording of the bongs.But the door of  Downing Street stayed firmly shut as the Prime Minister hosted a private party for staff.For all the nation knew, Boris could have been having an early night with Carrie and Dilyn the dog.Downing Street was as deserted as the Marie Celeste.Here was the strangest thing about Friday night — the total absence of Boris Johnson.The PM had recorded a speech full of optimistic talk about making Brexit a “storming success” and bringing the nation back together.But the BBC and ITV both refused to broadcast the speech, as Downing Street aides had refused to let them film it.Soyou wanted to see what the British Prime Minister said about this truly momentous moment in British history, you could not have seen it on our state broadcaster’s channels. UNBELIEVABLE.The BBC news studio was bathed in Brussels blue, asin mourning — so censoring Boris felt small-minded, ­churlish and petty beyond belief.I strongly suspect that ­refusing to broadcast Boris’s big Brexit-night speech will turn out to be the beginning of the end for the licence fee.If the BBC cannot look like a state broadcaster on a night of historic national importance, then it never will.But we didn’t need the Beeb to tell us that this was history happening before our eyes.The biggest mandate for anything in British history had FINALLY been honoured. Democracy had triumphed.After more than  years inside the European federalist experiment, the British people were masters of their own destiny once more. And while the national mood on Friday night was respectful for the feelings of the losers, perhaps that was because there is no need for ­triumphalism when you know you have won.The clock struck pm and Leavers and Remainers were all suddenly extinct.All those eye-swivelling nutjobs threatening to shove a Brexit p coin up their pious rectums in protest no longer seemed like a threat to ­democracy.They seemed worthy of pity.But after all the toxic ­isions of the past four years, the wounds will not heal quickly.The most vicious insult thrown at those of us who dared to vote to leave the EU was that we would all soon be dead. And so it is a bitter irony to reflect that Tony Blair, Michael Heseltine, John Major, Lord Adonis, Gina Miller, Anna Soubry and all the rest will never live long enough to drag us back into the European Union.At long last, Brexit’s uncivil war is done.And why Because the roots of British democracy run deep.Once we had voted to leave, it was ultimately unthinkable that we would ever remain — despite the fervent wishes of almost the entire British establishment, from the House of Lords and House of Commons to the civil service, the BBC and big business.Once the people had spoken, in the end they had to be obeyed.No parliamentary paralysis could ever stop Brexit. No clever lawyers could thwart it forever.That historic moment on Friday night felt it had an historic inevitability about it.British democracy could not be denied. How did the arrogant, out-of-touch establishment ever imagine they could overrule the largest vote for anything in our history So au revoir, monsieur, and adios, senor and bye-bye, mein liebe herr. Except — we are not leaving Europe, are we We are only leaving the European Union — that unloved, corrupt, expansionist empire.And the British people have nothing but love in their souls for Europe.Here’s the great Brexit irony. The British are probably the most pro-European nation on the continent. We revere European culture, drink their wine, holiday at their beaches, cities and moun-tains, eat their fruit, vegetables and cheese and buy their cars.But the British have always been a lousy fit in the EU.We do not like having leaders who we cannot kick out.We do not enjoy unelected old geezers in foreign cities telling us who can and can’t come into our country.We — one of the oldest democracies in the world, a country that has not been invaded for , years — truly do not need anyone  to make our laws or to tell us what justice looks like.The EU just lost its second-largest contributor while the largest contributor — Germany — teeters on the edge of recession.We should try to be understandingthey sound bitter.Our stormy relationship with the EU has lasted all my adult le.The first time I ever voted was in the  referendum, when I girded my flared jeans and enthusiastically voted “Yes to Europe”.But like my nation, over the course of the decades I fell out of love with the EU.Like my nation, I began to feel that I had been lied to about what the project really meant.Like my nation — and around .million of my countrymen in  — the thought of “ever greater union” made my skin crawl. For I believed with all my heart and soul that my great nation’s identity is worth preserving.Leo Varadkar, the Irish premier, sneers that the UK must “come to terms with the fact that it is now a small country”.Leo’s line is that the UK is now an isolated little rain-lashed rock, cowering timidly off the coast of the mighty European Union empire.But it doesn’t feel like we are a small nation today.It feels like we are a global nation once again, open for business with the world.It feels like we are the world’s sixth-largest economy, a cultural superpower, a warrior nation with a nuclear deterrent and the best armed forces in the world, the oldest parliamentary democracy on the planet and the longest-reigning monarch in history.All of that, plus the new added ingredient of post-Brexit va-va-voom.And in a Europe blighted by fragile coalitions and leaders with feet of blancmange, the UK boasts a popular Prime Minister presiding over the strongest, most stable government in Europe.British democracy has a far longer history than the European Union.If we were a small nation, then we would never have had the guts to leave the EU.If we were a small nation, then after the EU referendum of , we would have done what all those other EU countries did when they came up with a referendum result that Brussels didn’t like.We would have voted again, until Michel Barnier put down his cane.But the UK was always dferent.Unlike so many of our neighbours, we have not known the terror of fascism and communism, we have never experienced the jackboots of an invading army on our land, we have never seen our country chopped up by cruel foreign conquerors.We are a small nation in size but, through the centuries, we have always proved too big to bully.And what now The extremist voices — on both sides of the Brexit debate — will fade away because extremism is never the British way.Even with a year of transition and haggling about trade ahead, Brexit feels like it is slipping into the history books.The EU referendum in the summer of  seems long ago now.But as I recall, all we ever wanted was for our country to be a self-governing, sovereign nation once more and to restore the freedoms bought with the sacrice of the generations who came before us.Big Ben was silent on Friday night, but did you hear the church bells ring in all the faraway towns That is the sound of a country that just got its mojo back.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Aligning with Europe on everything would entirely defeat the point of Brexit.But they hoped that by showing some muscle, they could make the PM quake with fear and give them the upper hand.It was a woeful miscalculation.Unlike his predecessor, Mr Johnson believes in the UK whole-heartedly.

So theyre angry, theyre likely to lash out.“When you look at the detail of these last two attacks, its  not organised. Its about flailing about with anger.”One in seven of the convicted terrorists released since  had their sentences reduced or were freed through the early release system.But Dr Stott says that in some cases, prison is strengthening radical views.“With the networks within prisons like-minded people can associate together and reinforce those views,” he says.“We saw that during the conflict in Northern Ireland and I think were clearly seeing it again, with the jihadi prisoners. They are providing mutual support for one another in prison so theyre not being reformed.”But he says terrorists like Amman are acting alone, with no backing from formal organisations.Its a dferent type of terrorism from what we might have seen in earlier decades where its much more centrally directed.

He has since been sacked.The convicted terrorists and extremists back walking our streets could soon be joined by a new wave of dangerous characters.Other jihadi lags are expected to be released from prison on licence in upcoming months - including Sheffield con Khalil Maher, , who tried to secretly travel to Syria to join the Islamic State.Maher - who was arrested at Heathrow Airport - was jailed for five years, four months, in November , but is understood to be due out of prison later this month after serving just half his sentence.And Sunderland shopkeeper Mohammed Zahir Khan, , is thought to be due for release in the next few months, too - despite being jailed for more than four years in May  for posting support for ISIS online.Sundays Streatham attack has shone a light on the UKs automatic early release laws - which have been slammed for leaving our neighbourhoods unsafe and allowing jihadists to ignite terror across the nation.ButPM Boris Johnson gets his way, the waves of convicted terrorists ing to the streets could soon become trickles, or nothing at all.Vowing to crack down on the early release of terrorist prisoners, Mr Johnson said today: I think the question that everybody has about the inidual concerned [in the Streatham attack] is, what was he doing out on automatic early release, and why was there no system of scrutiny, no parole system, to check whether he was really a suitable candidate for automatic early release.And that is a very complex legal question. We do think its time to take action.I hope people understand that the anomaly we need to clear up is the process by which some people are still coming out under automatic early release without any kind of scrutiny or parole system.UNDER British law, criminals serving a determinate – or fixed – sentence of less than four years are automatically released from prison halfway through their term.They then spend the remaining half of their sentence on licence, during which they must adhere to certain conditions like good behaviour and staying in touch with their probation officer.This has been the case since , when the provisions of the  Criminal Justice Act were implemented.Lags serving a determinate sentence of more than four years can also be released at the halfway point, but this doesnt happen automatically - a parole board must agree to it.In the cases of those serving an indeterminate - non-fixed - or le sentence, the UK Government has to apply for parole on the prisoners behalf.The intention of early release is to rehabilitate prisoners in the community while managing the populations inside Britain’s overcrowded prisons.However, recent atrocities, including the Streatham stabbing yesterday afternoon and the deadly London Bridge attack in November, have raised questions about the rules.Streatham attacker Sudesh Amman had been released on licence last month, and is reported to have been living in a bail hostel in south London, with an electronic tag fitted.It is also understood he was under -hour police surveillance – something that comes at a huge cost. One retired police detective said yesterday it takes a team of  officers to carry out round-the-clock surveillance on an inidual target.Meanwhile, London Bridge attacker Usman Khan was a convicted terrorist who was on probation after being freed halfway through his sentence under automatic early release rules.In the wake of the November attack, the Government proposed a raft of changes, including scrapping early release for offenders classed as dangerous, giving those convicted of serious crimes like preparing acts of terrorism a minimum of  years behind bars, and forcing dangerous terrorists who receive extended determinate sentences to serve the whole time in prison.Under the Counter TerrorismBill, offenders not classed as dangerous would also be expected to serve two thirds of their sentences – rather than just half – while the number of counter-terrorism probation officers would be doubled.Today, PM Boris Johnson made a fresh vow to crack down on the early release of terrorist prisoners following the Streatham kne rampage – although it’s not clear how any changes would be applied to existing cases.We are bringing forward legislation to stop the system of automatic early release. The dficulty is how to apply retrospectively to the cohort of people who currently qualy, said Mr Johnson.It is time to take action to ensure, irrespective of the law we are bringing in, people in the current stream dont qualy automatically for early release.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Look out for that.”So I did, but still can’t isolate the exact moment it arrived at last week’s National Television Awards, on ITV, where the industry had assembled for the th time and, quite possibly, the last as well.If it was the NTA’s farewell, then it’d be a mercy ­killing for an event where shock results have come along about as regularly as Hezbollah ­isions have arrived at the Changing of the Guard.Five years ago, you could’ve bet the house Ant and Dec would claim their th presenting title, and This ­Morning’s Phillip and Holly would milk their tenth consecutive Best Magazine Show hangover, to the point their long-suffering audience were probably feeling homicidal.This year’s only vague surprise being, it transpired, Ant and Dec thought the same way as the viewers, with Dec admitting they: “Feel more and more sick every year.”There was a flip side to all these set-in-stone voting patterns, of course.The NTAs remained the one place on ­television earth where Mrs Brown’s Boys could be relied upon to beat the massively overrated Fleabag.Considering how regimented the actual voting is, though, the far more remarkable thing about the NTAs is that it’s nearly always a shambolic production.Categories come, go, mutate and ide into three drama sections .Some are accompanied by clips . Others, like New Drama, aren’t. It also whores itself out commercially and jumps on every available bandwagon.So David Mitchell trudged on randomly, dressed as Shakespeare, to promote a stage show, and the Impact Award was given to Gavin  Stacey, when it had “Caroline Flack’s bedside lamp” written all over it.A lot of this was down to the fact the NTAs still don’t know their own mind.They want to be both popular and highbrow, which meant poor old Michael Palin was left describing it as “a hotbed of talent”, while the camera went looking for Tess Daly.Through it all , Ant, Dec and This Morning have endured, and it’s possible to have a bit of sympathy for the production, with such stubbornly repetitive voting habits.The NTAs and ITV really are the authors of most of their own misfortune here, though.Insecure television networks need a Best Magazine category, TV awards don’t.Nor do they need a Best Judge, which was the section that eventually lumbered them with four-times winner David Walliams, the trouserless host — a man whose world begins and ends with himself and, when required to do something , like pay tribute to Nicholas Parsons, performs it with all the sincerity of a “mind the gap” announcement.As luck would have it, however, two very obvious solutions to the hosting problem presented themselves in the audience, on Tuesday.One was Ricky Gervais, who probably wouldn’t do it.The other, in about row , was Bradley Walsh, who stole the entire show by virtue of winning and saying nothing, but pulling all the right faces.Bradley would be the most obvious fit in the event’s history and I’m sure it would be warmly welcomed by most people,only the National Television Awards were worth saving.THREE and a half meandering years it took us to reach Friday night’s pm Brexit countdown.Yet in all that time I can’t remember one occasion when British TV’s satirical shows actually had something laugh-out-loud funny to say on the subject.That’s almost certainly because Have I Got News For You, The Last Leg, The Mash Report and Frankie Boyle’s New World Order all decided their left-of-centre anti-Brexit opinion was far more important than mere comedy.The wonderful irony is that the collective fury and bile has definitely had an effect.It’s made a minor star out of Geoff Norcott, one of those very rare comedians who’s not just a Conservative Leaver, he’s actually likeable as well.As the token voice of Brexit, Channel  and the BBC, very grudgingly, have had to include Geoff on almost every comedy show, including The Last Leg: Countdown To Brexit, where they’ve been trying and failing to screw a laugh out of Adam Hills’ beard for months now.I gave up on the latest attempt after about half an hour, which meant I was still looking for a show to make sense of Britain’s relationship with Europe and had only two reasonable options available, as the clock ticked down to pm.One was calm, sober analysis from the BBC, the other was ITV+’s screening of Love Island.Obviously, I took the more credible option and discovered men in lederhosen were flinging jugs of beer at scantily clad Frauleins while the commentator explained: “We sent a runner to buy strap-on harnesses and stuff poles on them.“The girls’ job is to toss pretzels at the boys and the couple with the least amount of pretzels on their pole at the end is out.”MAN Like Mobeen Man don’t like Mobeen.THE dressing-up box brigade lulled me into a  sense of security, at Sunday night’s Baftas, on BBC.True, host Graham Norton made sure there was an undercurrent of hostility to “white men” , from the start, and there was all the usual self-aggrandising flannel about “giving a voice to the voiceless”.But Andy “Gollum” Serkis made a two-minute -second speech, accepting his Outstanding Contribution award, that was so beautully judged it seemed to pacy them for nearly an hour and a half.Then Rebel Wilsonjoked that it was only sexism that stopped her joining Martin Scorsese and Sam Mendes in the Best Director category and it was like she’d flipped a switch on the entire room.Suddenly, Joaquin Phoenix was agonising about “systemic racism” and Prince William was lecturing everyone about “ersity” without the entire Royal Albert Hall gasping at his brass neck.Then, just when I thought it couldn’t get worse, up popped Hugh Grant to announce he was so impressed with the Best Film contenders His Lordship had actually condescended to vote for one of them, which I’m assuming lost.For a couple of seconds at least, though, it really was possible to think, “Maybe the National TV Awards weren’t so bad, after all.”WINTERWATCH, prediction of the week, Iolo Williams to Chris Packham: “In ten years’ time, we’ll probably have penduline tits.”Arthritic groins, Spacehopper-sized prostates and chronic flatulence.Further to last week’s allegations, Good Morning Britain weather girl Laura Tobin says: “I do not crave attention. I like to have attention for my work, good climate change stories and Nasa trips.”As I noticed myself, when I saw Laura appear in Tipping Point: Lucky Stars, Drive, with Vernon Kay, Pointless Celebrities and Sharknado : Global Swarming.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Labouraposs long road back to power after the  election disaster arguably began here in Sedgefield. Margaret Thatcher scooped a -seat majority and Michael Footaposs No dreams were shattered. But in Sedgefield, County Durham, voters elected Tony Blair their MP for the first time. Eleven years later he became Labour leader and in  he marched the party back into government after  years in the wilderness.  After three general election victories and a decade in Downing Street, he quit undefeated as Prime Minister. But  years after he left Parliament, his former stronghold is held by the Conservatives – one of the Red Wall bricks which crumbled on December . His key ally, Phil Wilson, won his friendaposs old seat in  and was MP until last yearaposs general election where Boris Johnson netted an -seat majority. Mr Wilson admitted: “Voters didnapost like Jeremy Corbyn and they felt betrayed by what we had become.” The former union activist was one of the local Labour members who spotted Mr Blairaposs potential in the early s.  He believes Labour has been exiled from office because it failed to keep up with voters. “I have got nothing against the world changing but for the Labour Party to keep up with it itaposs got to change too with the times,” warned Mr Wilson. “Tony Blair knew the Labour Party had to changeit was ever to get elected again. “You donapost have to agree with everything he did, but why have you go to diss his reputation  “I would have thought you would be proud of the fact we were in power for  years and achieved things from the minimum wage to all the investment in the health service, to keeping the Tories out of power for the longest period since the  Century. “But we vily him.” He added: “What is the point of principle without power ” Labouraposs grip on Sedgefield lasted  years from  until December. When Mr Blair became PM in , he won the constituency with a , majority. He welcomed US President George Bush to the town of Sedgefield in November , eight months after the then PM controversially sent British troops into Iraq alongside their American comrades. The pair tucked into fish and chips at the Dun Cow Inn, Mr Blairaposs favourite pub.The dish cost £. in  and is £. today. The former Labour leaderaposs majorities in Sedgefield at six general elections averaged ,. Critics believe his closeness to Bush and the Iraq War alienated his support base, ultimately propelling Mr Corbyn into the top job. But Mr Wilson said: “If it hadnapost have been Iraq, for people like Jeremy Corbyn it would have been something . “Apparently itaposs the whole neo-liberal approach to the economy, whatever that means.” Mr Wilson won an , majority in  and averaged , over three general elections. In  his majority was , but in December Tory Paul Howell won the constituency with a , majority on a .% swing. Mr Wilson was not surprised at losing in , having expected defeat two years earlier. “We were picking up on the doorsteps even before  that it was the state of the Labour Party, the leadership, Jeremy Corbyn and his world view,” he said.  “A lot of us thought we were going to get a real drubbing.” He blamed the leadership rather than Brexit for Labouraposs thumping defeat two years later. “For every one person we got on Brexit, youaposd get four or five people who just didnapost like Jeremy Corbyn,” he said. “It would be that he was too left-wing, a communist, he doesnapost like this country – they saw him as being associated with terrorists. “Then we had the wish list otherwise known as the Labour manesto. “I would get up in the morning, put the radio on and there would be another pledge.  “It got to the point where I just used to laugh, shake my head and turn the radio off because I was thinking, aposThis is just crazy, you canapost go on like thisapos. “We werenapost realistic. “I got the impression with the manesto that somebody was sitting in a room with a pen and paper and there was a queue of interest groups at the door that came in one at a time and they were asked what they wanted and that was just put in the manesto.” Voters were more “economically literate” than the party hierarchy, he claimed. “They knew two and two didnapost make five, but the Labour Party seemed to think it did.” AskedLabour deserved to lose, he replied: “Yes”, adding: “But Boris Johnson didnapost deserve to win.” He went on: “What upsets me the most is that people who are normally our supporters didnapost feel they could vote for us. “People had made their minds up that Labour was not serious about winning anymore.” Voters turned away from the party because they “no longer thought it was for them”. “There was a perception where people thought the party was nasty,” he said. “People always thought the Tory Party was nasty, but now it was us.” Voters did not believe the party was patriotic, he added.  “Thereaposs nothing wrong in being proud of your country,” said Mr Wilson. “But it was asthe leadership didnapost realise the first principle of any government is to defend the country and its people, and people didnapost think we would do that. “People thought we fraternised more with our foes than with our friends.” He identied Ed Milibandaposs  leadership victory as the moment it “all started to go wrong” for Labour – and accused the current hierarchy of failing to understand aspiration. “When I was  my dad said to me, aposYou can do whatever you want, son, but youaposre not going down the pitapos,” he said. “He worked down the pit best part of  years. What he wanted was better for me than he had himself. “The bedrock of Labour politics is aspiration – to improve the lot of working people. “If you donapost keep up with their aspirations you get left behind. “People talk about left behind communities – itaposs not the communities that are left behind, itaposs the Labour Party.” Brexit also fuelled the  result – and Mr Wilson was the architect of a plan to trigger a second referendum. He was behind a bid to push a Withdrawal Agreement through the Commons, as long as there was another EU referendum. The idea was voters would choose between an exit deal or Remain.  Mr Wilson was accused of delaying Brexit, but he told the Mirror: “Everybody knows Iaposm a Remainer, I canapost deny that, why should I  “But we needed to bring it to a resolution and the best way to do that was to involve the British people.” Stressing voters should have been able to compare the Withdrawal Deal with Leave campaignersapos  boasts, he added: “I wanted to get Brexit over.” Labouraposs next leader needs to distance themselves from five years of Corbynism, he believes. He said: “The first question the electorate will ask is, aposIs this Labour Party completely dferent from the one that Jeremy Corbyn led apos “If they still believe it is in anyway connected with Jeremy Corbyn, we will still have a problem at the ballot box.” At the Golden Lion pub in Sedgefield locals were split over Labour at the general election. But regulars celebrated Brexit with a party on Friday night. Barmaid Joanne Coulter, , stuck with Jeremy Corbynaposs party despite Labour wanting another referendum.  She said: “I voted Out but Iaposve always voted Labour. “My family have always voted Labour – working people round here vote Labour.” However, her pal Carrie Mekins, , a mental health nurse, said: “Iaposve always voted Labour since I was  because itaposs a working party for the working people, and thataposs just what you voted.  “But I voted Conservative this time because Boris wanted to Leave. “Labouraposs core values are for the working people, but this time Brexit was more important. “Labour wanted to do it all again with another referendum. “I wouldnapost say I aposlentapos my vote to the Conservatives, but Leave is what I voted for.” Blasting the delay to departing the EU, she added: “When you vote it is a democracy, we shouldnapost have to wait all these years for it to come about.” In Newton Ayclfe town centre today, morning shoppers were ided on Labour. Barbara Haslin, , who worked in a mental health hospital, normally votes Labour but switched to the Tories in December.  She said: “I thought Boris was going to get more done, he made a lot of sense – even though he is a bit of an idiot – and he had to be given a chance. “I just hope he doesnapost forget the North East. “I didnapost like Jeremy Corbyn, I just didnapost – the way he comes across, I just donapost like the man.” Andy Bayne, , an ex-Royal Marine, voted Labour up to and including the  general election under Tony Blair. But he he has not voted since.  The Brexiteer said: “Blair came out with all these promises, he was going to do this and that, but he didnapost care about us, all he cared about was making money – and he has done. “I have no trust in any politician any more. “Jeremy Corbyn was just the same as Blair – a liar. “ButI see some changes I could vote Labour again. I would like to see ex-Forcesapos men get a fair deal.” Julie-Ann Atkinson, , a full-time mum, has always voted Tory and backed Leave in . “My dad was in the Army so he doesnapost vote Labour, none of us do,” she said.  “The Tories are there for the normal people, not just making the rich richer. “Jeremy Corbyn was filling peopleaposs heads full of rubbish, making promises he couldnapost keep. “He wasnapost going with what people voted for over Brexit, he was trying to prolong Brexit.” Harry March, , who worked in a coal mine and power stations, voted Tory in neighbouring Bishop Auckland, helping Conservative Dehenna Davison oust Labouraposs Helen Goodman.

Mr Gove once stood on a picket line in solidarity with his fellow reporters. But questioned by BBC Radio  Live, he would not sayhe would have backed yesterdayaposs boycott. A clearly uncomfortable Mr Gove said: I wasnapost in the room at the time so I wonapost pass judgment until, of course, Iaposve heard from all the people who were.The UKaposs top civil servant was today urged to investigate the deeply disturbing decision to order senior journalists from some of the UKaposs major news organisations - including the Daily Mirror - to leave before a civil service briefing on Boris Johnsonaposs Brexit plans. Cabinet Secretary Sir Mark Sedwill was told the situation was damaging to democracy by Labour leadership hopeful Sir Keir Starmer, who wrote the letter.Sir Keir warned banning parts of the media risked undermining the integrity of the civil service - and access to the UKaposs chief negotiator should not be determined by political favouritism. Around a dozen journalists from organisations including the Financial Times, the Sun and thehad received an official invitation from Downing Street to attend the briefing with David Frost, Boris Johnsonaposs Europe advisor, on the PMaposs post-Brexit trade plans. But political editors from other publications - who have previously been invited to non-political briefings given by senior civil servants - also turned up. They were granted entry into No. But a security official then read out a list of names for those who were allowed entry to the briefing - with those from left-of-centre outlets forced to stand on one side of the entrance hall. BBC Radio  Live host Nicky Campbell said Mr Goveaposs refusal to answer was not good enough and quoted an piece the Cabinet minister wrote in the s when at the Aberdeen Press and Journal.  It said without truth, democracy dies in darkness and rather like nappies, politicians have to be changed often, and generally for the same reason. Mr Campbell demanded: Would you and Mrs Gove [also a journalist, Sarah Vine] have been the only two there, like Mr and Mrs  He added: Would you have stayed in that room  Flustered Mr Gove replied: Yes. What. No - no I think as I say I wasnapost in the room at the time. Mr Campbell pushed on: The issue is that you and Mrs Gove would have stayed in the room and every single - the BBC, Robert Peston, Laura Kuenssberg, the Mirror, HuffPost, all the political journalists would have left for the briefing - and you and your we would have been the only people there. Mr Gove replied itaposs wrong and sexist to bring my we into it. He added: I try to make it a rule not to pass judgement on disputes or disagreements when I havenapost been present.  Those banned from the briefing, in a move reminiscent of Donald Trumpaposs administration which has tried to exclude journalists from critical organisations, included The Daily Mirror, The i, Huffington Post and the Independent. Mr Johnsonaposs head of communications Lee Cain arrived and told reporters: Those who are invited to the briefing can stay, everyone  Iaposm afraid will have to leave. He added: Weaposre welcome to brief whoever we like. In his letter to the Cabinet Secretary, Sir Keir said: The actions of the Prime Ministeraposs Director of Communications, who is a political appointee, are deeply disturbing.  I am concerned that they have undermined the civil serviceaposs ability to comply with its core values of integrity, objectivity and impartiality. Equally, banning sections of the media from attending important briefings about important matters of Government is damaging to democracy. He said the mediaaposs access to the Prime Ministeraposs chief negotiator should not be determined by political favouritism. I would ask that you investigate urgently this matter and provide assurance that such an incident will not happen again. Ian Murray, executive director of the Society of Editors, said there were very real concerns for press freedom. He said: The Society of Editors commends the collective action of lobby journalists to walk out of the briefing and all eyes are on No  to make a swt turnaround of their decision.

bug on a TUI holiday \" to FREE daily email alerts from Mirror - daily newsSubscribeWe will use your email address only for sending you newsletters. Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailA beautician has sued travel giants TUI for more than £, after she suffered a crippling bout of food poisoning on holiday. Jenner Irvingaposs vile symptoms became so bad at four-star Hotel Les Jardins daposAgadir in Agadir, Morocco, that she needed to use a wheelchair. The -year-old fainted in her hotel room after she was sick on the fth day of her all-inclusive break. A court heard yesterday the masseur and reflexologist remained unwell for a fortnight back home in Hampstead, north London. Judge Jonathan Hand QC, sitting at Central London County Court, ruled against TUI, deciding the food Ms Irving ate at the hotel was the most likely source of her stomach bug. He told the travel firm to pay the woman £, in costs and damages. Of course the court and the experts cannot rule out the possibility of some other cause, he told the court. But it seems to me, mindful that she did not eat outside the hotel, that the fundamental conclusions of the expert remain good. She does not need to prove the cause of the contamination, she simply needs to prove that her symptoms were caused by contaminated food. Taking all the evidence together, it seems that on the balance of probability she has established her case on liability.  Ms Irving ate only at the luxury hotel during the stay in March . She did not swim in the pool or the sea and, although she visited a zoo, had no contact with the animals. On arrival back in the UK, she need to be shuttled off the plane in the wheelchair. Speaking in court, Ms Irving said: I suddenly started feeling really ill and felt like I needed to be sick.  It was like projectile vomit came out of me. One minute I was literally vomiting and the next minute it was diarrhoea so I didnapost know which way to turn. She said her acute symptoms blighted the last two days of the holiday and, particularly, the journey home. I felt sickand before I realised I had fainted and an air hostess was there with some ice, she told the court. A wheelchair was waiting for her at the other end and Ms Irving said the service she received from TUI on the flight home was excellent.

Kate and Gerry McCann are taking legal action against a ruling by the country’s supreme court, reports the Daily Star. The McCanns’ initial action was against former detective Goncalo Amaral, , who led the initial police hunt for Madeleine. He sold a best-selling book which accused the couple of covering up her death, angering the McCanns and their supporters. The couple, both , successfully sued Mr Amaral for injury to reputation arguing his claim Madeleine was dead was hampering their global search for her. But the decision to award them damages and costs totalling £, was overturned on appeal and then ratied by Portugal’s Supreme Court. Now the McCanns are hoping to appeal against that judgement in the European Court Of Human Rights in Strasbourg, France. A judge is to assess their case within the coming months. A spokesman for the European Court of Human Rights said: “Before the end of the year there will be a preliminary examination by the court regarding the admissibility of the application.’’  If the McCanns win the Portuguese Government may be ordered to pay them a cash settlement. A source close to the UK police probe into Madeleine’s disappearance said that could fuel aposresentment’. “The disappearance of Madeleine has already cost Portugal,’’ they said. Tourism was badly affected afterwards.

He was told in September that year he would not face charges.  nThen , he and then-lover Kenney had spent the evening at the the Millennium nightclub in Harlow before inviting locals back to the mansion in the early hours of March , .  nThe Strike It Lucky host left the house after Mr Lubbock was found, and he later told a September  inquest that he felt sick and panicked and ran off after seeing the body.  nLast year, he spoke about Mr Lubbockaposs death, telling Piers Morganaposs ITV show Le Stories that he couldnapost be more sorry for his behaviour that night.  n  n  nThe one-time Royal Variety Performance host insisted he is  per cent innocent.  nBarrymore, now living in west London, sued Essex Police and claimed it was a wrongful arrest that had cost him about £.million in lost earnings, but Court of Appeal judges concluded in August  he would be entitled to only nominal damages.  nHis career as a TV presenter came to an end after Mr Lubbockaposs death, and he recently withdrew from the current series of Dancing on Ice, with the showaposs bosses saying he suffered a broken wrist.  nJonathan Kenney  n  n   nKenney, who worked as a drag queen, was Barrymoreaposs boyfriend at the time of the party almost  years ago.  nHe was also arrested along with Barrymore and Justin Merritt in June .  nThree months later, he was told he would not be charged.  nKenney told police that he and Justin Merritt were in the outdoor hot tub together and they last saw Mr Lubbock alive jumping into the pool and in high spirits.  nHe told detectives that the pair left the hot tub at about .am and then were chatting the master bedroom when Mr Lubbockaposs body was found.  nJustin Merritt  n  n   nMerritt, from Harlow, was an unemployed dustman when he attended the party at Barrymoreaposs home.  nIn September , he told an inquest that meat factory supervisor Mr Lubbock had joined him and Kenney in the hot tub, and then went into the pool.  nMerritt told the hearing: He was ducking under the water and ing about, having a good time. He then went into the pool and was e bombing.  n   nTop news stories from n   nHe claimed he had been chatting in the bedroom for  minutes when Barrymore came in, adding: He said there was a geezer floating in the pool.  nMerritt, who had met Barrymore only hours earlier, dialled  at about .am.  nHe was later arrested and released without charge.  nKylie Merritt  n  n   nAt the inquest, Kylie Merritt - Justinaposs younger sister - said she didnapost see an assault on Mr Lubbock.  nShe had met Barrymore for the first time at Millennium earlier in the evening.  nKelly Campbell  nLike most of the invited guests, Campbell had only met Barrymore for the first time that evening.  nSimon Shaw  n  n   nShaw was a friend of Barrymoreaposs and a local resident.  nHe told the inquest that he jumped into the pool to rescue Mr Lubbock.  nHe said: I ed and grabbed hold of the person. He slipped through my hold and I swam back up to take more air and ed again.  nI grabbed hold of the person and pulled him up and someone grabbed me.  nHe left the home with Futers after Mr Lubbockaposs body was foundbecause they feared media attention, the inquest heard.  nJames Futers  n  n   nFuters was a local resident and chef.  nExplaining how he first met Barrymore, he told the inquest: I was his paper boy when I was a nipper and I had seen him around.  nHe had been to the house in the past and was on his way home from Millennium Club with Shaw, his friend, when he decided to drop in, arriving between am and am.  nFuters told the inquest that he, Barrymore and Shaw went to Barrymore bedroom for a drunken chat before they found his body.  nHe said: We were going to have a dip in the pool. It looked like there was something down there. Simon jumped in when we realised there was someone at the bottom.  n  n   nBy the time an ambulance arrived, he had left the property with Shaw, the inquest heard.  nClaire Jones  nJones was -years-old when she attended the party.  nShe worked locally as a cashier.  nShe had only met Barrymore for the first time that night.  nCause of death aposunknownapos  nThe inquest found that Mr Lubbock had suffered severe anal injuries, which a pathologist said were caused by an object being forced into him.  nA coroner ruled the cause of death as unascertainable and an open verdict was recorded.  nOn Monday, DCI Jennings told reporters that mistakes were made with the initial investigation after items possibly used in the attack - including a pool thermometer and a door handle - vanished from the crime scene.  n  nBut he said he is now confident the force will find the killer and finally secure a conviction, hoping the reward and a documentary - Barrymore: The Body In The Pool, which is due be aired on Channel  on Thursday - will generate new leads after  years.  nHe added: We know not everyone at that party was responsible for what happened, but someone was. We also know that not everyone at that party may know what happened, but someone does.  nWe want the people who do have information to come forward and talk to us -  years is a long time, loyalties change and it is never too late to do the right thing.  nSome people also arrived at the scene in the hours after Stuartaposs death. They may hold the key information and we would like to hear from them.  n  nIt is also possible that iniduals at the party may have told other people what happened that night.  naposCome cleanapos  nMr Lubbockaposs father, Terry, is confident his sonaposs killer will finally be found and thinks Barrymore could be the key.  nHe said: I think itaposs time he comes clean. Itaposs time now Michael. I think you know more about this than you have said and the focus will be on you.  nItaposs time now for you to either clear your name or put your hands up to what happened because you must know.  nMr Lubbock added: The pennyaposs dropped now, itaposs time for people to come forward whether they are directly involved or indirectly involved. Any bit of information they have got, they must come forward with that.  n  nHe called for a fresh post-mortem and inquest for his son, while Mr Jennings said Stuartaposs injuries were too severe to have been consensual or self-inflicted, and suggested he may have been held down.  nThe officer said: I canapost rule out a single inidual was responsible for the sexual assault and causing Stuartaposs death.  nI would say on the balance of probabilities and all of the evidence and intelligence that we have, that itaposs more likely more than one person was involved.  nThe documentary tells the story of the death through interviews with journalists, forensics experts and people who knew Stuart.  nAt the beginning of the -minute programme, the  call reporting the incident to police is played.  nThe caller said: A fella has drowned in the pool.

He was told in September that year he would not face charges. nThen , he and then-lover Kenney had spent the evening at the the Millennium nightclub in Harlow before inviting locals back to the mansion in the early hours of March , . nThe Strike It Lucky host left the house after Mr Lubbock was found, and he later told a September  inquest that he  \"felt sick \" and  \"panicked and ran off \" after seeing the body. nLast year, he spoke about Mr Lubbocks death, telling Piers Morgans ITV show Le Stories that he  \"couldnt be more sorry \" for his behaviour that night. nThe one-time Royal Variety Performance host insisted he is  \" per cent innocent \". nBarrymore, now living in west London, sued Essex Police and claimed it was a wrongful arrest that had cost him about £.million in lost earnings, but Court of Appeal judges concluded in August  he would be entitled to only  \"nominal \" damages. nHis career as a TV presenter came to an end after Mr Lubbocks death, and he recently withdrew from the current series of Dancing on Ice, with the shows bosses saying he suffered a broken wrist. nKenney, who worked as a drag queen, was Barrymores boyfriend at the time of the party almost  years ago. nHe was also arrested along with Barrymore and Justin Merritt in June . nThree months later, he was told he would not be charged. nKenney told police that he and Justin Merritt were in the outdoor hot tub together and they last saw Mr Lubbock alive jumping into the pool and in high spirits. nHe told detectives that the pair left the hot tub at about .am and then were chatting the master bedroom when Mr Lubbocks body was found. nMerritt, from Harlow, was an unemployed dustman when he attended the party at Barrymores home. nIn September , he told an inquest that meat factory supervisor Mr Lubbock had joined him and Kenney in the hot tub, and then went into the pool. nMerritt told the hearing:  \"He was ducking under the water and ing about, having a good time. He then went into the pool and was e bombing. \" n Top news stories from nHe claimed he had been chatting in the bedroom for  minutes when Barrymore came in, adding:  \"He said there was a geezer floating in the pool. \" nMerritt, who had met Barrymore only hours earlier, dialled  at about .am. nHe was later arrested and released without charge. nAt the inquest, Kylie Merritt - Justins younger sister - said she didnt see an assault on Mr Lubbock. nShe had met Barrymore for the first time at Millennium earlier in the evening. nLike most of the invited guests, Campbell had only met Barrymore for the first time that evening. nShaw was a friend of Barrymores and a local resident. nHe told the inquest that he jumped into the pool to rescue Mr Lubbock. nHe said:  \"I ed and grabbed hold of the person. He slipped through my hold and I swam back up to take more air and ed again. n \"I grabbed hold of the person and pulled him up and someone grabbed me. \" nHe left the home with Futers after Mr Lubbocks body was foundbecause they feared media attention, the inquest heard. nFuters was a local resident and chef. nExplaining how he first met Barrymore, he told the inquest:  \"I was his paper boy when I was a nipper and I had seen him around. \" nHe had been to the house in the past and was on his way home from Millennium Club with Shaw, his friend, when he decided to drop in, arriving between am and am. nFuters told the inquest that he, Barrymore and Shaw went to Barrymore bedroom for a  \"drunken \" chat before they found his body. nHe said:  \"We were going to have a dip in the pool. It looked like there was something down there. Simon jumped in when we realised there was someone at the bottom. \" nBy the time an ambulance arrived, he had left the property with Shaw, the inquest heard. nJones was -years-old when she attended the party. nShe worked locally as a cashier. nShe had only met Barrymore for the first time that night. nThe inquest found that Mr Lubbock had suffered severe anal injuries, which a pathologist said were caused by an object being forced into him. nA coroner ruled the cause of death as  \"unascertainable \" and an open verdict was recorded. nOn Monday, DCI Jennings told reporters that mistakes were made with the initial investigation after items possibly used in the attack - including a pool thermometer and a door handle - vanished from the crime scene. nBut he said he is now confident the force will find the killer and finally secure a conviction, hoping the reward and a documentary - Barrymore: The Body In The Pool, which is due be aired on Channel  on Thursday - will generate new leads after  years. nHe added:  \"We know not everyone at that party was responsible for what happened, but someone was. We also know that not everyone at that party may know what happened, but someone does. n \"We want the people who do have information to come forward and talk to us -  years is a long time, loyalties change and it is never too late to do the right thing. n \"Some people also arrived at the scene in the hours after Stuarts death. They may hold the key information and we would like to hear from them. n \"It is also possible that iniduals at the party may have told other people what happened that night. \" nMr Lubbocks father, Terry, is confident his sons killer will finally be found and thinks Barrymore could be the key. nHe said:  \"I think its time he comes clean. Its time now Michael. I think you know more about this than you have said and the focus will be on you. n \"Its time now for you to either clear your name or put your hands up to what happened because you must know. \" nMr Lubbock added:  \"The pennys dropped now, its time for people to come forward whether they are directly involved or indirectly involved. Any bit of information they have got, they must come forward with that. \" nHe called for a fresh post-mortem and inquest for his son, while Mr Jennings said Stuarts injuries were too severe to have been consensual or self-inflicted, and suggested he may have been held down. nThe officer said:  \"I cant rule out a single inidual was responsible for the sexual assault and causing Stuarts death. n \"I would say on the balance of probabilities and all of the evidence and intelligence that we have, that its more likely more than one person was involved. \" nThe documentary tells the story of the death through interviews with journalists, forensics experts and people who knew Stuart. nAt the beginning of the -minute programme, the  call reporting the incident to police is played. nThe caller said:  \"A fella has drowned in the pool. We have got him out. n \"Theres a party going on and someone has just gone out and found him. I think the geezers dead mate. \" n\",\"usage\":,\"language\":\"en\",\"semantic_roles\":[,\"action\":,\"text\":\"believe\",\"object\":,,\"action\":,\"text\":\"was

Dad-of-two Mr Lubbock, , was found dead in an outdoor swimming pool at Barrymoreaposs £million mansion in Roydon, Essex, on March , , after being seriously sexually assaulted. Barrymore, now , and two other men - his ex-lover Jonathan Kenney and dustman Justin Merritt - were arrested and later released without charge, and police say the three have not been completely eliminated from inquiries. Five others who were at the party that night - Merritt’s younger sister Kylie, chef James Futers, and locals Simon Shaw, Claire Jones, then , and Kelly Campbell - have also not been eliminated, according to police  Before the screening of a new Channel  documentary on the case, Mr Lubbockaposs father, Terry, , said he believes Barrymore knows more than he has revealed. He has called for the entertainer to clear your name or put your hands up as Essex Police offer a £, reward for information. On Monday, Detective Chief Inspector Stephen Jennings told reporters that it is likely that at least two people were involved, adding: “One or more of the eight people at this party are responsible for Stuart’s death.” He also said: I believe that he [Stuart] was raped and murdered that night. In September , an inquest found that Mr Lubbock had cocaine and ecstasy in his system, and had drunk the equivalent of nine pints of beer the night he died. With plenty of unanswered questions still lingering, here is a look at the five men and three women who were at the party. Michael Barrymore  Barrymore, born Michael Parker, was arrested on suspicion of serious sexual assault and murder in June . He was told in September that year he would not face charges. Then , he and then-lover Kenney had spent the evening at the the Millennium nightclub in Harlow before inviting locals back to the mansion in the early hours of March , . The Strike It Lucky host left the house after Mr Lubbock was found, and he later told a September  inquest that he felt sick and panicked and ran off after seeing the body. Last year, he spoke about Mr Lubbockaposs death, telling Piers Morganaposs ITV show Le Stories that he couldnapost be more sorry for his behaviour that night.  The one-time Royal Variety Performance host insisted he is  per cent innocent. Barrymore, now living in west London, sued Essex Police and claimed it was a wrongful arrest that had cost him about £.million in lost earnings, but Court of Appeal judges concluded in August  he would be entitled to only nominal damages. His career as a TV presenter came to an end after Mr Lubbockaposs death, and he recently withdrew from the current series of Dancing on Ice, with the showaposs bosses saying he suffered a broken wrist. Jonathan Kenney  Kenney, who worked as a drag queen, was Barrymoreaposs boyfriend at the time of the party almost  years ago. He was also arrested along with Barrymore and Justin Merritt in June . Three months later, he was told he would not be charged. Kenney told police that he and Justin Merritt were in the outdoor hot tub together and they last saw Mr Lubbock alive jumping into the pool and in high spirits. He told detectives that the pair left the hot tub at about .am and then were chatting the master bedroom when Mr Lubbockaposs body was found. Justin Merritt  Merritt, from Harlow, was an unemployed dustman when he attended the party at Barrymoreaposs home. In September , he told an inquest that meat factory supervisor Mr Lubbock had joined him and Kenney in the hot tub, and then went into the pool. Merritt told the hearing: He was ducking under the water and ing about, having a good time. He then went into the pool and was e bombing.  He claimed he had been chatting in the bedroom for  minutes when Barrymore came in, adding: He said there was a geezer floating in the pool. Merritt, who had met Barrymore only hours earlier, dialled  at about .am. He was later arrested and released without charge. Kylie Merritt  At the inquest, Kylie Merritt - Justinaposs younger sister - said she didnapost see an assault on Mr Lubbock. She had met Barrymore for the first time at Millennium earlier in the evening. Simon Shaw  Shaw was a friend of Barrymoreaposs and a local resident. He told the inquest that he jumped into the pool to rescue Mr Lubbock. He said: I ed and grabbed hold of the person. He slipped through my hold and I swam back up to take more air and ed again. I grabbed hold of the person and pulled him up and someone grabbed me. He left the home with Futers after Mr Lubbockaposs body was foundbecause they feared media attention, the inquest heard. James Futers  Futers was a local resident and chef. Explaining how he first met Barrymore, he told the inquest: I was his paper boy when I was a nipper and I had seen him around. He had been to the house in the past and was on his way home from Millennium Club with Shaw, his friend, when he decided to drop in, arriving between am and am. Futers told the inquest that he, Barrymore and Shaw went to Barrymore bedroom for a drunken chat before they found his body. He said: We were going to have a dip in the pool. It looked like there was something down there. Simon jumped in when we realised there was someone at the bottom.  By the time an ambulance arrived, he had left the property with Shaw, the inquest heard. Claire Jones Jones was -years-old when she attended the party. She worked locally as a cashier. She had only met Barrymore for the first time that night. Kelly Campbell Like most of the invited guests, Campbell had only met Barrymore for the first time that evening. She was a friend of fellow party guest Claire Jones. Cause of death aposunknownapos The inquest found that Mr Lubbock had suffered severe anal injuries, which a pathologist said were caused by an object being forced into him. A coroner ruled the cause of death as unascertainable and an open verdict was recorded. On Monday, DCI Jennings told reporters that mistakes were made with the initial investigation after items possibly used in the attack - including a pool thermometer and a door handle - vanished from the crime scene.  But he said he is now confident the force will find the killer and finally secure a conviction, hoping the reward and a documentary - Barrymore: The Body In The Pool, which is due be aired on Channel  on Thursday - will generate new leads after  years. He added: We know not everyone at that party was responsible for what happened, but someone was. We also know that not everyone at that party may know what happened, but someone does. We want the people who do have information to come forward and talk to us -  years is a long time, loyalties change and it is never too late to do the right thing. Some people also arrived at the scene in the hours after Stuartaposs death. They may hold the key information and we would like to hear from them.  It is also possible that iniduals at the party may have told other people what happened that night. aposCome cleanapos Mr Lubbockaposs father, Terry, is confident his sonaposs killer will finally be found and thinks Barrymore could be the key. He said: I think itaposs time he comes clean. Itaposs time now Michael. I think you know more about this than you have said and the focus will be on you. Itaposs time now for you to either clear your name or put your hands up to what happened because you must know. Mr Lubbock added: The pennyaposs dropped now, itaposs time for people to come forward whether they are directly involved or indirectly involved. Any bit of information they have got, they must come forward with that.

Kate Ingram Woolf had always dreamed of having a huge brood. After the -year-old had two children with her first husband in the mid s, she was devastated when she miscarried after trying for number three. But  years later she has finally given birth to her fth and final child after two decades of trying - and a further  pregnancies, of which  ended in heartbreak. While cradling her six-month-old daughter Edith, Kate said she couldnapost be happier and couldnapost believe she has the family she fantasised about as a teenager. Kate, from Herefordshire, said: I had always wanted a big family and when I was going through the miscarriages, it just made me want children even more. I became obsessed with wanting a bigger family. After going through  miscarriages, I just wanted to keep on trying and hoped that one day I would have my perfect little family that I do now. I hated being pregnant because I was so scared of what might happen and I just wasnapost convinced that it was real. I had to have scans every two weeks to help settle my mind and reassure me that everything was okay. My husband Steve, was excited but I didnapost want to get too excited because I didnapost believe it.  After my miscarriages, I suffered from postnatal depression despite never giving birth because my hormones were all over the place. I canapost believe Edith is here and healthy and I finally have my perfect family I had always dreamed of. Kate began trying for a third child in  after having two successful pregnancies - Jasmine,  and Kristopher,  - with her first husband. Over the next  years Kate suffered  miscarriages and had  more successful pregnancies with several partners. She orced her first husband and went on to have one child, Freya,  with her next partner. Shortly after, Kate split from her partner and went on to have Olivia, .  Kate, who has been married for three years to her current partner, Steve, , finally got the news she had been waiting for since they married in . She was pregnant again with a baby girl and in August , Kate gave birth to healthy baby Edith. Kate and her self-employed carpenter husband first began trying for a baby in . While she already has four children from previous relationships, she wanted a baby with Steve to create her dream family. After having two children with her first husband, Kate tried for baby number three which is when she began miscarrying. Sadly between  and , the enthusiastic mum suffered  miscarriages which led to the breakdown of her marriage.  After Kateaposs first miscarriage in , a number of tests were done but they all came back with the all-clear, leading Kate to believe it was aposjust one of those thingsapos. Finally in , Kate got pregnant with her third child Freya. Kate said: I was terried when I was pregnant because I never believed that it was real and I always thought I would lose it again. I wish I could have been excited but it was impossible given the circumstances. It was only after the th miscarriage, that doctors ran more tests and found that Kate had a bicornuate uterus which could causes an increased risk for recurrent miscarriage. I had been blaming myself for so long, thinking that I had done something wrong, so to find out that this could be the reason behind it was both relieving but sad because there was nothing I could do about it now, she said. During Kateaposs first marriage, she suffered a late miscarriage which led to the breakdown of her relationship. Kate said, I found out I had lost the baby at  weeks and that was probably the hardest one for me.  I had to go and sit in a hospital room surrounded by all of these women who were pregnant and be told that my baby was no longer alive. It was definitely part of the reason why my first marriage came to an end- I became obsessed with getting pregnant and it was all I wanted. Between  and , Kate had two more miscarriages with her current partner, leading them to want to give up trying. We were absolutely devastated but we decided we would try again and thataposs how Edith was born, she added. In August , Kate and Steve finally had their wishes answered when a healthy baby girl was born.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailA woman jumped  feet to her death from the balcony of her luxury apartment block shortly after beginning a new le in China. Gill Smith, , had seemed happy after setting up home in a wealthy part of Shanghai with managing director husband Peter and their two young sons, an inquest heard. Prior to her death she got herself in a hole and took her own le in a moment of madness, the hearing in Stockport, Greater Manchester was told. On July  last year Mrs Smith, formerly of Bramhall, near Stockport, fell  floors from the family home near the Huangpu River after sending her sons to have lunch with their father. She suffered multiple injuries and was found in the grounds of the apartment complex in the Weang Xincun area of the city. The waist-high metal and glass  surrounding the edges of the balcony would have required Mrs Smith to use a stool to step over them, the inquest heard. After her death police officers found passwords to her phone which contained a suicide note. The mum-of-two had seemed quiet in the weeks before her death and had been unable to get out of bed on some days.  The family were due to fly out to Spain to start the childrenaposs summer holidays before heading back to the UK to visit family. Mr Smith, managing director of recruitment firm Michael Page China, told the hearing: I knew she wasnapost her normal self over the two weeks prior to her death. She became quiet and wasnapost her normal self in terms of chatting when I would get back in the evening. I did specically ask her three times what was wrong and I sat with her and asked whataposs going on, itaposs not right. And she said nothing was going on. The father-of-two went on to recall the last time he spoke to his we. My last conversation was over the phone she phoned to say I have just put the boys in a car and they will be with you in  minutes, he said.  When it was the school holidays they would come and see me and we would got something to eat as I did a lot of travelling. A meal had been arranged earlier in the week and at one point Gill was going to come. I didnapost notice anything unusual. I know on the Monday she had stayed in bed all day. I had gone to work and she was in bed and I came back and she said she didnapost feel up for getting up and wanted to watch TV. Recalling the day of the tragedy, he added: As we finished lunch and were coming down in the elevator a text message came through. As soon as I got that message we set off back home.  I phoned my PA to try to phone the building and get someone to get up to the apartment.phoned my friendaposs we. My friendaposs we was sat with Gill and my PA phoned me really upset and saying she was so sorry. Gill had never talked about doing anything like this before, but weirdly enough there had been a few suicides in Shanghai over the last year and it had been a topic of conversation at a BBQ we were at four weeks before. She just got herself into a hole and I donapost think she meant it. I think it was just a moment of madness.  After the tragedy unfolded police found Mrs Smithaposs phone and a piece of paper with passwords written on it. This led them to uncover a saved draft email which explained her reasons for taking her own le and how she was sorry for doing so. Recording a conclusion of suicide due to multiple injuries caused by her fall, Coroner Alison Mutch said: Clearly Mrs Smith along with her family led a very happy le in China where they where living at the time. They had a very close family with two children that she clearly thought the world of. It is clear from all the messages I have seen that her family were a huge part of her le and she cared immensely for her family. Itaposs clear on the evidence before this court that in the short time proceeding her death she had become quite distressed and quieter than usual.  Itaposs dficult to understand what was going through her mind at the time, she clearly didnapost want to talk about it. It is clear from the notes that where recovered that she felt she was in a situation that for reasons not entirely clear she felt was not resolvable.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailShe advised US presidents and even correctly predicted John F Kennedyaposs assassination - and now Jeane Dixon has warned the world will end this year. Jeane was one of the most famous self-proclaimed psychics and astrologers in America. She wrote seven best-selling books, including an autobiography filled with her predictions and a horoscope novel for dogs. Chillingly, seven years before the death of JFK, who was shot as he travelled in a motorcade through the heart of Dallas, Jeane predicted he would be assassinated. In the Parade Magazine on May , , she wrote the  presidential election would be dominated by labour and won by a Democrat. Jeane then went on to add that whoever won the election would go on to be assassinated or die in office though not necessarily in his first term. But this was the first time she had dipped her toe into affairs of state. Born in South Caroline, Jeane claimed she had been approached by a fortune teller, who told her she would be famous for her gt and would help some of the worldaposs most powerful people. She initially worked writing horoscopes that were published across the US and started to make her first predictions using her crystal ball. In the middle of World War Two, Jeane came to the attention of US president Franklin D Roosevelt, who called her to the Oval Office. She claimed he asked her for advice on military issues and Jeane insists she told him the war would end before the middle of . Roosevelt died in April, , so didnapost live to seesome of her predictions came true, but Jeaneaposs reputation as a psychic was now growing. Her sensational claims about JFK caught the eye of one of her most powerful supporters, Richard Nixon, who was the US vice president at the time. Jeane was invited to speak with him in the Oval Office and her meteoric rise to fame continued. A commited Christian, she insisted her visions all came from God, which gained her many fans from the religious communities. Her relationship with Nixon continued when he became president in  and she met with him for a second time in . Jeane claims to have had a vision of a terror attack in , shortly before the Munich Massacre at the Olympic Games in Germany that summer. It seemed to be all the proof Nixon needed and Jeane is credited as being one of the reasons he formed a counterterrorism committee. And it has been reported that Nixon wasnapost the last president who sought he advice - Nancy Reagan and her husband, Ronald, were also said to be in contact with Jeane. Chillingly, Jeane has also predicted that the world will end in  when a aposwar of armageddonapos will break out to wipe out the planet. Some of her other predictions have been eerily accurate. She said there would be a huge shipping disaster in , which was the year of the Exxon Valdez oil spill. The massive oil tanker spilled , tonnes of crude oil near Alaska and led to the deaths of up to , seabirds, , sea otters,  seals and  orca whales. And one of Jeaneaposs very famous fans says she foresaw her fame and wealth more than  years ago. Oprah Winfrey met with the self proclaimed psychic in  and it has been reported that Jeane told her she would have a huge career and millions of fans.

Somjai said residents who visited the home pointed out the puppyaposs likeness to the cartoon character from the popular animated film. He said: We are wishing that the puppy survives, even though it has a deformity. We want to keep him as a pet until he grows up. Everybody has been amazed by him and saying that it is lucky sign. People said that he looks like the yellow cartoon character with one eye, so we can nicknamed him after that.  Somjaiaposs daughter Parn, said all the family were delighted to have a newborn puppy with the physical abnormality. It is still not clearthe puppyaposs single eye willproperly as it typically takes around two months for a dogaposs sight to develop fully. She said: We have taken good care of the puppy so far.

With Tessa living in Sweden and Patrick living in the Calornia, US, they hope to move in together one day.  nDespite worrying about her undergoing so many surgeries and turning her face into a Snapchat filter, he has been supportive of her journey and look.  nTessa is now a nude art model and is enjoying her le post-surgeries but also throws caution to young girls that they should do their research before every surgery.  nShe said: I am originally a small-town girl, growing up in a family that was struggling financially. My dad was having troubles with alcohol and my mother was working very hard to support the family.  nI remember throughout my childhood being afraid of le. What I learned from home was never to think anything good about myself, the Law of Jante was the religion in our house, and I suffered early of low self-esteem.  nBack then I knew I wanted to change my appearance, but I was still listening to others rather than to myself.  nI was very uncomfortable in my own skin I was shy and felt ugly. Plastic surgery has helped me out a lot. Le is too short to walk around feeling sad over your appearance.  n  n  nTeen declares her aposresting b***h face has gone for goodapos after dramatic surgery   nIf I ever have a daughter that wanted to have something done in order to feel more confident then I will pay for her procedure.  nMy goal is to feel as good as possible about myself both on the inside and outside, with or without clothes on.  nI must say, my wardrobe is suffering since Iaposve spent all my money on my plastic surgeries they always come first.  nIaposve had three boob jobs, two revisions, two liposuctions, one Brazilian butt lt or fat transfer, a bunch of fillers and Botox, two rounds of Belkyra fat dissolving injections and one round of Votiva vaginal rejuvenating ultrasound treatment.  nI had my first surgery when I turned twenty-three it was a boob job and I was beyond happy.

Tessa Texas, , grew up feeling insecure and spent her childhood hating her appearance while dreaming of having bigger boobs. In October , Tessa, from Helsingborg, Sweden, underwent her first boob job and has now spent £, on three boob augmentations alone - increasing from a cup size A to FF. She has also had a Brazilian butt lt, as well as facial fillers, Botox and liposuction and has collectively spent £,. She insists that her le and confidence has vastly improved since sheaposs had the surgeries and despite receiving negative attention from men who have told her to stop, she has chosen not to listen. In July , she received a drunken text from her now husband, Patrick Abbott, , who saw her on Tinder and asked her out. Two months later, they got married and she has never been happier. With Tessa living in Sweden and Patrick living in the Calornia, US, they hope to move in together one day. Despite worrying about her undergoing so many surgeries and turning her face into a Snapchat filter, he has been supportive of her journey and look. Tessa is now a nude art model and is enjoying her le post-surgeries but also throws caution to young girls that they should do their research before every surgery. She said: I am originally a small-town girl, growing up in a family that was struggling financially. My dad was having troubles with alcohol and my mother was working very hard to support the family. I remember throughout my childhood being afraid of le. What I learned from home was never to think anything good about myself, the Law of Jante was the religion in our house, and I suffered early of low self-esteem. Back then I knew I wanted to change my appearance, but I was still listening to others rather than to myself. I was very uncomfortable in my own skin I was shy and felt ugly. Plastic surgery has helped me out a lot. Le is too short to walk around feeling sad over your appearance. If I ever have a daughter that wanted to have something done in order to feel more confident then I will pay for her procedure. My goal is to feel as good as possible about myself both on the inside and outside, with or without clothes on. I must say, my wardrobe is suffering since Iaposve spent all my money on my plastic surgeries they always come first. Iaposve had three boob jobs, two revisions, two liposuctions, one Brazilian butt lt or fat transfer, a bunch of fillers and Botox, two rounds of Belkyra fat dissolving injections and one round of Votiva vaginal rejuvenating ultrasound treatment. I had my first surgery when I turned twenty-three it was a boob job and I was beyond happy. At first, I was nervous but itaposs in my nature to do a lot of research so I knew exactly how it was going to turn out. The pain was awful, nowadays Iaposm back on my feet but back then I was lying in bed for two weeks straight. Today Iaposm working as a nude art model and a touring stage performer and I have a lot more surgeries coming up. The snapchat filter is a great tool for me to use as a guide when Iaposm going under for my facial feminisation surgeries . Those are major and quite risky.  There is a lot of bone reconstructive work to be done on my face and I have already decided what surgeons to choose over in the US. The reason why I want to look like a filter is because itaposs simply just so much more beautul than my original face. I canapost wait to have it changed. My goal is to not have any of my own features left except my eyes, but even they might go under the kne in the future as Iaposm a fan of eye colour changing surgery. Tessa plans to have more surgeries in the near future, including a breast tissue expander, which is a breast implant designed to stretch the skin and muscle to make room for future, more permanent implants. She also plans to undergo rib removal, belly button removal, silicone butt implants, full body liposuction, cheek implants, v-line surgery, chin enhancement, eyelid surgery, brow lt and a reconstruction of her vagina. My lips are probably the most expensive treatment so far. I started having fillers seven years ago and I remember spending about £,the first year, she said. Ever since I was a little girl when my parents asked me what I wanted to be when I grew up, I told them I wanted big boobs and a moustache. Thank God I changed my mind about the latter one.  I never felt good in my regular body and I knew since I was a child that I was going to have plastic surgeries. At first it was hard as I didnapost have anyoneaposs support, I was suffering for years when listening to boys telling me not to do it. Now I follow my heart and nothing . I am a huge fan of the few transgender girls going that extra mile when it comes to expressing their femininity. Iaposm a huge fan of Nicki Valentina Rose and Gizel Rodriguez, they make me not feel unashamed for wanting to be ultra-feminine, I love it. Unfortunately, I donapost have the finances required to reach that look but it sure is my inspiration and dream. The Brazilian butt lt with fat transfer I had done is by far the best surgery Iaposve ever had it was a complete transformation. I am forever grateful for choosing one of the most skilled surgeons in Europe for this one. It worries me a lot how many young girls travel abroad to do their surgeries just to save money. Itaposs also scary how many guys out there think Iaposm doing this to get their approval. My plastic surgery journey is for me to look the way I want on the outside as I feel on the inside.

And then… silence.We arrived in . The UK embarked on a referendum of our membership of the European Union and three years of naval-gazing and political paralysis submerged our ability to see the waves of turbulence beyond our own shores.As post-Brexit immigration policy resurfaced in UK political discourse last week, I spoke to my former work colleague and dear friend, Lyndsay Cochrane, who travelled to Calais in February last year as a volunteer.Lyndsay, , stayed for an initial period of six weeks and ed for a further nine weeks.She said: “I love food and felt I could bring something to the table.”Within weeks, she was cooking for between , and , men, women and children.It cost Lyndsay £ to get from Glasgow to Calais.While making her way from the ferry port to her accommodation, she was confronted with billboards made by refugees saying: “We are not animals. We are human beings. Please treat us as such.”Lyndsay said: “They are at the mercy of the constant threat of violence and intimidation.”She observed the living conditions of many families in Calais and Dunkirk, often only sheltered by small flimsy tents during cold winter conditions.When asked about her most emotive experience, Lyndsay said: “We had a memorial service for a two-year-old girl who was shot and killed.“At the service, they had images of the girl, read out a poem and other children had drawn pictures of her.“Looking at the picture of her just broke me.”Lyndsay said it is dficult working in such a context but talked passionately about the way volunteers support each other in what she describes as “like a bubble of God’s love amid brutal circumstances”.It is likely that post-Brexit immigration will be even stricter in its limitations on migrants and refugees fleeing conflict.I asked Lyndsay how she feels about this when engaging with the refugees she talks to in Calais.She said: “I would never want to extinguish their hope.“Sometimes hope is the only thing keeping them going.”"},{"url":null,"title":"exclusive hibs kid fraser murray set for dundee loan","story":"Hibs youngster Fraser Murray is set to join Dundee on loan until the end of the season, Tele Sport can exclusively reveal.The -year-old midfielder is a product of the Hibees academy set-up and has made  appearances for their first team.The Easter Road club are keen for him to get more game-time under his belt and hope a switch to Dens Park will offer that.The Dark Blues hope to have the deal sewn up this week in time for Saturday’s trip to Morton.Meanwhile, club-mate Sean Mackie has ed to Hibs after picking up an injury in his temporary spell on Tayside."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2020/02/5e3930203b5672.98108232-836x564.jpg ","title":"mcpake id like another striker but im happy to go with just two","story":"Dundee boss James McPake admits he’d like another striker in his squad but slim pickings in the free agent market means he’s happy to stick with just two for the rest of the campaign.An ultimately failed deal to bring in St Mirren frontman Danny Mullen went right to the wire on transfer deadline day.That was frustrating for the Dens boss but he’s more than happy with the quality of the two strikers he has at his disposal.Andrew Nelson ed to full training today after surgery to fix a broken hand while Kane Hemmings notched his seventh league goal of the season at Morton on Saturday .James said: “I would like another striker.

There’ll be dips along the way, like Tuesday night, but we need to bounce back tomorrow.”First up for United is the challenge of Dick Campbell’s Red Lichties tomorrow afternoon.The teams have played out two tight games this season with United coming out on top by one goal on both occasions.However, a scrap wouldn’t bother Butch, so long as they pick up those all important three points.“They’re a dficult side to play against as we’ve seen, home and away,” he added.“It was tough at their place because of the conditions but the onus will be on us at home. It’s a dferent game.“Last week was dficult against Morton. They had something to hold on to but we did really well to come back into the game in the last minute.“It was a big point for us.“It was, obviously, very disappointing to go out on Tuesday night but, ultimately, it’s about the league and promotion.“It was a strange feeling to lose on Tuesday after such a long period without losing a game, so that’s something we’ve got to deal with. I think, personally and for the boys in the dressing-room, we were looking forward to tomorrow straight away just to get back out there and win a game again.“We’ve dusted ourselves off and we’re ready to go tomorrow.”A lot has been made of the rumours surrounding Lawrence Shankland’s future at the Tangerines as the January transfer window gets set to slam shut at midnight.However, Butcher insists the noise around their star man has had little affect on Shanks or the squad.“Lawrence is a great guy and since he’s come here, from day one, he’s got on with it.“He knew that he had to score goals and he’s done that. He’s been absolutely fantastic for us.“He deals with everything great. He’s not big time about it at all and doesn’t take things too far in terms of getting too high or too low.“It’s great for him but I think there’s a lot of boys in the dressing-room there’ll be speculation about because the side’s doing so well.“It’s something we’re having to deal with now and probably in the summer. It’s just one of those things but I think, at the moment, everyone is happy with how things are going.“Lawrence being here after the window is great.

He has brought it on in leaps and bounds.“You just have to stick with it because you have your tough times at football clubs but I don’t think the performances have been poor – they have been good.“It is just in that final bit and putting the ball in the back of the net, which will come.“You are playing for Aberdeen and are going to get the criticism when you don’t win the games.”Aberdeen had been subjected to criticism following a slump in form following a - loss to third-placed Motherwell and the flat stalemate at St Mirren.Taylor accepts such is the expectation at Aberdeen flak will be directed at players and the managementthey do not deliver results.He is confident the draw at Ibrox can be the catalyst to propel Aberdeen forward in the second half of the campaign.Taylor said: “Aberdeen is a big football club and criticism comes when you are not winning games.“That is part and parcel of being at this football club, the expectation is there. We know as a team the performances have been there but we have been keeping clean sheets. It is just that final bit.”Askedthe players discussed the criticism of the manager and the squad, Taylor said: “We focus on the job at hand and focus on the game.“We know we can do better in front of goal and that it is going to come and hopefully that will come against St Johnstone.”Dons boss McInnes had highlighted the lack of cutting edge in attack as the main factor in the recent slump in form.He made three permanent signings in the January transfer window in securing winger Matty Kennedy, midfielder Dylan McGeouchand attacking full-back Ronald Hernandez .Taylor said: “I am sure the players we have brought in can help us find the back of the net.“Hopefully we can kick on now.”Although Aberdeen failed to score for a third successive match when drawing - at Ibrox, it was a vastly improved performance with scoring opportunities created in Govan.Taylor said: “It was a solid, dogged performance and I am disappointed we didn’t come away with the three points because we had the better chances. We did enough to win the game.“It was important that we put in another solid performance and kept another clean sheet, especially when playing against an in-form side in Rangers.“We showed determination and that is a springboard for the rest of the season now.“Now we need to carry that forward and hopefully we can find the back of the net and that can push us on.”Leading scorer Sam Cosgrove had the best opportunity at Ibrox when one-on-one with Rangers keeper Allan McGregor.However, the striker, already on  goals this season, took a heavy touch when racing in on goal that allowed McGregor to make the vital block.Taylor said: “Unfortunately for Sam, the pitch played a part as the ball bobbled up a little bit.“Sam has proven his worth to us many times before.”Although Aberdeen have struggled in front of goal, they have been solid at the back, with the centre-back partnership of Taylor and Scotland international Scott McKenna pivotal.Since the restart after the winter break, the Dons have conceded just one goal in four games.

When we started to utilize the budget where it became one that might not be affordable to us at that stage.“How it played out was that we showed themour scouting networks and the concentration that we had in dferent leagues. While they then concentrated on their region they were aware of Ronald through their South American involvement and him playing for Venezuela.“He was actually on their system playing for Venezuela.“We married up reports and we both came to the same opinion he was a player of interest.“The benefit that we have had with the collaboration with Atlanta is they have Venezuelan players with the same Venezuelan agent at Atlanta.“So it was a direct in to their agent.

All have end-stage organ failure, be it kidney, liver, lung or heart, and require a le-saving transplant.Organs for transplant usually come from bodies of people who agreed to donate before death. But as this does not produce enough organs, both Scotland and England plan to bring in an #opt out# system, meaning that on death a person#s agreement to organ donation is assumed unless they had actively opted out.Live donation is an alternative to awaiting a cadaveric organ. As people can live happily with one kidney or half a liver, family members or altruistic iniduals sometimes offer to donate these organs. Since matching donor and recipient tissue-type, however, is generally required these donations are not always acceptable.Now groups of tissue-type incompatible donor recipient pairs are getting together to mix and match, producing duos who are tissue-type-compatible. So let#s say Annie is rejected as a kidney donor for her sister Jean for incompatibility reasons, and similarly, Arthur is rejected as kidney donor for Jim. But pairing donor Annie with recipient Jim and Arthur with Jean could lead to two successful transplants. A recent report from the US describes the first ever bi-organ exchange involving a liver-kidney swap * .In this specic case a daughter wished to donate a kidney to her mother with renal failure but was rejected because she might later develop the same kidney problem. So she offered half of her liver in exchange for a kidney for her mother. Another donor was eventually identied who wanted to donate half her liver to her sister with liver failure but was rejected because her liver was too small. But she was cleared for kidney donation. So on the day of the swap four operations took place and two needy people received le-giving new organs.Although not presently being considered in the UK, with the ethical issues sorted, this multi-swap procedure opens the way for extended chains of donors and many more lives saved.*Torres et al Am J transplant. :-."},{"url":null,"title":"tarbert club on target for 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe first competition of the new year at Tarbert Gun Club also served as the January leg of the club#s winter league.A full house of  teams turned out on Sunday January , and the early shooters had to put up eith windy conditions which made the clays dance.

Nearly three years later I fear the dream is still a long way from that reality.Mid Argyll Youth Development Servicescertainly seems to have ambitious plans for an indoor skate park and this is to be lauded, however a quick look online will show an apparent apathy with regard to moving forward with the project. A young man created the #Lochgilphead Skate Park Association# on Facebook in , yet a final post in  indicated how little the proposal had moved forward. If the project needs more money to actually get it built we need to know how much, so that appropriate funding can be sought.What is causing the project to take years to come to fruition The potential for help by the £ million Tarbert and Lochgilphead Regeneration Fund in  was dashed when councillors instead decided that improvements to road junctions, streets, a cycle track and indoor bowling were more important, and allocated a staggering £, to feasibility studies for these projects alone, this is before any work is actually done, you understand.That is a great deal of money for feasibility studies and design works.Let us be realistic # in nine long years the community has gone from the initial excited buzz about a skate park to finally managing to purchase a plot of land upon which to build it in early . From there it seems the project has not been able to move.In the meantime the youngsters who worked so hard to give momentum to the project appear to have given up hope and are now probably giving thought to employment prospects rather than having fun.It is a sad state of affairs.But rather than giving up hope, let us reignite this campaign for our children to have the dream of a skate park in Lochgilphead whilst they are still young enough to enjoy it.Nick MacIneskar, TayvallichSir,With regard to your story in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser #Inveraray seawall in need of attention#, would it be possible to contact BEAR Scotland and ask themthey could also create an access point to the shore Possibly at the bus stop at Barn Brae. Thanks very much.Marion McIntosh, InveraraySir,I should like to make an appeal to all MPs, MSPs, councillors and all lawmakers that in  they make no new laws.At the beginning of this new decade they should improve the laws they already passed. I would even like for them to go further and reduce the number of laws that are in existence.Now please don’t get me wrong, I am not against all laws. What I fear is that instead of addressing the issues which are negative to iniduals and society, legislators believing that by extending what are regarded as crimes changes society for the better. Their belief is wrong.We know that parking on pavements is wrong #upskirting# is horrying smoking in a car in which they are children is unacceptable dropping litter is shameful driving through a red light is dangerous.What we need is the range of social and cultural influences that help us feel that we should behave in a positive way. In the s, s and s the majority of people regularly attended churches and religious organisations. In these environments people developed feelings of what was right and wrong. Positive behaviour was also developed by participating in the extensions of these organisations through activities in young mother groups women#s guilds, choirs, and religious celebrations. These helped develop positive moral compass in people.Equally, most children and young people went to youth organisations such as the Girl Guides, Scouts, the BBs, army and naval cadets. Even into the s local authorities ran youth clubs and had excellent people called #youth leaders#. No more. #We cannot afford them# is the call of the day. Without them the honourable behaviour of society will continue to deteriorate.So my plea to politicians is simple # stop making us all criminals by passing more and more laws and start supporting and encouraging agencies, groups and people who indirectly and directly instil in iniduals behaviour of which all can be proud.Finlay CraigCoveSir,There is all the hoo-ha at the moment over the lesser royals deciding its going to be a better le that beckons from opting out from royal duties # perhaps wanting a less stressful, more normal, le for themselves and their family as ordinary people away from the media hype and national newspapers.It was lovely, however, to see in the same week front page on the local paper a real regional award for a less well-known commoner.An MBE given for services to the local youth community, making this two great awards for Lochgilphead in recent years and showing that local strong ladies in Mid Argyll do have what it takes.Hard work and true Scottish grit and determination in their hearts for the area and community.

A wee van and a motorbike were behind them at the time and they let them pass and they disappeared down the twisty road at an incrediblespeed.They reached Tighnabruaich at about  o#clock and saw Fulmar in the water, but when they stopped to speak to Johnny Malcolm and Donald Turner they were told she was not in the water more than # an hour and still not fully rigged. They were quite right but George Smith said they were busy getting Psyche ready for launchingbut they would be out first thing in the morning to bend on the sails and finish off the rigging.They got their storesin the yard and with these and their luggage went aboard in two trips. Things were soon put sufficiently enough in order to allow them to get to bed and after watching Psyche go down the slip they were soon in their bunks. It was a beautully clear evening but distinctly cold.Next morning they were up at sevenand about eight the yard men came out and finished up their jobs. Jimmy Smith fixed up the slipping clutch and suggested we do away with the present gear lever fancy arrangement which was not strong enough for its work. This the Skipper agreed to though it meant a less handy working but it did away with the pin and shield that broke up the dog-house seat, they being replaced by a removable hatch cover. It certainly made sitting in the dog-house more comfortable.The Skipper went ashore to the village for meat and some curtain hooks while Archie watered ship and the other two continued cleaning and clearing up aboard.At quarter to twelve they were away under full sail and in brilliant sunshine but with a cold north-westerly they ran to Ardlamont then beat up to Tarbert, being passed just outside Tarbert as an aeroplane flew close overhead, by Blink. They noticed a huge oil tanker doing trials just off Arran.They were anchored off the herring pier before  o#clock and they had supper-cum-lunch then went ashore. The Pilot to visit a friend, the others to get milk in the village then to walk to the end of the road on Loch Fyne. On their way they spoke to an enthusiastic English pair, working in their garden, who wanted to know off which yacht they had come.During the evening Arcturus and Tunnag came in and one or two motor boats. Zaidie was in when they arrived and Leonora was anchored across Loch Fyne in Buck Bay.All aboard, Margaret and Archie went off to the islet in the harbour to get some roots for their new garden then soon afterwards all turned in, for though it was a glorious looking evening it was perishingly cold and the stove, lit as soon as they anchored, had been very welcome.On Sunday they were again up early and found a dull overcast day. The Pilot, ashore for water, heard a poor weather forecastfrom a fishing board. On the strength of this they hurried breakfast and by  o’clock were away with a south-westerly breeze.The Skipper gave the first beacon a rap with the boom-end as they ran out of the harbour. The beat down to Ardlamontand thee ran the engine for five minutes to get out of a nasty lop. The sun came out for about five minutes but by the time they had reached the Carry Buoythe rain had started and it got heavier and heavier.The wind strengthened with the rain and they moved up very fast into Tighnabruaich Bay then up to Loch Riddon to anchor off the pier at Ormidale. As they passed Tighnabruaich they saw Torridon was on Fulmar’s mooring and they watched her crew panicking to get off before Fulmar arrived. They wondered what the Torridons said when they saw Fulmar pass on through and realised that they could have stayed where they were. As they passed Glen Caladh the new Jansi of Kames passed under a not very healthy-sounding engine.They had lunch and the stove was lit then Margaret and Archie went ashore to visit friends and when they came back they brought with them a big sack of coal . The late afternoon and evening were spent below talking and listening to the rain hammering on the deck.Monday morning it was dry but blowing hard. They got the anchor early and motored to the moorings. The sails were hoisted to dry them and St Roma came close by to make their number and at one time a big school of thrasher whales went through the Kyles heading east and at a great speed.About noon they went ashore for a visit to the hotel and for a run round the Ardlamont road . Back aboard they had lunch and soon after packed up and came home."},{"url":null,"title":"the cinema on wheels returns","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe screen machine will be rolling back into Mid Argyll at the end of the month.Bringing with it a host of movies for film fans the Screen Machine will be in Campbeltown Road car park in Tarbert from Wednesday January  to Thursday January  and Lochgilphead Resource Centre car park from Friday January  to Sunday February .Musical fantasy film Cats, based on the Andrew Lloyd Webber stage musical, features an ensemble cast including James Corden, Judi Dench, Jason Derulo, Idris Elba, Jenner Hudson, Ian McKellen, Taylor Swt, Rebel Wilson, and Francesca Hayward.Also known as Star Wars: Episode IX, Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker is an epic space-opera film.

So how did Britain look before human interventions  Dense forest  or open woodland Research now favours the latter.Plants and animals evolved in equilibrium for thousands of years before humans impacted the landscape. Essential to this balance were ‘keynote species’ including aurochs , bison and tarpan . By grazing, these animals trampled and eroded soils, dispersed seeds and redistributed nutrients, thereby keeping the forest open. This in turn encouraged growth of large trees while also creating numerous habitats and microenvironments for a wonderful ersity of plants and smaller animals.Now this bioersity is severely threatened by modern monocultures , and massive quantities of pesticides, fungicides, fertilisers and #weed# killers. It is no wonder that insect numbers have plummeted, many bird species are endangered and wild-flower meadows have virtually vanished. So could we recreate this natural order on unproductive land and save our wildle For Isabella Tree and her husband Charlie Burrell the answer is a resounding #yes#. In her book #Wilding#, Tree describes #wilding# their , acre farm at Knepp, West Sussex, that had been unproductive for years.They introduced longhorn cattle, Exmore ponies, deer and pigs but otherwise left well alone. Within months they saw a dference # most scrub was cleared, producing an explosion of plant and animal species. And where grazers were deterred by spiny or unpalatable plants, oaks emerged that will eventually form an open woodland.But Knepp is isolated. More rewilding sites are needed with wildle corridors between them to support the populations and genetic ersity essential for long-term survival.Surely parts of Argyll are ideal for rewilding. We already have beavers creating new waterways to support aquatic species – now how about some large grazers to open up the landscape and perhaps one day recreate the ancient Celtic rainforest "},{"url":null,"title":"hair raising happenings at the co op","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowLochgilphead Co-op staff are on a fundraising mission which they hope will raise awareness and help overcome stigma around mental illness.Trusting her hairdresser Nicky MacDougall, from Casa in Ardrishaig, Tina Holloway will have her hair shaved off to raise funds for the Scottish Association for Mental Health .Explaining why she decided to take on the challenge, Tina said: #I didn#t really think before I opened my mouth.

Douglas and Sons of Lilliesleaf, on Christmas Eve when Graham Douglas died .The Douglas family business was started at the end of the First World War by William Douglas, who had three sons Willie, Dan and Jimmy, who on leaving school in turn all joined the family business. Through time Willie and Jimmy both retired early from the firm through ill health and when Dan retired in  the business was taken over by Williersquos son, William , and long time colleague, Bill Reid . Graham became the fourth generation Williamto work in the business after leaving school and in  took over the business when his father, Bill, retired.The Douglas family took over the building of the annual Border Union Show and Kelso Ram Sales in  and the Championship Dog Show since the first Show in , completing  years for the former and  years for the latter respectively in .It is interesting to note they succeeded Messrs. Bulman, builders Kelso who had been involved with BUAS since . To have had only two main Contractors in over  years is indicative of their skills and loyalties.Graham was very clever at school with a good practical brain and I heard from his le long friend, Andy Shortreed, that he was an expert at, among other things, technical drawing and would make all manner of things out of wood and other material.He was encouraged to study and utilise these skills while at High School in Hawick but Graham was stubborn! All he wanted to do was leave school and join his father, Bill, and be a fencer, which he duly did in .Countless number of farms and estates throughout the Borders have benefited from Grahamrsquos skill, as have the three core events at BUAS. His younger brother, Neil, was in partnership with Graham for a number of years before ing to utilising his skills with heavy plant machinery.I cannot have more regard and respect for Bill and Graham and how they nurtured me when I joined BUAS as Secretary in . I listened and I learnt from them all the ins and outs of both the Showground and preparing these massive annual Events and bringing them together in such a professional manner and with an uncanny calmness that sometimes was frustrating but one knew that come the day the target was reached. The Ram Sales have evolved over the last  years with many changes and updates and it was a pleasure working with someone who was always conscious of the huge responsibility he had to the many thousands of people, whose livelihoods were often very dependant on a good Ram Sales or a good Show, whether buying, selling, exhibiting, a Trade Stand, providing a service or a member of the public.Grahamrsquos other passion in le was his racing pigeons, which he has bred and raced for over  years - and for the last  with his friend and near neighbour in Lilliesleaf, Bob Spearman. They had many years of great fun and indeed numerous successes with their birds and it was always a great pleasure and exciting for those at the Showground when in the spring Graham would very often bring a crate of young birds when he came to work and released them as part of their early training. A master breeder even he did not understand how the young birds knew which direction was home!He had a great eye and would spend many long evenings just watching the birds to learn which would be potential race winners and which to keep as breeding stock. They had their fair share of success in UK races, whether from Edinburgh or the south coast of England but their biggest success was when one of their favourites ndash Bonnie Lad ndash finished th out , birds released from the South of France. No-one does fathom how these incredible birds find their way home and I believe these two wise owls were also baffled but enjoyed the discussion and banter over a pint or two in the local pub. Thankfully Bob Spearman is carrying on with the ldquoLilliesleaf Legends pigeon flock.Grahamrsquos greatest assets were that he was honest, thorough and reliable with great attention to detail in anything and all in which he was involved.

and embarked on a year-long campaign to eradicate dog fouling.Now, thanks to a successful bid for funding, new bins and bag dispensers have been located throughout the town.ldquoIrsquove always found the notion of dog poo smeared across our streets abhorrent, even as a small child, said community councillor Jackie Couchman.ldquoInnerleithen has a high density of dogs in a relatively small area which magnies the issue.ldquoMost dog owners are responsible and pick up, a sizeable minority do not and, it would seem, will not. I thought it was worth a concerted effort to seewe could make a dference to the state of our streets to benefit everyone. I was prepared to make a personal commitment of time and effort to this cause.The project got off ground last January when Innerleithen community councillors made the decision to try and rid the streets of dog mess.Reflecting on the actions they undertook, Jackie said: ldquoI became involved after Gordon Daly taped plastic bottles to lampposts to dispense free poo bags to those in need.\"Susan Meikle and I offered to help these from supplies Gordon had procured from the Dogs Trust.The following month, the community council was encouraged by local authority councillors to apply for funding through the Localities Area Bid Fund.ldquoThis concentrated my mind and I took it upon myself to complete the application with offers of help from both a previous applicant and The Bridge, said Jackie.ldquoWe heard our project had been shortlisted to be put to the public vote in time for our May community council meeting.But the timetable for the public voting process was disrupted by other political happenings, and after a tense wait and a flurry of activity to encourage voting, good news was delivered.Jackie added: ldquoWe heard our bid was successful in time for our July meeting.\"Various conditions had to be met before the funds could be released, including  percent of the amount applied for supplied by us, copies of our constitution and accounts.ldquoHaving won the funding, final details of ordering, delivery, installation and maintenance had to be agreed.Whilst waiting on the new bins to arrive, the community councillors did not rest on their laurels.With the help of SBC leader Shona Haslam, Jackie and Gordon stencilled anti-fouling signs on problem pavements in Innerleithen.Community councillors also mapped out locations for the new bins and Scottish Borders Council agreed to install these and remove or relocate the redundant ones.ldquoOperationally, the local authority agreed to provide the litter bags and to replenish the poo bags with us taking responsibility for funding them, added Jackie.With the bins now in place, the community council is due to meet on Monday to discuss further fundraising initiatives.The townrsquos community council, in particular, the poo-busting trio of Jackie, Gordon and Susan, have worked tirelessly this last year to combat the dog fouling issue in Innerleithen.Nevertheless, inevitable questions remain.Will they no longer witness the flattened deposit bearing the imprint of a shoe, the stressed parent quickly steering their child away from the offending brown mess, or irritated adult repeatedly scraping their foot off a kerb Probably not says Jackie, adding: ldquoWas it worth it  Yes.\"And in the shorter term it has made a dference.\"Longer term, my feeling is that it will depend on continuing effort and collective ownership of the problem. People have generally been very supportive although every post on social media has triggered lsquothey wonrsquot ever pick up commentsrsquo.\"Despite the campaign Jackie says itrsquos unlikely that everyone will become law abiding citizens and pick up after their dog, but says shersquod do it all again in an effort to keep clean the streets and grass verges of the bonnie town she resides in."},{"url":null,"title":"council-asked-declare-interest-planet","story":"CAMPAIGNERS descended on Thursdays meeting of Scottish Borders Council in a bid to convince the local authority to declare a Climate Emergency.So far  councils across Scotland have made the declaration as efforts continue to halt and reverse the damage being done to the planet.Despite the Extinction Rebellion protest outside the council headquarters at Newtown St Boswells, bosses have yet to issue any statement.Protestor Jennie Gibson said: \"The declaration is the first step to deal with the problem.\"It shows the council takes climate crisis seriously and so should we.\"It means they have to make plans to cut emissions and we can seethey do it or not.

I use this phrase to describe the spectacle of street lights at night when viewed from a vantage point.One of the best places in East Lothian to view the lsquoupside down skyrsquo is from the road by Farsquoside Castle. This vantage point gives you views over Wallyford, Musselburgh, Portobello and Edinburgh beyond.These urban areas create a sea of lights which look like a sky full of bright stars, except, of course, itrsquos lsquoupside downrsquo and theyrsquore not really stars. But it looks spectacular in its own way. In fact, views with bright city lights are these days often considered tourist attractions.But Irsquove recently realised something: while the lsquostarsrsquo of the lsquoupside down skyrsquo are getting more numerous and extensive every year, the real stars in the actual sky are becoming more dficult to see at least where I live.Literally thousands upon thousands of houses are being built in the western part of our county. Much of the rural landscape in this part of East Lothian, which I knew when I was a child, is going fast.Most of me understands and accepts the needs for this, but a part feels sad at the loss of a recognisable landscape. And already I have noticed that a by-product of this has been increased light pollution in areas close to where I live. It is going to get much more noticeable as more development takes place.I know many people will say there are many more things to think about, especially in late January, when the Christmas turkey is coming home to roost and all those bills have to be paid at a time when we are already financially drained from festive expenditure, and stressed out. Thank goodness for Burns suppers, a highlight of a month that often seems both the darkest and longest of the year.But this is all the more reason to pause. When was the last time you really had the opportunity to sit under a dark night sky full of visible stars  This is one of naturersquos free gts and stargazing has real benefits for our mental health and emotional wellbeing.I remember some years ago, when visiting a friend in a very rural part of Scotland, I went out to put something in the bin. My friend came out to seeI was OK, as I hadnrsquot ed after  minutes. I had been struck by the beauty and power of the starlit sky, unpolluted by city lights. Without noticing the time, I had sat just gazing at the universe above me.I can remember the sense of awe and peace it created. Sure, part of it was also the quiet and stillness in that area, but sitting under the canopy of stars is what overwhelmed me in that moment.Itrsquos an experience fewer of us can enjoy because of the increase in light pollution, but also noise and general busyness all around us. So we often donrsquot even realise what wersquore missing. Perhaps there is a cause and effect here: the less you notice the absence of something, the less you think itrsquos important or relevant.Our ancient ancestors understood its power. But I think we have lost the sense. I recently asked a group of young people how many of them had sat under the stars and just gazed and wondered at them. Sadly, none had done so, and some thought the idea ldquoweird. I think a lot of adults would share that opinion.But taking time to sit and really wonder at an unpolluted night sky can fill us with awe, as I experienced that evening at my friendrsquos house. It makes us feel small and in so doing it puts our worries and anxieties in perspective. It can promote inner peace and calm.For sure, the bills wonrsquot go away neither will the stress at work or whatever is dominating your thoughts most of the day. But in taking time to pause and wonder at the vast and almost timeless beauty of the stars, your soul gets time to catch up. It can help you see things dferently, in a more creative way. Itrsquos a form of meditation with something bigger than we can imagine, but also something incredibly beautul.And itrsquos fascinating, as you try to identy the dferent constellations, and perhaps realise how much you donrsquot know or have forgotten. Could you identy the northern star, and what constellations can you see  Sailors in days of old were experts at identying the stars to aid direction, but Irsquom sure they also marvelled at the unhindered beauty and mystery of them as well.There are still many places in our county where we can be wrapped in star-lit darkness. But as the lsquoupside down skyrsquo gets bigger and brighter, the real stars are fading in so many places.The real shame is, as the stars disappear from our sight, they may disappear from our consciousness as well.Letrsquos not let that happen. Let us gt our children, and ourselves, with the noticing and gazing at the real stars in our sky and somehow find the time, even briefly, to stargaze."},{"url":null,"title":"garry-oconnor-referees-haddington-amateur-teams-successful-charity-match","story":"Haddington Town FC took time out over the festive period for a special friendly in aid of Back Onside.Former Hibernian and Scotland striker Garry OrsquoConnor, who is an ambassador of the good cause, refereed the match, which saw members of the amateur teamrsquos squad come up against one another on January .Matt OrsquoConnell, chairman of the club, which was formed last year, said they were determined to help support the charity, which helps young people and adults who face mental health challenges.He said: ldquoWersquore a club that was founded on the idea of bringing local guys together into a positive social and active environment.ldquoItrsquos well documented that the highest proportion of suicide across Scotland is men aged - and thatrsquos something we hope to positively redress in our town by facilitating a great environment in which local guys can improve not only their physical but also their mental health.ldquoOur connection with the charity Back Onside was really born of their slogan, #SupportThroughSport, a powerful statement that really resonated with us.ldquoTheyrsquore a great charity who are doing a hell of a lot across the UK and so for us, a small amateur club barely nine months old, to play a small part in helping a charity who share our ethos was immensely rewarding.Haddington Town play on Sunday mornings in Division Two of the Lothian and Edinburgh Amateur Football Association , alongside fellow county side Meadowmill.The charity match, played at Knox Academy, finished - in favour of the lsquoawayrsquo Haddington Town team.Libby Emmerson, founder and CEO of Back Onside, said: ldquoWe are beyond grateful for the support received from Haddington Town Amateur Football Club and guest referee Garry OrsquoConnor.ldquoAs a small charity with a huge clientele, community events such as the Haddington Town AFC charity match are key to raising funds and awareness so that we can continue to support those facing mental health challenges.Mr OrsquoConnell thanked everyone for their support, with the match raising pound, ndash more than double the target.He said: ldquoHuge thanks to Libby Emmerson, FES FM and Garry OrsquoConnor.

To turn the area over to commercial activities from November, with an unsightly and unpassable clear-up lasting from January to May, is to commandeer the place for more than half the year. Eight weeks would be acceptable  is not.Naturally, this eyesore wont be published on any VisitScotland website. Most sightseers wont ever catch a glimpse of this inglorious aftermath. Meanwhile, between now and the middle of May, those who live and work in Edinburgh must pass by and avert their gaze, wondering how their city became a mere pawn of the entertainment industry and not an illustrious capital of which they could once be proud. As one of many disgruntled locals tweeted, this is ruination \"in the name of greed\".I cannot think of a city of comparable elegance, venerability and wealth ndash a Unesco World Heritage Centre to boot ndash where the first thing you see as you emerge from the train station, or arrive from the airport is a wasteland. Welcome to Scotland! Here we dont roll out the red carpet, but ndash after an agonisingly long delay ndash we do renew the turf.Theres a palpable feeling at the moment that Edinburgh is undergoing seismic change, under our noses but without public consent. News last week that planning regulations could be relaxed to allow restaurants, cafes, and a host of other non-retail outfits to move into Princes Street is a fresh cause for concern. If approved, this new dispensation could mean that one of Europes most beguiling bouleds ndash the street that sells Scotland ndash could become home to a casino, cinema, or even a sports facility.Why should this concern us  Given the tawdry quality of some of the shops currently trading, wouldnt bright cafes or restaurants be a welcome improvement  After all, the array of tartan tat, cheap-as-chips fashion and even an emporium dedicated to sugary sweets ndash the smell alone could rot your teeth ndash is hardly in keeping with the magnicence of the venue.Yet given some of the poor decisions already taken by the councils planning committee, it is hard to feel confident that this incomparably lovely avenue is in safe hands. One member of the committee says the idea is to create a \"more authentic\" space. Im not sure what that means, but it sounds like double-speak for attracting lucrative footfall. And while pubs wont apparently be allowed onto the street, this relaxing of regulations extends to George Street, Hanover Street, Frederick Street and Castle Street. Like it or not, the face of the New Towns commercial district is set for a facelt.With the demise of House of Fraser at the West End, now transformed into a whisky experience, and towards the East End the once-beloved Jenners department store due shortly to close , the heart of the city is struggling to keep up with bewildering change. Fortunately, nothing so awful is in the pipeline as the notorious proposal some years ago to build an elevated shopping mall in the gardens. Perhaps the most worrying aspect of a less stringent commercial climate is the signal it sends, and the trend it looks set to deepen.Wherever you go, Edinburgh is turning into a visitor attraction, a living museum and gallery. Useful shops for locals are a rarity. In their place is a proleration of chic cafes, glitzy on-trend eateries and luxurious hotels, all pandering to the tourist market. Thanks to the make-over of old premises and investment in new, the capital has a superficial shine, a high-cost stylish patina. But as Dickenss Mr and Mrs Veneering showed, putting your faith in appearances is risky. Yes, it creates jobs, though mostly of a lowly-paid, transitory kind. But at what cost  Do people make the trip to Edinburgh for its pubs and coffee shops, or to soak up the atmosphere of culture, history and daily le that, over centuries, have made its name Princes Street has undoubtedly been in need of improving its image for a long time now. Some initiatives are to be welcomed, such as the Quaich project, to renovate the run-down Ross Bandstand, and to \"wild\" the western part of the gardens, so they look less like a postcard from the s and rather more invitingly freeform. While that is a laudable aspiration for one side of the street, however, the other is in danger of losing whatever soul it has left.I understand that the council is in a dficult position, trying to safe-guard the future of a district caught in the retail nightmare of swtly changing, quixotic customer behaviour. That it is hoping to welcome a greater ersity of trade suggests that in one aspect at least, human habits are unchanged: eating and drinking and watching the world go by. In fact, we are consuming far more than we ever did before, willing to spend money as well as countless hours sipping lattes and beer and scoffing burgers and sushi. So much for austerity. When it comes to leisure, wallets fly open.There would be nothing wrong with broadening Princes Streets commercial scopeyou could trust those at the controls. Sadly, I have no such faith. On the evidence of recent years, the citys development is geared towards immediate gratication, mainly for migrating flocks of cash-splashing customers. Where is the long-term perspective, tailored to the true character of the city, and to the requirements and concerns of those who live in it  Why bother to ask. Such a perspective requires serious thought, knowledge and imagination, luxuries the current decision-makers dont want to afford. As they say, Rome wasnt built in a day ndash but a theme park could be."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/10969268.jpg?type=article-full","title":"green-go-benefits-purchasing-leasing-electric-hybrid-cars","story":"Intelligent Car LeasingElectric cars offer the practicality of a normal petrol or diesel car but with greatly reduced emissions. In the case of fully electric cars, those emissions are zero.There are plenty of electric cars to choose from. There are the self-charging hybrids. These use a combination of an engine with a battery and have the ability to run for a short while in zero emission mode. Such vehicles do not require charging by you.On the other hand, Plug-in Electric Hybrids - often abbreviated to PHEV - have an engine but feature a larger battery that can be charged from the mains or from a home charging unit. These have the ability to run emission-free for around - miles - enough for your daily commute.Finally electric cars - often called EVsor BEVs- only have a battery. They require charging from a home charging unit to run continuously in zero emission mode.Of course, technology is fast-moving. Where once a fully electric car had a range of barely  miles, todayrsquos electric cars offer in excess of  miles.So how do you stay ahead of technology without incurring huge costs and loss of value in a car One way is through car leasing.

Despite there being more than a quarter of a million electric cars registrations in the UK between  and , many prospective buyers remain cautious.The top concern of car-buyers is the range of EVs. Of course, itrsquos true that in some of the fledgling models, range was an issue, but technology has moved on. The Nissan Leaf, for example, will drive for  miles before needing a recharge. The range is clearly displayed on the dashboard, so therersquos no danger of getting caught short. And the reality is,  per cent of journeys in the UK are shorter than  miles, so there is a high likelihood that it will meet the needs of most people.Charge times are another concern. A full charge on the Leaf takes eight hours but a quick charge will provide  per cent capacity in only half an hour. And with more and more investment being ploughed into EV infrastructure and charging points around the country, filling up the tank is becoming easier and easier every day.Speed is a popular misconception too. If when you think about an electric car, golf buggies and dodgem cars spring to mind, it might be time to think again. Far from being sluggish, modern EVs have excellent acceleration. The new Leaf can go from -mph in . seconds and has a top speed of mph. And they produce instant torque, meaning the start-stop transition is slick and immediate.Fully electric vehicles are, of course, only the tip of the iceberg for the eco-conscious, eager to get ahead of the curve on green issues. Hybrid cars have batteries which are charged up on long motorway journeys, enabling them to power shorter trips about town, saving fuel without the need to schedule trips around charging points.Hybrids are a good compromise for those who arenrsquot necessarily ready to make the full leap to electric, combining some of the benefits of EVs like lower road tax, savings on fuels and reduced carbon footprint, without taking the plunge into completely new territory.Both Macklin Motors Nissan Glasgow Central and Macklin Motors Nissan Glasgow South have gained Electric Vehicle Approved Status , so the teams there are well-equipped to advise customers about changing to an electric or hybrid vehicle.Macklin Motors Nissan Glasgow South,  Welbeck Road, Darnley, Glasgow, G SDwww.macklinmotors find-a-dealer nissan-glasgow-south Macklin Motors Nissan Glasgow Central,  Port Dundas Road, Glasgow, G HZwww.macklinmotors find-a-dealer nissan-glasgow-central ------------------------------------------------------------------------Helensburgh Toyota For Toyota, hybrid really isnrsquot anything new as they first manufactured hybrid vehicles more than  years ago.

And that wonrsquot be the only argument deployed against Indyref .Anyone who thinks Brexit will be done and dusted by May next year is living in a fools paradise. A bare-bones deal may well be struck by the December  deadline, covering free trade in goods, but huge questions of regulatory alignment will be outstanding.Nicola Sturgeon says confidently that the ldquoToaries will surely make a mess of Brexit and that that will be clear very soon as the impact of hard Brexit bites. But forecasts of doom have not had a good track record.Remainers in general have relied far too much on project fear. Planes falling out of the sky, food disappearing from the shelves, essential medicines not getting through. None of this has happened or is likely to happen.There is too much at stake for the EU and Britain not to come to a basic deal to keep things moving. The long-term economic effects of Brexit will undoubtedly be pretty dire. The Treasury forecast is that the UK will lose over % of GDP growth, which is as much as in a serious recession.But wersquove already lost % since , according to most estimates, and that hasnrsquot had much impact on Brexit opinion. Moreover, these forecasts are based on untested assumptions.Reduced immigration leads to lower growth, but it might also lead to higher wages being paid to workers already in the UK. Wage growth has been ticking up since Brexit.So we canrsquot rely on some popular revolt against Brexit, and anyway itrsquos not clear how a botched Brexit is going to make the case for Scottish independence.Westminster might just as well say that wersquove had enough of isive referendums. While the UK economy is under the stresses of transition, now is not the time for a Scottish independence referendum throwing another spanner in the works.Theresa May said exactly that in , and Boris Johnson, with his huge majority, is almost certain to say the same. Which means there will not be the ldquolegal and legitimate referendum which the First Minister says is the only one she will entertain.:Iain Macwhirter: Labour is on a loser with its unsubtle attack on nationalismShe did actually mention in her speech the possibility of a consultative referendum, and said that the time might come when Holyroodrsquos powers to hold such a referendum might he tested in court. There has been much learned discussion of this on the internet among legally-trained nationalists.However, she didnrsquot exactly bubble over with enthusiasm at the prospect. For Ms Sturgeon the only independence worth having is one recognised by Westminster, and the EU, as legitimate. That requires No. to agree a Section  Order allowing a legal and binding referendum to take place.She has a point. Unionists might boycott a consultative referendum. Local authorities would have to organise it and voters might regard it as a waste of money since the result doesnrsquot mean anything. Boris Johnson will certainly say that.So, it was another dose of sober realism from the FM on Friday. Wersquove been here before. Itrsquos not a great prospect for the legions of enthusiastic nationalists who have been led to believe that a referendum is just over the horizon. That horizon is getting more distant by the year.Some prominent nationalists believe the gamersquos a bogey. The most influential independence-supporting website, Wings over Scotland, has just thrown in the towel over Nicola Sturgeonrsquos legalistic approach. The Rev Stu says the site, which has a huge following, and raises six-figure sums each year, will notuntil Nicola Sturgeon is history.That may take a while. There is no obvious replacement for Ms Sturgeon. Shes been hugely successful in electoral terms and as this column has pointed out in the past, political parties are mainly concerned with winning and keeping seats. The SNP depends on the flow of cash and energy supplied by its MPs and MSPs. It doesnrsquot want a repeat of  when the SNP lost a third of its Westminster seats.The FM is a cautious lawyer, disinclined to lead from the front. Alex Salmond would probably be active in emulating Mandela. Organising campaigns of civil disobedience, withdrawing from Westminster, fighting in the courts, staging ldquoadvisory plebiscites. The kind of ldquoratchet\" approach advocated by The Common Weal activists.That might or might not work. But the question is irrelevant. The SNP used to regard itself as a revolutionary party not part of the establishment. But it has become the establishment in Scotland.

And that means first and foremost that ministers need to get their own house in order.Britain will also need to work with the EU ahead of the blocrsquos summit with China in September, with serious European moves to cut emissions required to encourage the worldrsquos biggest polluter to take more action.But one thing likely to set the tone of the talks will be out of the UK Governmentrsquos hands: the US presidential election.President Trump has initiated proceedings to withdraw the US from the Paris Agreement, with the withdrawal coming into final effect the day after the election on November  ndash less than a week before the talks begin.His re-election could strengthen the hand of other countries that have argued against strong climate action, but a newly elected Democrat president would likely want to send a clear message that the US is back in the climate-fighting game."},{"url":null,"title":"POLITICS WATCH  Rest easy - Nigel has been busy making plans for Nigel","story":"In the furrowed brow camp, according to some of the Sunday papers, was the entire Cabinet, reportedly irritated that the EU was not going to give the UK a loose, Canada-style trade deal and would instead be insisting on regulatory alignment.Nigel Farage, reviewing the papers on The Andrew Marr Show, also counts being a ldquorule taker as a red line. You could normally rely on him becoming very animated on the subject, but this was a new, post-Brexit Nigel on display.Calm, chipper, strolling on the sunny side of the street, he did not look like a man who had just lost his job and was, with Brexit now done, surplus to requirements.That was certainly not how Mr Farage saw it. When the Brexit Partyrsquos MEPs left Brussels last week they were facing uncertain futures. Some would be heading straight for their local JobCentre Plus office. Not so Mr Farage. Nigel, it turns out, has been busy making plans for Nigel.He was pleased to hear the Prime Minister was taking a hardline stance ahead of a speech on trade today.ldquoHersquos saying all the right things, hersquos being consistent with the manesto upon which he was elected.: Independent Scotland welcomeRecollecting his last day in the European Parliament, when the chair muted his microphone because the Brexit Party MEPs would not stop waving Union Jacks, Mr Farage said he sensed the balance of power had shted.ldquoFor the first time since the vote in  theyrsquore a little bit more frightened of us than we are of them. What the EU feared most was a competitor on its doorstep, he added. ldquoThat terries them.Mr Faragersquos last intervention in UK politics was to stand down his Brexit Party candidates at the General Election, leaving the way clear for the Conservatives. Now that the UK was out, did the Brexit Party still exist, Marr wondered.Oh yes, said Mr Farage. He had been fooled before into thinking his services were no longer needed.ldquoIn  after the referendum I was so thrilled that wersquod won, I had been doing it for so many years, I actually believed Theresa May when she said Brexit means Brexit, very stupidly of me. I think I gave the impression that I rather walked away. Irsquom not going to walk away this time. The Brexit Party will still be there. It will be more an insurance policy in case things go wrong.A new think tank is to be set up, called Brexit Watch, and in the next  months the party would ldquopraise the Government to the high heavens when they are getting it right but ring the alarm bellthey are not.Also in the Farage diary is a trip to the US. In the giddy days after the EU referendum there was talk of Mr Farage becoming the British ambassador to the US. President Trump loved the idea, tweeting that he would do ldquoa great job. It did not happen then and it is not going to happen now. What he is going to do in the US was unclear, with Marr saying only that the former City trader would be ldquositting alongside Mr Trump, which conjured up visions of a ventriloquist act.Dominic Raab, the Foreign Secretary, did his usual trick of giving an alfresco interview to Ridge on Sunday en route to Marr. He backed his boss on not aligning with EU rules, or as he put it: ldquoLegislative alignment ndash it just ainrsquot happening. Sounds like a slogan for the side of a bus.: Leader refuses to back MP in raceMr Raab had positioned himself in the grumpy camp earlier by telling UK representatives not to be pally with their former EU chumsthey met at international talks. They should ldquosit separately, he said.Leo Varadkar, the Taoiseach, called this ldquopetty and said it sounded like the sort of thing that happened at school. Otherwise, Mr Varadkar was strangely upbeat for a man whose party is in the middle of an election and behind in the polls.First prize for being a sunbeam went not to Mr Farage or Mr Varadkar but to Marrrsquos main guest, Donald Tusk.The now former president of the European Council can be relied upon to say something newsworthy. It was Mr Tusk, you will recall, who said there would be a ldquospecial place in hell for those who promoted Brexit but had no idea how to do it safely.At the end of last week the SNP asked the EU to ldquoleave a light on for an independent Scotland to . Mr Tusk duly appointed himself lamplighter in chief, and an honorary Scot to boot. ldquoIrsquom very Scottish now, he said, gesturing to his heart. ldquoEspecially after Brexit.: PM ready to accept checks at borderThe Foreign Secretary took a frosty view of this warm welcome, calling it ldquofrankly rather un-European and rather irresponsible given the secessionist separatist tendencies in Spain, France and Italy.A Conservative minister scolding the former president of the European Council for being un-European.

Youve worked your way up to a wealthy, privileged place where your voice, which people actually want to listen to, is amplied to millions of folk at once.Problems arise when it turns out that you are, in fact, a rank hypocrite.Take, for one example, Prince William, who warned of the \"catastrophic effect\" of overpopulation on the planet... while his we was expecting their third child. Perhaps keep your mouth zipped on that topicyoure not keeping your trousers zipped.His Royal Highness was back on it at the Baftas on Sunday night, this time giving a speech about how the industry must try harder in terms of racial ersity.Im not sure I remember him putting his name to his brothers statement about the racist treatment of his own sister-in-law or prioritising erse representation in his household staff. London is one of the most multi-cultural cities on earth - not hard to find employees from a iety of backgrounds, one would imagine.Where Willian, and so many celebrities, lets himself down is to make a point about an issue without addressing how he is complicit in the problem and should be addressing it. Otherwise, you look sanctimonious and a bit silly.Stepping in to show him how it should be done was Joaquin Phoenix, making an acceptance speech for Best Actor against a backdrop of an all-white acting nominees shortlist.There had been talk, when the shortlist was announced last month, of a boycott but, rather, everyone whos anyone turned out on the night.Phoenix, addressing the whiteness of the awards ceremony, made his interest in the issue credible. \"Irsquom ashamed to say that Irsquom part of the problem,\" he said, \"Because Irsquove not ensured that the sets Irsquove worked on are inclusive.\"He added: \"We have to do the hard work to truly understand systemic racism. It is the obligation of the people who have created and benefit from the system of oppression to be the ones to dismantle it.\"So thatrsquos on us.\"The \"us\" was followed with a slightly too long pause. It makes people uncomfortable to hear they might be complicit in an injustice they would be quick to condemn. Action, though, is the real test of mettle and lets see what action Phoenix now takes to address this issue.The actor Laurence Fox would, as a surprise to everyone following his appallingly crass Question Time appearance, seem to be role modelling decent behaviour in the wake of racism.Fox took it upon himself to argue with an academic in the BBC audience about racism. When his own white privilege was called out he labelled this racist and he referred to discussions of race in modern Britain as \"boring\". What a luxury, to be able to be bored about a subject that profoundly effects the lives of your neighbours, eh He went on to make some bizarre remarks about  trying too hard to be ethnically erse and ending up historically inaccurate. The only one who was inaccurate, in the end, was Laurence Fox, but he bullishly kept on.Until last week when he was pictured with the writer and critic Bonnie Greer, who Fox seems to have contacted after hearing her criticise him on a radio show.Greer was lambasted for the meeting and told that she shouldnt have accommodated him. It seems that speaking directly to your critics, face to face and not online, in an attempt to learn and understand is a step a great many people could learn from.While Foxs views were repulsive, his most recent actions are right. Now he has had Greers generous counsel, Im sure hes far less bored.Learning opportunities, happily, abound. The new Speaker of the House of Commons has laid down a role model gauntlet we must hope other men will pick up.When asked as to what he thinks about breastfeeding in the House, Lindsay Hoyle said he would allow it. A -year ban, imposed by Baroness Boothroyd, has surely hampered new mothers from taking their place, should they want to, on the green benches.The decision is right, but Sir Lindsays rationale is righter still. \"I think it would be wrong for me as a male to dictate on that policy,\" he said. Absolutely.Taking responsibility, self-reflection and centring the people effected by policy - some good news for once. Phoenix, Sir Lindsay and Fox show how it should be done.

But in reality, for the vast majority of readers going about their work and le, very little will change as a result of leaving the EU.The SNP needs to understand this, see the parallels to independence, and ride the wave. Its ability to do so could well be the dference between success and failure both in next yearrsquos Scottish Parliament election, and in the second independence referendum which it hopes will follow.I have never been of the opinion that the SNPrsquos strategic approach to Brexit has been entirely smart. Of course it is sensible of it to position itself as the party of Remain in a country which voted  per cent to stay. And of course it made the right judgment to suppose that those SNP voters who also voted to leave the EU will fall back into line, with an independent Scotland being their bigger prize.But the SNP allowed itself to be sucked into the hysteria of Brexitrsquos impact, and it is one aspect of its approach which will have to changeit is to be successful in a future independence referendum. Because, self-evidently, the walls have not fallen in since Friday night, as many predicted, just as the walls did not fall in the day after the Brexit vote, as many predicted, just as the walls will not fall in on January  after the end of the transition period, as many predict.This matters to the SNP because its politicians now need to put a nation at ease by selling the message that the walls will not fall inthey vote for independence. In order to achieve that it needs to dial down the hysterical messaging on Brexit.There are other big-ticket SNP messages which will need to changethe party is to fulfil its raison drsquoetre. Perhaps the biggest of all is its policy on membership of the very institution under discussion, the EU.Whatever the UK Governmentrsquos negotiations with Brussels over the next  months bring, it is highly unlikely that they will produce any kind of customs union. This gives the SNP a migraine, because its policy of negotiating membership of the EU for a post-independent Scotland by definition means entering into the EUrsquos Customs Union.And, as we have seen rehearsed atover the last four years in relation to the border on the island of Ireland, Scotlandrsquos membership of the EU would create the need for some sort of check on goods travelling between Scotland and England.The nature of the check, and the hardness of the border, will quite rightly be the subject of debate, but the core problem will not go away, and it is utterly toxic for a nationalist campaign hoping to win over people who are instinctive, often emotional Unionists.It is the sort of issue which turns elections, and referenda. And unlike in Ireland, we canrsquot hide the problem at the bottom of the sea.So what can the SNP do to avoid it  Well, much as those inside the SNP hate to talk about it, even privately, the political reality of its position is that all roads lead to EFTA.The European Free Trade Association has four memberswhich are not members of the EU or its customs union, but are in the single market by virtue of their inclusion in the European Economic Area.It has been made perfectly clear, and is perfectly logical, that an independent Scotland would be welcomed into the group, and there is very little about this route that doesnrsquot make sense for the SNP.Externally, to a nation which showed little unrequited love for the EU before the Brexit referendum ushered in a wave of marches and flag-buying, and which will by then have realised that le outside the EU is not akin to a scene from  Days Later, this is a fairly easy sell. Scotland would be in the free trade area, and would enjoy freedom of movement. But it would not economically self-harm through a customs barrier with its biggest trading partner ndash England ndash and it would not politically self-harm by risking a physical border on Britain.It is, to quote several politicians in the last decade, the best of both worlds.The SNPrsquos largest problem will be the internal sell to a politician and activist base which has become emotionally committed to the EU. Logic doesnrsquot always work in these situations, and they would not be the first set of politicians to place themselves in political harm because they cannot see the wood for the trees.Inevitably, the SNPrsquos leadership would have to present EFTA as a stepping stone to full EU membership. It would say that Scotland would ldquopark in EFTA until free trade and movement were secured both to the UK and to the EU.But, with that highly unlikely to be possible, Scotland would park in EFTA and then throw the car keys in the North Sea. Indeed, it seems perfectly likely to me that Scotland, like Norway, will benefit sufficiently from EFTA membership that the public clamour to rejoin the EU will evaporate, as it has in Norway, which now sees pro-EU polling in the teens.The SNP still has a lot of work to do to persuade the  per cent-or-so persuadables that independence is a good idea. Flag-waving leftism wonrsquot do that. They need to see a competent operation taking sensible decisions. One of those will be a sensible decision on the future relationship with Europe.As the dust settles, it will become politically impossible for the SNP to sell the consequences of EU membership to these people. And so, as we will see in the years to come, it matters not how many lights Donald Tusk leaves on for Scotland.We are not going back in.

He remains in the Oval Office because almost every Republican senator preferred being in power to upholding the democratic principles upon which the US was founded. By Wednesday Mr Trump will have defied justice. He will then be free to continue his campaign of grievance and resentment safe in the knowledge that there is no genuine check on his executive overreach.It goes on to say this week Mr Trump will deliver the State of the Union address from the House chamber where he was impeached in December. He could use the presidency as a bully pulpit to bring out the best in civic le. But he will not. The president wants voters less interested in integrity and empathy. Mr Trump will speak of a \"great American comeback.\" Ever the malignant narcissist, the reference will surely and unmistakably be to himself rather than the country.The TimesIts editorial says to remove Mr Trump from office his accusers needed to show him guilty of \"high crime and misdemeanor,\" which is a lofty bar.In order to make their case, to the American people as much as to the Senate itself, Mr Trumps accusers sought to subpoena further documents and witnesses, perhaps subjecting the latter to televised hearings. \"We must hear from those who were in the room where it happened,\" was how the House impeachment manager Sylvia Garcia put it on Friday, with the last phrase referencing the title of a new book by Mr Tumps former national security adviser, John Bolton. Leaked extracts from Mr Boltons book appear to support allegations against the president, but the Republican-dominated Senate voted against calling new witnesses.

Any serious discussion would need in-depth economic analysis of the static and dynamic benefits of these dferent options.She concluded: ldquoIf, in the end, an independent Scotland negotiated its way back into the EU, it would find itself part, with the other EU member states, of whatever UK-EU trade and security relationship had already been negotiated. Itrsquos clear that, compared to the debate in , Brexit radically changes, in many ways, the implications of independence in the EU.However Dr Hughes also said there had been a political sht in Scotlandrsquos favour because of Brexit, with ldquomore openness to the possibility that Scotland could become independent and apply to re-join the EU.She said: ldquoCertainly, member states with concerns around secession ndash including, but not only, Spain ndash would want to be reassured that any independence referendum was constitutionally and legally valid.ldquoBut, with the UK no longer a member state, and with the ill-will generated by the whole Brexit process, Scotland as a proEuropean, remain-voting country is now seen by EU member statesin a much more positive light.The paper is part of a new report, Brexit and the Union, produced by Edinburgh Universityrsquos Centre on Constitutional Change.Pamela Nash, chief executive of Scotland in Union, said: ldquoThis confirms there is a high risk of a hard border with EnglandScotland leaves the UK.ldquoWith  per cent of our exports going to the rest of the UK, putting up barriers would jeopardise our economy and jobs, particularly under the SNPrsquos plan to scrap the pound.ldquoNicola Sturgeonrsquos inward-looking and negative vision for Scotlandrsquos future would also lead to a barrier between friends, families and neighbours for the first time in centuries.ldquoThe positive future for Scotland based on solidarity and economic growth is to remain in the UK.Meanwhile, it has emerged that a light show projected on the European Commission building in Brussels about Scotland and Europe on Brexit night was paid for by the SNP, not put on by the Commission.The First Minister had tweeted a picture of the \"Scotland Loves Europe\" display with the message: \"The EU Commission building in Brussels tonight \".However the brief show on the Berlaymont building was put on by Edinburgh-based Double Take Projections as a party stunt."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/10983555.jpg?type=article-full","title":"no-buyers-found-worlds-oldest-working-post-office-dumfries-galloway","story":"Sanquhar Post Office in Dumfries and Galloway opened in , eight years before the second oldest in Stockholm, Sweden.The post office, which comes with a three-bedroom cottage, is on the market for pound,, and has not found a buyer since it was put up for sale last autumn.:Worlds oldest working post office in Dumfries and Galloway goes up for saleThe existing owner, Dr Manzoor Alam and his we, Nazra, have run Sanquhar Post Office since  and are retiring at the end of May .Amanda Jones, group retail and franchise network director at the Post Office, said: ldquoI want to thank Manzoor and Nazra for running this truly unique branch for the past five years.ldquoThe opportunity to be a part of postal history doesnrsquot come along very often and any new owner would be only the th person to run Sanquhar Post Office in over  years.ldquoThis branch provides a vital service for the local community ensuring that residents and businesses are able to access cash and do a range of everyday banking all at the counter.ldquoWhile the branch is for sale, customers should be assured that it is business as usual in Sanquhar.The post office is recognised by Guinness World Records as the oldest one in operation.The second oldest, located in Stockholm, opened in  while the third, in Santiago, Chile, opened in .Postal enthusiasts from across the world come to visit the office in Sanquhar, with many keen to have their letters marked with a special handstamp bearing the words ldquoThe Worldrsquos Oldest Post Office.:Headteacher has plans for island school with four pupilsMrs Alam said: ldquoItrsquos heart-breaking that we are selling this post office which has many special memories for my husband and I.ldquoWe have loved our time in Sanquhar and have made many friends in this vibrant community.ldquoWersquove served many of our local customers every day for the past five years as well as meeting people from all over the world who have come to take pictures outside and with us at this historic branch."},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"February ,  at : amOrkney Ferries say that due to technical issues beyond its control, the Kirkwall Shapinsay service has been disrupted as follows: • : sailing Kirkwall Shapinsy was cancelled. • : sailing Shapinsay Kirkwall was cancelled.

But we are built for the long haul.And Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Indiana, was most certain.ldquoSo we donrsquot know all the results, but we know by the time itrsquos all said and done, Iowa, you have shocked the nation, he said.Big WIN for us in Iowa tonight. Thank you!mdash Donald J. TrumpFebruary , ldquoBy all indications, we are going on to New Hampshire victorious.Democrats faced the possibility that whatever numbers they ultimately released would be questioned.And beyond , critics began wondering aloud whether the Iowa caucuses, a complicated set of political meetings staged in a state that is whiter and older than the Democratic Party, are a tradition whose time had past.The party has tried to accommodate critics, this year by promising to report three dferent data points about votersrsquo preferences, presumably improving transparency.But the new system created new headaches.State party spokeswoman Mandy McClure said it had ldquofound inconsistencies in the reporting of three sets of results, forcing officials to try to very results with ldquounderlying data and the paper trail.Some of the trouble stemmed from issues with a new mobile app developed to report results to the party. vw,vw,px, px\"Democratic presidential candidate former Vice President Joe Biden Caucus organisers reported problems downloading the app and other glitches.Des Moines County Democratic chair Tom Courtney said the new app created ldquoa mess.As a result, Courtney said precinct leaders were phoning in results to the state party headquarters, which was too busy to answer their calls in some cases.Organisers were still looking for missing results several hours after voting concluded.Shortly before am, the state party was making plans to dispatch people to the homes of precinct captains who had not reported their numbers.That was according to a state party official in the room who was not authorised to share internal discussions publicly.Earlier in the night, Iowa Democrats across the state cast their votes, balancing a strong preference for fundamental change with an overwhelming desire to defeat Mr Trump.The Democrat Caucus is an unmitigated disaster. Nothing works, just like they ran the Country. Remember the  Billion Dollar Obamacare Website, that should have cost % of that. The only person that can claim a very big victory in Iowa last night is ldquoTrump.mdash Donald J. TrumpFebruary , At least four high-profile candidates vied for the lead in a contest that offered the opening test of who and what the party stands for in the turbulent age of Mr Trump.It is just the first in a primary season that will span all  states and several US territories, ending at the partyrsquos national convention in mid-July.For Democrats, the moment was thick with promise for a party that has seized major gains in states since Mr Trump won the White House in .But instead of clear optimism, a growing cloud of uncertainty and intraparty resentment hung over the election as the prospect of an unclear result raised fears of a long and isive primary fight in the months ahead.One unsurprising development: Mr Trump won the Republican caucus, a largely symbolic victory given that he faced no signicant opposition.The president eagerly seized on the Democratsrsquo problems.ldquoThe Democrat Caucus is an unmitigated disaster, Mr Trump tweeted.ldquoNothing works, just like they ran the Country.He added: ldquoThe only person that can claim a very big victory in Iowa last night is lsquoTrump.rsquoPre-caucus polls suggested Mr Sanders entered the night with a narrow lead, but any of the top four candidates mdash Mr Sanders, Mr Biden, Ms Warren and Mr Buttigieg mdash was positioned to score a victory.America needs a candidate who can beat Donald Trump.In my last race, I flipped  counties blue that Trump won in .Im ready to take him on and unite our country. pic zPAYBNSrImdash Amy KlobucharFebruary , Senator Amy Klobuchar, who represents neighbouring Minnesota, was also claiming momentum, while outsider candidates including entrepreneur Andrew Yang, billionaire activist Tom Steyer and Hawaii Representative Tulsi Gabbard could be factors.ldquoWe know one thing: We are punching above our weight, Ms Klobuchar said late on Monday, promising to keep fighting in New Hampshire.New voters played a signicant role in shaping Iowarsquos election.Meanwhile, ultrabillionaire Mike Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York City, is running a parallel campaign that ignored Iowa as he prepares to pounce on any perceived weaknesses in the field come March.copy -.

She pledged to “live up to our responsibility” to future generations and announced that the Scottish Government would legislate to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to net-zero by , five years ahead of the UK as a whole.As bold and progressive as these targets are, it will require leadership at all levels of government to realise them. Crucially, it will require Scotland’s  local authorities to help address climate change.Councils are the sphere of government closest to our communities. Our unique reach and vast remit of policy areas mean that we have a huge impact across the country. From the businesses that councils choose to support to the planning applications that are approved from the types of houses and public buildings we build to our investment in sustainable transport, roads and paths, local action is critical to our success.: Douglas Millican: Climate change water strategy must stand the test of time: ‘Catastrophic’ climate change is accelerating faster than predictedThis is an internationally recognised conclusion. The Paris climate accord, where  countries agreed to determine, plan, and regularly report on the contribution that they undertake to mitigate global warming, was unreserved in recommending that councils are a core part of the fight against climate change. “The Conference of the Parties recognises the need to strengthen knowledge, technologies, practices and efforts of local communities and indigenous peoples related to addressing and responding to climate change,” it said.Disproportionate share of cutsThis is a call to arms for every local politician in the world, that the fight against climate change will be aided locally, with local government at its heart.This will not be done on the cheap, however. A fight such as this requires the means to be able to do so. Investment in our critical leadership role is required to focus on the transition to a carbon-neutral economy. One that breaks down the barriers our citizens face and creates a new set of opportunities for our workforce.On Thursday, the Government will announce its budget for the coming year. It will be important that it recognises the “climate emergency”. There is a need for a budget to help combat the global emergency – a fight that will not be won when council core budgets are under threat.Over a number of years, local government budgets have decreased signicantly. Between - overall funding has gone down in real terms by seven per cent. In comparison the Scottish Government has had its funding reduced by only two per cent. We are the sphere of government closest to Scotland’s communities, yet we are being passed a disproportionate share of cuts compared to our national counterparts.More funds from UKThe services that are at risk when our core budgets are under threat are exactly the kind that are essential in combating climate change.If we are to encourage our citizens to stop using their vehicles to help reduce emissions, then why would we cut a budget that funds passenger and community transport If we want our homes, public buildings and businesses to use less energy, then why would we cut a budget that provides energy efficiency advice and grants Andwe want to provide our communities with facilities to recycle, then why would we cut a budget for waste services The Scottish Government has a chance to address climate change at every level. We need a fair funding commitment for local government that looks across the whole system. All the signs are that Scotland will see a cash increase from the UK Government, this must be passed on to local government.Strong local leadership will be requiredwe are to truly meet these ambitious  targets. The Scottish Government has a chance to invest in councils so we can develop world-class digital infrastructure, enable the transformation of services and reduce the need for travel so we can enable investment in cleaner, greener public transport and buildings so we can support businesses across all sectors to achieve zero carbon emissions and so we can provide and maintain vibrant green spaces across the country.We cannot afford to look at the local government settlement narrowly. It must be viewed in its entirety to reflect the whole-system approach that is required to tackle and address the biggest challenges facing Scotland and threatening the sustainability of our communities, the communities that councils look after and invest in every day, of every week, of every year.Councillor Steven Heddle is environment and economy spokesperson for the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"why i lament transformation of stockbridge into scene from richard curtis movie aidan smith","story":"Aidan Smith lived in Stockbridge, recently ranked as the least deprived area in Scotland, for five decades and remembers it fondly as a more #edgy# neighbourhood.At the Sunday market, the pheasant-burgers were flying off the shelves. No one was being stung by the nettle moisturiser’s asking price and hot cakes – warmed-up croissants with whisky-laced marmalade, organic of course – were selling like the proverbial.The beautul people were out in force, snuggle-buggled up against the cold as they moved round the stalls – at least when their £ Canada Goose jackets and voluminous scarves weren’t causing a blockage in the lanes. It looked like a scene from a Richard Curtis movie and no one happening across it could have been surprised that Edinburgh’s Stockbridge had just been named the least deprived community in Scotland.Meanwhile, I was trying to remember what the place was like when it was plain and humble Stockaree. On the site of the market there used to be tenements which were pulled down in the s amid high excitement. Kids walking to school for more arithmetic, semolina and the belt had never seen a wrecking-ball do its thing before.: ‘Stockbridge isn’t posh’ - businesses and residents respond to report naming Edinburgh neighbourhood Scotland’s ‘least deprived’ area: Hundreds queue outside Stockbridge Shelter store for January charity saleAcross the street was a toy shop which only seemed to sell plastic and tin weaponry. We were all desperate to own a Johnny Seven – “Seven guns in one … let’s count ’em!” went the ad – but my pocket money would only stretch to a flame-thrower for Action Man. This did nothing, of course, least of all shoot fire. Essentially, as my father would teasingly point out, Action Man was dressing-up dollies for boys. But I never got the accessory home as I was jumped by the Cumbie Street gang and had it nicked.Enviouos, acquisitive and smugHalf a century ago, Stockbridge probably wouldn’t have figured quite so high on the Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivationwhich puts it top of the pops while Greenock languishes in bottom place. Fty-odd years ago, viewed from the perspective of a fur-trimmed Canada Goose hood, you would have called Stockbridge “edgy”. No one used such terminology then, of course. Wherever was home you simply got on as best you could with living, learning which streets to avoid. Now, though, we’re obsessed with league tables and where we figure in them. We crave surveys which tell us how much better we’re doing than some poor schmucks. We get to enjoy European football they suffer relegation.SIMD is supposed to highlight which communities need more help to alleviate poverty and you really hope it fulfills this . But there are critics who argue it’s flawed, that in high-density areas well-off families can be ranked as deprived, enabling them to play the system.Should it be published, though  Or rather, why is it published in full  We should know which areas are at the wrong end and they shouldn’t feel any embarrassment about this. But what’s to be gained from listing the least deprived  If a newspaper turns round the findings and calls Stockbridge the most affluent – not The Scotsman, but a rival title did this – then SIMD starts to read like one of those frivolous lestyle studies or deeply unscientic reports into property trends. Result  More envy, more acquisitiveness, more smugness.I don’t live in Stockbridge anymore. The family suddenly got bigger and we couldn’t afford the larger house we needed. Did I, for the best part of five decades, enjoy the best of it  I’m not going to claim that for fear of being seen as smug but it was certainly dferent.How to pronounce StockbridgeThere wasn’t a branch of Farrow  Ball offering the on-trend, must-have paint colour called Economy Mince, but we had a flea-pit cinema with lax usherettes so we could hide under the seats and watch Raquel Welch in One Million Years BC, fighting T-Rex in a fur bikini, many times over.Where once there was artisan housing along the Water of Leith – trim dwellings built for the working-class by philanthropists – now there are many opportunities to buy artisan bread and coffee from men in beards who don’t seem to be able to afford socks so that’s a link with the past, I suppose.For those of us growing up in EH – when everyone pronounced Stockbridge with the emphasis on the first syllable rather than the second which is the incomers’ way – a rite-of-passage was Madam Doubtfire’s second-hand clothes emporium. Were you brave enough to venture into the basement blackness, down among the mangy cats  Could you ask for something the stone-faced proprietress patently didn’t stock, like a Johnny Seven gun or Cremola Foam  Then could you run away before she hurled her clay pipe at you She wasn’t Stockbridge’s only ‘madam’. For -odd years, Dora Noyce was in the rather dferent business of running a brothel in Danube Street which was hugely popular with sailors dropping anchor at Leith. Some time after she died, when one of my four Stockbridge addresses was just round the corner, I would be stopped by panting men in full naval unorm looking for an Edinburgh attraction every bit as renowned on the high seas as the Tattoo. Gradually Danube Street pulled up its knickers and became respectable. Cumbie Street reverted back to Cumberland Street and the toerags stopped dropping penny bangers in the metal dustbins of New Town residents further up the hill.

I’ll try where I can to find outanybody nearby owns the property. These places are almost always in a bad state of repair – broken windows, roofs and doors missing. “If it’s somewhere that’s been left open you’re not breaking and entering and you’re not going in to commit a crime so you can’t be prosecuted for that either. Michael likes to tell a story through the items that have been left behind“You’re going in at your own risk. If you can’t get in you write it off and move on. Like I say it’s a grey area so I prefer to keep a low profile and let my pictures speak for themselves.”Michael shares the photographs he takes via his Facebook and Instagram pages entitled Forgotten Places NI: “I respect people’s privacy andI’m ever asked to take any photos down I do it straight away.“I do it for the love of old buildings and their contents, it’s as simple as that. It’s a hobby and I don’t try to make any money from it. “I had been taking photos for my own pleasure to start with but when I showed them to other people they said I needed to share them online because they were so good. That’s why I started up Forgotten Places NI.”An old ambulance found at a derelict propertyMichael’s photographs are posted with a short description of the property but little detail about the location unless it’s somewhere that’s easily recognisable. He said he likes to keep his best finds to himself: “I know a couple of other guys who do this. There’s ones who take photographs and sell them. Mine is purely a hobby.“I’ll get messages from other people asking where I’ve been. I don’t always tell them. It’s dog eat dog. It sounds stupid because there’s nothing to gain from it. It’s one-upmanship to find somewhere that no one  has posted about.Orangemen aim toscale KilimanjaroMasonic supports Charity work Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"“I don’t get why people would exchange locations. I don’t see the point. It’s finding the places and not knowing what’s going to be inside that does it for me. If you go somewhere that’s already been documented it takes the excitement out of it.”Most of the properties are in a bad state of repairHe said: “What I do I call it documenting. I go in take pictures and write a wee blurb about the place I’ve been. “Sometimes it’s a property that’s got a ‘for sale’ sign at it. You’ll come back in three months and it’s gone, it’s been flattened for redevelopment. It’s sad because when you’re in it you get a real sense of the character of the house, the essence of it.”Michael said he used to have a penchant for ghost hunting, but with his new pursuit he tries to steer clear of the paranormal: “I used to have a bit of a fascination with paranormal investigation, though I think it had more to do with the old buildings. I love walking round old places as you can pick up so much of the history from just walking around. “I used to do a few paranormal investigations so that gave me an appreciation of old buildings, the character of them, just how dferent they are to the ones now.“With Forgotten Places NI I don’t like to spook things up to be scarier than they are. That said, there’s a post I put up just this weekend about a house that I called the House of Ambivilence. It really did have mixed feeling about it. “It looked lovely from the outside, a nice farmhouse. Downstairs had a nice calm atmosphere, but when you went upstairs, honestly, you wanted to get out again, something just didn’t sit. I felt uneasy about the atmosphere. A well lived in room“That’s not generally the case, mostly you get a good feeling about the place because of the items you find in them – kids’ toys, religious pictures, birthday cards. It’s that connection I like.”Michael’s photos are largely focused on derelict properties in NI but he has also ventured into the Republic of Ireland: “Banbridge is a good location to have as a base. I can be in the south in  minutes, quicker than to get to Belfast.“For me it’s trying to find places that haven’t been documented. Everybody’s done Cairndhuand because of its popularity it has been subject to vandalism. Nevertheless it’s a fascinating place. It doesn’t matter what people do to it.” Michael, who has three children, said: “My daughter would come out with me from time to time for a wee spin. We’d trek up country roads to seewe can find any or maybe I’ll have some place marked to check out. “I’ll maybe read around online about an area to seethere’s any stories relating to old mills, old schools. You can look at satellite images before you go. We’ll maybe have eight or  places marked.“These places that I’m going into, people don’t even know they’re out there. There’s hundreds of them. I mark them on my Google Maps – there’s five or six hundred on there to explore.”Michael said he has a bank of photos stored on his phone that he hasn’t shared yet: “If I didn’t go out for another three months I’d have enough to keep posting. “Looking back at some of my older photos, they aren’t great. I think I’ve got better. “In July or August I had , likes on the page, by December it had doubled, now I’m pushing towards ,. “It’s amazing because I’m not doing anything with it, I’m just publishing photos with a small bit of a story, I’m not promoting it or trying to make money from it.”Michael is quick to point out that he is not the first person to find beauty in the Province’s derelict properties. He said Abandonned NI set the benchmark for this sort of photography.Michael said his obsession was a year-round one: “I’ll be out in winter as well as summer. In winter it’s good because the foilage dies back and you’re able to see things that would previously have been hidden. I remember once crawling through a hole and the hedge to find this property that you’d never know was there.” Asked what led him to begin searching for old houses Michael said: “It was my son who got me started, it must have been about three or four years ago. “He showed me this video on YouTube of a guy in America who was exploring this derelict mansion that used to belong to a drug dealer. “It looked fantastic, all the broken windows and doors hanging off and the stuff that was left inside. “My son said we should try to find something like that here. I said, ‘you’re not going to get something on that scale but we’ll have a look’. “What we did was we went to Cairndhu which is near Larne. It’s pretty much where everybody that does this starts. It’s so well known, it’s such a tragic story of how it fell into such disrepair. It’s so vast. As soon as I got in I was hooked.”Cairndhu which was built around  is the former home of Sir Thomas Dixon. It became a convalescent home before it was closed in .Michael said: “There are people on social media who tell me about a derelict house near to them, sometimes it can be just a shell. For me that’s not that interesting. “What I find interesting is somewhere that has personal possessions still inside. It could be furniture, it could be letters, there’s houses you go into and you’d think people had just walked out and left everything still in it.Michael said his passion was driven more by what people had left behind inside the properties rather than the buildings themselves.He commented: “Some people would look at a man in his forties out exploring the country like this as stupid, but for me it’s just that sense of adventure. “It’s good to be out and about. It’s a healthy interest and no one is harmed.“It’s like how you feel when you’re a kid when you go out exploring. “I’m not sure I was even this adventurous as a kid. Maybe I’m making up for it now.“It’s that excitement of the unknown, that danger of not knowing what you’re going to find. That’s why I do it. “It’s those wee unassuming houses that look like nothing and you go in and they’re just filled with stuff. You find out all about the owners, the le that they led.”Discussing some of the remnants of the past he has uncovered, Michael said: “You see so many of the old Singer sewing machines.“There was one house where I found the shell of a Mk II Jag. I found an old ambulance as well.“For me the best finds are the wee personal things like a Valentine’s card or a kid’s note that says ‘mummy has been mean to me and daddy’ – you’re hoping that was just a wee fleeting moment.”He continued: “I try to capture those items as they sit to tell the story of the house. “I take the photos on my phone, maybe I’ll upgrade to a fancy camera someday though photographers will tell you it doesn’t matter what you use, it’s your eye for a photo.“People say to me they can imagine a story around my posts. In my wee blurb I’ll not give the location away unless it’s a well known building. I’ll just describe it a wee bit as best I can and let the pictures tell the story.”Offering suggestions as to why houses end up derelict yet full of possessions, he said: “A lot of the time you’ll get an elderly person who will pass away, they may have nobody to leave it to or they may leave it to the family and they can’t agree what to do with it so it just sits.“Sometimes you get people who buy the property for the adjoining land but don’t knock down the original property.”Some of the items left behindThe scene in an abandonned kitchenBoots no longer made for walkingThis cupboard remains well stockedAn Evening Prayer"},{"url":null,"title":"orangemen aim to scale kilimanjaro","story":"A dozen Orangemen from Co Down are planning an ambitious trip to Africa during which they will attempt to scale Mount Kilimanjaro.The men from Banbridge District No  have a proud history of undertaking gruelling fundraising ventures, with this particular challenge requiring two years of groundwork.Deputy District Master Stuart Magill said: “In this last  years at Banbridge Orange Hall we’ve raised over £, for dferent causes and charities.“Drumming For Heroes from LOL  has raised £,. They’ve carried a Lambeg drum up to the top of Ben Nevis and cycled from John O’Groats to Landsend with a Lambeg on the back of a bike. “They also did the four peaks of the UK in four days, and walked the route of King Billy from the south of England to Carrickfergus and down to the Boyne, also bringing the Lambeg.”Banbridge Orange Hall is home to several dferent lodges including LOL  and LOL  of which Stuart is a member. “This time it will be our lodge that’s doing Kilimanjaro though we won’t be bringing a Lambeg – it’s going to be hard enough as it is,” he continued. “It’s a follow up to the Walk of Remembrance when we walked  miles from Thiepval Memorial to Menin Gate.”The -year-old added: “It was my idea to climb Killimanjaro. I’ve never done it before, that’s why I want to do it. “There’s  of us doing it. My biggest worry was getting .

There’s a big build to allow us to pay for it, the cost of the trip is coming out of each person’s pocket so that every penny raised is going to the charity. It also gives us plenty of time to train for it, and also to raise money for the two charities.”Two charities are set to benefit – the Children’s Cancer Unit in Royal Victoria Hospital and Angel Wishes which helps children with cancer and supports their families.He said the two charities were close to the hearts of those taking part in the trek as they were good friends with a family from Banbridge who are indebted to the services provided by the organisations.In pictures: NI man finds beauty in derelict properties around the Province Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Stuart said: “The oldest person taking part is in his sixties and the youngest is in his twenties. “The majority of training will be in the Mournes for fitness and stamina, but there’s no training over here really for the altitude.

I want to be in a position to make robust decisions on key issues and I hope Casement will be one of those.”Another key decision for Minister Mallon will be on the York Street Interchange, which was specied as a commitment for the Executive in the New Deal, New Approach document.“There was a procurement process that was challenged. We now have to commence that procurement process again,” she explained.“It certainly is an issue that needs to be addressed. Anyone who travels in that part of the city will know it is hugely congested when it comes to traffic. It is also bad for emissions and the climate which is one of my priorities.“I want to try and progress that but also balance it around connecting people and doing what we can to tackle the climate emergency.“The project is stated as commitment for the Executive but it also features in the New Deal New Approach and I very much welcome that commitment is in there.“Infrastructure is central to the new document and it recogniseswe are serious about transforming lives and ensuring people have real opportunities in areas were people are really struggling then we need to be investing in infrastructure.”As for a possible Glider extending to link South and North Belfast, Nichola saidone of her priorities is “about increasing public transport and people’s access to it”.“I have asked officials for an urgent briefing to see where that is but encouraging people to use public transport and encourage people to walk and cycle are priorities for me.”After three years of no Stormont Executive, Nichola said she is under no illusions to the challenges facing her around Infrastructure, including a huge backlog of work to tackle street lighting, potholes and climate change.“The financial situation that I have inherited is extremely challenging. If you look from , there have been systemic signicant budget cuts to the department.“One of the areas which has been affected has been street lighting and it is something I am very aware of. It is on people’s front doors and gives people a sense of safety and confidence.“If we want to make a dference to people’s lives, we need to address issues like street lighting and pot holes.“I would be hopeful of working with Minister Conor Murphy in the Department for Finance to secure more money to address some of these issues.“Pot holes is a big issue across the North and mainly due to budget cuts to the department. I want to try and address it.“I think we could be doing so much more in Belfast, especially around cycling. We need to encourage and facilitate parents who want to be able to walk their children to school. It will involve safety mechanisms but it is something I want to have a big conversation about with not only my officials but people as well. It is beneficial for the climate but also for people’s physical and mental health.”Asked about many people’s negative attitudes at -hour bus lanes in the city, the Minister stressed she is keeping an open mind but called for better conversations around such controversial issues.“It is about a balancing act. It is about encouraging people to use public transport but in a way to promote local businesses as well.“I have an open-door policy here and I want to engage with everyone. When we all put our heads together, that is when you get to a better place for policies and decision-making.”As for rumours of potential water charges being introduced for residents, she was quick to spell out her position.“The SDLP is opposed to water charges and I have been very quick to say that it won’t be the case under my watch.“I also welcome the fact both the First and Deputy First Minister have come out as well to say it also. I view my role as important in helping struggling families and not to add to their burden.”On a personal level, Nichola is “excited” about her role over the next two years but stressed she will not forget about her local constituents in North Belfast who elected her to Stormont in the first place.“It’s very exciting. It is a very big department. I think a lot of people think it’s just about roads but in actual fact, the department impacts on everyone’s daily lives.“Infrastructure covers things like whether houses can be built or not which is important because we have a housing crisis and other things like waste and water.“When you turn on your water tap, how you travel to and from school and work, MOT to ensure your vehicle is safe, road gritting in winter – all fall within the Department for Infrastructure.“I haven’t forgotten I am here only because the people of North Belfast elected me. I am keen while I take up this role I don’t lose sight of that and continue to be focused also on my constituency and the service I provide.“I will still be a familiar face around North Belfast. The reason that I got into politics is to serve people who put their faith in me.“I won’t lose sight of that and I am very clear that I want to be in the constituency and welcome people to still come to me with their problems and their issues because my job is to try and help them.“I am a parent too and for all parents, it is important to balance your work and your le. I am very lucky I have a supportive family. I look forward to family time and spending time with my children is important but I will do my absolute best in this role.”As for her hopes for her two-year tenure at the helm of Infrastructure, Nichola concluded: “I really want to make the most of these two years. I understand I am coming into a position where we haven’t taken decisions for three years so there is a backlog.“There are huge financial restraints but I really want to make an impact. At the end, I want to look back and ask what did I do to improve people’s lives, better connect people, have a thriving and balanced economy and an improved climate.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"janines wedding day is captured on camera","story":"WELL-known local woman Janine Howard will feature in tonight#s edition of the popular BBCNI documentary series, True North.‘Saving Face’ follows the story of -year-old Janine and her preparations for her marriage to fiancé Matthew Light in October.Janine was just two years old when she was diagnosed with leukaemia. During treatment for the condition, she developed the rare le threatening condition necrotizing fasciitis, also known as the flesh eating disease, resulting in surgeons removing large parts of the soft tissue in her face.Despite the trauma, Janine survived but her story made local headlines back in February  when she approached the North Belfast News for help after suffering abuse on the street and online because of the way she looks.In a heartbreaking interview, she revealed that she’d had to start wearing earphones when she left the house to block out the abuse and insults she was receiving from young people.

He has alerted the relevant authorities. The site is just yards from the St Gall’s GAC clubrooms. Belfast City Council waste bags, household fridges, cemetery headstones, construction rubble, wood and huge amounts of other waste have een dumped on to the land and the massive mound is sliding close to the Ballymurphy Stream.The land is known as Milltown Glen and is situated between Maguire’s Garage, Milltown Cemetery and the Bog Meadows.Michael Culbert of St Gall’s GAC said that the issue of land ownership needs to be claried. “There is a gateway that runs from Milltown Cemetery, a lane, and it’s that land that is being dumped on,” he said. “We want a clean environment, we care about the environment. We have all age groups at St Gall’s, from six-year-olds up and have been in this area for approximately  years. We have never seen the like of this. This is a beautul glen, you have the Bog Meadows and here it’s the epitome of fly tipping. This is going on in the heart of West Belfast and it’s not on. We need someone with responsibility to hold whoever is doing this to account for the contamination of this area. We don’t want the river polluted.“It needs to stop and it needs to be cleared up and now our local councillor Steven Corr has taken up this issue.”Ulster Wildle Nature Reserve Officer Deborah McLaughlin told the Andersonstown News that the dumping has got worse since the start of the New Year.“This is an absolute eyesore and I have contact DAERAin relation to it as a lot of the rubbish will end up in the stream,” she said. “We are concerned at the level of fly tipping going on and concerned for health and safety. DAERA are aware of the issue and at the minute we are waiting to hear back from them.”Local Sinn Féin Councillor Steven Corr said the illegal dumping is “destroying the landscape”.“What we are seeing is a localised environmental nightmare,” he went on. “We are only a few feet away from this stream being contaminated. I can’t get my head around why somebody thinks it’s ok to do this. There are lorry loads of rubbish being dumped down a riverbank, killing wildle as it goes. I’ve never seen anything like this, on this scale, in West Belfast. This is fly tipping on an industrial scale, there is industrial waste on the site, glass, headstones. There is confusion as to who is responsible for the land but we would be calling on the Rivers Agency and the NIEAto work with us. Belfast City Council have offered support as their bags are also being dumped on the site. This land needs to be secured as a matter of urgency.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"martin rings the bell for the final time","story":"THE beginning of February will mark the start of spring and change for one West Belfast primary school principal as he prepares to retire.Holy Child Primary School principal Martin Short, himself a past pupil of the Andersonstown school, will hear the bell ring for the last time this week as he calls an end to the role that he has held for the past  years.“I started at Holy Child in September , I’m a local guy, came from Slemish Way, my three brothers came here, my sister went here, my three grandchildren are at the school now,” he said.“For me to think back then that I’d be the Principal of the school, it never crossed my mind but I’m so proud.”Martin told the Andersonstown News that he always wanted to teach.“I got that from the teaching and education I received at Holy Child, at St Mary’s Grammar School. The expectations in Holy Child are as high as anywhere  in Belfast and that has continued on.”Martin said that there were many moments throughout his career at Holy Child that stand out.“Our standards in literacy and numeracy, I’m very, very proud of those. We received an exceptionally good inspection report in  where there were no areas for improvement.“I took great pride in the whole business of ‘opening up the school’, so that the children could come in earlier for breakfast club, afterschools clubs. I’ve enjoyed working with our parents and the links our school has with the local post primaries in the area.“I think I’ve improved the fabric of the building. I fought to get the new windows installed and the final jigsaw of that project will be completed next month with the new windows in the foyer. We had a new roof, new heating system.“We won the big Gaelic Raffo Cup last year which was a great achievement, our shows, our choir, I’ve always been very proud of the strong links with St Agnes’ parish.”Martin spoke of the challenges he faced as school head.“The big challenge was finance. Budgetary constraints. Also the complexities of the special educational needs that children now encounter and the school having to meet those needs, was a massive challenge – all the while not getting enough funding. The big challenge of mental health within children and the influence of social media. We were three years without an Executive, with no direction from the department and that was a challenge for the school.”While not sailing around the world or taking up golf as part of his retirement plans, Martin explained that he will still be assisting and helping other schools through advisory work with CCMS.“I’ll be onhand to tell people to basically not make the same mistakes I’ve made, we all make mistakes what about trying this, try that and don’t be worrying about that too much.“I have a photo in my office from when I was here as a child, it has always reminded me to keep my feet on the ground and that the children are the most important thing.”When it comes to not pulling into the Holy Child car park next week, Martin said it will be a time of “mixed emotions”.“I will be very sad to leave the children, to leave the staff, the staff have been brilliant, the parents have been brilliant and I will miss that. I’ve done two ‘cycles of seven’,  years but I will be in and out of the school. I’m emotionally attached to this building, I’ve been here since I was four and I’m  now. I’ve loved every minute of it.”"},{"url":null,"title":"petition to save belfast zoo signed by almost","story":"Belfast Zoo. Picture: Google Maps  FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappBelfast Zoo.

The petition directed at Belfast City Council comes after a Sinn Fein motion called for the transformation of the facility into a visitor attraction by . The number of people signing the petition has been growing steadily since the petition was started, with many sharing their reasons as to why the facility should remain.Some said the Cave Hill site should be invested in while others advocated for the zoo#s conservation efforts, saying it does a lot to save endangered species.Sinn Fein#s motion put forward last week said some animals should be ed to their natural habitats in a carefuly crafted phased approach. This was rubbished by people who signed the petition, with one saying to re-introduce these lovely animals to the wild is silly, they will not survive.Another said: The zoo is vital for conservation efforts across the globe, provides valuable work placements for students looking to go into the conservation field and provides excellent learning opportunities to communities and young people. Money needs to be put into the zoo by the council or sold onto someone who will put the money in to make it more accessible , they wrote on the Change.org petition. This would be a great opportunity to work with Queen#s university academics and students to design stimulating enclosures both for the public and animals.Please don#t turn Belfast zoo into a tacky tourist attraction, they pleaded. \"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming f .ece AUTOCROP wh _Chloe_and_Grace_M.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming f .ece AUTOCROP wh _Chloe_and_Grace_M.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming f .ece AUTOCROP wh _Chloe_and_Grace_M.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming f .ece AUTOCROP wh _Chloe_and_Grace_M.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeClose\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming f .ece AUTOCROP wh _Chloe_and_Grace_M.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming f .ece AUTOCROP wh _Chloe_and_Grace_M.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming f .ece AUTOCROP wh _Chloe_and_Grace_M.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming f .ece AUTOCROP wh _Chloe_and_Grace_M.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"Belfast Zoo  FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp At Monday#s council meeting, Castle Councillor Conor Maskey hit out at what he described as silly reactions from other parties and the media#s approach to the recent public debate.As well as ing animals to their natural habitats and transforming the zoo into a visitor attraction, a conservation programme for indigenous animals and a commitment to retaining staff was also put forward in the motion. Councillor Maskey referred to other parties portraying the motion as about locking up the zoo and throwing away the key.He said the approach was far, far, far, from it.He told the chamber: This was never about closing the zoo, it was about properly investing in the site to ensure we are in keeping with a modern and ethical approach to the city and the animals, and doesn#t burden the rate payer.He added, however, in the light of the debate the party would be talking to the council about amending the motion before it is referred to the Strategic Policy and Resources Committee later this month.DUP Councillor George Dorrian confirmed his party#s opposition to the motion after meeting with trade union officials.He said the party wishes to bring about a more sustainable model but that they do not wish to close the zoo.

It even happens on the phone when I answer it #Frances Olive#.I also don#t have any public social media presence because I#ve been forced off it by bullies.For the -year-old former statistician, who has lived in south Belfast for two and a half years, it#s also a lonely road.I#m the oldest of seven children and only two of my siblings are totally accepting and embracing of my identity, said Frances, who has had two surgeries under the NHS and has met the criteria for being legally female.Wearing fashionable glasses with green rims and dressed in a baby pink leather jacket and a long multi-coloured pink and black dress for our interview, stylish Frances is far removed from her previous incarnation.But she said she has always known who I am from my absolute earliest memory, adding that for a long time in my teens I thought I was schizophrenic - or mad, but I didn#t tell anyone.I remember going through puberty and not being physically attracted to boys or girls Indeed, as a young boy, Frances even considered becoming a priest.I remember going through puberty and not being physically attracted to boys or girls so I thought I#d been given a gt from God, she said.So I considered the priesthood and I spent time going to two dferent seminaries in Co Cavan and Co Dublin for quite a while from when I was aged  to . I thought God wanted me for the priesthood and was making it easy for me to cope with a le of celibacy.But after praying for a sign around the age of  he didn#t get one and went home from seminary confused and uninterested in relationships with girls other than as friends.Frank was  when he got married to a girl he went to primary school with and had known all his le. She was also his best friend for decades.The couple, now orced, had two children - son Tim, the -year-old pastor of Omagh Community Church who continues to stand by the person he still calls #daddy# and a daughter with whom she has no current contact. Although they are now estranged, Frances, who#s now a policy advisor for FOCUS: The Identity Trust, said his ex was the first person who knew of his personal struggles.My ex-we knew for a long number of years but I don#t think she recognised the full import of it, Frances said. She misinterpreted the cross-dressing. Suffice to say we both recognised that it was an issue. We did attempt to live with it for approximately  years before I couldn#t survive any longer.When my ex-we discovered my identity we tried to continue on as things were before with the elephant in the room.I embraced it all and tried to be the best possible father, husband, brother and manager. I did the absolute best I could.In  Frances and his ex-we went together to get help from the NHS. That journey ended with an operation that marked the start of the transition. During years peppered with bouts of depression, anxiety, unemployment and social phobia, Frances revealed that she had also attempted suicide three times and had been considering it again before going to her GP in great distress aiming to complete suicide but not wanting to put that burden on my family.Frances was finally officially referred to the regional gender identity service by a consultant psychiatrist in  but relations with his we, whom he no longer sees, broke down in  and they parted ways.My ex always made it very clear that it was totally unacceptable to her that I would cross-dress, that I would express my true identity in public and it was coming to an absolute crisis, she said. The amount of pain that we were both undergoing ... it became impossible for me to bear it any longer and I was literally at the stage of choosing whether to be or not to be.It pains me that my decision to be me has had a fallout on those who I love the mostFrances is extremely conscious of the hurt and turmoil she has caused to her nearest and dearest, who may never come to understand her motivations.It pains me that my decision to be me has had a fallout on those who I love the most in the world, those people I continue to love, she said. The feeling of isolation is at times almost unbearable.But that said, she#s convinced it#s better being Frances than denying her true self.I am immeasurably more comfortable as me, she said. This whole journey has been about resolving my inner conflict and I have done that. I#m totally comfortable in my own identity and I don#t have to fight that any more.Yet there remains the guilt of bringing the challenge of her identity to her son and family.A lot of things happen to transgender iniduals like me and they#re largely down to societal attitudes but they affect the people around me, she admitted. There is transphobia all around me. My ex-we and my family would have experienced that sort of societal transphobia and I feel guilty becauseI wasn#t transgender none of this would be happening. Timothy has been able to transcend all that because he knows the true me.For Frances, though, this rocky road leads to her future path of choice. I always thought I had some sort of a calling, she said. Now I#m convinced my vocation is to shed some light for society for those transgender people yet to be born.I#m still here and the purpose of my being is to help change society#s attitude to people like me and to make people realise we#re not mad and we don#t have two heads.God created us the same way He created everyone .Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseTim and Frances Shiels togetherKevin Scott FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappTim and Frances Shiels togetherTim#s Story: #I accept it as Frances#s reality but I don#t approve of it... we#ve agreed to disagree#Pastor Tim Shiels thought he#d already dealt with everything this world could throw at him.The -year-old had been a homeless drug addict, spent five stints in rehab and tried to take his own le before eventually getting clean and turning his le around.But the Omagh man, who is no stranger to battling for survival, was destined to face yet another bump in the long and tortuous road after his father told him he#d always felt like a woman trapped in a man#s body.I honestly thought I had seen it all, he said. It was around the beginning of . The exact date is a mystery to all of us at this stage - we#ve all been through so much already.But what do you do when your daddy sits down at your kitchen table and essentially tells you that he wants to become your mammy He added: My understanding or ignorance of gender dysphoria was limited to what I#d seen on Coronation Street [with Hayley Cropper, a male-to-female transgender character].Sitting in the lobby of a hotel, with his orced dad who now identies as a female, Frances, the father-of-four and pastor of Omagh Community Church speaks candidly about the shocking revelation from almost eight years ago.I accept it as Frances#s reality but I don#t approve of it, nor do I agree with it. Ultimately, we#ve agreed to disagreeBut Tim, who still calls his father #daddy#, also confided that while he accepts that Frances believes he was always a woman, he refuses to accept his father#s assessment that it#s a medical, rather than psychological, condition.That#s where the tension exists between him and me, he said. I accept it as Frances#s reality but I don#t approve of it, nor do I agree with it. Ultimately, we#ve agreed to disagree.Describing his conflicted feelings following the admission made by his father - who used to be called John Francis, better known as #Frank# - Tim said he was angry and wanted to poke his eyes out.It was a wave of emotion, going from shock into a processing of #What do you mean  That#s nuts. Daddy are you okay #, he recalled.As Frances was sharing this story I remember pausing and asking myself, #What do I do  I#m a pastor, I love God#. So I asked Jesus, #What would you do #That was the default setting for everything  that would follow, and I just felt my spirit telling me #You#ve just got to hold his hand# even though I wanted to run.Tim cannot, however, rememberhe did physically take his father#s hand.Neither one of us can remember the exact moment, he said. I#d like to think I held his hand, but I knew the message was that I had to maintain the relationship and journey with this. It would, however, have been easier to run.That made Jennie very angry. She was counting the cost and the impact of this on the kids.After sharing the news with we Jennie , a midwe, she requested a lead-in time where their children - Sian and Oisin , Aoeand Cadhla- could continue to see Grandad Frank.Frances wasn#t up for that - as far as she was concerned the decision had been made and we had to get up to speed with it, Tim said.That made Jennie very angry. She was counting the cost and the impact of this on the kids.We felt we were being told that this is the beat of the drum, and you#re either in or out.I felt that I#d already made the decision , but everybody  then had to make their own.Tim said that when they told the children they were met with blank faces. He then told them he wasn#t going to force them to be in any relationship they didn#t want to be in.Although Jennie has yet to meet Frances due to all the complexities of the situation, Tim told how the older three children initially decided that they wanted to hang out.We went to a cafe and it was very dficult, he recalled.Frances was described as a man and being greeted as #Sir#... and in their heads everybody was looking at them.So you#ve got an eight-year-old and two  year olds looking at someone who#s supposed to be their granddad but presenting themselves as a female.In the end they all felt it was easier to not engage with the emotion and the abnormality, so now there#s no contactThe reality is their granddad was there, looking like a woman. It didn#t make sense to them, they felt so uncomfortable with and decided it was too much for them.In the end they all felt it was easier to not engage with the emotion and the abnormality, so now there#s no contact.Explaining gender dysphoria to them wasn#t enough to make them understand their granddad#s new persona, as Tim added: I#m  and I still can#t make sense of it.He added: Our youngest journeyed the longest but the turning point for Cadhla was two summers ago when we were walking up the quay on the River Foyle and she found it incredibly dficult and very uncomfortable to have everyone looking at us.Recalling the words the consultant used to describe how his father had been feeling pre-transition - it#s like a cooker standing in the mirror and seeing a fridge - Tim said he accepts the analogy and hopes it will help people understand the complexity of this issue.We#ve got to accept there are people in our community who are suffering like that on a daily basis, he added.In his role as a Church leader, Tim said none of his congregation have rebuked him for his dad#s decision. On the contrary his incredible Church family have been very supportive.As Frances and I have journeyed together, I#m in a more authoritative position to speak into this and I#ve become more public and I#m travelling across the UK and Ireland to speak to churches, he said.More often than not the reality of the Church is that we look at people as problems to be fixed but regardless of how Frances is today, my daddy is not a problem to be fixed.

The South Derry MLA said: The British governments disastrous Brexit policy has caused huge concern among farmers and agricultural producers. On Monday, I was glad to see that the assembly passed an LCM which ensures our support for Westminsters commitment regarding  payments. Confirmation of funding for this year will bring some relief to farmers, but this is unfortunately short term. The Single Farm Payment from the EU represents  per cent of farm incomes and is crucial to the livelihoods of farmers and to the rural economy. In  , the total value of payments awarded to Mid Ulster amounted to pound,,. The idea that this amount of revenue could be removed from the local economy post EU exit is a scary thought.There is huge uncertainty about funding post  and farmers have been kept totally in the dark about their futures, and Mr Poots comments regarding his intention to remove the flat rate system which brought all farmers, whether based in the mountains or on lowlands, to an equal level, is a further worry. Hill farmers are already at a disadvantage, and the flat rate system set about to create a level playing field. On top of this, Mr Poots has indicated that he plans toto a productivity based payment which would further disadvantage hill farmers. It is Sinn Feacuteins position that this would be unfair, and our representatives on the DAERA committee, particularly Chair Declan McAleer MLA, has raised this as a concern with the minister.Sheep farmers in the mountains have already lost the ACN payment, which we are calling for the reinstatement of. Farmers cant plan or invest and many are genuinely fearful for their livelihoods and the future of their farms and businesses. All of this is a consequence of Brexit and the British government dragging us out of the EU against the democratic will of the majority of people here, and is another example of why Brexit is bad for the people of the north. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Police received a report at around .am on Thursday, January , of a suspicious object at Caw Close. The PSNI said officers were on the scene at .am. Officers attended and following a search of the area discovered a second suspicious object nearby. Both objects were then examined by ATO and were declared as small, exploded pipe bomb type devices. A PSNI spokesperson added: “Reports were then received of loud bangs in the area between the hours of pm on Thursday night and midnight. There have been no reports of any injuries with minor damage caused to the front windows of two houses.” googletag.cmd.push DUP MLA Gary Middleton said it was his understanding that police were on the scene earlier but Army Technical Officersdidn’t arrive until pm. “ATO is not based locally and normally takes longer to get here,” he explained. Over the years his party colleague Gregory Campbell has pushed for a bomb squad base to be located in Derry. Thursday’s incident has brought the issue to the fore once again and Mr Middleton said response times would be quickera unit was based in the North West. “It causes a large amount of disruption and people are often put out of their houses for long periods of time. googletag.cmd.push “We don’t want to see any incidents but realistically people still want to cause disruption and that’s the reason we absolutely need the ATO in the North West. It would help clear the area quicker. “There had been a suggestion in the past that it could be at Maydown.” ‘Anger’ SDLP MLA Sinead McLaughlin has also condemned those behind an explosion at Caw Close in the Waterside area of Derry last night. The Foyle MLA said that local people were left distressed and angry as they were forced from their homes by those intent on dragging this community backward. She continued: “Residents in the Waterside area of the city were left distressed and angry today after they were forced from their homes by thugs who left a crude but viable bomb in the area. “Those responsible have nothing to offer this community. We are trying to build a better Derry and acts like this only make that harder. They have to be faced down.” “I would appeal to anyone with information to bring it forward.” Officers would like to thank all those affected by this alert for their patience whilst they worked to keep them safe and appealed to anyone with any information about the incident or anyone who was driving in the area and who may have dash cam footage available to contact detectives in Strand Road on  quoting reference number    . Alternatively, information can also be provided to the independent charity Crimestoppers on    which is % anonymous and gives people the power to speak up and stop crime.

She claims the community psychiatric nurse at Altnagelvin was sending her home until a police officer intervened to insist that she got the help she needed. googletag.cmd.push According to the latest figures available for the Western Trust area,  people are waiting to access to Children and Adolescent Mental Health Servicesservices. The target is that no patient waits more than nine weeks, but  of those iniduals have been waiting in excess of nine weeks, with the longest wait forty-one weeks. In addition, , people are waiting to access psychological therapies. No patient is supposed to wait longer than thirteen weeks, however,  have done so - the longest wait recorded  weeks. It was recently announced that the Stormont executive is to set up a new working group on mental wellbeing and resilience. googletag.cmd.push It is the first time that the executive has collectively demonstrated determination and unity to tackle mental health issues including suicide. Health minister Robin Swann said the issue requires a strategic, coordinated and sustained approach across government departments. Interventions A Spokesperson for the Western Health and Social Care Trustsaid: “Respecting confidentiality the Western Trust does not comment on the inidual treatment and care of its patients. “Those presenting in crisis to an Emergency Department will be seen within two hours by a mental health professional and will have a thorough mental state assessment. This service operates seven days per week across the Trust. “In addition the Trust also operates the Card Before You Leave scheme . This scheme offers next day appointments with a mental health professional for those presenting with a mental health crisis who have been assessed as being low risk of self-harm.” She continued: “Following assessment patients may be offered a range of interventions including admission,appropriate, to a psychiatric bed, referred for follow-up by an appropriate community mental health team, referred to an appropriate community or voluntary organization or discharged back to the care of their General Practitioner. “There are a range of statutory and voluntary services which respond to those with mental health issues in the Western Trust area. “Services in the voluntary sector can be accessed through self-referral or through referral from mental health services, acute services or Emergency Departments. Statutory services are accessed via GP and or Emergency Department referral.”  Crisis intervention service No decision has yet been made on the future of Derry’s Community Crisis Intervention Service based at the Holywell Trust building on Bishop Street.

Creator, Tony McCourt, , said a similar Facebook page exists for the Brandywell area so he felt it was only right to set one up for Creggan.  Within a day it had , members and less than a week later it has amassed over ,. Built in the s, Creggan is one of Derry’s best-known estates. It has been home to an abundance of artistic and sporting talent, including Olympic athletes, a Eurovision winner, a Top Ten rock band and international footballers. googletag.cmd.push In the late s and early s, Creggan became a byword for political resistance all over the world. On the Memories of Creggan Facebook page, people have been sharing cherished photos of relatives, historically signicant portraits of the Troubles, images of friends playing on the street, tales of famed characters from the estate, all sorts of myths and legends true and untrue, and everything in between. Former Creggan residents who have emigrated all over the world, including those from America and Australia, have joined the page to reminisce and share old tales from their childhood. “Everybody is enjoying it,” Tony explained, “they’re all sharing old memories.” googletag.cmd.push Friends contacted Tony to tell him that they can’t get their mothers off the page, one of the ladies is -years-old and is “loving all the old photos so much”. He added: “They’ve said they’re getting no housework done and no wains are being watched because they’re all too busy on the page. People are talking about their schooldays and friends who haven’t been in touch for many years are reconnecting.”  Memories Tony spent most of his childhood in Creggan and lived there until he got married at the age of . His brother, Peggy, still lives in Creggan and Tony has happy memories of “great neighbours and friends”. “The page brings back good memories. Nobody had anything but everybody shared what they had with each other.” The Troubles were never far from peoples’ minds, and people had their own troubles, but Tony prefers to recall the joyful times. “There was a lot of heartbreak at that time. But I like to remember all the positive experiences I had growing up. Playing football in the street all day when there were barely any cars around. “I remember the first TV on the street, it was the Kennedy’s and we used to go in to watch the FA Cup final. I also remember watching Popeye and the Lone Ranger. “I had a bad leg at one time and I remember a friend of mines carrying me to Grianan Fort and back again.” Moving forward, Tony would simply like to see people use the page in a positive way. “There are no real rules, we’re just asking people to keep it clean and to refrain from any insults. “Everyone is finding it funny going through all the old photos and that’s what it’s all about.” With that said Tony was off to the attic to unearth a few more boxes of photographic treasures from his boyhood.  ‘Heroes’ Peggy McCourt has lived in Creggan Heights for sixty-two years, asked what the estate means to him, he proclaimed: “Creggan means community.” He explained: “It was tight-knit no one had very much but what they had they shared be it a cup of milk to a drop of sugar, or can you lend me ma three slices of bread. “We all grew up in the Creggan, most of the families came from the Springtown Camp so hardship was a way of le but they made sure their wains were fed and watered, even going without themselves. “Then came the civil rights movement, then a full-blown war on the streets but again the Creggan community rallied around those who were affected by the conflict. “So many young people were first interned just because they were Catholic, many were arrested, put though interrogation centres and ended up in prison.” Peggy continued: “The hunger strikes took their toll on many families but no matter what went on Creggan grew into the best estate in Derry – in the world. “Growing up was hard at the time we lost so many friends and family members but it was a fun place to grow up, friendships formed that still last to this day. The friends I had sixty odd years ago are as strong as when we first met.  “No video games, all street games, football, rounders, even cricket, hopscotch, all these plus many more sitting out till  or  telling ghost stories, then you ran home the living day lights scared out of you. “Creggan is more than a council estate, its a way of le, its in your blood, we don’t even have to look anywhere for heroes, Creggan is full of them they are called ma’s and da’s.”   If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Born and raised in Derry until the age of , I always had a calling for adventure and opportunity, and it was at this stage in my le I took a huge leap of faith and went in chase of the American Dream. A little Irish girl lost in the big city of New York awaiting my immigration papers is where I learned so many le lessons and character building. At the age of  I stumbled upon a movie The Secret which would eventually change my le and my direction. googletag.cmd.push This movie for me was a beginning, an awakeningyou will. I had opened my eyes to a whole new world of self-belief, ambitions and possibilities. At the age of  I opened my first business which was a Health Care Call Centre. Alongside this I worked for a healthcare administration business which was family run and set up by my mother in New York. Whilst I found great business acumen and skillset in my work, it took its toll on me. The corporate pace and stress fuelled environment was not my fit so I sold my shares in the family business and sold my own business. googletag.cmd.push This was an important and pivotal moment for me in my le where I would embark on a journey of self-discovery and promise. From the beginning of le as I know it until now, I have never known fulfilment like being a mom. Being we to my husband, Dr Frank Dos Santos, and mother to our gorgeous and amazing children and brought me happiness like no other and for this I am eternally blessed and grateful. The le we share together is precious and I value this every day. There came a point for me personally, where I had reached that feeling of fulfilment and happiness and these feelings are what I embrace and evoke everyday in le. Drawing on my previous experiences and knowledge of The Secret as well as the process of le which had led me to this point, spurred me on to find my true passion in le. Helping others. I thought, whatI can pass on these feelings that I’m feeling  WhatI can help others to feel joy, hope and happiness whatever their environment or circumstance  So, in , alongside my business partner Chiara I set up a company Joy In The Workplace whose sole aim was to bring and implement productivity and joy into the workplace. This was my fit. The gratication and sense of fulfilment in helping others became a part of me. I knew I could do this, loved doing it and I did not want to stop here. I knew that feeling of being in a corporate environment and feeling stressed, overworked and unfulfilled and being able to approach and work with iniduals and groups who were in the same position and offer them a road to productivity and happiness in their role was le changing. I wanted to do more. In the Secret Bob Proctor was the clear definitive practitioner for me. I got in touch with the Proctor Gallagher Institute and trained in becoming a PGI Consultant The programmes set by Bob Proctor and Sandy Gallagher are some of the most effective and efficient I have ever seen and I was thrilled to become a part of it and be able to offer coaching to clients in both the U.S and Ireland. I recently was promoted within this company to Senior Coach and Account Executive which now enables me to offer some of the most elite personal development programmes PGI has to offer. Working alongside these esteemed colleagues has been a huge ambition of mine and I have learned so many invaluable skills and ideologies that I cannot wait to share with more and more clients whether personal or in a group setting. As my journey to date describes, I have achieved some great things and I am still achieving and believing every day. But there has been for quite some time, a feeling of wanting to offer something back home. I often would hear stories in the news, and reports from my hometown Derry in Ireland of the suicide epidemic which has been playing on my mind for quite some time. It is with such sadness and despair that I have felt the strong urge to help in some way. Derry is such a beautul town steeped in wonderful facts of history and monument but there is a huge cry for help and I simply cannot and will not ignore this. In understanding these facts, I have purchased a building in the city and will be hosting mindset workshops for both adults and children in the near future. It is never too early to implement positivity and to teach the importance of le and its value. In addition to this my foundation for suicide prevention is well underway as I have been working constructively with a team of like minded professionals from the city in order to structure and further develop and implement this project which I know in my heart will instil a new light of positivity and hope for those going through tough times and needing some guidance. My connection to Derry has been growing as of lately and I have found myself travelling back and forward trying to help in ious ways. Myself alongside Catrina Crillyhave set up “Bee Me LTD” which is the first children’s personal development company of its kind. We will be launching a child friendly app and host Bee Me Camps which will have a fun and friendly environment where children will learn about self-image, empowerment, positivity and how thoughts create things. We’re excited about this project and cannot wait to see it develop. My journey has come with its teachings, its blessings and its le changing moments and I for one would not change any of it. I am at this point in my le where I am seeing my dreams come to reality. I am helping others to see THEIR dreams and make them a reality. My work is not work for me anymore, it is my passion and I feel incredibly lucky to wake up everyday to the le I have and to be able to share my teachings that will help my clients achieve the le they too want. It is my pleasure and my honour. The world is ours and we can think it into whatever we want it to be. And together, we are making it happen.

It’s not an easy thing to do but the plan is on February  and  from pm to pm in the Nerve Centre there will be a photography exhibition, short film showcases and, obviously, a gig. The event will be a creative arts festival following the completion of the Education Authority’s CADi scheme that provides young people with qualications and key skills in the creative arts such as film, live sound, photography, graphic design and events management. Live sound is underlined because, obviously, it’s the most important thing in the world.The festival will contain an exhibition of photography, showcase of short films and two days of music including  bands highlighting the musical talent throughout Northern Ireland. googletag.cmd.push  PICTURED: Megan Watton and Oisin Clenaghan. This celebration of youth culture has been completely organised by the young people involved with the CADi project to showcase youth within the arts. This should be just about enough to keep the adults interested.Featured acts include Villa in FranceGrace Mullan,Vanilla Days, Meeks, Wasted Wild,Juno Hasson and Aimee Tourish, a bit of trad from Jordan Lively and songstress Maya Patterson, all who have been paving their way through the music scene across the north coast and Derry and in recent months.I spoke to one of the organisers, Megan Watton, and first asked what does CADi mean and what made you all want to do it in the first place  “Well, I joined three years ago it stands for Creative And Digital Innovation.“The course is one year and you get an OCN level one, two or three, depending on what age you are which is the equivalent to an A level or GCSE. “I, personally, wanted to do it because it would give me new skills and quality’s I could use in the future. It has been a programme run by the education Authority for three years and the numbers grow each year The Nerve Centre has been a fantastic help as they provide the tutors of each discipline events management, film, photography, graphic design and sound.They also have connections in the music scene which helps when booking bands,” she added. “Just that this programme has aided so many young people with their mental health and self-confidence and the out of school conditions helps. Without CADiI wouldn’t have gotten into my tech course.” Ethan Martin, who also helped organise it, said: “CADi means working with others in a small group to achieve the same goal. It’s been hard as we had to learn how to run an event, the Nerve Centre has been a huge help.”Events manager team member Clodagh McKenna, said: “The CADi Youth Takeover is an event for young people by young people. “It’s a chance to show how talented the youth of Northern Ireland is particularly in its music scene which has so many hidden gems. It also contains amazing work from the photographers, and film makers from the CADi programme.“CADi is a cross community programme aimed to give young people aged - the opportunity to gain skills in areas they wouldn’t usually get an opportunity to within school. “These include photography, graphic design, live sound , film and events management. The bulk of the programme consists of three residential weekends which lead up to the final event.“We’ve worked hard over the past couple of months to produce an event we hope the public will love. CADi really is like a second family to lots of us and you can see that when we come together. “We’ve created friends and memories that will last a letime.” AdultMarty Coyle said: “The CADi courses are a fantastic opportunity for young people to get some real-le experience in arts related subjects whilst gaining a qualication at the same time. “The upcoming two-day event at Nerve Centre will showcase the hard work they have put in throughout the course, showcase their own work as well as presenting a broad demographic of their peers within the arts throughout Northern Ireland”.

The First XV made their experience known at the Foyle College’s Limavady Road campus, dominating both halves with slick passing, clever footwork and powerful drives forward.Foyle had been aiming to cause an upset as the odds of beating the superior Campbell College were stacked against them. Beating Carrick Grammar - at home in Round  of the competition, Foyle’s coaches Ally Ferguson and Neil Stewart will have relished the opportunity to challenge such a highly rated team in the fourth round tie.Having taken Foyle’s players to Limerick to play against quality teams like Crescent College this year, they had logged an impressive win against Rainey earlier this season. Before the game, Foyle Director of Rugby, Paul O’Kane had highlighted the need to perform from the first whistle but it was not to be as Foyle conceded an unconverted try in the opening  minutes.Despite this, Foyle still looked bright with their forwards dominating scrums in the opening stages albeit conceding possession too easily whilst passing out. Campbell College’s lock D. Harkin drove forward brilliantly utilising skilful footwork and Foyle heads dropped as Harkin brought the ball down in the centre of the try line allowing fly half M. Rae to easily convert, widening the score to  points.A misunderstanding between two Foyle players resulted in a collision in collecting a Campbell drop kick and summed up the gulf in quality and experience between the two sides. Another brilliant run forward with slick hands from Campbell College saw centre L. Kenny score a converted try. Campbell College’s quality of passing was what allowed them to get forward so easily, despite Foyle gaining territory regularly, they were unable to match Campbell’s quality meaning they could not make the most of possession.Driving forward  minutes before half time, Campbell’s centre M. Booth gained another try and fly half R. Rae once again confidently converted to bring the half time score to - googletag.cmd.push Half Time -The heavens opened at half time to compound Foyle’s struggles but the squad looked undeterred lining up for the second half. It was in these opening stages that Campbell showcased their strength in a flurry of rucks and mauls, making the most of possession and flanker J. Jeffery scoring a decisive  points. It was the conversion of this try in the second half that sealed Foyle’s fate bringing a dference of  points and the score that would last the rest of the game. Despite the away team’s D. Harkin and J. Jeffrey dominating rucks and winning possession it was then midway through the second half when the intensity of their drives forward dropped. Knowing there was little chance of Foyle coming back in the game Campbell College allowed Foyle to push forward, maintain possession and come closest to scoring the coveted points they so desperately searched for. googletag.cmd.push  PICTURED:Foyle College break forward. A rouse of the crowd and a succession of line outs close to Campbell’s try line saw tensions rise between the two teams, with a resulting ruck ending in flared tempers. The gain of territory and maintaining of possession from the penalising of a number of high tackles from Campbell College proved fruitless for Foyle however with the away side able to break the lines and push Foyle back into their own half.The final whistle at - sealed Foyle’s fate with an exit from the Danske Medallion Shield but the players shouldn’t be too disheartened by the scoreline. This was a quality side they went up against in Campbell College with a wealth of experience to make the most of their dominance. Foyle Principal, Patrick Allen offered his commiserations to the team on social media stating he was, “proud of the commitment and determination shown by the boys.” It will be an incredibly useful learning curve for Foyle who despite exiting the competition will take the tough lessons learned onto the rest of their season. They should eagerly look forward to facing Campbell College again in the future knowing first hand the quality of one of the best sides in the land.

when he ran onto a pass from Marty McCourt to shoot past Blackwood.Forest replaced Kane with Matt McCormick and the young striker almost scored immediately, but was denied by an excellent save from Blackwood whose out-stretched leg prevented a certain goal.In the th minute McCormick did find the net after some excellent approach play from Burkowski.Moments later a superb run from Olympicrsquos Thomas Rogers almost ended with a deserved goal, but his shot flashed over the Forest crossbar.A good performance from Tollymore that resulted in a deserved win, but can they repeat the performance this weekend as consistency is whatrsquos important Best for Tollymore were James Jennings and a remarkable first half performance from Paul Devlin, but in truth it was a good team performance.Match sponsor: Diamond Patrsquos, Newcastle.Tollymore Forest Ballynahinch Olympic III NEWCASTLE LEAGUE DIVISION .prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29th January 2020 Flagship.jpg","title":"Flagship Festival of Flight set to return  ","story":"IT has been confirmed that the Festival of Flight will be ing to Newcastle in June.Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos flagship tourist event will take place on Saturday, June .This festival, which comprises exciting displays both on and off the ground is expected to attract tens of thousands of visitors to the resort.It has not yet been confirmedthe RAF Red Arrows display team will be taking part.The Festival of Flight is part of the councilrsquos lsquoGiant Adventuresrsquo programme of events which was announced this week.They include Wake the Giant in Warrenpoint in August, and Footsteps in the Forest in Slieve Gullion Forest Park.The Councilrsquos tourism programme will also include the DownTime Festival in Downpatrick from June -, the Strangford Lough Skfie Festival from July -August , and the Strangford Lough and the Narnia Festival in Kilbroney Park, Rostrevor, from November -.Council chairman Charlie Casey said: ldquoThese flagship festivals are key events in our programme of tourism events.ldquoWe are very pleased that the Festival of Flight, Wake the Giant and Footsteps in the Forest are all scheduled toto our district in .ldquoThese festivals act as a catalyst to inspire visitors to visit our area.

It has been downgraded to a Type II emergency unit which we believe is not sufficient. The Downe was only one of two hospitals in the past  years which had had its needs fully assessed before it was built.ldquoThere is a clearly established case for a -hour emergency service in Downpatrick operating seven days a week and nothing has happened at the Department of Health or anywhere  to suggest otherwise. Service changes were made in the past due to staffing issues, nothing .Mr McGrady also revealed that changes are planned at the Downe with surveyors visiting the hospital recently to examine where the proposed new MRI scanner will be located.He said the provision of the scanner will result in an extension being built and also open the door to allow the hospital to do so much more in terms of diagnostics and other opportunities,Campaigners also insisted at last weekrsquos meeting that space is needed to reopen  beds closed in the same week of the new Downersquos official opening in , highlighting the need for everyone mdash including politicians and Newry, Mourne and Down Council mdash to work together on this particular issue and that it was time for the ldquoinjustices of the past in terms of local health care provision to be addressed.Mrs Anne Trainor highlighted the lack of investment in local hospital services in the past and said it was time that the Downe Hospital was firmly on the ldquolips of the decision makers and that the local area got its fair share of funding.Looking to the future, she saidthe Downe does become a centre of excellence for the elderly, this will pave the way for other new services to add to those already in place.She also backed calls for more beds to be provided in the Downpatrick hospital and is keen to see the local council taking an active role on health and working alongside campaigners.ldquoHealth is the single most important issue and we have been hammering home this message for years, she declared.ldquoNewry, Mourne and Down Council needs to play a serious role in the delivery of healthcare. The former Down Council put its hands in its pocket to help the hospital campaign but its successor has been lacking in this regard.Mrs Trainor added: ldquoWe want a fully ing hospital that provides this community with the services it needs. We already have an excellent hospital and fantastic staff, but the community deserves what everyone  has.ldquoWe also need to to engage with local medical providers who are the experts.

In addition to her work with children, Laura is also keen to show her support for the work carried out by the charity.Explaining the nature of her work, Laura said that it centres around helping children deal with emotional behavioural problems through play.She has a dedicated toolkit to help which includes sand trays, miniature toys, stuffed toys, hand puppets and books containing therapeutic stories to help deliver the so-called Play  Grow project.A qualied play therapist who is registered with Play Therapy UK, Laura has been working with children since  and previously spent time working in Downpatrick where she did her voluntary placement with Action for Children based at the Ballymote Centre.She explained that the opportunity to set up her new service came about as a result of her volunteering work with Le Change Changes Lives, with her work focusing on children aged between four and .ldquoI work with children who have emotional behavioural problems, those dealing with bereavement and loss or who have separated or orced parents, Laura continued.ldquoI also work with those who have anger of anxiety issues, those who may have become withdrawn, have communication problems or have suffered forms of abuse or nightmares. I also work with those who are being bullied or who are bullies themselves.Laura, who offers a free consultation with parents, said children can release their inner feelings through play.She explained that play is a childrsquos natural medium of self expression, highlighting the number of times children ask their parents to play with them and have a chat. Laura said children feel most comfortable in this environment.ldquoAs play is what children are comfortable with, it makes sense that you would use this method to help them through a dficult time. This is particularly effective for children who cannot or who do not want to talk about their problems.ldquoThey can play out their feelings and problems anda child wants to talk to me here of course they can do that. Some children say that they do not want to talk about whatever trauma is in their lives and I say to them that is great because they do not have to.ldquoHowever, they will still express those feelings through play and may in fact not be aware that this is what they are doing. The metaphor is very powerful in the play therapy room and children can hide behind a mask to demonstrate their feelings and using a puppet is a very good example of that.Laura said her work is a method of helping children with behavioural and emotional problems to help themselves, explaining that is the children do all the work.ldquoI am just here as a facilitator, she said. ldquoPlay therapy is not always fun and sometimes the children will encounter dficult feelings. I adopt a child-centred approach where the child leads the way and the therapist follows which is non directive.ldquoOne of the most important aspects of play therapy is the element of control. For some children when something has happened in their le or environment it is a thing which they cannot control which causes trauma. When they come here, this is the one place they can come in and say lsquoright we are doing this my wayrsquo and it can take back control.Laura described play therapy is ldquonon judgemental and said children know they are in a safe environment and can express themselves in any way in which they will be accepted or who they are.She added: ldquoThe children will learn that while here they can be themselves and they will feel comfortable to be themselves.Laura can be contacted on   or via her social media page..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29th January 2020 New.jpg","title":"New minister at Lissara church  ","story":"A NEW chapter in the history of Lissara Presbyterian Church opened last weekend with the installation of the Rev Alan Burke.A large congregation attended last Friday eveningrsquos service in Crossgar with the new minister looking forward to his time working in the area.For the past two and a half years, Mr Burke was assistant minister at the Loanends and Killead churches near Aldergrove.

She joined the Animal Welfare Party, and, in her sixties and seventies, she travelled across the UK and Europe to campaign for animal rights.ldquoI demonstrated in many places. I went to Brussels twice to protest against the exportation of live animals. The International Fund for Animal Welfare took us in a coach.ldquoI was in the front row of the crowd, up against these spikes and razor wire. If they had started to push from the back, I dread to think what would have happened.ldquoThe night before the protest I had this thought: lsquoThe danger is not to protestrsquo. I wrote it on a little board.ldquoPeople kept tapping me on the shoulder and passing the board around the crowd and eventually it made its way back to me.What does the message mean ldquoIt means that it is more dangerous not to protest against these injustices that are happening.June still has a copy of the placard. Later, at her home, she retrieved it from a trove of scattered paraphernalia accumulated after years of protest.She has written prolically throughout her le about events which have provoked and enthused her. One poem describes the day of protest in Brussels. It reflects Junersquos unceasing dedication to animal welfare but also her frustration at the pace of change:ldquoThe writer of these verses was, quite some time ago, in Brussels with a poster which now rings yet more true. lsquoThe danger is not to protestrsquo is what the message said.ldquoThen round it went to young and old for everyone to read. From countries all round Europe, but the farmers paid no heed. Live transport, a huge issue then, continues just the same.Another poem read:ldquoChristmas is a time to spend, but why not save instead  In sheds around the country to sate the publicrsquos lust for something huge to set their feast. The turkeys just exist.ldquoTen million in this country at Christmas time alone. Is this the way to talk of peace and teach our children love Veganuary runs throughout January.

This offers the membership and the country a broader choice.I am yet to decide who I will back in the forthcoming election but I know that I want to see a vision from each of the candidates. For me, that vision needs to be a realistic reflection of our last decade out of government in Westminster, but also a strategy for reconnecting with our voters and securing a Labour government which can deliver for those who need us most.Finally, I want to thank the staff across the NHS and wider public services for their hard work under increasing pressures, particularly during the winter period.Our public services work hard all year round and many take the sacrice of working over the Christmas and New Year period for which I, and many others, are extremely grateful.As everyou would like to speak with me, you can call my office on    or write to me at Vaughan.Gething@assembly.wales or Office of Vaughan Gething AM, Room C, National Assembly for Wales, CF NA. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We are the most successful part of the UK Labour family over the last decade in terms of winning elections and running a national government. However, that cannot be taken for granted. An unpopular UK leader could make our task much harder next May.The first and most important attribute the next UK leader must have is the ability to fulfil the mission of our party - to become a party of government again across the UK, not just a party of protest. I want someone who can implement our labour values in government, not just talk about them.That requires some honesty about why we took such a beating at the general election, together with the willingness and strength to do something about it. Offering more of the same would be a betrayal of people who need a UK Labour government and will condemn the UK [or what is left of it] to a further decade of the Tories.We didnrsquot get hammered in  for one reason alone - there were a number of them. Agreeing to the election in the first place when we plainly were not prepared. Agreeing to an election certain to be dominated by Brexit. Our vacillation on Brexit when people wanted certainty and leadership. The factional infighting. The demonisation of the last UK Labour government, asthat would encourage people to vote for us.

A costed manesto that then had a huge extra spending pledge added to it, meaning that people didnrsquot believe that we were serious or credible one even the policies they liked. A staggeringly inept UK campaign that wasted the amazing dedication of our volunteers, prepared to go out in the cold and rain to campaign. Our abject failure on anti-Semitism. This and much more.Many people recognised that Boris Johnson is a dishonest man who is completely out of touch with most peoplersquos lives. Lots of people still voted for him or refused to vote Labour because they could not trust and support us. Our own people - long term Labour voters - struggled to support us. Our leader was undeniably part of the reason why. Blaming our defeat solely on the mainstream media or whichever side of the Brexit ide we favour isnt honest and will not help us to win in the future.I donrsquot much care whether someone claims they are from the left, soft left, centre or old right of the Labour Party. We all have a stake in our party and the countries of the UK. These are serious times and we need a serious figure who can nail the Tories and the clown in number ten.Irsquove been interested in what Lisa Nandy has to say and believe that Lisa and many other figures have a key role to play in rebuilding our party ndash first as a credible opposition, then as a credible alternative government at the next UK General Election.However, I think the person best placed to win the argument, and even more importantly to help us win an election, is Keir Starmer. Itrsquos not the protesting, or the taking part that counts. Itrsquos the winning and the decisions you get to make in government that can change peoplesrsquo lives and change the country for the better. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Itrsquos more crucial than ever we re-elect a Welsh Labour Government in . But must also find a new UK Labour Leader who has what takes to unite, win, and ensure the UK Labour Party has a credible vision fit for the world of the s and s ndash and a Leader capable of speaking for and winning the confidence of the whole country.I was delighted to see so many talented and thoughtful colleagues putting themselves forward for election. There are things being said by many that we need to listen to.But, after speaking to many of the candidates personally, and asking them all tough questions - I am backing Keir Starmer for Leader. I think hersquos got what it takes to hold this government immediately and robustly to account to build a team of all the talents and crucially that he has the vision, ideas and credibility to win again.Keir joined me on the streets of Penarth speaking to voters and local businesses during the election campaign ndash and it was clear by the warmth of the reception he received that he is someone who has the immediate credibility and credentials to be our future prime minister, and would work in partnership with Welsh Labour.He has crucial experience of public service and confronting powerful vested interests for the good of the country. He acted to prosecute MPs who had abused expenses and Murdoch journalists in the phone-hacking scandal when he was Director of Public Prosecutions.We need to win back these voters that we lost in the last general election. It was heart-breaking on election night, to see Labour lose places like Wrexham and Bridgend.The UK Labour Party must get back to being a party that votersrsquo can trust. That means we cannot just have a ldquoone more heave approach. We need someone who can speak to the whole of our country, not just one region or subset of voters, with the values and vision to win. Keir fits the bill. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

But we are built for the long haul.And Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Indiana, was most certain.ldquoSo we donrsquot know all the results, but we know by the time itrsquos all said and done, Iowa, you have shocked the nation, he said.Big WIN for us in Iowa tonight. Thank you!mdash Donald J. TrumpFebruary , ldquoBy all indications, we are going on to New Hampshire victorious.Democrats faced the possibility that whatever numbers they ultimately released would be questioned.And beyond , critics began wondering aloud whether the Iowa caucuses, a complicated set of political meetings staged in a state that is whiter and older than the Democratic Party, are a tradition whose time had past.The party has tried to accommodate critics, this year by promising to report three dferent data points about votersrsquo preferences, presumably improving transparency.But the new system created new headaches.State party spokeswoman Mandy McClure said it had ldquofound inconsistencies in the reporting of three sets of results, forcing officials to try to very results with ldquounderlying data and the paper trail.Some of the trouble stemmed from issues with a new mobile app developed to report results to the party. vw,vw,px, px\"Democratic presidential candidate former Vice President Joe Biden Caucus organisers reported problems downloading the app and other glitches.Des Moines County Democratic chair Tom Courtney said the new app created ldquoa mess.As a result, Courtney said precinct leaders were phoning in results to the state party headquarters, which was too busy to answer their calls in some cases.Organisers were still looking for missing results several hours after voting concluded.Shortly before am, the state party was making plans to dispatch people to the homes of precinct captains who had not reported their numbers.That was according to a state party official in the room who was not authorised to share internal discussions publicly.Earlier in the night, Iowa Democrats across the state cast their votes, balancing a strong preference for fundamental change with an overwhelming desire to defeat Mr Trump.The Democrat Caucus is an unmitigated disaster. Nothing works, just like they ran the Country. Remember the  Billion Dollar Obamacare Website, that should have cost % of that. The only person that can claim a very big victory in Iowa last night is ldquoTrump.mdash Donald J. TrumpFebruary , At least four high-profile candidates vied for the lead in a contest that offered the opening test of who and what the party stands for in the turbulent age of Mr Trump.It is just the first in a primary season that will span all  states and several US territories, ending at the partyrsquos national convention in mid-July.For Democrats, the moment was thick with promise for a party that has seized major gains in states since Mr Trump won the White House in .But instead of clear optimism, a growing cloud of uncertainty and intraparty resentment hung over the election as the prospect of an unclear result raised fears of a long and isive primary fight in the months ahead.One unsurprising development: Mr Trump won the Republican caucus, a largely symbolic victory given that he faced no signicant opposition.The president eagerly seized on the Democratsrsquo problems.ldquoThe Democrat Caucus is an unmitigated disaster, Mr Trump tweeted.ldquoNothing works, just like they ran the Country.He added: ldquoThe only person that can claim a very big victory in Iowa last night is lsquoTrump.rsquoPre-caucus polls suggested Mr Sanders entered the night with a narrow lead, but any of the top four candidates mdash Mr Sanders, Mr Biden, Ms Warren and Mr Buttigieg mdash was positioned to score a victory.America needs a candidate who can beat Donald Trump.In my last race, I flipped  counties blue that Trump won in .Im ready to take him on and unite our country. pic zPAYBNSrImdash Amy KlobucharFebruary , Senator Amy Klobuchar, who represents neighbouring Minnesota, was also claiming momentum, while outsider candidates including entrepreneur Andrew Yang, billionaire activist Tom Steyer and Hawaii Representative Tulsi Gabbard could be factors.ldquoWe know one thing: We are punching above our weight, Ms Klobuchar said late on Monday, promising to keep fighting in New Hampshire.New voters played a signicant role in shaping Iowarsquos election.Meanwhile, ultrabillionaire Mike Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York City, is running a parallel campaign that ignored Iowa as he prepares to pounce on any perceived weaknesses in the field come March..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title: Iowa us Democrats have spoken but gremlins delay results of caucus article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

In the last few years Pulse PR has worked with clients include Applegreen, during the roll-out of its first stores in Northern Ireland, jewellery retailer Argento that has over  high street stores in Ireland and one of Ireland’s most iconic gt wear brands, Belleek. And with a business spirit which has helped take root due to her father’s own entrepreneurial background, Grainne’s developed her own firm over the last  years – growing with the changing media landscape, creating communications and marketing strategies, working with tech start-ups from the ground up and building on strong media relationships. “For seven years I had worked with PR agencies and businesses such as Barclays, Tayto and Tesco. I was approaching  and I decided it was now or never,” she told Ulster Business. Networking at Down Royal Racecourse with a pocket full of business cards saw her leave with three clients, and from that, the business was born. Although Pulse PR was initially centred around work with public relations and press, Grainne now works with a lot of start-ups, particularly those within tech – her business is also based at Catalyst, formerly the Northern Ireland Science Park, which is the largest technology park here. One of those she’s now working closely with is IRP Commerce – a £m turnover software development company which made it on to Deloitte’s Technology Fast  list of high growth technology companies seven times. “That relationship started eight years ago with a press release, and now I work with them to target retailers, manufacturers and distributors across the UK, promoting its e-commerce  at national conferences and building strategic relationships with key players in the e-commerce industry. When I started it was very traditional PR, and dealing with newspapers and magazines. Now, it’s also grown further into the digital sphere with online PR, blogging and video testimonials. “I’ve seen a big sht in how my time is spent from when I started  years ago. Although clients still value print coverage, there is definitely a demand to create engaging campaigns for social media. “Because of how the world is changing, I have had to ersy as well. It’s about being flexible and realising the developing trends, and trying to adapt. I’ve always been comfortable in front of the camera or with a microphone in my hand so turned this into a business opportunity to host events, commentate on radio or host  at tech conferences – there is an under-representation of women in this sector so it’s a gap I believe I fill.” As a self-employed businesswoman, Grainne extends her reach with clients by collaborating with freelance photographers, designers and videographers. “You have to get results for your clients. I purposely keep my client list manageable so I’m not competing against myself and I can broaden the scope of activity I do for them,” she says. Grainne also works with Catalyst on its Springboard programme as a marketing domain expert, giving start-up companies assistance when they are bringing their product to market. She says most of her clients come through referrals from other companies she’s been involved with. “Referrals are great as it means I’ve done a good job for the person referring me. I also find a lot of work comes from people I have previously worked with or went to school with. Northern Ireland is known for having two degrees of separation – this also applies in the business world.” She’s also been working with the Ulster Farmers’ Union this year to help promote the organisation’s Open Farm Weekend. It’s an initiative, sponsored by Bank of Ireland UK, to allow members of the public to pay a visit to a farm for the first time. “This is a new sector for me, but the principles are the same – find out the end user and then apply the right marketing tools to engage with them. “It’s about fitting in with a company and how that business thinks – being adaptable and working out what they want, and trying to help them grow. It’s about presenting a strong and clear message, developing strong media contacts and also working across digital and print media to boost reach.” In  years, the media and PR landscape has evolved, including how information is consumed. “But I’m still a firm believer in knowing the basics,” she says. “It’s about having the experience and the education to be able to do it. After my degree and Master’s, I studied to gain additional post-graduate qualications from the Chartered Institute of Marketing. I’m a firm believer in le-long learning. Too many people starting in the industry think all the need is a smartphone and an Instagram account. “It’s competitive, but there’s always enough business for everyone out there. You really just need a few clients and then you turn your focus to them, as well as working with others as and when they come. A few projects naturally ended last year so I’ll be expanding my client list in the coming months. It’s always exciting to start with a new company or entrepreneur. “It’s about being flexible and being aware of what is going on with your clients, and being proactive. Being a sole-trader means you are flexible and can work closely with companies, either in their office or remotely as an extended member of their marketing team. I have often thought about employing more staff, but I believe clients want to see me working on their account, rather than meeting me at the pitch and then being passed over to a junior member of staff. “There’s a great satisfaction in helping an innovative small business, which is set for bigger things, and working alongside them in getting their message out there, building, growing and creating jobs. You really want to work with them and help build their business. “It’s about building the relationships and contacts, and that’s something you can’t teach. People buy from people and I believe one of the reasons I have kept many of the same clients for  years is because I always go the extra mile and am true to my word.” Grainne’s desire  years ago to go it alone with Pulse PR is something she says is very much part of the family story. “My father Malachy is an entrepreneur, a mechanic by trade, but he’s always been able to turn his hand to everything,” she says. My sister Orla was also self-employed as a pharmacist. I’ve been brought up in that environment and we’ve always had support and a ‘can do’ attitude from our mother Geraldine. I had a baby, Gabriel, four months ago but didn’t get the option to take maternity leave. This is the downside of being self-employed, but the flipside means I can work from home when I need to.” As for the next  years, Grainne says it’s about trying to give something back, using her skills to help those who have little or no experience in knowing how to bring their message and products to the fore. “I’m still as passionate about business as I was  years ago. I’m excited to see how I can continue to use my skills to add value to clients to ensure their message and their voice is heard.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail_MM-Photo-1.jpg","title":"manufacturing month ni to showcase strength of sector","story":"Posted on Tuesday  January  by Ulster Business Economy Minister Diane Doods with Manufacturing NIs Stephen Kelly Northern Ireland’s burgeoning manufacturing sector will be showcased as part of a major initiative to highlight the strength and excellence of the industry here.

The revamp is part of the Department of Finance’s Reval – which is a reassessment of the rates system which businesses pay. While still a draft schedule of values, each council will also have to apply its own regional rate, based on the new proposed figures.“The Cathedral Quarter isn’t just about eating and drinking,” Gareth Neill, BID manager, Destination CQ told Ulster Business.“We have a vibrant ecosystem of arts and culture and fantastic built heritage that makes this area stand out, hospitality plays an integral part to the quality of le in this part of Belfast – for a city to be striving to attract new residents, increase our tourism offer these are crucial to the city’s success. “We are concerned about that the potential knock-on effects to the affected business owners and there’s a very real possibility it will have an impact on the price of a pint to the people who come to socialise in Cathedral Quarter. The knock-on effect of outdated methodology for calculation of rates on licensed premiseshas a potentially crippling effect on jobs and character of this area.”A spokesman for Land  Property Services said: “In Northern Ireland, nearly % of pubs will have no change or a decrease in their Net Annual Value .“Any business rate payer who thinks their new valuation may be incorrect, can contact LPS to arrange an informal review and supply any relevant information before the new valuation list comes into force on  April .”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/mip1.jpg","title":"mipim taking belfast to the world","story":"Posted on Friday  January  by Ulster Business Joe ONeill and Suzanne Wylie Belfast Harbour boss Joe O’Neill will help lead a private and public sector delegation to MIPIM – the world’s biggest commercial property event – as chairman of the taskforce. He chats to John Mulgrew about the big announcements, fighting off the competition and attracting a global giant to Northern Ireland For Joe O’Neill and the wider delegation heading to potentially warmer climates, the proposition of selling the city and wider region to major investors has gotten easier.In the five years since Belfast ed to MIPIM – an event which sees tens of thousands descend on Cannes in France for four days of real estate and development – the private and public team, and taskforce, have developed a “strong ” in which to sell the city and Northern Ireland, with hopes of attracting a big name insurance or tech firm on the list.“MIPIM is a great  for the promotion of city-wide initiatives, and demonstrating to investors and to occupiers the growth potential in the city, and the opportunities for them and that the key stakeholders are all aligned behind an appropriate growth agenda,” Joe says.“You see dferent sizes and scales of stands out there – you see some really ambitious stands and proposed developments, so Belfast has to see it’s entry point into that. Belfast first and foremost will be competing against peer group cities within the UK… but then it is a worldwide show, so you will be competing against other cities.”Belfast is leading a major delegation this year, and will also be joined by representatives from other Northern Ireland councils, including those that are part of the Belfast Region City Deal, such as Mid  East Antrim. That deal is also going to be a focus for announcements and development, during the event.This year’s delegation will be led by a host of top private sector developers in Northern Ireland, alongside Belfast City Council and organisations such as Belfast Harbour. That includes Bywater, Wirefox, Titanic Quarter, Tribeca, McAleer  Rushe and Graham Group, along with the two universities and others working within related fields from law, professional services and the supply chain.For Joe and the delegation, MIPIM represents an opportunity to announce some of Belfast and Northern Ireland’s wider major new infrastructure and commercial plans. Previous visits have included the announcement of major offices schemes, hotels and apartment developments.“We will have a series of announcements – some of those announcements will be new, and some will be progress, and demonstrating to investors or occupiers that progress has been madeit’s a multi-year scheme, to show we are delivering.“… we have new projects coming through the pipeline in ious sectors. This year we are looking at launching schemes around digital innovation. That aligns with one of the themes in the Belfast Region City Deal, for the city and councils in the deal. We have a particular focus on cyber-security as an investment and operating location – particular those from the US.”Joe says that would be in addition to the already well-established cyber-security development at Catalyst in the Titanic Quarter, and that new names are coming in to the marketplace creating a “cluster” around the sector, and setting up Belfast and beyond as a new global hub.“We are looking at announcing some details around the Belfast-Dublin-London corridor,” Joe says.“As an economic corridor, or triangle. Post-Brexit, there are clear synergies in developing a proposition where companies can avail of the three locationsthey are looking at a global footprint, and see advantages to locations in three cities.”The issue of increasing connectivity between Belfast and Dublin also remains high on the list – improving the speed and frequency, and making developers aware of the new Belfast Transport Hub, which will transform the city’s rail and bus connectivity when complete.For Belfast Harbour, it’s also bringing the expansion of its already successful film studios to MIPIM, amid further plans to grow and develop the hub to attract big names and become the largest of its kind outside London.“We will be revealing more of our expansion plans, which is being supported by NI Screen,” Joe said. Some of those delivering their own presentations to potential investors will include the Harbour, Belfast City Council, Catalyst and the universities. “We are out looking around, when we are there, at what dferent cities are doing – seeing whether something works well, and looking at our competitive advantage in that area.”As for the strengths and attraction for potential investors, Joe says: “Skills, talent and technology are very much at the fore. Agility as a small region and to be able to respond, and seeing that team Belfast is there and that we are aligned with a particular project. It doesn’t have to be taken back home and introduced to someone .“There is the emergence of Belfast as an attractive city – investment opening up, and people are always looking at new markets. “Part of the initial roll-out when I took on the chair of MIPIM, the role was to go around to ask those who were on board previously to ask about it,it had changed. Everyone noticed and recognised considerablechange over the last four years. “We were pioneering and establishing ourselves four years ago, now they felt we were very much a concerted and effective operating team… the collective was a powerful message, and having  or lunches involving all of the stakeholders at one time. It’s a really strong  to take on the next chapter.”So, for Joe and the rest of the MIPIM delegation, what would be considered a major goal or success on the back of the visit to the commercial property show in March  “A particular focus this year is to attract key institutional investors – the big insurance companies for example. That’s a chicken and egg situation… you need to have product, to have product you have to show that you have occupiers and a steady revenue stream. “What we have been able to say to the investment market is ‘we have product and we now have sustainable occupation coming through… now it feels like the right time for you as an investor, to come in, and to support further investment’.”Asked whether replicating the successes of our neighbours in Dublin in attracting tech giants such as Apple, Facebook and Google is also on the cards, Joe says: “Something like that, or a major investor. For them to do that – a technology or an investment company – they need to see that the public, private and third-tier sectors are all collaborating together to make an effective market, and I think we are good at doing that now.”And the timing couldn’t be better for the delegation – now able to go in with a clear mandate and message with the restoration of the Executive and ato day-to-day power-sharing politics.“The positive thing for us is with the government and secondly, somearound Brexit… it takes those two challenging issues off the table.” πView all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/johnm1.jpg","title":"companies must act quickly on new ir legislation reforms","story":"Posted on Monday February  by Ulster Business At the start of this year the government launched a review into the changes to IR legislation which will affect medium and large private sector organisations and have far-reaching impacts on the way they engage with non-permanent workers, writes John Moore, managing director, Hays NI.The timeframe between the review and the reforms coming into effect in April is shorter than many would have liked but with the reforms now on the horizon, companies need to act, particularly those in sectors such as technology, construction and finance where use of contractors operating as personal services companiesis common. At a basic level, the reforms to IR legislation sht the responsibility of determining the tax status of personal services company workers to the company that engages them where previously they could self-certy. The original rules required the freelance contractor to determine their tax status, but HMRC believed non-compliance was common.Now,a person’s assignment falls outside of IR legislation, they are deemed to be self-employed, so gross payment will be made to the PSC. Butthe assignment falls inside of IR, the professional should be treated as an employee, applying PAYE and NIC deductions from their payment. In simple terms, the tax arrangements for contractors are changing so that they won’t get such a good dealthey can’t demonstrate their work is out of scope and employers will have to pay more for using and keeping what were previously non-payroll workers.This will have a big effect on how people choose to work and who they choose to work for, not to mention how organisations plan and budget. An organisation’s policy towards contractors will affect how attractive they are to freelancers. But on the other side we’ve already seen some risk averse companies adopt a blanket ban on freelancers just to be safe – meaning they are missing out on skilled professionals they need to deliver projects.In Northern Ireland, as where, it’s likely the IR reforms will hit technology hardest, but the effects could be wide ranging across roles in construction, project management and finance.We’ve heard anecdotal evidence of IT contractors leaving the big banks and starting to view early stage tech companies with less than  employees more favourably because they fall outside the scope of the legislation. When similar legislation was introduced in the public sector in , hundreds of highly skilled contractors left roles to join organisations who were prepared, often leading to projects being scrapped. Now the private sector is catching up, preparation is key and anyone who hasn’t done a review of what it means for their capacity should do so urgently. A Hays survey showed % of private sector firms expect cost increases when IR reforms come into effect, % expect to lose key talent and % think it will be harder to bring in non-permanent workers. A third of organisations surveyed were completely unaware of the reforms – a big concern given how tight the labour market is.So, first you need to determine whether assignments are inside or outside of IR. You need to have full visibility of all workers your organisation engages who are paid via agencies and consultancies as well as knowledge of how they are paid. You will also need to have the expertise to determine the tax status of each assignment. When you know that you can then start communicating with freelance workers, renegotiating working arrangements, standardising onboarding procedures and decidingany specialist skills need to be brought in house to get projects over the line.If you expect to use a high volume of temporary workers in , outsourcing your temporary worker provision through a managed services programme could be an option, as an expert would carry out accurate assessments for every temporary worker placed with you.Whatever stage you are at, don’t ignore IR. It’s coming and you need to understand it.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
