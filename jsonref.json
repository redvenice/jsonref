Which I understand.\u0027 He did not go into further detail about how he had hurt his ex, but he had warned earlier in the recording that: \u0027I will kill that b***h if she play with me.\u0027 According to Pitchfork, the recording was obtained from the Miami-Dade county state attorney\u0027s office, and was bad enough that both prosecutors and XXXTentacion\u0027s own defense lawyers were treating it as a confession.        The rapper\u0027s girlfriend Geneva Ayala posted a photo of her injuries from the alleged beating on Instagram at the time (pictured)He asked her to move in with him that night but just two weeks later, she says XXXTentacion  grabbed her phone and smashed it on the floor before striking her in the face after she admired one of her male friend\u0027s grills in a Snapchat video.\u0027I got slapped for no reason,\u0027 the Instagram model told theMiami New Times. \u0027And he kept acting like everything was cool.\u0027 She said he hit her again later that day, allegedly slapping her so hard that she became lightheaded. Then the rapper returned to the room with a barbecue fork and a wire barbecue brush and asked her: \u0027Which one do you want me to use?\u0027 \u0027He told me to pick between the two, because he was going to put one of them up my vagina,\u0027 she said during a deposition given to a prosecutor seven months later.  Alaya said the beatings only got worse when the couple moved to Orlando in June 2016.She told prosecutors that XXXTentacion beat hear every three to four days, choking her, pressing knives or scissors to her face, holding her head under water in the bathroom and promising to drown her.\u0027His favorite thing was just to backhand my mouth,\u0027 she told the Miami New Times. \u0027That always left welts inside my lips.\u0027      Prosecutors presented surveillance video evidence in the death of XXXTentacion that showed when co-defendants Michael Boatwright and Trayvon Newsome got out of their car carrying guns and killed the rapper at the wheel of his $150,000 BMW          A BMW sits idle after reports of a shooting in Deerfield Beach involving Broward rapper XXXTentacion on Monday, June 18Things reportedly came to a head on the morning of October 6, 2016. The couple had recently found out Ayala was pregnant and XXXTentacion was happy with the news. But that day he allegedly threatened to kill her and their unborn child. For 15 minutes, XXXTentacion allegedly \u0027punched, slapped, elbowed, strangled, and head-butted\u0027 Ayala, she told the police. Ayala said her eyes were leaking and she began to lose her vision as she started to vomit. But XXXTentacion forbade their roommates from taking her to the hospital. Instead he left her in a room for two days. She escaped while pretending to make him something to eat, running out of an open side door in the kitchen. XXXTentacion was arrested the next day and charged with aggravated battery on a pregnant victim, domestic battery by strangulation, false imprisonment, and witness tampering.But in November 2017, Ayala signed a document saying she would not testify against XXXTentacion in court. She claims she was forced to do it by the rapper because she was scared of his fans, who he would often invite to court appearances.            XXXTentacion performs during the second day of the Rolling Loud Festival in downtown Miami on Saturday, May 6, 2017  Music streaming service Spotify announced in May 2018 that it would stop promoting or recommending music by him and R\u0026ampB artist R. Kelly as they violated its hateful conduct policy.  This decision was later reversed however after the CEO of Top Dawg Entertainment Anthony Tiffith threatened to pull his label\u0027s music from the service. The popular rap star was fatally shot as he left a motorcycle dealership in Florida on June 18 in an armed robbery.His luxury car was blocked in the parking lot and two masked men, armed with guns, tried to steal his Louis Vuitton bag containing $50,000 in cash. A struggled ensued and the rapper was shot multiple times by one or more gunman, who took the bag and fled, police said. Dedrick Williams, 22 Michael Boatwright, 22 Trayvon Newsome, 20 and Robert Allen, 22, have been arrested and charged in connection with his murder.  XXXTentacion Confessed to Domestic Abuse and Other Violent Crimes in Newly Obtained Secret Recording | Pitchfork"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/29/21/4F49D7DD00000578-0-image-a-5_1535574178136.jpg","title":"Why Kate Middleton not wearing sash state banquet","story":"    Kate Middleton wore a blue-grey Alexander McQueen gown to the state dinner at Buckingham Palace on Tuesday evening          She was seen wearing the Royal Family Order, which depicts Queen Elizabeth II in her youth upon a yellow ribbon while the rest of the family wore the Royal Victorian OrderAn order is given by the Queen to members of the Royal family as an acknowledgement of their service.While Kate, 36, hasn’t had that honor bestowed upon her, she has been given another special recognition which she was proudly wearing pinned to her chest.

But a global outcry, including from the UN and the US, sparked a PR counter-offensive.  Foreign reporters are routinely stopped from accessing Xinjiang and are monitored          The Hotan Vocational Education and Training Center sits behind barbed wire in Xinjiang          Satellite images purported to show the internment camps where Muslim minorities are heldGovernment propaganda insisted the centres were aimed at countering the spread of separatism, terrorism and religious extremism through \u0027free\u0027 education and job training.However, an AFP examination of more than 1,500 publicly available government documents - ranging from tenders and budgets to official work reports - shows the centres are run like jails.To build new, better Chinese citizens, a document argued, the centres must first \u0027break their lineage, break their roots, break their connections, and break their origins\u0027.The centre featured on state broadcaster CCTV last week is one of at least 181 such facilities in Xinjiang, according to data collected by AFP.Participation is voluntary, according to CCTV, which showed contented \u0027students\u0027 wearing matching uniforms, studying Mandarin and learning trades like knitting, weaving and baking.The centres first appeared in 2014, the year that authorities launched a new \u0027strike hard\u0027 campaign against \u0027terrorism\u0027 after deadly violence in Xinjiang.But the buildup began in earnest in early 2017, with local governments in predominantly Uighur southern Xinjiang ordered to speed up the construction of \u0027concentrated educational transformation centres for focus groups\u0027 - a euphemism for the religious, the poor, the uneducated, passport holders, and virtually all men of military age.

The characters on the banner read, \u0027Willingness to spill blood for the people. Countering terrorism and fighting the enemies is part of the police spirit\u0027          China has admitted to the alleged use of internment camps for Muslim minorities in XinjiangShortly after, Xinjiang\u0027s regional government issued regulations on managing \u0027religious extremism\u0027.Extremists could be hiding anywhere, officials warned, instructing cadres to be on the lookout for 25 illegal religious activities and 75 signs of extremism, including such seemingly innocuous activities as quitting smoking or buying a tent.\u0027Detain those who should be detained to the greatest extent possible\u0027, cadres were told.Detentions surged, catching local governments unprepared.In 2017, spending by justice bureaus throughout Xinjiang exploded, driven largely by huge outlays for building and running vocational centres.The offices spent nearly three billion yuan (£334 million) - at least 577 per cent more than planned - according to AFP\u0027s calculations.Counties in the south closed the gap with a special fund earmarked for centres in the region.At least some of that money came directly from the Communist Party\u0027s Central Political and Legal Affairs Commission - the group in charge of the nation\u0027s legal authorities - budget documents showed.  Xinjiang \u0027training centres\u0027 should \u0027teach like a school, be managed like the military, and be defended like a prison\u0027, said one document, quoting Xinjiang\u0027s party secretary Chen Quanguo          Police are seen across Xinjiang as they ramped up their presence in cities and villages          A UN panel says up to one million ethnic Uighurs may be held in Chinese internment campsAround April 2017, local governments began posting a wide variety of tenders related to the facilities.Some orders - furniture, air conditioners, bunk beds, cutlery - would not seem out of place at a typical Chinese university.But others resembled prison equipment: sophisticated surveillance systems, cameras for recording students in their rooms, razor wire, a system for eavesdropping on phone calls, and infrared monitoring devices.The centres also bought police uniforms, riot shields and helmets, pepper spray, tear gas, net guns, stun guns, electrified batons, billy clubs, spears, handcuffs and spiked clubs known as \u0027wolf\u0027s teeth\u0027.At least one centre requested \u0027tiger chairs\u0027, a device used by Chinese police to restrain interrogation subjects.The gear was necessary, party officials in the regional capital Urumqi argued in an emergency request for Tasers, to \u0027guarantee staff members\u0027 personal safety\u0027.Non-lethal weapons, it said, were important for \u0027reducing the possibility of accidental injury in some situations where it is not necessary to use standard firearms\u0027.           On state television, the vocational education centre in Xinjiang\u0027s Hotan prefecture looked like a modern school where happy students studied Mandarin          A police vehicle patrolling the streets near the Id Kah Mosque in Kashgar, XinjiangDespite repeated attempts by AFP, local authorities could not be reached for comment before publication. On Wednesday, Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying questioned the report\u0027s findings but offered no specific denial.\u0027I want to express my strong doubts on whether the situation you described is true,\u0027 she told an AFP reporter at a regular press conference, adding that \u0027I hope you can look at what Chinese officials have said and what the Chinese media has reported.\u0027At the end of 2017, \u0027higher authorities\u0027 issued directions to standardise the facilities\u0027 operations.New \u0027vocational education and training service management bureaus\u0027 were set up, headed by officials experienced in running prisons and detention centres, according to local government websites.Students would be tested on their knowledge of Mandarin and propaganda on a weekly, monthly and \u0027seasonal\u0027 basis, and write regular \u0027self-criticisms\u0027, one bureau wrote in a memo.They would spend their days \u0027shouting slogans, singing red songs and memorising the Three Character Classic\u0027, it said, referring to an ancient Confucian text.Their files lodged in a centralised database, students were sorted into categories based on their offences and levels of accomplishment.

Gaynor Rowles, Vikki Waterman, Lucy Collins and Ms Mali said upfront childcare costs were leaving them with high fees to payThe other mothers highlighted how upfront childcare costs were leaving them with high fees to pay and gaps of weeks before they were repaid under the new system.Vikki Waterman, 34, who has two young daughters, said she had to pay £1,300 upfront for childcare before she returned to work, which the UC system took five weeks to repay.She was also fined £50 by the nursery because a late benefit payment resulted in her being two days behind in paying for childcare.She told MPs: \u0027We don\u0027t want to sit at home when we didn\u0027t plan to be single parents.\u0027We shouldn\u0027t be penalised for that. That is not what we are here for.\u0027We want to be able to go to work and to provide for our own families, and at the minute it seems as if there is a roadblock everywhere we turn.\u0027"},{"url":null,"title":"Newlyweds slammed getting married volcano staging wedding photos Congo","story":"    Travel photographer, John Milton, and his now-wife (both pictured) have been slammed for staging their wedding photos at the top of a volcano in the war-torn Democratic Republic of the Congo          Another photo showed Milton\u0027s wife on her knees by herself as she posed with a gun in her face          Facebook user, Cecilia Christin, a 28-year-old ESL teacher, shared the photos online with the caption: \u0027What in the fresh yt hell is this mayo encrusted bullsh*t?

Maxine Waters and to former CIA director John Brennan via CNN’s HQ in New York – a building where I used to work.All of the recipients, as CNN itself was quick to note, have been openly critical of President Trump, and been regularly verbally attacked by Trump.Was that the reason they were sent ‘functional explosive devices’?Was that the terrorist’s primary motivation?Possibly.We’ll have to wait for the police and FBI to work that out.But let’s not pretend this couldn’t just as easily have been a left wing home grown nutcase targeting right-wing political figures.As I have regularly said, many liberals have been sent completely bonkers by Trump winning the White House and their behaviour has grown increasingly erratic and threatening.Only last week, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell was attacked in a restaurant as he ate dinner with his wife. His shrieking assailant grabbed McConnell’s to-go box from the table and dumped it outside on the sidewalk as other diners cheered.It was a very ugly, intimidating incident, and followed similar ones involving right-wing public figures.This morning, as it was being debated on Fox News, a pundit said: ‘My fear is that intimidation turns to violence.’Literally as he finished saying those words, one of the anchors announced the breaking news of the pipe bombs.You couldn’t have scripted a more ironic, or pertinent segway.And that’s what I mean when I say I’m not surprised by these pipe bombs.We could all sense during the recent frenzied and disturbing Kavanaugh Supreme Court nominee fiasco that partisan politics in America has got completely out of control.There’s no longer any attempt or pretence at fairness, nor any desire to come together for the greater good of the country.Instead, there’s just a constant seething rage on all sides that permeates every pore of political debate, fuelled by social media where everyone competes to shout loudest in their indignant, superior self-righteousness.This kind of rage inevitably leads to real violence, as we’ve seen today.Of course, because these pipe bombs were sent to Trump critics, many in the media are racing to pin all the blame squarely at the feet of the President.I’ll come to him in a moment, because he’s most definitely not blameless when it comes to whipping up violent thoughts.But there are others who should take a long hard look at themselves today too – starting with the accusing media.          Because these pipe bombs were sent to Trump critics, many in the media are racing to pin all the blame on the President. He’s most definitely not blameless, but there are others who should take a long hard look at themselves today too – starting with the accusing mediaI’ve been in LA for the past few days and watched a lot of cable news.It’s been wall-to-wall Trump, and in the cases of CNN and MSNBC, wall-to-wall sneering, mockery and open derision of the President.There’s a specific currency to perpetual Trump-bashing: it sells. Those who trade in it, from cable news networks to newspapers and late night shows, are making vast sums of money from spewing hateful negativity about the President.Now, let me be very clear: as a journalist, I don’t have an issue with Trump being criticised – he is a uniquely isive and polarising figure who flies loose with the truth and loves picking fights and saying or tweeting inflammatory things.As America’s leader, and the world’s most powerful man, Trump must be held to account for everything he says and does.But there has to be some balance too, doesn’t there?I’ve never seen any US president treated as badly as Trump is treated, and that cannot do anything but pour salt on the wounds of a bitterly ided country.Having said that, nor have I ever seen any US president use violent rhetoric as regularly as Trump does.From the moment he first ran as a presidential candidate in 2015, he’s used overtly inflammatory and threatening language.On the day of the Iowa caucuses, he told the crowd he’d pay their legal fees if they decided to ‘knock the crap’ out of protestors.At a Las Vegas rally a few weeks later, he berated security guards for being so soft on a heckler, saying: ‘I wanted to punch him in the face!’Last week, at a rally, he applauded Rep. Greg Gianforte’s physical attack on a journalist by saying: ‘Any guy who can do a body slam is my type!’This would be a bad enough presidential comment at any time, but for Trump to say it hours after it emerged that Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi had been murdered for criticising the Saudi regime, it was outrageous.Trump would argue that many media, Democrats and liberal celebrities constantly abuse and threaten him, and of course he’s right.Robert De Niro screamed ‘F*CK TRUMP’ from an awards show podium and has repeatedly said he wants to beat him up.Comedian Kathy Griffin posed with a severed Trump head for a pathetic photo stunt.Madonna, on the first Women’s March after Trump’s inauguration, said she dreamed of blowing up the White House.All of this nonsense (and we saw similarly unacceptable violent talk from the likes of Ted Nugent about Obama) has conspired to create an atmosphere of raw hatred and toxicity that is deeply damaging to America and I strongly suspect, to the psyche of American people.When someone feels so enraged by political discourse that they send deadly bombs to kill some of the most famous political figures in the country, something is horrifically wrong.When we’re not even surprised it’s happened, then it’s even more worrying.The violent rhetoric has got to stop before it drives more lunatics to do stuff like this.          The violent rhetoric has got to stop before it drives more lunatics to do stuff like this - and it needs to start at the top - with TrumpAnd for that process to begin, it has to start at the top – with Trump.So stop the violent trash-talk, Mr President.Words have meaning, and consequences.You’re not presiding over some fake WWE prime-time extravaganza.You’re President of the United States of America, a great country full of hundreds of millions of very real people living very real lives and relying on you to improve the quality of those lives.But it’s never seemed less ‘United’ and you have it in your power to do something about that.I urge you to do so.You will never Make America Great Again if you can’t unite it."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/10/24/19/4961C43500000578-0-image-a-15_1540406166181.jpg","title":"Gagging order madness Social media guesses injunction businessman be","story":"    A leading British businessman has been granted an injunction preventing the revelation of alleged sexual harassment and racial abuse of staff, it was revealed todayBoth of these scenarios have happened in the past, most famously regarding former Manchester United footballer Ryan Giggs.  A Scottish newspaper named Giggs as a married footballer who hushed up an alleged affair with ex-Big Brother contestant and former Miss Wales Imogen Thomas.

What happens if your choice is not available? Will we have to discuss substitutions with the delivery person?Sainsbury say that one in three Brits are not happy with their sex lives - was it ever any different? Why does a grocery store need to morph into a relationship expert? Why do they think a vibrator is the answer to every woman\u0027s prayer?The people who stand to lose most from this misjudged sales initiative are men. Once women realize that a vibrator with seven speeds doesn\u0027t snore, doesn\u0027t roll over and fall asleep after a couple of minutes\u0027 activity, doesn\u0027t fizzle out (especially if you have a decent supply of batteries) and doesn\u0027t ask if you\u0027ve put on weight, they will be marching off the shelves.Sainsbury might think they are being helpful, but in fact the reverse is true. Once Vibrators are as common as fish fingers and frozen peas, the writing is on the wall for men. In future, they will have limited use as sperm banks.You have been warned. "},{"url":null,"title":"Disgraceful BBC blasted discriminating against women paying less","story":" Strictly Come Dancing presenters Tess Daly and Claudia Winkleman (left), and Question Time presenter David Dimbleby (right), are covered by a loophole which means their salaries go undisclosedAnd MPs said it was disgraceful that the BBC had forced employees to set up personal service companies (PSCs), which has left many with hundreds of thousands of pounds of debt following tax changes.The digital, culture, media and sport committee began an inquiry into pay discrimination at the BBC several months ago following the resignation of its China editor Carrie Gracie and her criticism of its ‘secretive and illegal pay culture’.Its report, which praised Miss Gracie for ‘shining a light’ on the gender pay crisis at the organisation, came after scores of BBC women gave evidence in front of MPs detailing the gender discrimination they had suffered. Republican candidates want Ivanka, Sarah and Kellyanne to...Share this articleOne female presenter was branded aggressive when she complained after discovering her male colleague as being paid 50 per cent more than her.MPs said pay inequality had left women ‘feeling worthless or diminished’.The committee also condemned a loophole that means the salaries of some of those earning more than £150,000 go undisclosed because they are employed by BBC Studios.   Former China editor Carrie Gracie (right) has criticised the BBC\u0027s ‘secretive and illegal pay culture’. Former BBC Look North presenter Christa Ackroyd (left) was in dispute with HMRC over the nature of her BBC contractAs a commercial arm it is not technically covered by transparency rules. MPs said the loophole covers stars such as Strictly Come Dancing presenters Tess Daly and Claudia Winkleman, as well as Question Time presenter David Dimbleby.The report revealed that BBC bosses had rushed to increase women’s salaries just as pay lists were to be published. A TV presenter quoted in the report said: ‘Just before the BBC published pay over £150,000, I was offered an immediate pay rise. It became apparent that for nearly three years I had been sitting next to a man doing an identical job who was being paid tens of thousands of pounds more.’However, even a year after the crisis was blown open, the BBC’s top 10 earners are still men. MPs branded the finding ‘shocking’.Although many women have filed pay grievances, complaints are often subject to long delays and ‘bureaucratic confusion’, the report said. Just seven of the 78 formal grievances submitted by workers had been resolved, MPs said. Many had not received a response within the 90-day deadline promised by the BBC.‘These rates are unacceptable,’ said the report. ‘Staff are spending unnecessarily long periods enduring anxiety about outcomes.’It added that staff now had a lack of faith in management, who were accused of attempting to avoid the problem.‘The BBC’s reluctance to tackle this issue has resulted in a loss of trust between staff and management,’ the report read.Woman’s Hour presenter Jane Garvey said BBC employees are frustrated by the grievance process, which she said was ‘complicated, stressful and time-consuming’.Committee chairman Damian Collins described the gender pay revelations as disturbing.He said: ‘There’s a sense of anger and frustration at how difficult it’s been to raise these concerns – a sense that the BBC has dragged out people’s complaints as long as possible, that people have felt very uneasy about making the complaints in the first place and don’t feel they’ve been supported.’Criticising the lack of action from BBC bosses, he added: ‘Enough is enough, they’ve got to give a commitment that this will all be resolved within six months.’A BBC spokesman admitted the corporation still ‘has more to do’ but said much of the report was already out of date and that it had made ‘real progress’."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/28/16/4EA5DBC400000578-0-image-a-5_1532791884035.jpg","title":"Doctor Year dared turn whistleblower three colleagues","story":"    Peter Duffy (pictured) had his case heard at a tribunal where he claimed he was falsely accused of racism after he exposed some of his colleagues Even now, surgeon Peter Duffy has flashbacks about a particular medical emergency — the patient’s agonised screams, the race to save his life on the operating table.The man in question, in his 40s, had Fournier’s gangrene, a ‘flesh-eating’ infection, and he was deteriorating rapidly, he says.After Mr Duffy, a consultant urologist, performed emergency surgery, it was touch and go for a time, but the patient survived.

He is estranged from the NHS he loved. And there is no hope of reconciliation. He will never work for the NHS again.          Kavinder Madhra (pictured) is under investigation by the General Medical Council on an undisclosed matterHis crime — for that is how he feels it was regarded by his bosses — was to turn whistle-blower against Mr Madhra and two other doctor colleagues, whom he believed were guilty of grave medical negligence. In response, he was labelled a racist.When Mr Duffy found out about the allegations, he knew all was lost. He’d been warned by a colleague when he joined the Trust that the NHS tended to regard racism allegations as ‘guilty until proven guilty’.In 2016, Mr Duffy felt forced to resign after a subsequent pay dispute. Earlier this year, he took the Trust to an employment tribunal.His witness statement described the incident where Mr Madhra played golf instead of dealing with an emergency as well as other allegations against him and two other consultants, Ashutosh Jain and Saleem Naseem.In July, the Manchester employment tribunal found Mr Duffy had been constructively unfairly dismissed and awarded him £102,000 in regard to a dispute over pay, but not over his disclosures.And the nightmare isn’t yet over. He says the NHS is still ‘going after him’. He is being pursued for £48,000 costs and must attend a further hearing next month.          Mr Duffy was forces to quit his job at the Royal Lancaster Infirmary (pictured)‘It has been very stressful,’ he says, in his first interview. ‘I feel a mixture of emotions.‘I can’t believe that after having lost my vocation and having to live and work on the Isle of Man, away from my family, Morecambe Bay is still pursuing me.’ Growing up in Lancashire, Mr Duffy, who is married with three sons aged 21, 18 and 16, originally wanted to follow his father’s career path and become a pharmacist. But a day as a teenager shadowing his father’s golfing partner, a consultant urology surgeon, changed his mind.‘I thought I’d faint, and I did faint. But I loved it,’ he recalls. ‘I said to my parents when I got home: “I’m going to become a urologist.” ’Mr Duffy failed at his first attempt to get into medical school, and while he was studying to have another go, he worked as a theatre orderly and an auxillary nurse at a private hospital in Preston.‘I started out at the coal face. You’re at everyone’s beck and call. You learn an awful lot,’ he says.Mr Duffy studied medicine at Charing Cross Hospital Medical School between 1982 and 1988. He worked at a number hospitals, including in Guildford, Chertsey and Southampton, before joining the Royal Lancaster Infirmary in 2000, and was appointed Clinical Lead in 2003, a position he held until 2010.          Mr Duffy had brought waiting lists down at Furness General Hospital (pictured)He loved his work. He was proud of the department, too, which had a reputation for excellence. ‘I put every effort into building up the department and its reputation.‘By the mid-to-late 2000s, we were being held up as an example of how a modern NHS department should run and won a very prestigious national award.’But then, says Mr Duffy, standards began to fall alarmingly.According to his tribunal witness statement, in 2005, there was that particularly staggering incident when a patient developed Fournier’s gangrene and Mr Duffy says he had to operate while Mr Madhra, the on-call surgeon, played golf.Hospital staff initially made contact with Mr Madhra, who said he would drive urgently to the hospital, but when he failed to appear they were unable to reach him on his mobile phone, according to Mr Duffy’s witness statement.Mr Duffy claims Mr Madhra said the golf club required him to turn off his mobile while playing.According to Mr Duffy’s witness statement, Mr Madhra said he hadn’t come in because he’d been told the patient had a different infection, epididymitis, which he always treated with antibiotics.Mr Duffy says the hospital was also receiving calls from the laboratory saying prostate biopsy specimens taken by Mr Madhra contained no prostate.‘It turned out he (Mr Madhra) had no idea of how to use the ultrasound machine he had been using to do the biopsies over a period of years,’ he said in his statement.‘A colleague and I spent several of our free half days doing all his biopsies again, finding several missed cancers . . . Mr Madhra was suspended.’Then, in 2009, two other Asian consultants, Ashutosh Jain and Saleem Naseem, joined the department. One of them had been appointed by Mr Duffy himself, and he’d voted in favour of the other to join the staff.          Mr Duffy had studied medicine at Charing Cross Hospital Medical School Initially, he got on well enough with them, but over the next few years he began to clash bitterly with them, as well as Mr Madhra. In 2014, Mr Duffy claims there occurred what he describes in his statement as a ‘truly huge clinical error’, again involving Mr Madhra.It concerned a patient who needed to have a kidney removed, but Mr Madhra had listed him to have the healthy one taken out.‘Luckily, I picked up the error immediately before the patient was due to be transferred to theatre. I declared this as a major clinical incident, which it clearly was.’Mr Madhra was suspended for a second time. Three months later, there was another near disaster, Mr Duffy alleges, when a patient in his 60s was ‘completely inexplicably’ discharged by Mr Jain and Mr Naseem with untreated advanced bladder cancer, sepsis and renal failure.He was to be readmitted on Mr Duffy’s operating list in six weeks — time, Mr Duffy says, he really didn’t have. Profoundly concerned, Mr Duffy felt duty bound to report the incidents — and did so — but was terrified of potential consequences.‘I knew, and I was repeatedly warned by colleagues, of the risks,’ he says. ‘But you have to cling onto the morals that took you into medical school in the first place.‘It was heartbreaking to watch the department disintegrate. But I always swore I wouldn’t betray the standards that I had aspired to in my teens and 20s. I was determined that I wouldn’t allow myself to be worn down into cynically tolerating poor and dangerous practice. Not speaking out would have betrayed everything I believed in.’By now, tensions were running high in the department.          Mr Duffy had worked at Furness Hospital (pictured) among others and had previously won \u0027Doctor of the Year\u0027Around November 2014, an anonymous letter was sent to Lancaster police accusing Mr Duffy of racism and saying he had caused ‘much difficulty’ for urology consultants at the hospital.The police passed the letter back to the hospital, but despite the nature of the claims, highly detrimental to Mr Duffy, the hospital management failed to inform him.Instead, he says he heard about the letter from a colleague a few months later. ‘He said he felt I should know,’ says Mr Duffy. ‘I was upset and shocked. My colleague advised that as no action had been taken, it might be best to keep my head down.’It wasn’t until nearly two years later, after he had tendered his resignation, that Mr Duffy learned that, around that time, he had been accused of racism during a meeting.‘I wasn’t told at the time, he says. ‘I was never given the opportunity to defend myself, to say that I wasn’t a racist. That these claims were ludicrous.’So, despite the hostile atmosphere, Mr Duffy resolved simply to try to get on with his job.Then, in December 2014, came an incident that Mr Duffy said he had ‘long dreaded’.A patient had a serious infection, requiring emergency surgery. It was Mr Duffy’s belief that Mr Jain and Mr Naseem had ‘missed an opportunity’ to act two days earlier. Mr Duffy performed the operation — ‘scraping together an anaesthetist and surgical team during everyone’s lunch hour’, but it was too late and the patient died on January 2, 2015.Mr Duffy says the department’s report to the coroner about the death glossed over any missed opportunities. It was, he says ‘unbalanced, out of context and ignored the substantive service failings that probably contributed to the death of the patient’.          Mr Duffy had also worked at Chertsey Hospital (pictured). He had said Mr Jain and Mr Naseem had \u0027missed opportunities\u0027In response to Mr Duffy’s accusations, David Walker, the medical director of University Hospitals of Morecambe Bay NHS Foundation Trust, maintained the Trust has always been ‘open and honest with the Coroner. In the case of Patient A, clinical evidence was provided at the inquest by Mr Duffy and an independent investigation was subsequently conducted with the agreement of the Coroner’.The atmosphere in the department had become unbearable. Mr Duffy had discovered, he says, that overtime payments he was due had been queried and not paid.In 2015, it was agreed he would move to Furness General Hospital, another hospital run by the Trust.With almost farcical timing, in February 2016, he received the ‘Doctor of the Year’ award at a ceremony in Kendal, Cumbria, having been nominated by staff, patients and members of the public.The award ‘celebrates doctors who continuously go “that extra mile”, showing strong leadership and professionalism’. As well as bringing waiting lists down at Furness General Hospital, Mr Duffy ‘was praised for treating all members of the team equally — getting stuck in — even mopping the floor between theatre cases!’          Mr Duffy joined Noble\u0027s Hospital in the Isle of Man (pictured) in December 2016Mr Duffy managed to smile graciously as he received his trophy, but inside, he was marvelling at the irony of it all. In July 2016, by now deeply unhappy, he felt he had no option but to resign.‘I believed in the NHS — it was a shattering outcome, to be forced to submit my resignation.’Feeling deeply betrayed by the NHS, Mr Duffy launched his legal action in October 2016. He is grateful for the support of the British Medical Association, which has paid his legal fees.In December 2016, he joined Noble’s Hospital on the Isle of Man. ‘It’s a beautiful island, and a pleasure to work here, but I’m separated from my family, living on my own, coming back to an empty rented flat every evening.’Mr Duffy believes the NHS needs to change its attitude to whistle-blowers. ‘I don’t feel at all that the NHS is genuine in its pledge to protect whistle-blowers.‘The NHS has always tended to punish or destroy whistle-blowers or tactically look away.‘Once senior managers realise their own jobs will be forfeit if they don’t act over critical care issues, avoidable deaths and whistle-blower retaliation, then — and only then — will there be real culture change.’When contacted by the Mail, the Trust pointed out that Mr Duffy substantially reduced the scope of his claim, meaning that the issues regarding the three Asian doctors were not tested by the tribunal.          Mr Duffy had worked at many hospitals including Guilford Hospital (pictured)The Trust, which still employs Mr Jain and Mr Naseem, ‘continues to work hard’ to ensure a culture where staff can raise concerns without fear and where ‘safety is paramount’.All clinical concerns raised by Mr Duffy were investigated, the Trust said. The Trust was also aware of ‘interpersonal relationship and behaviour issues’ between members of the urology team and took action to remedy concerns.’Mr Madhra, Mr Jain and Mr Naseem all declined to comment."},{"url":null,"title":"Tests nine 10 ham pineapple pizzas sold contained no pork","story":"    Food outlets used thinly slice processed turkey instead of ham according to new testsRevealed: The five towns and an entire city where every...Not so Happy Meals!

They pledged to lift the yoke of Brussels austerity, which has delivered economic disaster in Greece, and threatens to do the same in Italy. And these are no idle boasts from Italy’s firebrand leaders: the Commission is playing a dangerous game because Italy – the third largest economy in the single currency – has the potential to play havoc with the stability of the eurozone.The uncertainty has already sent shivers through the market in Italian government bonds – essentially a measure of the faith international markets have in a country’s economic stability.\u0027It wasn\u0027t a lion\u0027s den, it was more like a petting zoo\u0027:...Labour would cost every family £35,000 May blasts as Corbyn...Tory MP Andrew Bridgen accuses No 10 of making up threats to...Share this articleThere is certainly an argument to be made that the Italian leadership is being unwise in its economic plans. Under the proposed Italian budget, taxes would be cut, spending on the poorest in society would be increased and the state would lower the retirement age.The problem, of course, is that while such measures might appeal to voters, someone has to pay for them, and already the Italian government has the second highest level of national debt in relation to national output inside the EU at 130 per cent of gross domestic product.Yet in the past, Italy has found it relatively easy to run big budget deficits and a large national debt because of the willingness of citizens and the country’s economic institutions to hold large amounts of government debt.          Mario Monti (pictured) had never held any elected office and was charged with implementing an austerity programme The bottom line is that whatever you think of the Italian proposals, it is deeply worrying for Brussels to threaten a sovereign nation over its spending plans.This is not the first time the EU has sought to take control of the Italian economy. After the convulsions in euroland in 2010, the EU insisted that Italy appointed one of its own, a former European commissioner, Mario Monti, as prime minister.A Brussels technocrat, Monti had never held any elected office. He was charged with implementing an austerity programme which has now contributed to Italy’s jobless rate of 9.7 per cent (more than twice the UK’s 4 per cent), and a shocking youth unemployment level of 31 per cent of the workforce.Such appalling unemployment is one of the main reasons Italians turned to anti-Brussels populist parties at the ballot box. So who is going to win this shoot-out? In a budget fight with Italy, Brussels and Frankfurt – home of the European Central Bank (ECB) – must believe they have the upper hand. Recent data from the German-dominated ECB shows that Italy’s banking and financial system is being propped up by almost half a trillion euros (£424billion) of short-term loans, at a time when the German government is one trillion euros (£885billion) in credit. The scale of those Italian debts to Europe’s central bank gives its partners in the single currency great leverage over its affairs, yet the confrontation looks certain to revive anti-euro sentiment in Italy.There will be renewed demands from Italians to leave the eurozone, restore the lira as a national currency and take control over its own destiny.With global markets teetering thanks to Donald Trump’s trade war on China, the current impasse could not come at a worse moment for the eurozone. Yet Brussels is demonstrating that for its unelected officials blind ideology still overrides democracy.

In a daring break, he sprinted across an exposed 800 yard stretch to reach a 25-pound field gun.The gun usually required three men to operate it, and by the time he reached it Labalaba was soaked in blood from a bullet wound to his jaw.             Prince Harry and wife Meghan walked the red carpet at Nadi airport to their awaiting Qantas charter flight          The Duke and Duchess bid farewell to Fiji as they boarded a flight to the nearby Pacific Island nation of Tonga          The royal couple are spending just one night in Tonga before heading back to Sydney, Australia for the closing ceremony of the Invictus Games But the elite soldier, still under heavy fire, spun the cumbersome weapon to face the advancing guerrilla fighters and opened up from close range, decimating them.Ignoring his wounds he continued to hold off the 250 Front fighters for six hours.Captain Mike Kealy and comrades Tommy Tobin and Sekonaia Takavesi also ran the 800 yard gauntlet to try to save the courageous sergeant\u0027s life.They arrived too late, but Labalaba had held off the guerrilla force long enough for the Sultan\u0027s Strikemaster jets to arrive.The jets drove back the attackers while reinforcements from nearby Salalah were organised.In SAS: Operation Storm, a book recounting the battle, fellow trooper Roger Cole wrote that the fight would surely have been lost had Labalaba not taken the 25-pounder.The sergeant was posthumously awarded a Mention in Dispatches for his bravery, and his body was returned to England, where it was buried at St Martin\u0027s Church in Hereford.

This one’s a stinker – suitable only for theatrical rubber-neckers.Jim Broadbent plays Hans Christian Andersen, 19th century author of children’s stories.Apparently he did not devise the stories himself. No. They are the creation of a one-legged, sausage-chewing, Congolese pygmy (Johnetta Eula’Mae Ackles) who is trapped in a box in Andersen’s Copenhagen attic.QUENTIN LETTS: Dutch king on state visit gushed about the EU...QUENTIN LETTS: Cue the Hitchcock music... so much around May...QUENTIN LETTS: Forget about Brexit at PMQs this week – MPs...Share this articleThe production’s programme carries an essay about Belgian colonial atrocities in the Congo.The pygmy may represent Congolese slavery, though why Andersen, who was Danish, is being blamed for the sins of Belgium is not explained. As the audience settles at the start, the pygmy’s box swings left and right like a large clock pendulum.Anna Fleischle’s dark set, draped with hanging puppets, has a nightmarish quality, innocent snow visible through the windows. A taped narration (voiced by gruff Tom Waits) tells us that Andersen is an ‘iconic’ writer. Ugh. Mr Broadbent’s Andersen speaks in a modern British argot, emphatically matey and coarse. Much of what he says is nonsensical.          Jim Broadbent\u0027s latest role will see him transformed into Christian Andersen , the play is running until JanuaryHe announces that he is off to England to stay with Charles Dickens, who may also have a ghost-writing pygmy. Dickens finds Andersen a bore (he’s not wrong) and after five weeks tells his guest to get lost. Actually, he puts it more strongly than that. There are numerous profanities, some uttered by child actors playing Dickens’s offspring.The contrast of their outer innocence and the nastiness of the language may or may not be a comment on western children’s literature.The 85-minute evening is peppered by F and C words, a ‘gyppos’, ‘b******s’, ‘banging the broads’, ‘s***loads’ and a rash of ‘c**k and balls’.Some fool behind me roared with laughter at the first few swear words. After a while even he lost interest.When Andersen returns home he finds that the pygmy has escaped her box and has murdered a couple of blood-smeared ghosts with an accordion which has been turned into a machine gun.Seldom have I surged with such yearning myself to cop a few bullets.Can you murder ghosts? Mr McDonagh certainly shows that you can murder dramatic reputations. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/10/24/16/5336490-6312347-Federal_investigators_are_reviewing_surveillance_video_to_determ-a-9_1540396333777.jpg","title":"Feds trying track SEVENTH suspicious package sent Vice President Joe Biden","story":"Share this articleJoe Biden also reportedly targeted by serial bomber -- and the device may be still in mail systemSweep of Biden home finds no suspicious package"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/afe52592842efe1611eae994268b706ade56bcf2/0_400_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3d509e3464e299dfd7b2a87b6a93bb58","title":"life on the tiny island of migingo in pictures","story":"A rounded rocky outcrop covered in metal shacks, Migingo Island rises out of the waters of Lake Victoria like an iron-plated turtle.

Here’s our roundup of your comments and photos from last week.First up, EstelleMoon, who has had a disappointingly fulfilling experience:Well, as much as I’d like to say I’ve been reading something esoteric and obscure, no, I’ve been reading something incredibly popular. And as much as I’d like to say that the popular thing is overrated and bad, no, in fact, it turns out it’s incredibly popular and incredibly good.I’m talking about Elena Ferrante. I finished My Brilliant Friend a couple of days ago, and I’m now about 100 pages into Volume 2 of her Neapolitan Quartet, The Story of a New Name. They’re so vivid and rich when it comes to detailing this beautiful, frustrating and profound friendship between Elena and Lila, full of love, full of competition, full of resentment, full of life. But they’re also a portrait of a community, of a country coming from fascism, they’re about the urge to break away from the stifling world you grew up in, they’re about masculinity, about family, about politics and so much more – but all these heady themes emerge in the best way possible – ie, organically, through the story and the lives of Elena and Lila.Oh well. Elsewhere, julian6 has enjoyed Mario Vargas Llosa’s early book, The Time of the Hero:This account of the daily struggles and cruelties at a military academy in Peru has sharply etched characters and wonderfully economical descriptive work. Llosa plays with time sequences throughout, moving back and forth, slowly drawing out the painful life journeys of his characters. It is clear-eyed, unsentimental and unfailingly honest, showing its vulnerable, petty, vindictive but not entirely irredeemable protagonists in a raw uncompromising light. The translation brought out the fluency of phrasing, the choice vocabulary. These narrators - for there are many viewpoints in this work, as well as third person - know their world intimately. I was drawn in from the beginning. The sympathy that emerged was never pleaded for or crudely awakened. There is nothing cheap in Llosa’s vision - it is a naked portrayal of diminished lives caught in an unforgiving web of poverty, prejudice and pitiless power structures.A second reading of Life and Fate by Vasily Grossman has impressed Ieuan:Very similar to War and Peace (which was its inspiration – and of similar length and complexity). The manuscript was confiscated by the KGB upon writing and Grossman was told it couldn’t be published for ‘at least 200 years’. A copy was smuggled to the west in the 1980s and published here. It was hailed a masterpiece and (IMHO), it is.The Power by Naomi Alderman gets a nod from koelner:I just finished reading and it absolutely blew me away. I didn’t necessarily agree with how things developed (ie that it would really work out like that if it happened in real life) but it was just so clever, especially the letters between authors at the end. I finished it and immediately had the urge to write an essay on it like back when I was in school. I mean, I didn’t, but there was just so much to think about and comment on and discuss. It really fired my imagination. It would be such a good book to study at school. Really enjoyed it.Meanwhile, The Power and the Glory by Graham Greene has worked for scoopster35:Greene puts you exactly in his world – peasant Mexico, in this case – with no fuss, no flowery prose, just hard, clear, vivid writing.RedmonT recommends The End of Vandalism by Tom Drury:It’s hilarious. Rare indeed that I laugh out loud from a book but I have done several times already. There’s something tragic about it, too.Here’s paulburns on Richard Flanagan’s Death of a River Guide:During an expedition down the Franklin River in northwest Tasmania, Aljaz Cosini, the expedition’s guide, drowns in an attempt to rescue a punter who has fallen into the raging rapids. As he drowns he recalls not only his own life, but the lives of several generations of his relatives, one of whom is a Tasmanian Aborigine. (For those who don’t know, Tasmanian Aborigines are a different type of indigenous people to the mainland Indigenous Australians), and another a convict, whose relatives are ashamed of the ‘convict stain’. At the same time, Flanagan writes in detail and lovingly of travelling down the Franklin River (not the safest thing in the world to do) in a journey beset by tragedy. This is a fine, beautifully written book.I am reading Harry Potter again, this time with my grandson. He is the same age his mum was when the first book was published,when we found it in the library, well before it became A Thing. He pleads for another chapter each time we finish one. ‘You can read this yourself,’ I said. ‘Yes, but it’s funner having you read it so I can imagine it in my head’ he said.

The struggling department store also unveiled a near £500m annual loss as it writes off the value of its brand and the cost of unwanted shop leases and IT systems.Debenhams, which currently has 165 stores and employs 27,000 people, is struggling to adapt as shoppers switch away from the traditional high street towards spending more on leisure activities and to buying online. Nearly a quarter of all spending on fashion purchases is now made on the internet.The company said the closures would take place over three to five years, as it confirmed that a far greater number of its outlets than previously admitted are likely to become unprofitable and need to shut down amid rising costs and heavy competition.Debenhams swung to a pre-tax loss of £491.5m in the year to 1 September, from a £59m profit a year earlier.Sergio Bucher, chief executive, said: “It has been a tough year for retail in 2018 and our performance reflects that. We are taking decisive steps to strengthen Debenhams in a market that remains volatile and challenging. “Working with our new chief financial officer Rachel Osborne, and the board, I am determined to maintain rigorous cost and capital discipline and to prioritise investment to achieve profitable growth. At the same time, we are taking tough decisions on stores where financial performance is likely to deteriorate over time.“With a strengthened balance sheet, we will focus investment behind our strategic priorities and ensure that Debenhams has a sustainable and profitable future.”The retailer said last year that it would close up to 10 stores and has already shut two. It is reducing the size of up to 30 stores, filling unwanted space in big stores with gyms and cafes in a move it hopes will attract shoppers back to the high street. Debenhams also axed a final idend payout to shareholders, saying it would prioritise cash generation and debt reduction in an move first reported by Sky News. The 240-year-old retailer has already issued three profit warnings this year the company is also trying to sell assets in a bid to shore up its finances, including its Danish chain Magasin du Nord. House of Fraser is set to close at least 12 of its 59 stores after being bought out of administration by Sports Direct. John Lewis has admitted that it will make almost no profit in the first half of this year.Sports Direct, which is a major shareholder in Debenhams, is tipped to launch a takeover of Debenhams too if the department store’s financial situation worsens.In September, the Takeover Panel was forced to intervene after a Sports Direct director caused confusion by saying the retailer had considered buying Debenhams – before insisting that he had not intended to make the comment. Sports Direct had to then issue a formal statement confirming that it did not plan to make a bid for the struggling department store chain for six months.But the company reserved the right under Takeover Panel rules to make a bid if there was a “material change of circumstances” at Debenhams, if the company’s board agreed, or if there was a bid from a third party."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7cc63c2bf421f1527b6a318c5b243f386e899fe8/0_58_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=291752e2efcc7093e68087d77bff2c1f","title":"freezing uk tower block was cash cow for foreign investors","story":"Agents at Liverpool flats faced 13 prosecutions last year as housing benefit flowed abroadMill View tower, a 16-storey former council-owned high rise in Toxteth, attracted 13 prosecutions last year for Elite Property Management and Lettings Ltd, a local firm that was managing 13 of the flats. The flats had cost around £60,000 each in 2013 and were all rented to residents claiming housing benefit. The company was prosecuted for licensing offences.The discovery of the building’s story – described as “shocking” by two local MPs – has prompted calls for some landlords to have their properties seized and housing benefit rental payments withheld.When environmental health officers inspected the block in April 2016, 11 out of the 13 flats that were later the focus of the prosecutions were owned by overseas investors – based as far away as Russia, the United Arab Emirates, Singapore and Malaysia.The investigations by the council discovered “hazards of excess cold”, and showed that Elite had failed to obtain licences on the properties it was letting on behalf of its international clients.Elite was prosecuted 13 times for the licensing offences, giving the tower the most convictions under the Housing Act of any building in England and Wales last year, according to freedom of information requests made by the  and ITV News.Frank Field, the independent MP for nearby Birkenhead and chairman of the work and pensions committee, said: “It is deeply shocking and depressing isn’t it? I think it is another example of the weak underbelly of globalisation, where the government is defenceless in trying to defend tenants.”Field said some landlords should have their property confiscated: “This is not just an isolated case. We have therefore got to build up an armoury to protect tenants in the weakest position. That includes withholding housing benefit from landlords and withdrawing their right to own and manage the property. Is it so shocking that these people should lose control over their property?”Dame Louise Ellman, the Labour MP who represents the constituency in which Mill View is located, said: “It’s shocking. It needs some kind of national legislation to stop this taking place.”Joe Beswick, head of housing at the New Economics Foundation thinktank, described the fact that housing benefit has become an international investment opportunity, offering guaranteed returns, as absurd.“The offshoring of the private rented sector is just another layer of absurdity,” he said. “From a relatively stable housing system where the government provided homes for people that couldn’t access them through the market … we’ve now gone to an unregulated system where rents are much higher because UK property has become such an attractive asset to international investors.”Beswick added: “A lot of those rents are finding their way into offshore accounts with, presumably, a higher level of tax avoided on taxpayers’ money.”Mill View, he said, proved that the involvement of international investors in the UK property market – and the problems it had caused – were not confined to London.“The worst thing about it is that while the money is being ploughed in, it is not in any way productive. Investors’ money is not being used to build more affordable homes, it is just being used to buy existing assets. It just increases the competition for homes and increases the cost of homes, with the people of the UK ending up with more expensive houses and no increase in the supply of houses.”Darren Sharkey, the director of Elite, claimed that he did not feel he needed a licence and that the licensing system penalised good landlords but had been unsuccessful in removing “very many rogue landlords”.He claimed that costs such as the ground rents paid by the landlords meant that owning a Mill View flat was not as profitable as it appeared.“We served improvement notices and as a direct result many have had work carried out – and we will continue to enforce the notices to make sure the remainder are done. This is exactly why we introduced landlord licensing”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/05d835fd21bee80005a1867b3ece3f0bead8773f/0_494_7360_4418/master/7360.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=98408cc2fa8ab9c4fbe79c5c51d41af6","title":"government policing of rogue landlords labelled pathetic","story":"Official U-turn after revelation that database is empty and would be secret anywayTheresa May has pledged to give tenants access to the government’s new rogue landlord database after a  and ITV News investigation revealed that not a single name had been entered into the system in more than six months since its launch – and that even when landlords’ names were listed, the public would not be allowed to see them.In a swift U-turn, the prime minister’s official spokesman said on Wednesday: “Our rogue landlord database has only been in place since April and has been warmly welcomed by councils as an important enforcement tool.“As we have said, only offences committed from April this year can be included, and it can take several months to secure convictions. We are clear that we expect to see entries in the database from the new year. We also intend to make information in the database available to prospective and existing tenants.”The government estimated before the launch of the database that there were 10,500 rogue landlords operating in England, and said it expected more than 600 of the worst offenders to be entered into the system.Before the change in policy, the contents of the database had been planned to be kept secret from the public. The government said it was “not in the public interest” to explain why that decision had been made.The secrecy and sparsity of the central government rogue landlord database had contrasted sharply with a separate project run by the mayor of London’s office. The mayor, Sadiq Khan, said the capital’s online “rogue landlord checker” was available to all Londoners and had received more than 1,000 entries from local authorities, although only around 300 are currently viewable as entries expire after a year.He said: “Millions of renters have to put up with totally unacceptable conditions and the government is failing to do what’s necessary to overhaul the outdated system. The government must step up to help renters.”The central government system also possesses much tougher rules for local authorities to enter records of rogue landlords, and some housing experts wonder how many names will eventually make it into the system.John Healey, the shadow housing secretary, said: “It beggars belief – six months after its launch – that none of the more than 10,000 rogue landlords ministers said should be named and shamed have yet been put on their database.“It’s not just renters who lose out when the minister lets landlords off the hook. Taxpayers pay the price too, when millions are being spent on housing benefit to bad landlords letting dangerous accommodation.”The prime minister’s announcement, which did not give a time frame for the move, came as the government’s efforts to police rogue landlords were branded weak following further revelations that found convicted landlords were continuing to operate by exploiting loopholes in the law, which is supposed to protect the most vulnerable tenants. and ITV News revealed on Tuesday that rogue landlords were collecting rent, often funded by taxpayers via housing benefit, despite convictions for housing offences and failing to pass the “fit and proper” person tests required by housing legislation in England and Wales. Because of the way the law is written, this is usually perfectly legal.The Liberal Democrat leader, Vince Cable, said: “It is clear from this investigation that this legislation is too weak and is not being properly enforced. There’s no justification for treating rogue landlords more lightly than other people who break the law.”Housing experts have joined the politicians by also calling for a review of the legislation designed to police the private rented sector.Julie Rugg, a senior research fellow at the University of York’s Centre for Housing Policy, has suggested that the government should rewrite housing legislation from scratch, while a landlord trade body called on Wednesday for a thorough overhaul of the current system.The Residential Landlords Association said councils should use existing powers to ask tenants in rented homes to identify their landlord on their council tax returns, to help prevent rogue landlords from evading scrutiny. The trade body also said that a new housing court should be established to more quickly and effectively deal with cases.While there are numerous pieces of legislation that could be used against rogue landlords, critics say the law contains loopholes and that councils do not always have the resources to effectively enforce."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bfa0411b0e4628144a2fa7da777ae5c572e1c473/0_395_1080_648/master/1080.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dfa2525afed13798da16d4df1c67810d","title":"weloveatl how instagram fell in love with atlanta in pictures","story":"A hashtag that started as a way of promoting local photographers has become a movement of love for the city, with over a million postsAtlanta lives on Instagram as #weloveatl, a hashtag started by three local photographers in 2012 to corral shots of the city on social media for a photography exhibition at Young Blood Gallery. They received more than 5,000 submissions and the show ultimately included 275 photos from over 100 local photographers. But the hashtag has lived on well past that show.In the years since, #weloveatl has turned into a movement, with over 1m posts to the hashtag on Instagram and 69,000 followers for @weloveatl. “If you say #weloveatl, it’s a proclamation, it’s different than identifying where you’re at, it’s saying ‘I love my city’ or ‘we love our city’,” co-founder Tim Moxley said in a 2014 interview.Co-founder Brandon Barr told  Cities #weloveatl is now registered as a not-for-profit corporation to connect, support and boost Atlanta’s photographers, online and off, with exhibitions and installations throughout the city. The aim, he said, was to support local nonprofits and promote the love of ATL.“For us as founders, it’s been exciting to give this platform to the many talented photographers in the city and be constantly surprised by the visual storytelling of this community,” Barr said. “It’s a city constantly writing its own story, and that’s pretty special.”Atlanta continues to make its mark on Instagram.

It was, he wrote, small and polarised, and often either simplistic or incomprehensible. “I’m allergic to light verse because it seems a betrayal of the purpose of poetry. Equally, poetry that sets out to be deliberately opaque is betraying the purpose of language.”One can only assume that a poem launched today by the Children’s Society will bring him out in hives, with its sentimental five-stanza invocation of starlight and candles, and its insistence that “No child should reach out their hand and find nothing No child should ever be left in the snow”. Light a Candle was commissioned from the poet Clare Shaw, and will be sung by choirs across the UK, in a setting by the Royal Academy of Music PhD student Louise Drewett, with an outing on BBC One’s Songs of Praise in early December. Shaw, the Yorkshire-based author of three collections, whose work has been hailed as “startling, searing, scorching”, says this secular, 21st-century descendant of Christina Rossetti’s In the Bleak Midwinter is one of the most taxing things she has ever tried to write.Purists will doubtless argue that Light a Candle isn’t a poem, it’s a song lyric. Even Bob Dylan himself seemed a bit taken aback on learning that he had won the Nobel prize in literature in 2016, opening his will-he, won’t-he acceptance speech with the rather touching admission that, on first hearing the news, “I got to wondering exactly how my songs related to literature.” But times they are a-changing: few such misgivings greeted the recent announcement that Kate Bush is shortly to join Dylan on the library shelves when 40 years of her lyrics are published by TS Eliot’s old firm, Faber.Eliot was once a leader of the grumpy old aesthetes’ brigade, arguing that “poets in our civilisation, as it exists at present, must be difficult”, to the dismay of that young whipper-snapper Philip Larkin, who believed in a poetry for the masses. But before anyone thinks that the author of The Waste Land and Four Quartets would be tossing and turning in his grave, remember this: it is his own Old Possum’s Book of Practical Cats that – through the nifty reverse manoeuvre of the musical Cats – has helped to keep Faber afloat as an independent publishing house.What does any of this have to do with the face-off between “light verse” and poetry that “sets out to be deliberately opaque”? One answer might be that it’s a false opposition. There is good and bad in both quarters, and one reader’s opaque is another’s moonlit field. Another response is that what passes for light verse covers a multitude of possibilities, including a poetry that is capable of building empathy and community in our snarling, fragmented times. “Having come through abuse and familial estrangement myself, I know that music and poetry can be a transformative experience for young people,” says Shaw.Words that touch the hearts of those young people are important not only for them but for poetry itself, bringing in a new generation and buying time for them to orientate themselves and create their own spaces, which they can then fill in regenerative ways. There was an audible buzz when this year’s Forward poetry prize – which Robertson himself has won – was scooped by the black, queer American Danez Smith, whose propulsive debut collection made a thrilling case for the seriousness of popular forms. In the words of one commentator, this was “poetry as fierce fire”.I’d go further and say that, because of its elasticity, poetry is stealing a march on the novel for inclusion and innovation, and that its vigour is backwashing into fiction. Max Porter’s brilliant Grief is the Thing with Feathers is one example: a hybrid work that co-opts Ted Hughes’s Crow motif for a heart-wrenching exploration of family bereavement.And, significantly, the verse novel is having a bit of a moment. Sarah Crossan, the new Irish children’s laureate, has put it to powerful use, most recently in an exploration of the death penalty. (“This book really made me see things in a different way,” wrote a young reader of a previous Crossan novel, One, about conjoined twins.) Then there is Robertson’s own small masterpiece, The Long Take, which was a frontrunner for this year’s Booker prize, with its filmic evocation of postwar America as seen through the eyes of a demobbed soldier. So despair not – for, as Clare Shaw puts it in Light a Candle: “Beyond the horizon, a new sun is rising.”• Claire Armitstead is associate editor, culture for the "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e1d91d8844fc8c466b3c9360a5ee0fcd957c8cc8/1_0_2559_1536/master/2559.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=92e25d58f46256074c2af7face5499d7","title":"trust equal gap rich poor inequality","story":"The gap between rich and poor has been widening for decades, driving a climate of mistrust that harms us allFrom Adam Smith onwards, economists have recognised that trust is the glue that binds societies together. Nations in which people trust each other have stronger institutions, are more open, have less corruption, grow faster and are nicer places to live. Trust is notable by its absence in police states.So it is a matter of concern that trust has become an increasingly rare commodity. In the US, there has been a precipitous drop in faith in the government. Almost four out of five Americans trusted Washington to do the right thing when Eisenhower and John F Kennedy were in the White House. Under Donald Trump, that has fallen to one in five. In Britain, Theresa May is trying to finesse a Brexit deal at a time when parliament is even less trusted than the banks. By a distance, the most trusted institution in the UK is the military. We don’t trust big business, we don’t trust the City, we don’t trust the newspapers – and we certainly don’t trust politicians.Nor is this simply a reaction to the financial crisis of a decade ago, although it certainly has not helped that the supposedly perfect model of free-market capitalism constructed before the crash was based on erroneous assumptions and was operated – in many cases – by self-seeking crooks.When Milton Friedman famously said it was the duty of corporate executives to make as much money as possible, he was careful to add the rider that they still had to play by the rules and abide by ethical customs. This was certainly not the case in Wall Street and the City of London in the early and mid-2000s – and the general public woke up to that fact.But as the Pew Research Center has shown, faith in the US government was going down long before the demise of Lehman Brothers in 2008. Things improved during the Reagan and Clinton booms of the 1980s and 1990s, which shows that the state of the economy is a factor, but the long-term trend has been downwards for over half a century.Similarly, faith in the UK political class was being chipped away at long before the sub-prime housing crisis exposed the flaws in the global financial system. Westminster sleaze under John Major, the war in Iraq (justified by Tony Blair’s “dodgy dossier”) and the MPs’ expenses scandal that undermined Gordon Brown’s government all played a part in poisoning the political well. In some parts of Britain, politicians have been viscerally loathed since the factories and pits were replaced by warehouses and call centres.The link between trust and rising inequality was identified by the US political theorists Eric Uslaner and Mitchell Brown in the early 2000s. Where inequality was higher, the poor tended to feel powerless. Sensing that their views were not represented in the political system, they opted out of civic engagement. What’s more, according to Uslaner and Brown, people’s trust in one other rests on a foundation of economic equality. “When resources are distributed inequitably, people at the top and bottom will not see each other as facing a shared fate. Therefore, they will have less reason to trust people of different backgrounds.”Way ahead of time, this pointed the way to the political earthquakes of 2016: Brexit and the election of Trump. Leavers mistrust remainers, and the feeling is mutual. Liberals on the east and west coasts of the US might as well live in a different country for all that they have in common with those struggling in the rust belt states.It is not hard to see why this has happened. There has been a stupendous increase in pay at the top, which has only sometimes been justified. Economic performance, as demonstrated by growth rates, productivity increases and rates of investment, has deteriorated. The financial sector was allowed to exploit an “anything goes” regime to enrich itself. The recovery from the great recession was the least fair in modern history, with the bulk of the gains going to those at the top. Meanwhile, the message to the less well off was to get a better diet, pack up smoking, drink less and generally buck their ideas up. All things considered, it’s not surprising that voters in Britain did not buy George Osborne’s “we’re all in it together” shtick, nor that voters in the flyover states found Hillary Clinton a tad patronising.In a recent speech to mark the opening of a new school of business and society at St Mary’s University, Andrew Bailey – the City’s regulator – put it this way. “In essence, the system that operated from the Great Depression until the 1980s relied on the legacy of the 1930s and an almost unstated code in society that the remuneration of senior executives should not increase beyond a quite limited multiple of average pay ... to breach this relationship would be viewed as ostentatious and breaking a norm that acted as a glue in society more broadly. I would go further and argue that this formed the basis of trust, with an expectation of future behaviour and a common value or ethic.”This sounds right. A more permissive approach to top pay has led to a loosening of the bonds that hold society together. The argument that there is a trade-off between economic dynamism and less inequality doesn’t really wash. Innovators came up with great new ideas when societies were more equal. What’s more, there are countries that are both highly competitive and egalitarian.Sweden is one such country. It has proved capable of growing just as quickly as the US, but with more generous welfare and longer life expectancy. It is no surprise to find that when Pew studied levels of trust across eight European countries, Sweden was the clear winner. If Britain and America want to rebuild trust and avoid shocks similar to those of the past two years, this is the model they should follow.• Larry Elliott is the ’s economics editor"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/423cc1dd0f8e7ec8ac4fa3af5f40cdf79cc7dcdd/0_0_941_571/master/941.jpg?width=685\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=566f932682ba0ed543891fcf8c516676 1370w","title":"take two our pick of the best jumpers and midi skirts in pictures","story":"From leopard print to pleats and sequins, the unifying factor for this season’s skirts is the length.

Thirsty studios continue to fiddle with well-known properties in order to reboot, rehaul and resurrect, often enticing but also confusing audiences with the results. The latest iteration of Halloween took the liberty of scaring away the memory of prior sequels to bring Jamie Lee Curtis back from the dead Amazon introduced the fifth actor to play Tom Clancy’s rather dull CIA operative Jack Ryan in the recent self-titled series next month The Grinch returns in cartoon form and in December, Sony launches an alternative animated Spider-Man universe existing alongside their rebooted live-action series.Which brings us, sighing from exhaustion, to The Girl in the Spider’s Web, a film that introduces us to the third Lisbeth Salander in eight years – and if Sony, the studio backing it, has its way, hopefully the last – kicking off a definitive new franchise. Stieg Larsson’s bestselling Millennium series was first transplanted to the screen in 2009 with all three books adapted and released within months, introducing star Noomi Rapace to Hollywood. Just two years later, Sony lured David Fincher to an English-language take on the first novel, scoring Rooney Mara an Oscar nomination, and while box-office results were decent, they weren’t quite decent enough to justify a $90m budget. It meant that despite interest from Mara a sequel fell through and instead a cheaper option came to fruition. With half the budget, Evil Dead remake director Fede Alvarez took the helm and rather than continue with the original planned trilogy, the fourth book was chosen, written by David Lagercrantz long after Larsson’s death.It might seem odd skipping from one to four but this so-called “soft-reboot” acts as a sort of origin tale with a plot that delves into the background of the notorious goth-hacker. Salander (played this time by The Crown’s Claire Foy) remains a vigilante at large in Stockholm, bringing down powerful men who take advantage of women. She’s also still a hacker-for-hire and her latest job sees her tracking down a powerful program that gives its owner the ability to take charge of nuclear weapons worldwide. It thrusts her into a dangerous underworld and forces her to confront her shadowy childhood, the memory of her abusive father and the sister she thought she’d left to die.On paper, it might seem puzzling to drag Salander back to the screen yet again, but it’s clear from the first 15 minutes that Sony is hoping to position her as a female alternative to James Bond (something Alvarez has also confirmed). This might also seem puzzling to fans of the books, given that Salander’s stories have traditionally been structured as page-turning mysteries, but The Girl in the Spider’s Web is an unashamed attempt to bring in a wider audience at a time of increased female visibility in the action genre. It’s a sleek, efficiently made slab of entertainment but one that borders on anonymity, Salander’s idiosyncrasies buried underneath a more multiplex-friendly exterior, kicking and shooting her way to inevitable triumph.Despite the shiny new packaging, there’s something unavoidably dated about the story that unfolds. Salander’s hacking prowess is used for trickery that would have felt more impressively novel if it had been employed in 1995 by Sandra Bullock’s character in The Net (a character at one point receives an important clue via fax). She’s also close to superhuman, setting traps and predicting outcomes in a way that a smarter, niftier script could have handled effortlessly. But here it just feels impossible, psychic even, and such magical smarts jar with other dumber oversights made by her and ex-partner Mikael Blomkvist, played here by Sverrir Gudnason. His existence in the story is so superfluous he might as well be absent, and the same could be said for Salander’s queerness, mostly forgotten, along with her feminist brand of vengeance, shown early in a potent introduction then abandoned almost immediately.After breaking out with The Crown, Foy has made a number of choices that suggest she’s all too aware of the danger of typecasting when playing a role of such magnitude. This year alone she’s played a woman questioning her sanity in Steven Soderbergh’s not-quite-fun-enough exploitation thriller Unsane and the frustrated wife of Neil Armstrong in Damien Chazelle’s middling space race drama First Man. In both films she rose far above the material she was given and it’s a skill that continues here, her commanding presence adding weight to a character who isn’t afforded much depth.But there’s only so much brooding she can do before we demand more, given how Salander was written with such loving detail on the page. Elsewhere, there’s a staggeringly underused Vicky Krieps and reliably strong work from Lakeith Stanfield, an actor who’s also able to rise far above a middling end product.Alvarez’s history within the horror genre (he also directed sleeper hit Don’t Breathe) means he’s a dab hand with some effectively nasty gore and while his ability to choreograph hand-to-hand combat is scrappy, he’s got an eye for a sweeping cinematic vista. Coupled with a grandiose score, there’s a slick competency on show. It’s watchable enough but let down by a strange lack of interest in presenting Salander as anything but an engine to propel a plot. More female action heroes is by no means a bad thing but forcing Salander into Bond’s shoes feels like a misstep, her intellect and survivalism suited to far more interesting pursuits. The Girl in the Spider’s Web is trapped in the wrong genre."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/401c203578b9d93dd38d9da1e93359015cbc920d/225_272_2793_1675/master/2793.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=90d7d9e594bb81366ddd23f727344c2f","title":"beetlejuice review afterlife comedy tim burton michael keaton winona ryder","story":"Michael Keaton, Winona Ryder, Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis star in this spiky and bracingly inventive 1988 ghost story about a house makeoverVibrant to the point of being garish, warm and generous, with a spiky sense of satire, this supernatural comedy is one of Tim Burton’s best. It is a time capsule of the 1980s, both in its absurd stylings and its parable of Reagan-era commodification culture. And what a cast. Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis play the Maitlands, a meek, childless couple whose contented existence is disrupted by their unfortunate deaths in a road accident. Back home, it takes them a while to realise they are dead, though the Handbook for the Recently Deceased and the surreal Technicolor hellscape outside the front door are strong clues.But the Maitlands are to suffer a fate worse than their recent demises. Their cherished hilltop house is sold to the Deetzes, a family of New York yuppies (including Winona Ryder as the black-sheep teenage daughter), who set about giving it a vulgar postmodern makeover, aided by their odious interior designer, Otho. The Maitlands’ attempts to scare the newcomers away fall flat – they’re far too nice. Besides which, the money-minded Deetzes see the presence of ghosts as a marketing opportunity. Which is where Betelgeuse, the undead “bio-exorcist”, comes in. Played with scene-stealing gusto by Michael Keaton, he is a bundle of scuzzy, lecherous, manic energy – somewhere between Robin Williams, Jack Nicholson and Krusty the Clown.The story almost comes off the rails, but Beetlejuice’s charm lies more in the execution. The movie is crammed with visual invention and snappy comedy. The afterlife is richly imagined as a macabre bureaucracy. The living world is no less outlandish, especially with those eye-popping interiors and costumes (for me, the film’s only flaw is that the house actually looks better after its remodelling). Burton was a bracing new talent with a headful of ideas here. His now-familiar Dr Seuss gothic sensibility was a novelty, and crucially, it was still tethered to the real world."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/04f6aa2ae03dc6b6c6f17c462e3ba0ff9bf28931/0_21_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=85d2797f88b2d55fb56e7e4a6b9e539c","title":"the forgotten cinemas of baltimore in pictures","story":"Since the 1890s, the city in Maryland has been home to more than 240 cinemas and while many of these buildings have survived, only a few of them still show films.

But a new generation of chefs are breaking the mouldLast Christmas, Stuart Ralston, chef-owner at Edinburgh’s highly rated Aizle, had a revelation: he was exhausted. After two decades of 15-hour days and three years at his first solo venture, the 35-year-old was physically and mentally spent. “And that’s not where I wanted to be for the next 20 years,” he says.Acutely aware that, in particular, he was not spending enough time with his young son, Ralston began to question the damaging chefs’ bravado he had bought into. “When I was coming through, Gordon Ramsay and Marco Pierre White were idols. It was a badge of honour to say I’ve worked this-many-days-in-a-row or so many hours. In places I trained, I don’t remember owners ever caring how many hours the staff worked or whether a chef had done 20 days straight.”How do chefs cope with that? Often, after their final shift each week, they get smashed, sleep all the next day, then go straight back to work. It is a cycle of pressure, sleep deprivation, punishing 80-hour weeks and temporary release in booze (or drugs) – all within a dysfunctional cocoon where making time to see friends, exercise or eat properly is derided as weakness. Many older chefs end up orced or battling addiction and mental and physical health problems. “I know how that story ends,” says Ralston. “I don’t want to die from a stroke at 59.”Ralston’s crisis occurred after Restaurant Sat Bains and the Raby Hunt, both two-Michelin-star restaurants, axed midweek lunches and moved to a four-day week, cutting staff hours but keeping them on the same salaries. Inspired, Ralston started crunching the numbers and, in January, Aizle reopened as a four-day-on, three-days-off, dinner-only operation.You could describe this as enlightened self-interest. There is a dire shortage of skilled chefs according to the skills agency People 1st, 19,000 leave the industry annually. To recruit and retain the best (given that chefs could often earn more in bigger commercial environments), small high-end restaurants need to provide their staff with a superior work-life balance.“I don’t want to train a sous chef for two years for them to go and work somewhere else,” Ralston says. Equally, however, he rapidly became convinced that this step-change would create the perfect virtuous circle. He feels a moral duty to look after his staff he wants to produce incredible food he cannot do that with half-dead chefs. A shorter working week, therefore, seems like a no-brainer.Small restaurants such as Aizle run on tight margins. They are passion projects, rather than big moneyspinners. So Ralston has had to box clever. The restaurant was reconfigured to add four extra seats, the price went up £10, to £55 a head, and Aizle now opens from 5pm rather than 6pm. With extra Sunday services during the Edinburgh festival and in December, it is averaging 200 covers a week – 20 more than it was doing previously.Aizle’s kitchen staff still work long hours, 8.30am until just gone midnight. But, says Ralston: “They’re not dying on their arse. We have a good lunch together, cooked from scratch – that’s a big thing for me because I’ve often been in places where staff meals are fried leftovers – then, hopefully, service isn’t too stressful because I limit the covers to 45. We could do faster turnarounds, but that’s comfortable. Saturday night, we clean down and go home feeling like normal people.”Slowly, the four-day week is gaining traction in hospitality. For instance, the Hand-Picked Hotels group is trialling it and Paul Kitching, who opened the 21212 restaurant in 2009, announced last week that he would be introducing a four-day week for his staff without decreasing their salaries. Others are taking more radical steps. Last month, Checkers, in Montgomery, announced that, after seven years of holding a Michelin star, it will relaunch in November as the daytime-only Checker’s Pantry.Kathryn Francis, the restaurant’s manager and co-owner, is adamant that Michelin stardom did not add undue pressure. But, she says, the arrival of children makes the balance more difficult to maintain. “When you’re young, you can push and push and it doesn’t matter if you’re ratty and knackered, because you haven’t got kids. But when you have, you put them first. Work is important, but you have to enjoy other aspects of life.”That is a mantra of which, unlike their parents’ generation, younger staff are fully in favour. “The workforce is changing and millennials aren’t up for crazy hours,” says Tom Tanner, spokesperson for the Sustainable Restaurant Association. Instead, to recruit good people, growing chains such as the Breakfast Club and bar group the Alchemist are offering staff paid time off to volunteer with community groups, a perk for principled millennials. The Breakfast Club’s holiday allowance is generous (for instance, head-office staff and general managers get 40 days a year), and it allows staff paid time off to train for company fitness challenges, such as a marathon in the Arctic Circle.Fitter staff have fewer sick days so, again, there is a clear business motive there. Beyond pay and hours, however, a growing minority of restaurant owners comprehensively reject the almost military hierarchy, discipline and brutality of old-school restaurants. Sam Buckley, the owner of Stockport’s Where the Light Gets In, has turned a potential private dining room into a staff library, to spur their creativity (the staff also take yoga sessions together). At the Gallivant hotel in East Sussex, owner Harry Cragoe, who made his money in fruit smoothies, has not just upped pay and reduced hours, but introduced new uniforms and better staff food. He also encourages his staff to stay healthy, using inducements such as subsidised gym memberships and free flu jabs.If not, they will walk. Chefs are in demand. They have options. Mark Hill, the owner of food truck Street Cleaver and York’s Born to Lose burger kitchen, found his escape route in street food. “I could earn more as a head chef,” says the 31-year-old. “But what’s the point if you never see your partner, friends, family, and it’s just making you miserable? I’m running a kitchen in a new way with freedom and respect so people can have better lives, me included. People just need to have some fun again.”Restaurants are not life or death. Eating out is a frivolous leisure activity. No one should be suffering to feed us."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b7bdcef807a0fc5adae6d8550aac1043499d7ba9/160_431_4198_2519/master/4198.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a90eed7935a55c17487868aec7c9971b","title":"champions league nearly over mauricio pochettino spurs psv","story":"Mauricio Pochettino said Tottenham do not deserve to qualify for the Champions League knockout rounds after they failed to translate a dominant performance at PSV into victory.Spurs were 2-1 up and coasting only to lose Hugo Lloris to a 79th-minute red card after a charge outside his area and foul on Hirving Lozano.

He lamented their lack of clinical edge in front of goal and how they took their foot off the pace in the closing stages, suddenly slowing the tempo and losing their aggression up front.“If you don’t win this type of game it’s difficult to deserve to qualify,” Pochettino said.

Roberto Firmino and Sadio Mané were also on the scoresheet for the first time in seven and eight club games respectively as Liverpool’s front three clicked on the European stage.It would have been more had Mané converted a second-half penalty or Adam Lallana finished when through on goal. Not that Liverpool were complaining.Napoli’s 2-2 draw at Paris Saint-Germain ensured victory took them to the top of Group C with the return at Red Star next. Klopp took comfort in more than the scoreline.Fabinho impressed in the heart of Liverpool’s midfield after an uncertain start and Xherdan Shaqiri’s instinctive creativity helped break Red Star’s shape and their discipline. Joe Gomez was also outstanding alongside Virgil van Dijk in central defence as the Serbian champions endured another bruising European away defeat. Their previous outing was a 6-1 defeat at PSG that is under investigation by French police amid allegations of match-fixing. They are allegations that Red Star vehemently deny.Of more immediate concern at Anfield was the thankless task of trying to contain Liverpool without encouragement from their vociferous supporters. Officially, at least. Uefa had banned Red Star from selling tickets to their first two away matches in the group stage following a pitch invasion following the play-off win against RB Salzburg.Pockets of Serbian voices could be heard around the ground throughout the game, however. They would have been misled by the 20 minutes that preceded Firmino’s opener. Red Star looked comfortable and threatened in numbers. They should have taken the lead when Lorenzo Ebecilio’s corner found Srdan Babic unmarked in the penalty area but, with the home defence static, the centre-half volleyed over.Liverpool needed time to find sharpness in their passing and movement. A change in personnel and formation from Klopp may have been a contributing factor. The hosts started with Salah at the spearhead of their attack with Mané, playing with his broken thumb in a protective cast, Firmino and Shaqiri roving behind. There was also a rare start for Fabinho with Jordan Henderson and Naby Keïta sidelined by hamstring injuries.Fabinho grew in tandem with the confidence in Liverpool’s performance. The Brazil international was caught waiting for possession twice in the first half but otherwise settled comfortably on only his second start since a £43.7m summer switch from Monaco. His distribution, strength and energy in central midfield made for an encouraging contribution, although it was the quartet in front of him who truly stood out with their flicks, back-heels and mesmerising link-up play.The breakthrough was pristine in its creation and execution. Shaqiri was the instigator, as was the case for Salah’s winner at Huddersfield on Saturday, releasing Andy Robertson down the left with a perfectly weighted pass behind the right-back Filip Stojkovic. Robertson provided a wonderful cutback from the byline into the run from deep of Firmino. Liverpool’s No 9 took one touch inside Nenad Krsticic before driving his 14th Champions League goal for the club down the centre of Milan Borjan’s exposed goal.The opening goal invigorated Liverpool’s display. Firmino almost released Mané with an exquisite flick seconds after his opener and Robertson sliced a good chance wide following a flowing move between Shaqiri, Salah and the Senegal international. A second seemed only a matter of time, and it arrived on the cusp of half-time with Shaqiri involved once again. Georginio Wijnaldum threaded a fine ball into the Switzerland international and his deft touch released Salah free on the right of the area. The Egyptian drove an unstoppable finish beyond Borjan.Salah’s second of the night stemmed from a more questionable source early in the second half. The referee Daniel Siebert was initially unmoved by half-hearted penalty claims when Mané went to ground attempting to get on the outside of Stojkovic. His additional assistant on the far side of the Kop goal identified an arm from the Red Star captain catching the striker at throat-height. Siebert eventually pointed to the spot and, while the visitors raged at a decision that was hardly a game-changer, Salah lined up a penalty that was swept emphatically down the middle of Borjan’s goal. His half century of Liverpool goals was also his 14th in the Champions League.Mané missed the opportunity to follow Salah’s lead from the spot when, after Lorenzo Ebecilio headed a free-kick against his own arm inside the area, Borjan tipped his penalty superbly on to the crossbar. Mané was unable to convert the rebound but moments later, after substitute Daniel Sturridge had released him inside the area, the striker prodded beyond the keeper from close range to complete Liverpool’s comfortable night."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dceff5a99da4f63b8d881adb13c5bab28742defb/205_412_2647_1588/master/2647.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2f43ee73ef8d5ff47a434c1413486246","title":"five scenic uk cycle routes for beginners","story":"Cycling doesn’t have to be all about endurance, speed and derring-do – it’s also an activity that can be relaxing and even meditative. These five routes are perfect for those looking to take on longer rides at a gentler paceMore and more people are rediscovering cycling as a gentle way to exercise and explore new places on their own steam. Cycling lets us experience our surroundings in new ways – from the sights and smells we might miss in the car, to the simple pleasure of feeling the wind in our hair. It’s also something just about anyone can enjoy: cycling is non-weight bearing, and for many people it’s easier than walking. There are also bikes to suit most needs. With some great, flat, traffic-free or low-traffic routes across the UK that you can enjoy at a gentle pace, inspiration and adventure are just around the corner.Distance: 18 milesStart: PadstowEnd: Wenford BridgeTime taken to cycle: one-and-a-half to two hours without stopsThe Camel Trail is one of the UK’s best-loved cycle trails, not least with families, for its beautiful waterside scenery and wealth of wildlife. From picturesque Padstow it follows the Camel estuary’s shore, a designated Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, and home to little egrets, peregrines, ospreys and kingfishers. The delightful riveted Little Petherick creek bridge once served the former railway line. After an on-road section through Wadebridge it wends through wooded country beside the River Camel, past Bodmin, before briefly skirting Bodmin Moor, to Wenford Bridge.Pit stopTreats on Trikes is a traditional tea, cake and ice cream vendor on a tricycle, midway between Padstow and Wadebridge, at Penquean quarry.Distance: 13 milesStart: Sirhowy valley country parkEnd: Taff Bargoed parkTime to cycle: one to one-and-a-half hours without stopsExplore three south Wales valleys parks by bike. Starting at Sirhowy valley country park, north-west of Newport, you’ll follow a former railway line over the listed Hengoed viaduct, with its 16 towering arches, and past the Wheel o Drams, an 8-metre tall circular sculpture of mining carts. Penallta country park once housed the deepest pit in the south Wales coalfields, and now features viewpoints, wetlands, and the UK’s largest earth sculpture – Sultan the Pit Pony (above, top left). You’ll finish in Taff Bargoed park, once three pits, and now a wildlife haven perfect for a riverside picnic.

From candle-lit and calming to high-powered and heated, there’s a school of stretch out there for everyoneAt its most refined, yoga means union or connection. Practically: connecting the body and breath, moving through and holding specific positions for physical and mental wellbeing.Of course, there’s a bit more to it than that, and a head-scratching breadth of different styles – each with its own approach. Some are centred on improving strength, stamina and flexibility. Some on addressing injuries and aches. Some are all about stilling the mind, or seeking spirituality. Some help you work up a sweat, or contort into a half-man-half-pretzel. Some offer all of the above. Here’s what the most popular styles promise.Note: most classes are signposted by level (all levels, level 1beginner and so on). These signposts are your friends – they’re the difference between practising happily and pulling a hamstring. Namaste.Acroyoga Best for those comfortable with personal contact (and gravity-defying leaps of faith), acroyoga is a playful acrobatics-meets-yoga style that puts you into pairs for a series of balance and bodyweight exercises. Fun and fairly vigorous, it aids (and asks for) concentration, strength and a bit of derring-do – the (infinitely Instagrammable) poster posture is “flying”.See also: aerial yoga. Another modern school that sees you contorting around silken (reinforced) scarves suspended from the ceiling. Ideal if you want adventure and personal space.AshtangaOne of the more traditional, commonly practised styles, ashtanga involves moving fluidly (flowing) through a set series of standing and floor postures, repeating sequences that link the breath to movement. A strong, mid-pace style anchored by deep, controlled breathing: think sun salutations – and lots of them. Great for strength and a good stretch.See also: mysore. Same principles, but you follow your own pace and breath.HathaThe mother of all yoga, hatha is the umbrella term for all physical yoga postures (asanas) and the base of most styles. The hatha you’re likely to meet tends not to flow, instead focusing on nailing the fundamental poses and technique. Great for those looking to learn the postures or avoid excessive movement – but don’t think the slower pace equals ease this is a strong style.IyengarIyengar is hatha and then some: a slow-paced, perfectionist’s class that’s all about precision and mastering correct body alignment – then holding it. Rather than settling for poor positioning, props such as belts and blocks are used to help align your body. Although challenging and disciplined, this is an excellent entry point style, providing a solid basis for poses while building balance, body awareness, strength and flexibility.JivamuktiA modern, vigorous yoga grounded in hatha flow that builds in chanting, readings, music and maximum joy – if that’s what you’re into (which half of Hollywood is).KundaliniAn intense, spiritual style with meditation and breathing techniques interwoven into postures, aimed at unblocking the chakras.Power High-intensity power yoga follows the flowing style of ashtanga or vinyasa but at a much punchier speed, helping yogis get a sweat on and a serious workout in. Practised at bikram-level heats and room temp, the athletic style is great for strength and endurance, but less advisable for anyone unfamiliar with basic poses.See also: rocket. Another hardcore, high-powered and fast-paced style, rocket yoga stems from ashtanga’s poses. It was devised by the Grateful Dead’s personal yoga teacher, and so-named “because it gets you there faster”.Restorative The one to look out for if you’re injured (or apprehensive). Restorative yoga focuses on a mindful, measured style for minimum strain on the body and maximum respect for its limitations. Deeply relaxing, the simple, healing poses are held for longer than other styles, supported by iyengar-type props.VinyasaA close relative of ashtanga, vinyasa is the broad term for uninterrupted, flowing movement between poses, guided by the breath (breathe in, move that there breathe out, move this here). As such, it’s a dynamic style, quite aerobic, giving a good workout and stretch, but also providing a moving meditation and a nice overview, as teachers explain each pose and transition.YinA slow-paced, meditative yoga with roots in China. Poses are held for extended periods and intended to avoid putting stress on the body. Usually passive and seated, yin leaves muscles relaxed, as gravity and time deepen the stretch. A healing and releasing style (candlelit yin yoga is so meditative it’s sedative-like)."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/961b2d7870f1d69aa1d0172adc5aae5ab5b6fedf/120_339_2769_1661/master/2769.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4b13365f3c7a854b7c31290ea25c401a","title":"aint no mountain fair enough how urban hiking can change the way you see your city","story":"Yes, most cities are peak-free zones, but you can still find challenging hiking conditions – all without a trip to the countryUrban hiking might sound like an oxymoron, but it’s actually a thing. There are plenty of maps, blogs and guided tours cropping up online (more about that below).So what is urban hiking? Well, it’s exactly what it says on the tin: taking on a challenging walk – perhaps at pace – in city and town settings, often with a view to racking up some considerable elevation. Much like a bracing country hike in the Peaks, Alps or Highlands, climbs and descents (either via hills or staircases) are something to be enjoyed and attacked, rather than endured.The appeal of urban hiking is obvious. It’s a great way for city folk to get more exercise without any fancy equipment, it’s a sport that enables locals to discover more about the history and background of where they live and it’s a handy way for older people to get active and to socialise. Best of all? It’s pretty much cost-free.Many of us love to ramble on a weekend away, so it’s odd that when we return to our urban lives we forget how to use our legs, hopping on the bus or tube rather than stretching our limbs. Urban hiking reverses this trend and makes sport of tackling lanes, mews and markets along the way. It can be educational too – lots of guides and maps encourage urban hikers to take in local landmarks and buildings, with notes describing their connections to the history of the area.There are plenty of ways to get involved, too. People living in towns and larger cities can simply look up walking tours aimed at tourists and join these organised treks and hikes. After all, they’re not just designed for the enjoyment of people who are new to the area. Be warned though, if you want to cover a considerable distance you’d be better off striking out alone. Urban walking tours aimed at visitors are often more focused on cramming lots of sites into shorter strolls and focusing on a particular theme or period in history, rather than packing in the miles (or hills).To take to the streets without assistance, you need a bit of preparation. But not much. Armed with a smartphone with a map app and a destination punched in, you should be fine. While a bit of pre-hike research will put you in better stead, you can easily find pre-made routes and loops online to suit your desired distance (and your appetite for hills). The website of walking charity Ramblers has plenty of maps and resources for newcomers and, once you’ve signed up for its free membership, you can get stuck into the in-depth routes and guides. You can also plot your own routes on websites such as Mapometer, which allow you to easily create maps to follow and share.One of the benefits of urban hiking is how little gear you need beyond the basics (and a bit of common sense). It’s sensible to take a small bag with essentials such as water, a sugary snack, such as an energy bar or flapjack, and a light rain jacket. If your phone’s battery is poor, it’s worth packing a back-up or charger, just in case.But beyond that, try not to weigh yourself down – you’re likely to never be too far from a shop, cafe or pub, so cut yourself loose from lugging too much garb. Oh, but don’t forget a box of plasters to treat any sore feet.Thankfully there aren’t any strict rules to adhere to when urban hiking (beyond those you’d normally comply with as a pedestrian), however, one tip is to not use the same road twice along a route. Or to put it another way, you should always aim to cover new ground and not double-back on your previous, outward passage.Other than that, you’re set. What are you waiting for? Pack your bag, pull on some comfy trainers, find a route and hit the streets. There’s a world of stairs to climb out there – last one to the top buys the ice-cream, beers or prosecco!"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/78246b97099de57467d629fada08157b093f4413/0_72_5742_3446/master/5742.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b829b4fb8dfa1942377f2930a872f23b","title":"hairdressing techno making living worlds largest refugee camp in pictures","story":"In the Bidi Bidi settlement in north-west Uganda, refugees and locals are coming up with new ways to support themselves.

Civil servants have also accelerated plans to lay down new laws and secondary legislation so that UK businesses and both British and EU citizens can prepare.The move follows concerns across government that preparations for how the UK might cope with crashing out the EU are still uncertain. The Brexit secretary, Dominic Raab, told cabinet colleagues on Tuesday that Whitehall departments needed to step up their efforts next month and move “from warning businesses to telling them to act”.Whitehall has until now concentrated on the publication of more than 100 technical notices detailing the potential impact on particular industries but not on inidual businesses and people.A source said that there would be an acceleration of preparations after MPs return from a short break on 12 November. “We have to get on with no-deal legislation. At the moment, we’re looking at the same legislation for a deal as no deal. In the case of no deal it would need royal assent before we leave.“There will be an awful lot to discuss. It will concentrate minds. Obviously we don’t want to upset the negotiations, but the clock is ticking and it will get harder and harder the later we leave it,” the source said.If May fails to negotiate a deal, the UK would no longer be part of the EU’s regulatory regime, introducing barriers for businesses trading between the UK and EU. It would also create uncertainty about the legal status of EU residents in the UK and Britons living in the other 27 member states.MPs will return from recess to find that new laws have been drawn up to be laid before parliament to cope with the UK leaving the the EU without a deal, the source said.According to the Institute for Government, the government will have to pass a citizens’ rights bill to give certainty to EU nationals. There would also have to be a separate migration bill to end free movement among the hundreds of statutory instruments the government would have to pass to ensure continuity after Brexit.MPs have expressed growing concern at the lack of engagement between Whitehall departments and businesses. Meg Hillier, the chair of the Commons public accounts committee, wrote to Jon Thompson, the head of HM Revenue and Customs, saying she was “concerned and disappointed” that small firms had not been contacted about how to prepare for the possibility of no deal.Amyas Morse, the head of the National Audit Office, told MPs earlier this month that excessive secrecy across Whitehall meant that civil servants and the public had been kept in the dark about the government’s proposals.The Treasury and HMRC have announced £8m in funding to help customs brokers train new employees to prepare for a no-deal Brexit. Customs intermediaries, which help firms to move their goods through customs checks, will also be able to apply for grants.Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland’s first minister, said on Wednesday: “I am increasingly concerned, literally with every day that passes right now, that the prospect of a no deal is becoming ever greater.“As things stand just now I think no deal may actually be the most likely outcome, and that is deeply concerning,” she told Holyrood’s committee conveners.

Even including those disinformation operations, he said, “we’ve not seen anything that demonstrates that … the Russians have succeeded in changing the outcome of the elections, either a parliamentary election or a referendum.”Wright was speaking to the committee in the wake of the government’s response to its report on “fake news”. In that report, the DCMS committee made a number of recommendations for change, including pushing the government to raise the maximum fine the Electoral Commission can levy, creating a fact-checking standard to fight misinformation, and establishing “clear legal liability for the tech companies to act against harmful and illegal content on their platforms”.The government accepted just three of the committee’s 42 recommendations for change, including one that suggested it stop using the term “fake news”, in favour of more clearly defined terms including “disinformation” and “misinformation”. Damian Collins, the committee’s chair, said the lack of response was “disappointing and a missed opportunity”.“It uses other ongoing investigations to further delay desperately needed announcements on the ongoing issues of harmful and misleading content being spread through social media. We need to see a more coordinated approach across government to combat campaigns of disinformation being organised by Russian agencies seeking to disrupt and undermine our democracy. The government’s response gives us no real indication of what action is being taken on this important issue,” he said.In front of the committee, Wright emphasised instead the role of educating the public on how disinformation spreads online, and how to recognise untrustworthy sources, particularly those backed by hostile states. “In order to win the information war with Russia, what you need is the public to be more sceptical about what they read and see,” the DCMS secretary said, citing the “30 or 40 false narratives” the Russian state had put out over the attempted assassination of Sergei Skripal.He said he would consider the possibility of a levy on technology firms to pay for that education, as well as to pay for the activities of the Information Commissioner’s Office, saying “if you are asking for more activity to take place, you also need to address how that’s going to be funded”. Such a levy was one of the committee’s recommendations."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b1067e4689b929c7ad2e5cb343f879f7a41c7546/0_460_1489_893/master/1489.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8044cd3f5cef430751729f10269375d1","title":"recording of mothers voice more effective than smoke alarm study finds","story":"Sleeping children three times more likely to wake to voice recording than to loud beeping, research findsIt’s every parent’s worst nightmare: there’s a fire in the house, the alarms are beeping, but the children are sleeping on oblivious. Now scientists say they have found a better way to rouse slumbering youngsters.Researchers in the US have discovered that playing a child a recording of their mother’s voice is about three times more likely to wake them than a traditional alarm. What’s more, it does so faster and is linked to a quicker escape.The team say the research supports a smaller study previously conducted by the group, but reveals that using the child’s name does not make a difference to the effectiveness of the voice alarm. Smith said the team now want to explore whether a voice other than the child’s mother can be just as effective, or if the gender of the voice matters.“If we can get something that can be generically developed and just taken straight out of the packet and is effective for children in this age range then that is our goal,” he said.Writing in the Journal of Pediatrics, Smith and colleagues report how they compared the effects of four different smoke alarms on 176 children aged between five and 12 years old, none of whom had hearing difficulties or were taking any medication that affected their sleep.While one alarm featured a high-pitched beep – the sort commonly found in households – the other three featured the voice of the child’s mother calling either the child’s name, giving instructions such as: “Wake up! Leave the room!”, or both.Each child slept in a lab-based room that resembled a real bedroom, and were shown how to escape from the room before they went to bed. The children were also kitted out with electrodes, allowing the team to make sure that the alarm was sounded when the children were at the same sleep stage each time.The children were each asked to sleep at the lab on two occasions, and were woken up twice with alarms each time, meaning each experienced all four alarms – the order of which was chosen randomly.In addition, the children shook off their slumbers faster, with a median value of two seconds for the voice alarm, regardless of which words were used, compared with more than two and a half minutes for the traditional alarm. Similarly, escape times were longer in the cases of the beeping alarms.Rick Hylton of the National Fire Chiefs Council welcomed the study, but said people should not worry about how effective their current alarms are.“We know smoke alarms save lives. They will alert occupants early, if working, fitted and installed in the correct location. This gives adults, parents or s the opportunity to wake children and leave the house,” he said, adding that children should also be shown an escape plan.Prof Niamh Nic Daéid, director of the Leverhulme Research Centre for Forensic Science at the University of Dundee, said the research backed up work by her team that found a human voice combined with a low-frequency pulsing tone was far more effective in waking children than a traditional high-pitched alarm.But she noted that the latest study involved children sleeping in a location other than their own bedroom, which might have made them more receptive to an alarm, while more work was needed to explore whether other familiar sounds, such as a dog barking, might also prove effective in rousing children."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/943af9ea26e4f7b4c6c109213453eba346301b34/130_0_3340_2004/master/3340.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b4a0b8dbb404ffa99c2b705185ed838a","title":"astronomy photographer of the year 2018 the winning images","story":"The US photographer Brad Goldpaint has beaten thousands of amateur and professional photographers from around the globe to win the Royal Observatory Greenwich’s title of Insight Investment Astronomy Photographer of the Year 2018.

Certainly his 67 from 60 balls at the end of Tuesday’s 219-run DLS defeat – a frictionless innings that included 12 well-timed fours – was a far cry from a summer spent mainly grinding out the runs.But having spent the previous evening typically pushing himself to the limits in practice as Sky Sports filmed a feature on his training regime, he had to have treatment for cramp in his legs towards the end of the innings before the condition moved to his arms after the match.As a player who sweats profusely on the field, Stokes will need to be mindful of avoiding a repeat come the three-match Test series that begins in Galle on 6 November. Once Saturday’s one-off Twenty20 international is out of the way, the five-day format will challenge bodies as much as minds and techniques.Following this tour, thoughts for Stokes will once again turn to the late night street fight in Bristol on 29 September last year.

He was seen, not entirely unfairly, as a highly paid starter doomed to falter time after time in the playoffs. Now, as the winning pitcher in the the Red Sox’s 4-2 victory over the Los Angeles Dodgers in Game 2 of the World Series, he’s positioned himself to be a genuine Boston legend. Meanwhile, the Dodgers are heading back to California down 0-2 in the best-of-seven series and in desperate need of a home victory to avoid falling into deep trouble.Price pitched six strong innings against a potent Dodgers line-up, allowing just two runs on three hits, while striking out five and walking three. It was Price’s second straight postseason win, following his victory over the Houston Astros in the clinching Game 5 of the American League Championship Series. Price has had an up-and-down career in Boston, his struggles against the New York Yankees have been beyond well-documented, but there’s no question that he has stepped up in the two biggest games of his Red Sox career.It looked like this was going to be a pitchers’ duel for most of the game’s first half. The Red Sox scored first when Ian Kinsler hit a single off of Hyun-jin Ryu to drive in Xander Bogaerts. As with so many of the runs the Red Sox have scored this postseason, it came with two outs. That was, however, the only run they managed to score off of Ryu for the first four innings.Meanwhile, Price ran into a jam in the fourth. Matt Kemp tied the game with a sacrifice fly that drove in David Freese. Then, Yusiel Puig untied it for the Dodgers by driving in Manny Machado to make it 2-1 Los Angeles. For a moment the “Beat LA” chants died down at Fenway Park and it looked like the old David Price was making a return at the least opportune moment. He didn’t. Instead, Price settled down and got out Justin Turner and Freese to end the inning. The Dodgers wouldn’t score again.Price was asked after the game, what had changed to make him more effective in the postseason. His answer was simple. “I have,” he said. “I take a lot of pride in being able to evolve from pitch to pitch or day to day or game to game. Being able to make adjustments on the fly, it’s paid off.”The game turned in the fifth inning when Ryu was pulled with two outs and the bases loaded, and Dodgers manager Dave Roberts put in reliever Ryan Madson. Madson promptly walked Steve Pearce to force in a run and then allowed yet another two-out hit, this one to JD Martinez. The Red Sox were now up 4-2, putting Ryu on the hook with a hard luck loss. Price threw a scoreless sixth and Red Sox manager Alex Cora turned to his bullpen to close out the game. Joe Kelly, Nathan Eovaldi and Craig Kimbrel (in the middle of his own redemption story) shut the door on LA with scoreless innings of their own.Expect Roberts to receive his share of criticism for the moves he’s made in these first two games, especially when compared to those made by Cora, who has turned “In Cora We Trust” into something of a catchphrase in New England. Roberts now has the unenviable task of trying to prevent his team from going down 0-3 in the World Series. The 2004 Red Sox, who were honored at Fenway before the game started, did come back from that deficit against the Yankees in that year’s ALCS. Not that Roberts needs a reminder: he was part of that Red Sox team and one imagines that he doesn’t want to attempt that once-in-a-lifetime feat again."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/064fb3634af95ff318a8e337560b4ef53afc4e4d/384_117_2232_1340/master/2232.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fae6ff9e163774d68a54ee2cb45889d9","title":"christian wade retires danny cipriani ban rugby union news","story":"Wasps have released their England wing Christian Wade from his contract so he can attempt to break into American football.Wade, whose solitary cap came in 2013 against Argentina before he was summoned to join the British \u0026amp Irish Lions in Australia, has scored 82 Premiership tries, a total bettered only by two players.The 27-year old has spent his senior career with Wasps but has not been considered by England since Eddie Jones took over as head coach at the end of 2015 and is expected to attempt to break into American football through its international player pathway programme.Wasps tried to persuade Wade, whose fifth and final appearance of the season was against Gloucester at the start of this month, to stay. “We held numerous discussions with him to try and convince him to keep pushing forward with Wasps, but in the end it was clear this was the path he wished to go down,” Young said. “It is very disappointing to lose a player of his quality at this stage of the season.”Wasps, who have been linked with Toulon’s New Zealand centre Malakai Fekitoa, are expected to sign Michele Campagnaro, who will captain Italy against Ireland in Chicago next week. The 25-year old is being released from his contractby Exeter, the club he joined in 2015, next week which means he will be able to play for the Azzurri in a game outside the official Test window because he will not be bound by the Premiership’s rule on the non-release of non-England players.The former Wasps fly-half Danny Cipriani has been suspended for three weeks following his red card last Saturday during Gloucester’s European Champions Cup defeat against Munster at Thomond Park.Cipriani appeared before a disciplinary panel in Paris on Wednesday after being sent off for a head-high challenge on the Munster centre Rory Scannell. He accepted the decision and apologised despite the red card being widely seen as disproportionate – even under the crackdown on dangerous tackles – because he appeared to be trying to get out of the way rather than make contact.His guilty plea, together with his contrition and previous good disciplinary record, meant a ban of six weeks was halved. He will miss the first three rounds of the new Premiership Cup, matches in which he was unlikely to have played much of a part. He will be free to play again on 12 November, four days before Gloucester host Leicester in the Premiership.It means he would be available for England’s final two matches of their autumn campaign against Japan and Australia should either George Ford or Owen Farrell suffer an injury, although the national head coach, Eddie Jones, has alternative fly-halfs in his squad in Alex Lozowski and Henry Slade."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c3c9c6260ef43d6d3793190cc4d633ec7b6b3e85/0_171_4919_2953/master/4919.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=448b6412302f5aa6f37ab5d40e05620c","title":"khabib nurmagomedov and conor mcgregor have suspensions extended","story":"Nevada fight regulators have extended the suspensions of Khabib Nurmagomedov and Conor McGregor, after their meeting at UFC 229 earlier this month was marred by brawls inside and outside the octagon.

In practice, this has generally meant commissioning Russell Brand on the grounds that he pronounces hard words in a mockney accent, but occasionally the stars align and the denizens of W1A find someone who has a genuinely common touch. Stacey Dooley is the standard bearer, and we will see how Danny Dyer’s history documentary goes, but a new voice has been added to the mix, via Omielan’s adaptation of her fringe show into a part-documentary, part-standup exploration of politics as experienced by the man on the Clapham omnibusfaceless millennial in the gig economy (BBC One).The first of four episodes looks into housing, with Omielan asking a simple question (and ignoring the cries of those who would tell her that, oh no, it’s not so simple, surely!): why, at the age of 35 (she has since turned 36) and working full time, can neither she nor her peers buy a place to live?Wage stagnation, the broken property market, the maintenance of high rents by government policy that prefers to have people on housing benefit than piss off the rentier class by building more housing (I paraphrase, but not by much) are covered. The unwillingness of mortgage lenders to see anyone other than the holders of steady, old-fashioned jobs as viable vessels for their precious funds is also neatly explained.The effects of all this are deftly demonstrated, too. Omielan attends a speed-flatmating event (like speed-dating, but with many more ways to end up screwed) and meets an architect with visions of a pod-based future. “Thousands of young people just trying to live their best life and learn how to contour,” Omielan sighs as she inspects his plans for 10 sq metre living spaces squeezed into towers. It is a neat dig at the millennial stereotype cleaved to by older demographics as their real problems are literally stacked up.She also tours an office block under property ship, the practice by which a company takes over unused office space, makes it basically habitable (if you are lucky – Omielan spoke to inhabitants who had turned up to find carpetless, windowless rooms) and rents out rooms on rolling monthly “licences” to not-quite-tenants, who live five or six to each bathroom and kitchen and keep squatters out in return for below-market rent. “You’ve got the best deal out of all of them,” notes Omielan, sitting down with Scott, who manages one of these enterprises. His permanent smile did not entirely distract from his barracuda stare, the outward tell of the inner calculations being made by men working in the margins. “It does come with a lot of headaches,” he insists. “Yeah,” Omielan replies briskly. “But it also comes with a lot of money, so you’re fine.”In later episodes, Omielan tackles public spending and social mobility. “Boris Johnson got into Oxford?” she says, peering at evidence hanging in a hallway. “How?” This is a question that cannot be asked often enough, not because we do not know the answer, but because the answer is appalling, has a tentacular reach and we need to hear it to remind ourselves. The last episode covers the NHS and Omielan’s mother’s painful, undignified death within a system that her daughter feels failed her. The experience prompted Omielan to start investigating how politics got us here and to develop the original standup show.Viewers may or may not agree with her points of view, those of the experts to whom she speaks or the takes of the “ordinary” people she interviews. But the point is that she is saying it differently, starting at a dramatically and authentically less sophisticated point than usual and demanding to be informed. She is hilarious and a joy to watch – a force to be reckoned with in factual and comedy settings. It all feels so fresh that I find myself watching anxiously, hoping that the light of youth and hope does not vanish from her eyes as she learns about the world. Retreat to your pod and learn how to contour, babe, before it is too late."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/18132bf71da1883785d24cb88ae9ec8475202456/0_0_3500_2102/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=620be74483206289d996e1f2eb654bfc","title":"great british bake off strictly come dancing x factor why do people believe that reality tv is fixed","story":"A string of scandals a decade ago shattered our trust, but claims that producers are rigging the likes of The X Factor are wide of the markThis has been a bad spell for anyone who believes in the sanctity of reality television. The most recent contestant to be eliminated from Strictly Come Dancing, Vick Hope, this week insinuated that her exit was down to a shadowy fix on the part of the show’s judges and producers.Meanwhile, the sight of singer Armstrong Martins wearing an earpiece before a sing-off on last weekend’s X Factor led some fans to accuse the results of being fixed. And then there is The Great British Bake Off, which also fielded fixing accusations after Manon was eliminated over the apparently less talented Rahul last week. It is hard to shake the feeling that, whatever you watch, you are nothing more than a puppet being manipulated by the profit motive of a large entertainment conglomerate that makes its money by tricking naive viewers with the illusion of free will.Except, really, come on now. Don’t be daft. As much as each of these theories have caught fire in recent days, there is barely a scrap of credibility to any of them. Hope’s claims forced Strictly producers to reiterate that the judges’ voting is independently carried out on an electronic voting pad before any discussions with producers. The X Factor “fix” was explained with a reminder that, actually, every contestant wears an earpiece before the sing-off. And as for Bake Off, every episode is essentially just an edited highlight reel of an entire day’s worth of pre-recorded baking overseen by a pair of relatively eccentric judges. And besides, it’s just cakes.You can understand why such conspiracy theories are so pervasive. Apart from anything else, shows such as X Factor and Strictly do have plenty of unfair elements. On Strictly, contestants with years of professional dance training are routinely matched against absolute beginners, which automatically weights the show in their favour. And X Factor often seems like such a work of artifice – with staged behind-the-scenes audition sequences, use of pitch correction and scouted contestants – that it is easy to believe the public vote is also less than rigidly upheld.It’s hard to rebuild audience trust after a knock like that, which is why Soapstar Superstar no longer exists. But it might also explain why the notion of a fix is still so attractive a full decade later. We have been surrounded by so much nonsense for so long that it makes sense to assume everything we watch has been rigged.However, whenever solid accusations do arise – whenever viewers complain that phone lines have been blocked, such as when Ofcom received 1,900 complaints about the 2007 X Factor final – they are always investigated and almost always cleared. In short, there is no evidence that any so-called “fixes” on any reality show of the last decade have been anything other than sore loserdom on the part of the contestants and viewers. It is fake news. It is the last resort of a dummy-throwing baby.Perhaps, then, the word “fix” has become a crutch a term we can bandy around whenever something doesn’t go our way. After all, it is easier to reassure yourself that you’re witnessing a grand conspiracy than to admit you backed a dud. And it is much easier than admitting you have wasted your life getting het up about a television programme about cakes."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/63b968ea3dd890c0f9bc0acce1c16e9c60d56e95/0_117_4116_2470/master/4116.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f22b9732776e4ba636f242e76193878f","title":"staten island max rose republican democrat midterms","story":"The ‘forgotten borough’ has sent Republicans to Congress for all but two of the last 35 years – but Max Rose thinks he can winIt’s not hard to find a congressional district in New York City where a Democrat can win as long as the candidate “has a pulse”.That’s basically the whole city.

I don’t want to run in a district like that. I don’t want to live in a place like that. People deserve a choice, so we’re giving them one.”Staten Island, sometimes dubbed the “forgotten borough”, is enough of an outlier within New York that it once voted to secede from the city in a non-binding referendum.Though registered Democrats outnumber Republicans in the district, it has had a Republican representative for all but two years in the last three and a half decades.“It’s just not like the rest of the city. It looks like much of the rest of the country. It’s more suburban than urban,” said Richard Flanagan, a political science professor at the College of Staten Island and the author of Staten Island: Conservative Bastion in a Liberal City.And so, like in many swing districts around the country, the race features two candidates running as moderates and focusing relentlessly on local issues. “He’s an underdog, but a strong Democrat’s always in striking range,” Flanagan said of Rose. “It’s never been an entirely safe seat for a Republican.”Outside a ShopRite last week on the island’s south shore, its most conservative bastion, Donovan shook shoppers’ hands and reminded them to vote.“The national Democratic party doesn’t understand the Democrats here,” he said. “They’ve always voted for me and they’re going to do it again. I’ve done everything I promised them. I’ve done it with integrity. I’ve taken stances that hurt me politically.”He’s counting on registered Democrats like Paul Binder, 61, who enthusiastically greeted his congressman after exiting the supermarket with a cart piled high with groceries. Binder calls himself a “former liberal”, who now dislikes both parties, but especially the Democrats. He likes Donovan because, as the former Staten Island district attorney, “I heard he’s tough on crime, and that’s good enough for me.”“I can’t vote for these Democrats. They’re disgusting,” Binder said. “I’m a Donald Trump fan.”Donovan doesn’t bring up Trump too often these days. He says the president has done a “remarkable job”, especially on foreign policy, but stresses that he voted against two crucial pieces of legislation, the GOP healthcare bill and the tax overhaul plan.Things looked different a few months ago, when Donovan faced a primary challenge from ex-con and ex-congressman Michael Grimm. Grimm held the seat until he pleaded guilty to tax fraud and went to prison in 2015.Donovan got Trump’s coveted endorsement, and put the president’s name on campaign signs in letters as big as his own, not to mention a two-story billboard promoting the endorsement. He introduced a bill to require every post office in the country to display a picture of Trump.Donovan says nothing has changed: he supports Trump, but puts his constituents first.Rose sees the shift less charitably. “If Dan Donovan read a poll tomorrow that said he could win this race by wearing an Abolish Ice T-shirt, you’d see Dan Donovan parading around in an Abolish Ice T-shirt,” he said, referring to the movement on the left to abolish the federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency.The challenger has received high-profile endorsements from former president Barack Obama and former vice-president Joe Biden, and a financial boost from his inclusion in the Democratic congressional campaign committee’s Red to Blue program, which targets districts the party thinks it can wrench away from Republican control as it seeks to take over the House of Representatives.But Rose says he won’t support Nancy Pelosi as the party’s House leader, and is quick to point out he opposes single-payer healthcare insurance, and doesn’t want to abolish Ice. He frequently criticizes the city’s Democratic mayor, Bill de Blasio, who is deeply unpopular on Staten Island.At his headquarters in a former guitar shop, there are signs from liberal groups promoting abortion rights and opposition to the Citizens United supreme court decision to allow unlimited political spending by interest groups. They share space with handwritten posters listing platform points on infrastructure, gun reform, taxes, healthcare, education and the opioid crisis – a particular worry in a borough where 101 people died of overdoses last year.New York’s lieutenant governor, Kathy Hochul, joined Rose at his office last week to go after Donovan for his handling of the epidemic, criticizing him for disbanding a narcotics unit in the district attorney’s office and receiving campaign contributions from executives tied to Purdue Pharma, the company that makes Oxycontin. She called his actions “lessons in what not to be doing”.Rose, who spent almost five years on active duty in the army, led an infantry platoon in Afghanistan. He became a healthcare executive after leaving active duty but remains a member of the national guard, taking a break from the campaign trail in August to complete training.He is part of a wave of veterans running as Democrats across the country, but in New York City, he is the first combat veteran who signed up after 911 who is now running for office.Rose was injured when his vehicle hit an improvised explosive device, and says the incident taught him that Congress isn’t completely hopeless. They had appropriated money to make military Strykers more blast resistant. “If I had hit that IED in 2004 instead of 2013, I would have died,” he said. “In this odd way, I’m alive today because Congress got something done. So we know it’s possible.”There have been no public polls in the race, leaving it a question mark just how close the only competitive race in the city is.“I think it’s Donovan’s to lose,” said city councilman Joe Borelli, who is one of three Republicans on the 51-member council and known for his outspoken Trump support. “It’s tough to paint him in a way that Staten Islanders don’t like or wouldn’t like. Even a lot of Democrats happen to think Dan is a nice guy and a good congressional representative.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/50303d2bca67128a51ee35f3b8e8d6e9f412bedb/0_321_4016_2409/master/4016.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a31885807d9c8c13b97405f4a2ae6ece","title":"steve bannon rally elma new york republicans","story":"Trump’s former strategist touts his role in president’s success before crowd of 200 in upstate New YorkAs Donald Trump held midterm rallies this week in front of thousands, his one-time chief strategist Steve Bannon made his own, rather more low-key return to the campaign trail.Bannon appeared in front of 200 people at a firehouse outside Buffalo, New York, ostensibly to campaign for Republicans based in the area. But in a visceral demonstration of just how far Bannon’s stock has fallen since leaving the White House 14 months ago, none of those Republicans running for office turned up.Instead – in a move unlikely to please his former boss – Bannon spent the first part of his speech at the Jamison Road volunteer firehouse in Elma talking up his own importance in Trump’s 2016 victory, in an apparent attempt to thrust himself back into the national spotlight.“Let’s go back in time,” Bannon said, in a potentially revealing turn of phrase.There followed a Trump-style riff – a retelling of the obstacles and hardships the Trump campaign overcame to win a thrilling victory on 8 November.The difference is that in Bannon’s version, he is very much front and centre, the power – or, as Saturday Night Live portrayed him, the grim reaper – behind Trump, whispering in the candidate’s ear, guiding him to victory.Bannon, clad in familiar green Barbour jacket, grey hair swept back, recalled what he told Trump soon after signing on to the campaign.“I said: ‘The numbers show that working class people in this country will unite around a leader who will return America to her former glory.This recounting is unlikely to impress Trump, who claimed Bannon had “lost his mind” after leaving the White House, but then the president is probably not following his former guru as closely as he once did.When Bannon left his job as Trump’s chief strategist in August 2017, reportedly after clashing with colleagues, he returned to Breitbart News, the organization Bannon had once declared “the platform for the alt-right”.He could be “more effective fighting from the outside for the agenda President Trump ran on” than in the White House, Bannon claimed, but the reunion proved to be short-lived. Bannon was booted from Breitbart in January of this year after saying Donald Trump Jr’s meeting with a Russian lawyer was “treasonous” in Michael Wolff’s book Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House. The volume prompted Trump to speculate about the state of Bannon’s mind and brand him “Sloppy Steve”.The debacle left Bannon with some catching up to do to regain relevance in conservative politics. Wednesday marked a beginning of sorts – the former chief strategist drew a crowd of just 38 to an event in Staten Island, New York, on Monday – but the Elma event had got off to an inauspicious start when the original venue cancelled amid threats of violence.Bannon had originally been slated to appear with David DiPietro, running for re-election to the New York state assembly, but after the first venue pulled out, so did DiPietro.A couple of hours before the event, Michael Caputo – conservative strategist, organizer of the Bannon event, and DiPietro’s campaign manager – still thought DiPietro might actually turn up. Caputo said he had invited all Republicans running for office in the western New York area, but had yet to receive a single reply.“It might be no one,” Caputo said.He was right. Even Chris Collins, the US congressman for New York’s 27th district who is running for re-election despite having been charged with federal securities fraud, stayed away.But Bannon can take some encouragement from Wednesday night. There were at least some people in the crowd who were happy to spend time with him.“If it wasn’t for Bannon, believe me, Trump wouldn’t have had the traction he had,” said Barry Horwitz, a 76-year-old racehorse owner wearing a pair of beige, American-flag emblazoned trousers.“Everybody talks about the dark side of him. But read his credentials. He was in the navy, he was at Goldman Sachs. He’s filmed a lot of movies.”It could be that Bannon never escapes his image as a dastardly, “dark side” figure. The New York Republican stalwart Carl Paladino, who ran for governor in the state in 2010, certainly didn’t help to dispel it when he introduced Bannon to the stage.“He has been described by some as a white nationalist,” Paladino told the crowd, before listing off a rogues’ gallery of European far-right political parties Bannon has supported.“Bannon has done more than anyone to introduce the alt-right into mainstream American life.”Bannon spoke for about 25 minutes, warning of the ills of the “marxist left” and eventually explicitly praising Trump on job numbers, the border, and Korea. And as he drew to a close, the former hedge fund manager showed off the knack for appealing to the man in the street – however disingenuous that appeal may be – that brought him, and Trump, such success.“If you gave me the choice between the first hundred people who showed up here at Jamison firehouse today, in a red ball cap, to govern the country, or the top hundred partners at Goldman Sachs, I would take these red ball caps every day,” Bannon said, to whoops and whistles from the crowd.“Think about what the country would be if we took the first hundred of you and you made the decisions,” he said. “Well, that’s the closest we’ve got with Trump.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f021d5d158195249562ab3c772c6589da6d2c44e/0_316_3813_2287/master/3813.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eecc7105eae582260c524015220b42b6","title":"armistice day 100 years on share your letters stories and photographs","story":"Whether your family members or friends were in active service, or in some supporting role at home or abroad, we’d like to hear their storiesSunday 11 November this year will mark 100 years since the armistice treaty was signed between first world war allies and Germany, bringing to an end four years of war in western Europe.On that day people in Britain celebrated by pouring out onto the streets and gathering in large places. Church bells were rung in towns and villages across the UK, for the first time since the war began, both as a symbolic gesture and to let people know the war was over.Though this was a joyous moment for the allies at least, the devastating loss of life affected many families and communities in Britain and across the world.

It was said to be a long-planned meeting with the representatives of the newspaper’s new partner, the Saudi Research and Marketing Group (SRMG) – a publishing business with close ties to the Saudi royal family.But a spokesperson would not comment on suggestions that Broughton would also be attending the Future Investment Initiative conference – also known as “Davos in the desert” – while he is in the country.Broughton’s visit follows a deal the Independent signed earlier this year, which will see the British publication licence its brand to SRMG. SRMG intends to launch a series of sites, which it will own and operate, under the Independent’s name across the Middle East by the end of this year.Staff at the Independent, who have covered Khashoggi’s murder in depth, expressed concern about what they viewed as the secretive nature of Broughton’s trip to Riyadh and the fact that it coincides with the controversial conference. There is also uncertainty over the editorial oversight of the spin-off foreign language websites. A union chapel meeting is to be held on Friday night to discuss questions raised about their editorial independence from the Saudi state.Although the new websites will be Independent-branded, the content is set to be be almost entirely produced by SRMG journalists based in London, Islamabad, Istanbul and New York. The sites, which will operate in Arabic, Urdu, Turkish and Persian, will be “supported by operations staff in Riyadh and Dubai”.The publisher has strong links to the Saudi state. Until recently, SRMG’s chairman was Prince Bader bin Abdullah bin Mohammed bin Farhan Al Saud, who quit to take up a position as Saudi minister of culture.While journalists from outlets including the Independent and the  are attending the Future Investment Initiative in a reporting capacity, many media executives have boycotted Saudi events, including the conference, since Khashoggi’s disappearance.The editor of the Economist, Zanny Minton Beddoes, was due to attend the event, but earlier this month a spokesperson said she would no longer be going. The New York Times also decided to cancel its sponsorship of the event. Others no longer attending include Patrick Soon-Shiong, owner of the Los Angeles Times.Khashoggi was found dead earlier in the month and the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, has publicly torn down Saudi claims that the dissident journalist died in a fight in its Istanbul consulate. He made fresh allegations that his “savage” murder was premeditated and calling for an independent investigation in Turkey.The Independent has previously said that despite SRMG’s operational control of the new foreign language sites, they would conform to “the standards, codes and ethos of the Independent” and bring its journalism to millions more readers “in regions that need greater media plurality”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b09a240b7e57d8749245fbef8e900b6054512926/0_161_1295_777/master/1295.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2b0d669057da1b70fb185d254ce0ed27","title":"super typhoon yutu latest northern mariana islands","story":"Reports of injuries after Super Typhoon Yutu hit the Northern Mariana Islands early on ThursdaySuper Typhoon Yutu crossed over the US Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands early on Thursday as the equivalent of a Category 5 hurricane, making it the strongest storm to hit any part of the US this year, the National Weather Service said.Yutu produced damaging winds, flooding and high surf and there were reports of injuries, though the extent of these is unclear.Gregorio Kilili Camacho Sablan, the Commonwealth of the Northern Marina Islands’ delegate to US Congress, said the territory will need significant help to recover from the storm.On the phone from Saipan, Sablan said he has heard reports of injuries and that people are waiting at the island’s hospital to be treated.“There’s a lot of damage and destruction,” Sablan said. “It’s like a small war just passed through.”He has not been able to reach officials on the territory’s neighbour islands of Tinian and Rota because phones and electricity are out. “It’s going to take weeks probably to get electricity back to everybody.”“We’re surviving, we’ll get through this we are a resilient people but it’s just huge,” he said.Nearly 200 federal emergency workers were in the Marianas to assist, Sablan said.Maximum sustained winds of 180 mph (290 kph) were recorded around the eye of the storm, which passed over Tinian and Saipan early Thursday local time, said Brandon Aydlett, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service.“At its peak, the wind was constant and the sound horrifying,” Glen Hunter wrote in a Facebook message to The Associated Press. Hunter lives on Saipan, the largest island in the commonwealth, which is a US territory. The Northern Marianas are about 3,800 miles west of Hawaii.“Gonna be quite a scene when the sun comes up,” Hunter wrote to the AP early Thursday.It was still quite dark when he peeked outside and saw his neighbour’s house, made of wood and tin, completely gone.

At the same time I don’t know what will happen from here or what I should do,” Yasuda told Reuters a day after his release. “I am thinking about what I need to do.”Earlier, in a brief video released by Turkish officials, Yasuda, who had lost weight and grown a thick beard, confirmed his identity. “My name is Jumpei Yasuda, Japanese journalist,” he said in English. “I have been held in Syria for 40 months, now in Turkey. Now I’m in safe condition. Thank you very much.”He is expected to come under pressure to offer a more detailed account of his time as a hostage, which began when he was captured, allegedly by the Nusra Front, an al-Qaida linked militant group, soon after entering northern Syria from Turkey in June 2015.It was the second time Yasuda, who has been reporting from Middle East war zones for almost two decades, had been captured. He was held in Iraq in 2004 along with three other Japanese citizens but they were released after an intervention by Muslim clerics.Speaking outside their home near Tokyo, Yasuda’s parents fought back tears. “I could do nothing but pray, so I’ve been praying every day,” his mother, Sachiko. She said she had folded more than 10,000 paper cranes during her son’s ordeal in the desperate hope that her wish would be granted.His father, Hideaki, said: “Above everything else I want to see that he is fine. When he gets back I want to tell him one thing, that he did a good job hanging in there.”Yasuda’s wife, a singer who goes by the name Myu, was appearing on live TV when news came through that her husband’s safety had been confirmed. “First I want to tell him welcome back and then praise him for enduring his ordeal,” she said. “I’m so glad he survived.”Japan’s prime minister, Shinzo Abe, said he had called the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, and the emir of Qatar, Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, to thank them for their countries’ role in securing Yasuda’s release.“He looks to be in good health, but our staff will check his condition and transport him to Japan as soon as possible,” the foreign minister, Taro Kono, told reporters. A Japanese government spokesman said no ransom had been paid.The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a monitoring group based in Britain, said Yasuda was most recently held by a Syrian commander with the Turkistan Islamic Party, a group comprising mainly Chinese jihadis in Syria.His last reports from Syria included one about his friend Kenji Goto, a Japanese freelance journalist who was beheaded by Islamic State along with his friend Haruna Yukawa in January 2015.Contact was lost with Yasuda after he sent a message to another Japanese freelancer on 23 June 2015. In his last tweet two days earlier, he said his reporting was often obstructed and that he would stop tweeting his whereabouts and activities.Several videos showing a man believed to be Yasuda were released in the past year.Wire agencies contributed to this report"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f49207a63a380f2a9f658ec8d065210ee8fd6a69/0_38_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=69d793700fecf5a9e57d6788a4416880","title":"rights groups push for yes vote in irish blasphemy referendum","story":"Vote on whether to decriminalise blasphemy coincides with presidential election on FridayIrish voters will decide on Friday whether to remove a clause in the country’s constitution that makes blasphemy a criminal act. A yes vote in the referendum would be a further sign of the diminishing influence of the church in the once staunchly Catholic country.The referendum is being held alongside the presidential election, in which the incumbent, Michael D Higgins, is expected to win a second term. It follows May’s landslide referendum vote in favour of removing a constitutional clause effectively outlawing abortion.The last prosecution for blasphemy in Ireland was in 1855, but three years ago Irish police investigated comments made by Stephen Fry on television in which the comedian described God as “capricious”, “mean-minded”, and an “utter maniac”. The investigation was later dropped after Gardaí decided insufficient numbers of people had been outraged.Voters will be asked whether they want to remove the word blasphemy from a clause in the 1937 constitution that says: “The publication or utterance of blasphemous, seditious or indecent matter is an offence which shall be punishable in accordance with law.”Earlier this month, the Irish Catholic church said the blasphemy provision was “largely obsolete”, and that such laws had been used “to justify violence and oppression against minorities in other parts of the world”.However, it added, the right of people to practise their faith without being attacked or ridiculed “needs to be acknowledged and respected”.Its stance was echoed by the Church of Ireland, part of the Anglican communion, which also said: “There is a fundamental human right to freedom of religion, but also the freedom of expression (within limits).”Amnesty and the Irish Council for Civil Liberties this week issued a joint appeal for a yes vote in the referendum.Liam Herrick, ICCL’s director, said: “Freedom of expression is at the heart of our democracy and that must include allowing all speech that challenges, or even ridicules, ideas or institutions.“Criminalising blasphemy has no place in a modern democracy such as ours. Irish people don’t want criminal prosecution for those who call into question the authority of religious teachings.”Although the blasphemy clause was enshrined in the constitution more than 80 years ago, when the Catholic church wielded significant influence in the nascent state, it was reinforced in the 2009 Defamation Act. Under the law, an offence is committed if someone publishes or voices material “grossly abusive or insulting in relation to matters held sacred by any religion, thereby causing outrage among a substantial number of the adherents of that religion”."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3673899.1540400917!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"full list of schools facing structural inspections","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tArdgillan Community College in Balbriggan: school has asked some pupils to stay home over health and safety concerns arising from construction.

Photograph:  Gareth Chaney CollinsEducation authorities are facing a “race against time” to complete structural assessments for 40 schools during next week’s mid-term break.Department of Education officials are planning to work around the clock over the coming days in the hope that schools and parents will have certainty over whether their schools will re-open after the holiday.All the schools were built by the Co Tyrone-based construction firm Western Building Systems (WBS).Minister for Education Joe McHugh acknowledged the timeline was very tight, but said all available resources were being used to complete the safety checks.He said there was no indication all 40 schools would close, although it was likely that the number with serious structural problems would grow.Officials are also involved in an urgent search for temporary accommodation for students who are already affected by school closures.Some 1,300 pupils may require temporary accommodation for up to a year or more after three school buildings were ordered to shut this week on foot of structural concerns.Safety checks carried out on behalf of the Department of Education revealed a series of urgent structural concerns over Tyrrelstown Educate Together National School and St Luke’s National School, which share a campus in west Dublin. A building at Ardgillan Community College in Balbriggan was also ordered to close this week. A check of a fourth school built by WBS last year in Firhouse, Dublin, on Wednesday did not reveal any significant issues.While officials are hopeful of finding temporary accommodation for about 120 students in Balbriggan, the task of finding places for 1,200 children in Tyrrelstown is much more challenging.Officials are examining options such as splitting up the schools so classes can use spare capacity across a number of secondary schools in the capital.The potential for using prefabs is also being examined, though these require planning permission and a longer lead-in time.Taoiseach Leo Varadkar acknowledged in the Dáil on Wednesday that it would be difficult to find other rooms for teachers and pupils affected by the closures but “everything will be done to find alternative accommodation nearby”.Mr Varadkar said they had to put safety first, referring to the decision to close the three schools.It is unclear, however, whether the Department of Education will be in a position to pursue the company for potential costs linked to structural problems.This is because the defects liability period is six years in some contracts, and 12 years in others.WBS built about 30 schools under a fast-track “design and build” programme, which ran from late 2007 to 2013. This resulted in some schools being built within just three months. Stricter building regulations came into effect in 2014.Mr Varadkar said structural issues highlighted so far have indicated that “while no imminent danger was identified”, they were being closed as a precautionary measure to allow further detailed investigations. The Taoiseach said it would be a challenge to provide alternative accommodation for the pupils and teachers disrupted but “the target is to have interim accommodation available for when pupils return to school after the mid-term break”."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3674511.1540412769!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"school closures where are 1 200 students going to go","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tScaffolding surrounding bore holes in Tyrrelstown Educate Together National School, which has closed its doors due to a structural defect.

Andy, who is non-verbal and attends a specialised autism unit at the school, relies on this routine. He is also one of 1,200 pupils from the campus – shared with St Luke’s National School – displaced by the schools’ indefinite closing this week following structural assessment inspections carried out for the Department of Education. When Andy’s taxi did not pick him up for school Wednesday morning, he began pacing up and down ripping things climbing crying. “A total meltdown,” Morgan called it. “He knows he should be in school,” she said. “I’m up the walls . . . My son could have a regression because of this.”Morgan spends most days taking care of her adult son Anthony (26), who has Cerebral Palsy, but spent Wednesday morning struggling to contain Andy, who she says was “bouncing off the walls”. Anthony even had to wait 40 minutes to use the bathroom while his mother corralled Andy. With midterm break next week, Morgan has already been preparing for days at home taking care of Anthony, Andy, and her daughter Sophie (10). Her main concern now is how long the school will be closed, and how it could negatively affect Andy’s education. “With a child with autism, you have to accept a school that has a place available, where the waitlists can take years,” Morgan said. “You can cope for a day or two, but when you don’t know how long it’s going to be, it’s very difficult.”Parents were on hand at the school Wednesday afternoon for an impromptu car-park meeting with Matthew Waine, a Solidarity councillor for the Mulhuddart Ward on Fingal County Council. Waine has spoken to construction experts who suggest the building could be closed for months. If the schools have to relocate, he fears there is not nearby infrastructure in place to support an appropriate education environment. “There’s a stony silence from everyone,” he said. “The department hasn’t really said anything. Schools haven’t said anything. What are you going to do with 1,200 students? Where are they going to go?”Parents at the meeting were concerned that moving to a new school could throw off their work schedules, and expressed worry regarding the educational difficulties of changing schools and programmes. “Even if they find another place for the kids to go – and I have a hard time believing they will – I’m worried it will be too far and won’t suit us,” said Giulia Romoli, a parent attending the meeting. Charlie Cleary, a stay-at-home father of two whose sons attend Educate Together, was concerned about his sons assimilating to a new school environment with unfamiliar surroundings, teachers and students. “This is an absolute, complete disaster,” he said. “The worst part is the kids will be separated throughout Dublin 15. They will be forced to blend in. My guess is a lot of kids will do it, more won’t be able to.” "},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Healthcare workers and at-risk groups urged to get vaccinated ahead of winter monthsDetectives have arrested a man in his mid-60s following incident near MacroomResearch Lives: Dr Sheila McBreen, associate professor, University College Dublin School of PhysicsParents of children in schools closed due to structural issues express their fearsReconnect programme asks citizen scientists for help finding barriers to fish spawningMinister says it is likely that more schools will be ordered to close over the coming daysPeat was responsible for 3.4 million tonnes of emissions in Ireland during 2016Ceann Comhairle claims State adheres to \u0026lsquoone China\u0026rsquo policy in letter to DeputiesFast charge \u0026lsquosuper hubs\u0026rsquo to be installed on motorways and primary routesCouncils will get greater powers over short-term lettings in areas of high housing demand\u0026lsquoWe are splitting the vote and lowering the tone,\u0026rsquo says Gavin DuffyFour vehicles seized by garda\u0026iacute under Road Traffic ActsNorth inner city street should be a \u0026lsquovibrant cosmopolitan destination village\u0026rsquoNorth moves a step closer to abortion rights and marriage equalityMembers of the European Parliament back the proposals by 571 to 53Michael Jansen has been writing for more than half a century on people and events in the Middle EastGold rings that lay buried for 3,000 years now shine in National Museum\u0026lsquoIf we want to have a reliable network in Ireland we are going to have some way of supporting that\u0026rsquoFocus Ireland figures reveal 9,698 people in emergency accommodation in September"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3674423.1540403746!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"irish is spoken in the house of commons for the first time in more than 100 years","story":"During a debate on decision-making powers of civil-servants at Stormont, Plaid Cymru MP Liz Saville-Roberts called on the British government to introduce legislation protecting the rights of Irish speakers.

Photograph:  Getty ImagesIn what is believed to be a first in modern British political discourse, a Welsh member of parliament addressed the House of Commons in Irish on Wednesday.During a debate on decision-making powers of civil-servants at Stormont, Plaid Cymru MP Liz Saville-Roberts called on the British government to introduce legislation protecting the rights of Irish speakers.Parliamentarians heard the Member of Parliament for Dwyfor Meirionnydd say in Irish that language rights are human rights and that the Irish-speaking community is entitled to equality of treatment: “Is cearta daonna iad cearta teanga agus tá cothrom na féinne tuilte ag lucht labhartha na Gaeilge,” she said.Continuing in English, she pressed Northern Ireland secretary Karen Bradley to uphold the British government’s commitment to introduce language legislation as outlined under the St Andrew’s Agreement struck between the Irish and British governments and Northern Ireland’s political parties in 2006.“The British government pledged to introduce an Irish language act based on the experiences of Wales and the Republic of Ireland,” she said.“Will the minister uphold this commitment by introducing an Irish language act if power sharing institutions are not restored within six months?” she asked.Efforts to introduce language legislation have been met with stern opposition from unionist politicians and a refusal by the DUP to sign off on a stand-alone Irish Language Act. Conradh na Gaeilge has moved its campaign to Westminster where it is now seeking support from MPs for legislation that would protect the rights of Irish speakers under British law. “Considering there already exists legislation in Wales and in Scotland, elements of which were both introduced under former Conservative Governments, we see no reason why the British Government would not act and fulfil their 2006 St Andrews promise through the implementation of an Irish Language Act based on the Welsh and Irish experiences,” said Dr Niall Comer, president of Conradh na Gaeilge. “All we are asking is to be brought into line with the other indigenous language communities on these islands,” he added.Wednesday’s contribution is the first time Irish was spoken by a sitting MP in modern times. In 1901 , Irish Parliamentary Party MP for West Kerry Thomas O’Donnell delivered his maiden speech in Irish.Reporting on his speech at the time, the Pall Mall Gazette proclaimed: “Mr Thomas O’Donnell rose in the House last night to make his maiden speech, and addressed the Speaker in the Erse language. As a joke it was the feeblest performance that even Mr O’Donnell can have perpetrated, and by this time he ought to be consumed by his own blushes.”“When the Speaker refused to listen to Mr O’Donnell, even after his leader had pleaded for him to be allowed to speak in the language he knew best, Mr (John) Redmond advised his follower to refuse to speak in English if he was forbidden to speak in Erse. So Mr O’Donnell shut his lips with a snap, and the House won’t hear him talk this side of Christmas. It is a small mercy, but not to be despised. As for Mr Redmond, if he would restore himself to our favour let him give similar advice to the rest of his party.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3674519.1540404962!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"controversy over take home pay is not a big deal says n%C3%AD riada","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDuring the presidential debate  on RTÉ, Liadh Ní Riada said her take-home pay was €60,000. Photograph: Tom Honan for The Sinn Féin presidential candidate Liadh Ní Riada has dismissed controversy over her take-home pay as an MEP as “not a big deal”.Ms Ní Riada admitted on Tuesday night’s presidential debate on RTÉ that she does not live on the average industrial wage, as she had previously claimed.Sinn Féin has traditionally maintained that its elected representatives take home the average industrial wage, with the balance of their earnings used to pay party and constituency expenses.However, it emerged earlier this year that TD Dessie Ellis was being allowed to take home his entire Dáil salary and it was suspected other representatives enjoyed a similar exemption from the rule.In the debate, Ms Ní Riada clarified that her take-home pay was €60,000, out of which she takes home €47,000, with the balance going on constituency costs. She said she paid €40,000 in tax annually.The monthly pre-tax salary of MEPs is €8,484, which is the equivalent of an annual gross salary of €101,808.According to the Central Statistics Office, the average industrial wage is €744.08 a week, or €38,692 a year. In July 2017, Ms Ní Riada told Hot Press magazine she thought Sinn Féin’s policy that members accept only the average industrial wage was “a good idea”.“In order to be in touch with the reality of what it’s like to be an ordinary working class person in Ireland, you need to be living in the same circumstances. That means having an average industrial wage and trying to make it stretch.”Asked if she was taking the average industrial wage, she replied: “I am indeed.”During the RTÉ debate, Ms Ní Riada said she was lucky to take home a good wage and she had a family to support. Before she became an MEP, she knew what it was like to struggle, she said.Asked why she had told Hot Press something that was not true, she said it was “just semantics” and she should have clarified that the amount she quoted was after tax. She also receives a €4,000 a month allowance which is used to operate two constituency offices and for other expenses.Two years ago, she told Hot Press that “on huge wages you’re really removed from reality, you’re really removed from the struggle it is for people to educate their kids, to pay their mortgage, and all of that”. During Tuesday’s debate, she said “even if you’re on a very, very big wage, it’s still difficult to make ends meet because the cost of living is so high”.Read more news, analysis and comment from the race to the \u0026Aacuteras"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3652939.1538749548!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"in profile the six candidates running for the presidency","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t  Áras an Uachtaráin, the residence of the president. Photograph: Bryan O’BrienMICHAEL D HIGGINS Age: 77 Position: President of Ireland since 2011 Party: Independent Public life: Formerly a Labour Party TD and Senator. Minister for Arts, Heritage and Gaeltacht 1992 to 1997 Slogan: A president for us all Platform: When asked why he is standing again, President Higgins has argued that the challenges for the next seven years are different. In particular, he has mentioned climate change, Brexit and housing in interviews.He has four broad themes set out in his manifesto. The first is equality and inclusion, which includes ersity and marginal people. The second is sustainable communities, which takes in climate change, the environment, creativity, and localism. The third is one of his strong cards, his handling of the centenary celebrations, especially 1916. He emphasises his status, and argues he is the best person to be president for the commemoration of the first Dáil in 1919 and placing it in the context of a changed society. His last theme is his role as a representative of Ireland abroad, saying he will make Ireland a champion for human rights, peace and sustainable development. This will include, presumably, Brexit, and his contentious (and as yet untested) critique of the gap between the EU institutions and the “European street”.Controversies: The major one so far has been an unaudited €317,000 annual allowance. It is spent on State dinners, garden parties and other events at the Áras. Under persistent questioning more details have emerged, but the campaign is will face more questions until full figures are produced. The President described one claim it was used to top up a salary as “outrageous”, and says every cent of allowance is accounted for. He has also been criticised for reneging on his commitment to serve only one term, and his very full schedule of high-profile “presidential” events, which his opponents say give him an unfair advantage.PETER CASEY Age: 60 Position: Businessman, former Dragons’ Den panellist Party: Independent Public life: None. Failed attempt for the Seanad in 2016 Slogan: Small country, big nation Platform: He has built his platform on three pillars. His first is to unite the 40 million Irish diaspora in a meaningful way, making it an economic powerhouse. He claims the Irish abroad punch below their weight. His second is an Irish birthright programme to bring teenagers with Irish heritage to the country for a month where they could experience Dublin, Belfast and the Gaeltacht. His third is to reduce the costs of the presidency. He says he will forego his salary and give it to county councils to spend on local charities.Controversies: Has been more direct in his criticism of the President than other candidates. Was criticised for a tweet in which he drove a golf ball into the Atlantic, and then claimed to have retrieved it. He made a claim, subsequently withdrawn, that an incident involving an intruder in the Áras was a stunt. He has said one of the consequences of Brexit might be an independent Ulster. He also questions Irish neutrality and wants closer alignment to Nato.Funding: Casey says he will fund his own campaign, which he estimates will cost €100,000.Age: 51 Position: MEP for Ireland South since 2014. Formerly TV producer. Party: Sinn Féin Public life: MEP. Previously Irish language officer for Sinn Féin. Slogan: A new president for a new Ireland Platform: Ní Riada is the youngest of the candidates, and is a daughter of the late composer Seán Ó Riada. Both her parents died when she was a child, and her first husband died when she was 29. She has focused her messages on carers, recognition of fair wages, and a drive to bring home Irish people who were forced to emigrate during the recession.She argues her party’s position of extending voting rights to citizens in the North and those living abroad, and wants to establish a “citizens’ conversation” on Irish unity. Mental health is also a big theme, as are community and equality.Controversies: The Sinn Féin candidate has been running a ground campaign. She has focused on rural Ireland so far, and local rather than national media. She has been questioned about her criticism of the HPV vaccine several years ago. She now says she supports it but refuses to disclose if her daughters received it, citing family privacy. She also relies on the Sinn Féin line that Gerry Adams was never a member of the IRA and has also refused to describe the IRA’s worst atrocities as acts of terrorism. “It was a terrible time of conflict. But there is no conflict without a reason,” she told HotPress in an interview.Funding: Her campaign is funded by Sinn Féin. She is one of only two candidates who will have posters placed around the country.Age: 58 Position: Businessman. Dragons’ Den panellist. Party: Non-party Public life: None Slogan: Ambitious for Ireland Platform: He wants youth corps that will go to developing countries. He will also launch a campaign against childhood obesity. He will encourage ersity and stamp out cyberbullying. Duffy has put huge emphasis on his experience in business, and has argued that he would be the best at representing Ireland abroad as new economic challenges posed by Brexit and other global disruptions hit. He has not ruled out a second term, saying he would make a public decision six years into his term, if elected.Controversies: His past work as a consultant for Denis O’Brien has been the subject of persistent questioning. He says he did a total of about 40 hours of work for the businessman during 20 years, but won’t state the nature of the advice he gave. He has also had to deny he is a proxy Fine Gael candidate – he chaired the party’s leadership debates between Leo Varadkar and Simon Coveney. He has also been asked about the lack of a public service record and funding. He initially said he would take a loan of €700,000 but has now said he will fund the campaign from his own resources.Funding: €300,000 from his own resources. He is not going to do postering.Age: 56 Position: Businessman. Former Dragons’ Den panellist. Party: Non-party Public life: Presidential candidate in 2011 Slogan: Shaping our future together Platform: It’s what he calls a values-based campaign, and very much an economic message based on communities and small business. He wants to encourage whole swathes of Ireland which he says have not seen the recovery to recover through finding their own community and business leaders. Like other candidates he says he will focus a lot on isions and disabilities. He says he also wants to continue the work of Mary and Martin McAleese on the peace process by building up unity within communities North and South. He is convinced that Ireland will be united within his lifetime.Controversies: There is what many see the unfinished business of the bitter 2011 campaign, especially Tweetgate (when a fake tweet was read out during an RTÉ presidential election debate which Gallagher alleged contributed to his loss). Some see his participation as in someway settling a score. He denies this. Gallagher is still asked if he is a proxy Fianna Fáil candidate (which he denies). He is also asked about his low profile in the seven years since the last campaign. He is far more open these days about his Fianna Fáil connections and his role in fundraising for the party.Funding: Has not disclosed spending but it will come from his own resources. Has said it will be a “frugal” campaign, staffed by volunteers, without any posters.Age: 60 Position: Senator. Founder of charities Pieta House and Darkness into Light Party: Non-party Public life: Senator (Taoiseach’s nominee) since 2016. Slogan: Better Together Platform: Unsurprisingly mental and physical health form core parts of her message. She wants to hold a mental health summit within six months of becoming president. She also wants to hold a National Assembly of Well-Being and an annual day of wellness. She has plans to address the growing rate of obesity amongst the young, and also to “change the language” around elderly people. She has also said she would extend the Gaisce award to all age groups and stamp out cyber-bullying. She would also like to “give a voice to young people on the Council of State”.Controversies: The main controversy she has been embroiled in has surrounded funding. She does not have the resources of other candidates, and had to rely on loans. One of €120,000 came from a Los Angeles businessman Des Walsh. He is a former boyfriend from 40 years ago, but the large vitamin supplements company he headed was also investigated for pyramid selling. Her sister and niece were prominent in the No campaigns in the referendum on the Eighth Amendment and she also voted No. She said she would have no difficulty signing the new abortion regime into law, and that two of her daughters voted Yes.Funding: €140,000 so far. Two loans totalling €130,00 and €10,000 of her own resources.Read more news, analysis and comment from the race to the \u0026Aacuteras"},{"url":null,"title":"president higgins defends use of government jet on rt%C3%A9 debate","story":"  October 23, 2018Casey accuses incumbent of telling \u0026lsquolies\u0026rsquo as candidates trade criticisms in heated discussion   October 24, 2018Viewers of RT\u0026Eacute presidential debate got an even-handed free for all   October 24, 2018Prime Time\u0026rsquos presidential debate had no winners \u0026ndash and the big losers were its viewers   October 24, 2018RT\u0026Eacute figures show high levels of interest in final TV debate featuring all six candidates "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3674574.1540419021!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"se%C3%A1n gallagher is michael d hiding something on expenses","story":"As the presidential election campaign comes to an end, political correspondent Harry McGee joins Sean Gallagher on the hustings in Dublin. Video: Bryan O\u0027Brien\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tPresidential candidate Seán Gallagher with his wife Trish, at Loreto College, St Stephen’s Green, Dublin. Photograph: Dara Mac DónaillThe Up at Northwood Business Park in Santry, the last leaves are desperately clinging on. But soon they will have to bow to the inevitable. Seán Gallagher walks across the carpark past the russet-coloured trees to the Gourmet Food Parlour’s restaurant. He is upbeat and assertive but with less than 48 hours to go to polling day, one feels that he, like the other four challengers to Michael D Higgins, is clinging on at this stage. That is the nature of these things. It is the end game and the outcome is already evident, and has been since the beginning of the campaign. Gallagher rues that the campaign was not longer, indicating that four weeks was not enough for those who wished to take on a popular incumbent. And now, in the final days of the campaign, the businessman has come out with the gloves off. He returns to a recurring theme of the campaign – the €317,000 allowance for unspecified Áras expenses – and asks again why they are not being published. But now, for the first time, there is a note of suspicion. “Is there something within these accounts that Michael D is hiding?” he asks. “If not, why not publish them? The questions have been raised but the answers are not forthcoming.”It is a forceful move, but may be too late to make any real difference.We join Gallagher on his final canvass appearances before the moratorium kicks in. In between radio interviews, he visits the Loreto on the Green school in Dublin in the morning and the Gourmet Food Parlour in the afternoon. At the door he meets Alan Quirke and Shirley Byrne, who take him through its history. Twelve years in existence, it has gone from having 12 employees to 300 employees. Gallagher quizzes them up and down about the company, asking the kind of questions he might have asked during the Dragons’ Den years about branches, the catering side, growth plans, and so on. There is a sense that this is his comfort zone, talking to small and medium businesses about expanding and ersifying. On the wall inside, there is a framed newspaper article penned by Gallagher six years ago, when the company was first spreading its wings. He says he did a similar piece on the Santry Sports Clinic, a few hundred metres down the road. And dozens of others.For others, there is the GAA or tidy towns or community groups. This is Gallagher’s nationwide network – businesses and enterprises. That approach worked in 2011, but it just hasn’t resonated in the same way this time round. Candidates will never admit it – and Gallagher in particular is a person who always emphasises positivity – but the election has really become one about who will finish second.He remains bullish. He was happy with his performance in the Primetime debate and berates Higgins for not appearing on Thursday evening’s debate on Virgin One. But he himself did not appear in the first debate and got a scorching for it last night, with other rivals describing him as arrogant. He sees it the other way round. He argues everyone should have refused to participate in the first debate, thus putting pressure on Higgins. One of the reasons he has changed his mind on this issue and is participating in the last debate is to ask the questions he says Higgins has not answered. “The strange thing is Leo Varadkar and the Government see nothing wrong with that. In what Government department would they get away with that? Is it okay for him to say that in other Government departments, do not worry about auditing your accounts?”He continues: “Many journalists have said they have asked for publication of the accounts and they are not getting answers. More importantly, the electorate and the taxpayers are not getting any answers.”Asked has he got tired of being asked what he has been doing for the past seven years, he replies: “I wish that you or anyone would have accompanied me for every hour of every day for the last seven years. You would not have asked me what I was doing.”He repeats his oft-aired comments about staying with the same, or looking for something new: “It’s time for change. We need a president with a different vision for the next seven years.”But unless the polls have got it disastrously wrong, that is unlikely to happen.

Video: The White House\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t\u0027I knew few people as skilled at explaining the mood of the Arab street and the intricacies of Arab politics\u0027 as Jamal Khashoggi, above. Photograph: Johnny GreenPA WireI first met Jamal Khashoggi in January 1992, when we were both covering the military coup that prevented the Islamic Salvation Front winning parliamentary elections in Algeria. \u0026nbspIn the coffee shop of the El Djazair Hotel, Jamal told me about an exciting young preacher who had helped to drive the Soviets out of Afghanistan and who was building a following across the Arab world. His name was Osama bin Laden. Jamal had interviewed him, and helped western correspondents meet bin Laden in Sudan and later in Afghanistan.It would be easy to misunderstand Jamal’s admiration for the man who would mastermind the 911 attacks. Our conversation took place seven years before al-Qaeda bombed US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, and nearly a decade before 911. When I met Jamal, bin Laden and the mujahideen he led in Afghanistan had not completed the transformation from CIA and Saudi proteges into the world’s most wanted terrorists.Bin Laden was incensed that the Saudi royal family had invited tens of thousands of “infidels” to the cradle of Islam to combat Saddam Hussein in 1991. Bin Laden’s two main arguments – that the House of Saud was corrupt and unworthy to guard the holy places, and that the US played a destructive role in the Middle East – were immensely appealing to many Arabs, including Jamal.After Jamal’s death, the New York Times reported that he mourned the assassination of Bin Laden by US commandos in Pakistan in 2011. “I collapsed crying a while ago, heartbroken for you, Abu Abdullah, ” Jamal tweeted, referring to bin Laden as “father of Abdullah”. “You were beautiful and brave in those beautiful days in Afghanistan, before you surrendered to hatred and passion.”To me, Jamal Khashoggi was just a friendly, helpful colleague whom I was pleased to run into when reporting stories. I knew few people as skilled at explaining the mood of the Arab street and the intricacies of Arab politics. He somehow embodied more than half a century of Arab history: frustration and impotence over the fate of the Palestinians the temptation of radicalism the necessity of finding a modus vivendi with dictators the search for an accommodation between religious faith and freedom.The last time I saw Jamal, more than 20 years ago, we had lunch in Cairo with his Saudi wife, from whom he was orced at the time of his death. She was a pretty, petite woman, dressed from head to toe in a white headscarf and long-sleeved robe. We spoke briefly about their children, after which talk turned to Middle Eastern politics and she fell silent.In Algiers, Jamal wore slacks and a jacket, as he did on October 2nd, when he entered the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. In Cairo he wore a long, white Saudi dishdasha and Arab headdress. It was as if he became more Arab, more Muslim, the closer he travelled to the heart of the Arab and Muslim world. He was a chameleon who impressed western friends with his easy-going manner and the English he mastered at Indiana State University. Muslims noticed his piety.He was by no means a zealot. The New York Times published a photograph of him at a Thanksgiving dinner in Washington last year. There were a half dozen wine bottles on the table, yet Jamal tweeted the photo to his 1.7 million followers – something no Islamic fundamentalist would ever do.Jamal lived astride fault lines between east and west, and between establishment and radical Islam. Any seismologist will tell you that the fault line is the most dangerous place to be. To advise Saudi princes, as Jamal did, was a plunge into shark-infested waters. \u0026nbspJamal supported the Muslim Brotherhood, which was mercilessly repressed in Egypt and Syria over decades. The Saudi monarchy also supported the Brotherhood, until it backed Marshal Abdel Fattah el-Sisi’s overthrow of Egypt’s democratically elected president, Mohamed Morsi, in 2013.If Christian democracy was possible in Europe, why could Arabs not be ruled by Muslim democracy, Jamal asked. That may explain his friendship with Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who on Tuesday denounced Jamal’s “savage murder” by the Saudis. Erdogan constituted the greatest hope of Muslim democracy, until he too turned into a despot.It’s a strange feeling to learn that a colleague you knew and liked died atrociously. I have been surprised and heartened at the scale of the international reaction to Jamal’s murder. One hopes that something good may come of it. Angela Merkel’s announcement that she is halting all arms sales to Saudi Arabia is a positive sign.The disgrace of the Saudi crown prince could foil Donald Trump’s hopes of “regime change” in Iran. And it is just conceivable that Jamal’s death may hasten the end of the disgraceful war that has claimed at least 10,000 lives in Yemen."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3673308.1540315695!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"pennsylvania key to democratic hopes for us midterm elections","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe US Democratic and Republican parties are eyeing the women’s vote as a potential deal-breaker in the midterm elections, given President Donald Trump’s unpopularity among many women voters. Photograph: Cory ClarkNurPhoto via Getty ImagesAs the results rolled in on election night in November 2016, and the electoral college map began to turn from blue to red, the eyes of the country turned to Pennsylvania.The battleground state was Hillary Clinton’s final hope to snatch victory from the jaws of defeat.But shortly after 1.30am, news broke that Pennsylvania had voted for Donald Trump, securing his path to the presidency.The Keystone State, with its 20 electoral college votes, had backed the Republican nominee, part of the red wave that night that helped propel Trump to the White House.Two years later, Pennsylvania is again shaping up to be one of the most closely-watched states, this time in the midterm elections.The state could hold the key to Democrats winning back control of the House of Representatives when America goes to the polls on November 6th.Up to half a dozen seats are potentially for the taking by Democrats in Pennsylvania. This represents about a quarter of the 24 seats the party needs to win nationwide to gain control of the House.The reason for the party’s new-found optimism lies primarily in a momentous court decision earlier this year. Following a lengthy legal process, the state supreme court struck down Pennsylvania’s congressional map as unconstitutional.Pennsylvania had long been regarded as one of the most heavily gerrymandered states in the country. In the last three elections, Republicans have won 13 of the state’s 18 seats in the House of Representatives, despite the fact that the state has a relatively equal percentage of Republican and Democratic voters.Like many legislatures across the country, the imbalance was a result of redistricting undertaken by Republican-controlled states following a wave of wins by the party in 2010 – Pennsylvania’s oddly-shaped districts, which “wander seemingly arbitrarily across Pennsylvania” as the court ruling put it, were widely seen as the most egregious example of gerrymandering in the country.The newly-drawn congressional district map more accurately reflects the demographics of the state and is beneficial to Democrats. This, in addition to the fact that incumbent Republicans such as Pat Meehan and Charlie Dent are retiring, have fuelled hopes that Democrats are on track for a major victory in two weeks’ time.Democratic congressman Brendan Boyle, who represents the 13th district of Philadelphia, is confident about the party’s chances in the state. “I’m very optimistic that we will win at least four congressional seats here at state level – in fact, it is likely that we will pick up more congressional seats in Pennsylvania than any other state in the country.”While the districting changes will almost certainly benefit Democrats, the party is also hoping to tap into the female vote, and build on the anti-Trump energy that manifested itself in the women’s march shortly after the election. Remarkably, Pennsylvania has no female representation in Congress, an anomaly the party is hoping to address. A record number of women are running for elected office this November across the United States, most on a Democratic ticket.Here in the affluent suburb of Germantown in the northern outskirts of Philadelphia, Chrissy Houlahan is one of seven Democratic female candidates who will be on the Pennsylvania congressional ballot on November 6th.Houlahan (51) is running to represent Pennsylvania’s sixth congressional district. A third-generation US army veteran and mother of three, she is also an MIT graduate who has run two start-up companies and also worked as a chemistry teacher. Her Irish-sounding name is courtesy of her husband, whose family hails from Co Kerry.Like many of the female candidates in this election, she has never before run for public office. As she stops for a coffee before heading to a campaign event nearby, she explains why she was motivated this year to run.“I never expected to run for anything,” she says, “All I ever did before was vote and occasionally knock on doors. I really thought that governance and politics were for other people, and I was happy doing my job as a citizen, as a member of the military.”But then 2016 happened. Like many people across the country she was shocked by the election of Trump. In the days following the election she helped organise a bus to travel to Washington DC for the women’s march in the capital.“Fifty-three women travelled down to Washington for the day. We held a sign-decorating party the evening before, packed chicken and doughnuts and headed to the capital.” This experience was “part of the realisation that I could be helpful,” she explains, “seeing all those women, all those signs, all campaigning for issues – reproductive issues, education, the planet”.As she campaigns here in the Philadelphia area, she is keen to stress that she is not running solely on a women’s platform. “Women’s issues are family issues, they’re people issues,” she says. “It’s about ersity, about having people around the table who will represent a ersity of views,” she says, adding that it is unacceptable that Pennsylvania has no women representing the state in Congress.But while Houlahan is reluctant to cast her candidacy as aimed only at females, it is evident that both parties are increasingly eyeing the women’s vote as a potential deal-breaker in these elections, given Trump’s unpopularity among many women voters.In particular, there are signs that the GOP may be in trouble with college-educated women in suburbs from Philadelphia to Atlanta to Houston.A recent Washington Post survey found that college-educated white women in key battleground races favour Democrats over Republicans by a colossal 27-point margin.The Republican Party has been keen to shift Trump’s focus away from issues that could negatively impact on women. Following the president’s description of adult film star Stormy Daniels as “horseface” last week on Twitter, House speaker Paul Ryan, who typically tempers his criticism of the president, was unequivocal. “There is no place for that kind of language . . . he should not have said that,” he said.With women representing up to 50 per cent of the vote, Democrats hope that by harnessing the female vote on November 6th they could achieve major congressional gains.Elsewhere in the state, which ranges from urban centres such as Philadelphia and Pittsburgh to rural areas of the rust belt, Democrats are also quietly confident. They cite Conor Lamb, a 34-year-old Democrat who unexpectedly won a special election in a traditionally Republican area.As well as their hopes for the House, other races on November 6th are looking positive. One of Pennsylvania’s two Senate seats is up for grabs, and Democratic senator Bob Casey has a double-digit lead over his Republican challenger, Lou Barletta. This is despite controversy over an ad he ran criticising Republican healthcare policy which featured a woman whose twin daughters were diagnosed with cancer. Barletta’s own grandson, also a twin, is fighting cancer and the ad was deemed insensitive.In addition to the Senate race, Pennsylvania’s governor Tom Wolf, a Democrat, is also ahead in the polls.As Democrats look ahead to November 6th, they are hoping that the state that did so much to dash their hopes of a Clinton presidency in 2016 could be key to a comeback in the midterms.Will there be a backlash against Trump?

The pound dropped 0.5 per cent to $1.29, the lowest level since early September.Connor Campbell at Spreadex said sterling’s downward trajectory was “unsurprising”. “It appears that the currency has been spooked by Theresa May’s impending meeting with the 1922 Committee of Tory backbenchers, with whom the PM hardly has the best relationship with at the moment (even before the rather violent comments reported in the papers over the weekend). A no-deal Brexit would seriously threaten our national securityBritain Before Brexit: a portrait of the country and its peopleVoters \u0027deserve a final say on Brexit\u0027, leader of EU socialists says“The outcome of that address may impact how the Brexit negotiations move forward – or don’t, as the troublesome case may be.”Over the weekend, media reports emerged with Tory rebels using aggressive and violent language to attack the prime minister, including one who warned that Ms May should “bring her own noose” if she decided to come to the 1922 meeting. MPs were quoted as saying she was now entering “the killing zone” and that “assassination is in the air”, while another unnamed Tory was quoted as saying: “The moment is coming when the knife gets heated, stuck in her front and twisted. She’ll be dead soon.” Ms May confirmed on Tuesday that she would meet with the backbench 1922 Committee.David Cheetham, chief market analyst at broker XTB, said: “May’s position is similar to that of the pound in that it seems to be carrying on despite the sizable challenges faced.If May was toppled the pound would see a wave of selling in the short-term since her replacement could increase the chances of a no-deal Brexit, Cheetham added.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Chief among those are a new dark mode that turns the screen black and so makes the app easier to look at.People will also be able to add custom nicknames, emoji and colours to each of their chats, which the site says will make it easier to follow inidual chats.The central part of the new app is three tabs: Chats, People and Discover. The app opens on Chats, which contains all of the messages you have sent to normal people People will include friends, stories and a list of people who are online at that moment and Discover will feature everything else, such as businesses, games and ways of following the news.The redesign has included re-writing the Messenger app from the bottom up to make its code more simple. That has made it easier to add new features – like dark mode, which will arrive in the near future – and Facebook says that more will be coming in the future, too.Facebook Messenger on the desktop – which, unlike the app, is accessible from within the main Facebook website – will not be changed for now and so will keep the current look.The new design will be rolled out gradually to users around the world, in part to ensure that the changes are not too sudden.\u0026nbspIt can take time to get used to a new way to use an app you rely on every day, which is why we\u0027re rolling out Messenger 4 in phases, the company said in a blog post.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

For digital assets and decentralised apps to reach their potential, we believe mobile will need to be the main point of distribution. We look forward to partnering with developers in the blockchain community to usher in this vision.The smartphone will look and function much like any other high-end phone, with a 6-inch Quad HD display, a 16-megapixel rear camera and a powerful Snapdragon 845 processor.HTC Exodus is part of a new wave of smartphones incorporating blockchain technology into its device (HTC)However, it will also include a secure enclave that is separate from the Android operating system, where cryptocurrency can be securely stored.The Exodus 1 will also support decentralized, blockchain-supported apps that the firm hopes will help reshape the internet.HTC Exodus will be the first major smartphone to embrace blockchain technology, which the Taiwanese firm hopes will \u0027reshape the internet\u0027 (HTC)HTC\u0026nbspmay be the first of the major smartphone makers to integrate blockchain technology into its device, but it is not the only one.Earlier this year, Israeli startup Sirin Labs announced the Finney phone – a $1,000 smartphone that its creators hope will simultaneously revolutionise smartphones and deliver cryptocurrency to the masses.Dual-screen Finney phone is \u0027world\u0027s first blockchain smartphone\u0027We\u0027re blockchain enthusiasts, Nimrod May, Sirin Labs\u0027 chief marketing officer, told\u0026nbspThe Independent\u0026nbspin July. We want this phone to make all the benefits of blockchain technology available to as big an audience as possible, while making cryptocurrency accessible to the mainstream.Whether any of this new generation of phones catch on will depend on the success of the cryptocurrency space more broadly.Development for both phones would have begun when the market was experiencing a seemingly unending surge, however 2018 has seen a steady decline that has left bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies trading at around a third of their peak value.The future success of cryptocurrencies will equally depend on whether new technologies like the Finney phone and the Exodus 1 can establish a foothold in an already crowded smartphone market.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

It’s not a particularly special sofa: it’s navy blue, from John Lewis, and lumpy from years of people wedging their arses into the cracks between the cushions. If you sit on the chaise longue too hard, it flips like a seesaw.For three and a half years, this sofa was a sort of talisman representing everything that I loved about my old life: home, comfort and belonging.I’ve just moved back to London from Hong Kong, that rocky, typhoon-drenched island off the coast of southern China. It’s nice to be home. I’ve gone from being Theresa May’s “citizen of the world as\u0026nbspa citizen of nowhere” to being a somewhere person again.And what a strange time to be back. The irony that I moved home desperate to belong somewhere again at precisely the same time that the UK is figuring out where and how it belongs itself, is not lost on me.I left the UK at the start of 2015 with my now husband. He’d transferred with his company (HSBC – it seemed obvious we’d end up in Asia), and I’d jacked in my lovely job as an editor on a travel magazine. We’d been living in London for years since graduating and just wanted a change of scene. Friends had started to inch down the aisle and I couldn’t bear many more winters of X Factor. My East Asia experience was limited: I’d been to Shanghai in 2011 to meet a friend and had come back with an unshakeable sense that Asia was where things were moving forward, rather than stalling in Europe.Hong Kong seemed a good choice. It was exotically far-flung, but at only (only!) 6,000 miles away it was close enough to be home in 15 hours and as a former British colony, it had a reassuring vein of home running through it (crucially, the plugs were the same). Plus, as a travel editor, the prospects for fun weekends away in cities like Tokyo, Bangkok and Beijing was intoxicating. Hong Kong was hot, humid, hedonistic and so fast-paced I figured I’d have to sprint to keep up.\u0026nbspThe problem? I’m a somewhere person. I never knew how much I relied on my emotional connection to my home city to inform much of my character until I left it.Hong Kong –\u0026nbspswaggering, sweaty, bombastic Hong Kong –\u0026nbspis an anywhere kind of place. The friends I made came from erse backgrounds and nations, with friends, ties and cultural touchpoints all over the world. By contrast, I came from a world of single culture: most of my family lives within two hours of each other (except one rogue uncle who lives in Malawi) and my close friends are the ones I’ve had since school. I first went on a plane at the embarrassingly old age of 15 (I don’t think anybody, least of all my Eurocamp-loving parents, thought I would end up flying a lot for work).Expat\u0026nbsplife was like being back at university, but with a lot more cashThe first year in Hong Kong was tough as I clung to my Britishness, my London-ness, like a comfort blanket. In my 350 square foot, two-bed flat in Tsim Sha Tsui, Hong Kong, I felt not so much fresh off the boat but flung sharply off it. The sights and smells of my new neighbourhood were almost literally intoxicating, and I couldn’t understand why the supermarket opened, begrudgingly, at 8.10am. I never knew where I was going, and I lost all the swagger I had in London about knowing the coolest, newest places to go. I missed my default lazy Sunday afternoon walking along the South Bank, popping into Tate Modern –\u0026nbspin Hong Kong, there didn’t seem to be any museum really worth a repeat visit. (This is a well-known problem –\u0026nbspfor a global city, Hong Kong doesn’t have any world-class institutions, although the recent opening of the Tai Kwun arts complex and the upcoming opening of the M+ visual arts centre is changing that.)In the UK, I fitted in. I knew this retrospectively because I’d never even considered that I hadn’t. It was a natural sort of belonging. My life revolved around the reassuring timestamps of ordinary British life: Strictly Come Dancing,\u0026nbspthe weird April heatwave\u0026nbspand the John Lewis Christmas ad. I still counted down to Christmas based on that the release of that ad.Eighteen months after we moved, Brexit happened.I can still remember the exact moment I found out that the UK had voted to leave the European Union. It was mid-morning in my glassy office block, and colleagues and I had stayed up watching the count. Hong Kong felt very far away from it all, and to be honest Brexit gave us an excuse for a boozy lunch in some drab Belgian-themed pub and the opportunity to use the suffix “exit”\u0026nbspto describe the leaving do of a friend moving away from\u0026nbspthe city.Created with Sketch.In pictures: The coffin homes of Hong Kong Show all 19Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A general view of residential and commercial buildings in Yau Tsim Mong District which is a popular location for the \u0027subided units\u0027 in Hong KongA five year-old boy plays outside his tiny home, which is made of concrete and corrugated metal on the rooftop of an apartment block as he lives with his parents in an illegal rooftop dwellingA resident walks outside his illegal rooftop dwelling, which is located next to a public housing estate, in the backgroundLi Suet-wen and her son, 6, and daughter, 8, live in a 120-square foot room crammed with a bunk bed, small couch, fridge, washing machine and small table in Hong Kong.

In wealthy Hong Kong, there\u0027s a dark side to a housing boom, with hundreds of thousands of people forced to live in partitioned shoebox apartments, \u0027coffin homes\u0027 and other inadequate housingMy friends and family back home were at the coal face of it. My parents were sending me angry face emojis and announced they were moving to France (two years on they’re still in Essex – their plans to move are about as far along as Theresa May’s). Other friends who’d been up all night sent me bleary-eyed emojis and lightly indignant Whatsapp messages –\u0026nbspwasn’t I glad I lived all those miles away?At that point, the 6,000 mile chasm did feel just that: thousands of miles away. In Hong Kong, a very different type of politics talk was on the agenda for dinner-party conversation –\u0026nbspwould Hong Kong keep its independence or be squashed by China? –\u0026nbspand I sort of hoped Brexit might have collapsed under the weight of expectation by March 2019 anyway.Although in the year after it happened, I was glad to live away from the machinations and non-decisions and dreary refrains of “Brexit means Brexit”. Besides, as sterling fell through the floor, I’d managed to cream off more pounds for my Hong Kong dollars that ever before. I even tentatively posited that if the UK did leave the EU, I might as well set up home in Hong Kong instead.Theresa May’s 2017 speech, in which she derided the anywhere people who felt at home across the world, put into words the crude, untrue split between Leavers or Remainers. It was a defining moment for Brexit, and it was a defining moment for me. At the time, I was an “anywhere”\u0026nbspand couldn’t understand how people like me had become anathema to the national feeling. Most worrying was realising that the UK I ached for was not the UK I would find myself in if I moved back.And how I wanted to move back.\u0026nbspAround the time that May made her “citizen of nowhere” speech, I started to grudgingly accept that I must rather like living in Hong Kong –\u0026nbspafter all, I’d been there for two years. It was probably something to do with the lifestyle, which was hard not to love. Champagne brunches in the winter all-you-can-drink junk boat outings in the summer. Life was just easier: the subway always ran on time and you never woke up to a cold floor in the mornings, even in winter. I made true friends that put up with my constant existential whining about Hong Kong (if you’re reading: I’ll always be truly grateful).Plus, there were the opportunities. Expat life was like being back at university (when was the last time you heard a journalist compare Nottingham with Hong Kong?) but with a lot more cash. The people you met for drinks could introduce you to their entire network, and I met an average of six new people a week (in my six years in London, I think I met six new people in total). Somebody you knew was always doing something entrepreneurial –\u0026nbspthanks to the city being one of the most open places to do business in. Everybody knew everybody, which was comforting, until it started to feel suffocating. I couldn’t escape my job, even though I adored it.Eventually I came to realise that champagne brunches and low tax rates and the indifference I had for Hong Kong weren’t the things I wanted from my life or at least not one full enough for me to accept. The fact I lived 12 flying hours away from family and my closest friends, who were getting married and sprogging with alarming briskness, weighed on me heavily. I had planned my own wedding long-distance and it felt like it was happening to somebody else during much of our 18-month engagement.\u0026nbspIn Hong Kong, I always felt hollow at the fact that I didn’t speak the same language, or share the same culture –\u0026nbspor even the adopted expat one. In Asia, I felt more British and stuck in my ways than ever, which seemed like the opposite of the person I thought I was in Britain.And so the decision to move back wasn’t the proverbial lightning bolt. It was a slow blistering of the feeling that me, living in Hong Kong, wasn’t quite right. I frequently felt angry and upset and weak that I couldn’t settle in this most intoxicating of cities. The longer it went on, the more the issue of Brexit started to feel more and more abstract, and in some ways I was grateful for it happening: weren’t we lucky to live in a place that had at least some autonomy, however blunt, over the way the country was run?And so three and a half years almost to the day after setting foot on Hong Kong Island, I ditched the territory for Gatwick Airport (maybe the most British of all airports –\u0026nbspchaos inside, then surrounded by the gorgeous South Downs outside). I even left without my husband, such was my rush to move back.I’ve been home for around two months now, working for The Independent, where I don’t need to be careful about how I talk about China’s nationality complex: I can now write the words “Taiwan”\u0026nbspand “country”\u0026nbspnext to each other. I’ve realised that democracy means more than just voting for my next leader. It means being able to live in a place where I can speak freely, and be part of a dynamic and shouty media landscape unafraid to say what it thinks.The first night I was back, jet lagged and drunk after a bottle and more of wine, I cried in front of my friends about it being “the end of an era” –\u0026nbspand it is. I’ve transitioned with frightening ease back to my old life: I’m living in the same flat, I have the same friends, and I’ve gone back to eating the same thing for dinner. It’s almost like my three and half years abroad never happened.\u0026nbspThe crude difference is that I’ve reacquainted myself with the UK’s sluggish public services and an increased level of danger –\u0026nbspessentially the spoils that come with an open nation.Tangibly, plenty has changed. In the three and a half years I was away, my London neighbourhood, SE1, has sprouted an outdoor food market, and some hip performance space in what was a car park. The UK has its second female prime minister. I can pay for the Tube using Apple Pay, and everybody uses Uber\u0026nbsp–\u0026nbspif they’re not getting on the Night Tube. Half the high street has disappeared and isn’t it great I can pick up my Amazon parcel from a locker?China defends decision to deny work visa for Financial Times editor Bus travel hits 12-year-low as prices rise and services axedWhere do the limits lie for ultra-long-haul air travel?And intangibly, plenty has changed. I feel like a different person. I’ve visited some of the most densely populated cities on earth that aren’t well-known (yet) in the UK. I’ve embedded myself into a culture completely separate from my own and seen how the developing world views the UK. I’ve learned\u0026nbspscraps of Mandarin and known bone-crushing loneliness. I’ve transitioned back to being the well-travelled one among my friends, whereas in Hong Kong I felt like the polar opposite.I can’t say it wasn’t gut-wrenching to leave a life and friends I loved, although the idea of not living in my home country again tore at something even more primal –\u0026nbspBrexit or no Brexit. I’ve at last accepted that I just didn’t like Hong Kong that much, however much I enjoyed the lifestyle.Now, back in London, I have moments of such vibrating happiness to walk along some dingy street in Elephant and Castle I feel I might burst. I wait for a delayed train and my heart feels full (I know, weird).\u0026nbspI’m back in my city, and I’m back on my sofa.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

She also defended an incident on reality show\u0026nbspThe Real Housewives Of New York, in which\u0026nbspLuAnn de Lesseps\u0026nbspused blackface to dress up as Diana Ross. De Lesseps apologised for the costume at the time, but denied she used blackface.\u0026nbsp“There was a controversy on The Real Housewives of New York with Luann, and she dressed as Diana Ross, and she made her skin look darker than it really is and people said that that was racist,” Kelly said. “And I don’t know, I felt like who doesn’t love Diana Ross? She wants to look like Diana Ross for one day. I don’t know how, like, that got racist on Halloween.”“I haven’t seen it. I have not seen it, but it sounds a little racist to me,”\u0026nbspMSNBC correspondent Jacob Soboroff, who had joined Kelly for the segment, replied. Indeed, Kelly’s fellow panellists disagreed with her, as\u0026nbspauthor and television host Melissa Rivers said: “If you think it’s offensive, it probably is. Whatever happened to just, manners and polite society?”The segment was roundly criticised, not only for Kelly’s comments, but for the fact the panel failed to include a single non-white guest, and for the failure to discuss the brutal history of blackface.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspKelly’s note to her colleagues added: “When we had the roundtable discussion earlier today about the controversy of making your face look like a different race as part of a Halloween costume, I suggested that this seemed okay if done as part of this holiday where people have the chance to make themselves look like others.”“The iconic Diana Ross came up as an example. To me, I thought, why would it be controversial for someone dressing up as Diana Ross to make herself look like this amazing woman as a way of honoring and respecting her? I realize now that such behavior is indeed wrong, and I am sorry. The history of blackface in our culture is abhorrent the wounds too deep.”Follow\u0026nbspIndependent Culture\u0026nbspon Facebook for all the latest on Film, TV, Music, and moreShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

What young people want is to be active in taking the Gospel also to technology and have fun, learn and be evangelized through these channels.Pope admits child abuse has driven young people away from CatholicismPope Francis recently spoke about the challenges the Catholic Church faces in attracting young people, given the decades of child sex abuse scandals.They are upset by sexual and economic scandals that do not meet with clear condemnation, by our unpreparedness to really appreciate the lives and sensibilities of the young, and simply by the passive role we assign them, Pope Francis told a group of followers in Estonia last month.The app is likely to raise questions about whether it constitutes religious indoctrination of young people, with leading atheist and agnostic figures previously criticising\u0026nbspattempts to force religion onto children.In 2013, the academic\u0026nbspRichard Dawkins said that raising a child within an organised religion like Catholicism was in itself equivalent to child abuse.What a child should be taught is that religious exists that some people believe this and some people believe that, Professor Dawkins said at the Chipping Norton Literary Festival.\u0026nbspWhat a child should never be taught is that \u0027you are a Catholic or Muslim child, therefore that is what you believe.\u0027 That\u0027s child abuse.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The pound dropped 0.5 per cent to $1.29, the lowest level since early September.Connor Campbell at Spreadex said sterling’s downward trajectory was “unsurprising”. “It appears that the currency has been spooked by Theresa May’s impending meeting with the 1922 Committee of Tory backbenchers, with whom the PM hardly has the best relationship with at the moment (even before the rather violent comments reported in the papers over the weekend). A no-deal Brexit would seriously threaten our national securityBritain Before Brexit: a portrait of the country and its peopleVoters \u0027deserve a final say on Brexit\u0027, leader of EU socialists says“The outcome of that address may impact how the Brexit negotiations move forward – or don’t, as the troublesome case may be.”Over the weekend, media reports emerged with Tory rebels using aggressive and violent language to attack the prime minister, including one who warned that Ms May should “bring her own noose” if she decided to come to the 1922 meeting. MPs were quoted as saying she was now entering “the killing zone” and that “assassination is in the air”, while another unnamed Tory was quoted as saying: “The moment is coming when the knife gets heated, stuck in her front and twisted. She’ll be dead soon.” Ms May confirmed on Tuesday that she would meet with the backbench 1922 Committee.David Cheetham, chief market analyst at broker XTB, said: “May’s position is similar to that of the pound in that it seems to be carrying on despite the sizable challenges faced.If May was toppled the pound would see a wave of selling in the short-term since her replacement could increase the chances of a no-deal Brexit, Cheetham added.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

They found a series of signs that suggested black holes are closely orbiting each other.Before black holes fully merge together, they form what is known as a binary black hole, swirling around each other in orbit before they eventually get close and smash into each other. Scientists have spotted evidence of smaller black holes crashing into each other since 2015, by measuring the gravitational waves that are sent out into the universe.But scientists haven’t yet been able to see evidence of the bigger, supermassive binary black holes.Now scientists have examined the powerful jets that are thrown out by supermassive black holes. As the binary black holes orbit each other, the jet coming out will occasionally change direction – by mapping those as they change, scientists can confirm that those binary black holes do exist.“We have studied the jets in different conditions for a long time with computer simulations,” said\u0026nbspMartin Krause, lead author and senior lecturer in Astronomy at the University of Hertfordshire.\u0026nbsp”In this first systematic comparison to high-resolution radio maps of the most powerful radio sources, we were astonished to find signatures that were compatible with jet precession in three quarters of the sources.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

I am charmed by the arrangement of their bodies and the shapes in which they are bonding. I realise the contemporary significance of the scene: the labyrinth - a complicated, irregular network of passages in which it is difficult to find one’s way - alongside the simplicity and closeness of human togetherness. In any complicated maze-like structure - Brexit included - it is important to remember that people and love and relationships are a vital part of the picture.Walking back into town from Leagrave High Street I notice two graffitied propaganda messages: ‘Free Gaza’ and ‘Beverly is a black cow’. Here are but two voices, I think, in the crazy cacophony of contemporary British discourse, of the British tongue, fractured as it is into accents, splintered by slangs, torn, in this case, into the libertarian and abusive, one dehumanising, one for freedom.University students hold a flash protest against the low pay of McDonald’s employees. They receive tuts, cheers, insults, whoops, raised eyebrows. People enter the restaurant in any case, unaware or uncaring that they have crossed a picket line.I went to look inside the Catholic Cathedral during Mass. I wanted to see the ritual and the practices, the people and their poses. There is a rich spectrum of visual dimensions to Catholic prayer that I first noticed when photographing in Poland. I’m attracted to its ambivalence: solemn and joyous lonely in dialogue desperate but determined solitary yet complete.Posters from the town’s glory days surround the Winter Gardens as it rusts and becomes overgrown. It seems like an intentional act to rekindle nostalgia in the face of disrepair, to balance the present with representations of the past.At the back of the central market hang three representations of conflict, side-by-side, connected, making sense in relation to one another. Only one message can be worn at any one time, but together they narrate a powerful image of modern Britain: a unified group, a club, an undefeated nation facing an existential threat from its enemies.People set up posts outside the train station, asking the town’s new arrivals for various things: religious missionaries seek attention and commitment a person sleeping rough asks for food and spare change. I’m interested in how this affects the visual experience of arriving in Luton and what the religious and the homeless look like when viewed in the same frame.A concoction of interests outside King’s College: a tourist desperately hailing lost members of the group a shopper takes a break from the high street a man sits to read a woman meditates with her identity concealed.A family emerges from the colours of Leagrave High Street. Twins sit and stare, identically, scrutinising me, like their father, perhaps. They are framed by rails of clothes. Mannequins exaggerate their life.A pop-up employment workshop opens for business in the town centre. The sign is heavily loaded with the values of modern Britain: one must aspire to achieve, earn, and live acquiring skills is akin to personal development the prioritisation of the ‘local’. A lady carrying water on a scooter - unconventionally, comically, skilfully - appears as a strange detail of everyday life passing such lofty visions.The Britannia Monument celebrates Horatio Nelson’s life. An acrobat fell from the top and died in 1863. It remains a mystery, a travesty for some, that Britannia - the monument’s embodiment of the nation - has her back to the sea. These days she turns her back on a single one-man tent too, a home, a shelter erected on the shore.This was the last scene I saw in the town. I was leaving. I thought of how child’s play, in its innocence and vitality, continues amidst our hunched, phone-tapping adolescence and adulthood.A couple and their dog relax by the Cathedral’s Labyrinth.

They receive tuts, cheers, insults, whoops, raised eyebrows. People enter the restaurant in any case, unaware or uncaring that they have crossed a picket line.I went to look inside the Catholic Cathedral during Mass. I wanted to see the ritual and the practices, the people and their poses. There is a rich spectrum of visual dimensions to Catholic prayer that I first noticed when photographing in Poland. I’m attracted to its ambivalence: solemn and joyous lonely in dialogue desperate but determined solitary yet complete.Posters from the town’s glory days surround the Winter Gardens as it rusts and becomes overgrown. It seems like an intentional act to rekindle nostalgia in the face of disrepair, to balance the present with representations of the past.At the back of the central market hang three representations of conflict, side-by-side, connected, making sense in relation to one another. Only one message can be worn at any one time, but together they narrate a powerful image of modern Britain: a unified group, a club, an undefeated nation facing an existential threat from its enemies.People set up posts outside the train station, asking the town’s new arrivals for various things: religious missionaries seek attention and commitment a person sleeping rough asks for food and spare change. I’m interested in how this affects the visual experience of arriving in Luton and what the religious and the homeless look like when viewed in the same frame.A concoction of interests outside King’s College: a tourist desperately hailing lost members of the group a shopper takes a break from the high street a man sits to read a woman meditates with her identity concealed.A family emerges from the colours of Leagrave High Street. Twins sit and stare, identically, scrutinising me, like their father, perhaps. They are framed by rails of clothes. Mannequins exaggerate their life.A pop-up employment workshop opens for business in the town centre. The sign is heavily loaded with the values of modern Britain: one must aspire to achieve, earn, and live acquiring skills is akin to personal development the prioritisation of the ‘local’. A lady carrying water on a scooter - unconventionally, comically, skilfully - appears as a strange detail of everyday life passing such lofty visions.The Britannia Monument celebrates Horatio Nelson’s life. An acrobat fell from the top and died in 1863. It remains a mystery, a travesty for some, that Britannia - the monument’s embodiment of the nation - has her back to the sea. These days she turns her back on a single one-man tent too, a home, a shelter erected on the shore.This was the last scene I saw in the town. I was leaving. I thought of how child’s play, in its innocence and vitality, continues amidst our hunched, phone-tapping adolescence and adulthood.But speaking after the gathering of Tory MPs, the former home secretary, Amber Rudd, said Ms May has addressed her colleagues with “passion and emotion”, and said she believed the prime minister was safe in the job.\u0026nbspMs Rudd praised the PM, adding: She got a warm welcome, she talked quite emotionally about why she was doing this for the good of the country and how it was important that the public and our party members realise that we are behind her and that we all wanted the same thing - which is to lead in the best interests of the country.The Conservative MP Michael Farbricant\u0026nbspalso described the meeting as a “love in”, telling journalists gathered outside the meeting room: “It wasn\u0027t Daniella in the lions\u0027 den, it was a petting zoo.”\u0026nbspThe Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

But it is also clear that we will not rush a deal through at the expense of our principles or our agreed commitments, most notably on the Irish border question.Frans Timmerman: EU will not sacrifice principles to get Brexit deal“With all of this in mind we must now continue negotiating with patience, calm\u0026nbspand an open mind. The commission and our chief negotiator Michel Barnier received the full backing of all our leaders to do just that. It is time to deliver and we’re getting on with the job.”Ms May had said on Monday that “95 per cent\u0026nbspof the Withdrawal Agreement and its protocols are now settled”\u0026nbspbut that the Irish border was still a sticking point. Michel Barnier, the Commission’s chief negotiator, has previously quoted similar figures, suggesting most issues have been resolved.Created with Sketch.Brexit march for a final say – in pictures Show all 26Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Final Say campaigners take part in the peoples vote march for the future in London 20102018Final Say campaigners take part in the peoples vote march for the future in London 20102018Final Say campaigners take part in the peoples vote march for the future in LondonDemonstrators pass Trafalgar Square as they take part in a march calling for a People\u0027s Vote on the final Brexit deal, in central London on October 20, 2018. - Britons dreading life outside Europe gathered from all corners of the UK to London on Saturday to try to stop their country\u0027s looming breakup with the EU.Demonstrators wave Union and European flags and hold up placards as they pass Trafalgar Square, taking part in a march calling for a People\u0027s Vote on the final Brexit deal, in central London on October 20, 2018. - Britons dreading life outside Europe gathered from all corners of the UK to London on Saturday to try to stop their country\u0027s looming breakup with the EU.

Most recently the UK and EU have considered extending the transition period or setting up elements of a customs union between the UK and EU after Brexit.But any deal would also have to satisfy Eurosceptics in the Conservative Party, who are threatening to unseat Ms May, and her DUP allies in Northern Ireland, who have rejected a series of possible solutions on the basis that they treat the province differently to the rest of the UK.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

We will take responsibility and sort out this mess with a people’s vote.”Speaking to The Independent beforehand, she said many Tory MPs were privately supportive of a second referendum amid bitter isions in the party.Liberal Democrat MP Layla Moran said the sheer scale of the event showed that “confidence is growing” in the fight for a fresh vote.To huge cheers, London mayor Sadiq Khan said the march marked a\u0026nbsp“historic moment in our democracy”.Over 700,000 protesters’ call for second Brexit referendumTheresa May told she’s ‘heading for dead end’ in Brexit talksThe collective spreading cheer to Brexit-weary BritsEx-cabinet secretaries condemn Tory Brexiteers for undermining MayFinal Say: Meet some of the people marching a fresh Brexit vote He told protestors: “We’ve heard some complain that a public vote would be undemocratic and unpatriotic. But the opposite is true.“There’s nothing more democratic – nothing more British – than trusting the people to have the final say on our future.”MPs from across the political spectrum addressed the rally, including Green MP Caroline Lucas, Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable, Labour’s Chuka Umunna and Tory MP Dr Sarah Wollaston, who drew huge cheers when she compared\u0026nbspBrexit to a botched operation.Christian Broughton, editor of The Independent,\u0026nbsptold the crowds: “Theresa May says that the Final Say referendum will be a politicians’ vote, not a people’s vote, but we can all remember what some politicians told us in 2016.“We, the people, can all now see what’s really coming. And from where I’m standing it looks like a people’s vote to me.”He revealed that The Independent’s petition for a Final Say had achieved more than 940,000 signatures, adding: “We have to keep on showing up and signing up.”People did show up in their thousands for the march, which was extremely cheerful, except for a handful of Ukip protestors who screamed\u0026nbsp“Losers”\u0026nbspat passers-by from outside Downing Street.An army of students, college pupils and young activists led the march in a sign of the impact of the Brexit vote on the younger generation, some 1.4 million of whom have become eligible to vote since the referendum.Femi Oluwole, from the youth group Our Future Our Choice, told The Independent: “What we are trying to do is bring people together, as nobody has any confidence in what the government is doing.”He said young people were going to be hit hardest by Brexit, both economically and in the opportunities to live and work abroad.Among the crowds was Piero Passet, a 71-year-old restaurant owner from Turin, said he was marching because he was concerned for the future of the younger generation.Created with Sketch.Brexit march for a final say – in pictures Show all 26Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Final Say campaigners take part in the peoples vote march for the future in London 20102018Final Say campaigners take part in the peoples vote march for the future in London 20102018Final Say campaigners take part in the peoples vote march for the future in LondonDemonstrators pass Trafalgar Square as they take part in a march calling for a People\u0027s Vote on the final Brexit deal, in central London on October 20, 2018. - Britons dreading life outside Europe gathered from all corners of the UK to London on Saturday to try to stop their country\u0027s looming breakup with the EU.Demonstrators wave Union and European flags and hold up placards as they pass Trafalgar Square, taking part in a march calling for a People\u0027s Vote on the final Brexit deal, in central London on October 20, 2018. - Britons dreading life outside Europe gathered from all corners of the UK to London on Saturday to try to stop their country\u0027s looming breakup with the EU.

Animal products will only be allowed to enter the EU\u0026nbspthrough a border inspection post in a no-deal situation, and Calais has no such post.A solution to this problem would be re-routing animal exports to the Belgian ports of Zeebrugge and Antwerp, and Rotterdam in the Netherlands.The lords said such a situation would involve exports leaving from different UK ports, and asked what measures had been put in place to prepare for this major shift.Brexit leaves UK ‘vulnerable to invasive alien species and diseases’They also raised the issue of waste exports, which Defra thinks could take over six months to sort out after Brexit. The industry has pointed out that such an interruption to the supply chain could result in nearly 2\u0026nbspmillion tonnes of waste stranded in the UK.Control over fisheries was another major concern, according to Lord Teverson, especially considering the import status it had in the Brexit debate.“You will be well aware that, in the eyes of many members of the public, one of the perceived benefits of Brexit is the ability to control who can fish in UK waters,” Lord Teverson\u0026nbspwrote.\u0026nbsp“We suspect they would be surprised to hear, therefore, that the UK will follow whatever quota allocation is agreed at the annual EU summit in December 2018.”In practice, this means EU fishing fleets will continue to have access to British waters until the end of 2019.The committee questioned the fisheries control and enforcement policies that Defra would have in place before March, and whether it had assessed the fishing industry’s view of continued EU incursions into UK waters.In August, rocks and smoke bombs were hurled at British fishing vessels in the English Channel by French fishermen in so-called “scallop wars”, and Lord Teverson asked if there was any risk of these conflicts repeating themselves when EU vessels continued fishing in British waters.The committee also said they were “disturbed to hear” from Mr Gove that he was not aware of many of the issues surrounding chemical regulations following Brexit.MPs ‘far more likely to reject Brexit deal’ if unable to amend itA no-deal Brexit would seriously threaten our national security“Has your department received no representations from industry on this issue? Now that you are aware, how do you intend to overcome this challenge?” Lord Teverson asked.Responding to the letter, a Defra spokesperson said: “We remain confident that we will agree a mutually advantageous deal with the EU, however it is the duty of a responsible government to prepare for a range of potential outcomes including ‘no deal’.\u0026nbspDefra is working hard to carry out extensive preparations to make sure environmental, welfare\u0026nbspand biosecurity standards will continue to be met in a way that supports trade and the smooth flow of goods.”In a separate report released on Tuesday, the same Lords committee warned that the UK’s biosecurity could be compromised after Brexit due to the loss of EU systems to prevent diseases and invasive species entering the country.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

This is my firm belief and this is my understanding of democracy.”Mr Bullmann’s intervention is particularly significant because EU figures have so far been reticent to call for a second vote – for fear they might be seen as interfering in Britain\u0027s\u0026nbsppolitics.But the vast show of support on the streets of the capital has apparently encouraged some in Brussels and Strasbourg to break cover and speak out.Created with Sketch.Brexit march for a final say – in pictures Show all 26Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Final Say campaigners take part in the peoples vote march for the future in London 20102018Final Say campaigners take part in the peoples vote march for the future in London 20102018Final Say campaigners take part in the peoples vote march for the future in LondonDemonstrators pass Trafalgar Square as they take part in a march calling for a People\u0027s Vote on the final Brexit deal, in central London on October 20, 2018. - Britons dreading life outside Europe gathered from all corners of the UK to London on Saturday to try to stop their country\u0027s looming breakup with the EU.Demonstrators wave Union and European flags and hold up placards as they pass Trafalgar Square, taking part in a march calling for a People\u0027s Vote on the final Brexit deal, in central London on October 20, 2018. - Britons dreading life outside Europe gathered from all corners of the UK to London on Saturday to try to stop their country\u0027s looming breakup with the EU.

The arrangement could last for years on a \u0026ldquorolling basis.A Downing Street spokesman said: This is nothing more than a partial reflection of advice to ministers, and not of decisions taken - the Prime Minister made her position absolutely clear in the House of Commons on Monday.As the PM said then, we do not believe any extension to the implementation period will be necessary, and in any event we would have to be out of it well before the end of the Parliament.We would not accept a position in which the UK, having negotiated in good faith an agreement which prevents a hard border in Northern Ireland, nonetheless finds itself indefinitely locked into an alternative, inferior arrangement against our will.

Trade through Dover amounted to 17 percent of all UK trade, contributing \u0026pound122 billion to the British economy.Around 10,000 lorries pass through Dover each day and take around two minutes to get processed, but and added two minutes would create a queue over 17 miles long.Home Secretary Sajid Javid suggested French border agents could cause chaos just by asking every driver for their reason for travelling.Brussels could also refuse to give the UK the approval it requires to export animal products including meat and dairy for up to six months.The trade of animal products brings in around \u0026pound3.5billion a year to the UK economy.

So is Hammond’s next door.Whoever takes over — Boris, David Davis or Jeremy Hunt — needs an emergency clear-out.The big guns of the Treasury need to be pointed at the “enemy” not its own side.After two long, wasted years, Britain is engaged in an unexpectedly desperate fight, not just to salvage Brexit but to save British democracy.Weekend crowds demanding a second referendum seem oblivious to the threat such a crazy re-run would pose to this nation’s centuries-old stability, ironically the envy of Europe.We cannot reverse the  referendum without turning Brexit into a perpetual running sore. And Britain can never rejoin the EU except on its knees.The only way to put this corrosive issue to bed is for Brexit to succeed — as it will, despite treacherous Tony Blair and Facebook hypocrite Nick Clegg.To succeed as we must we need a new chancellor as well as a new prime minister.Diehard Remainer Phil Hammond should be first out the door.It was Spreadsheet Phil who vetoed vital preparations for No Deal — now a better-than - prospect with time rapidly running out.And it was Hammond who surrendered the one negotiating weapon Brussels fears most — a thriving, low-tax Britain competing with the EU on its doorstep.Our economic fate is entirely in our hands. We can make taxes and tarfs as competitive as we like.Better investment incentives and lower corporation tax rates would trigger a flood of foreign investment in UK plc — and ensure car makers like Nissan and Toyota never leave our shores.Yet the British Chancellor of the Exchequer has ruled them out.“Phil is like those Harry Potter Dementor creatures,” says a top Tory. “He sucks the le out of any room he happens to be in.”Hammond is easily replaced. Michael Gove, an ex-future PM but a formidable Cabinet minister, has the drive and imagination to take on the Treasury “Blob”.There is no shortage of Brexit talent on the Tory benches.Just compare thundering Attorney General Geoffrey Cox QC with prissy dried-stick predecessor Dominic Grieve.Grieve is busy sabotaging Brexit. Cox finds ways to make it work.He is now “marking Number Ten’s homework” on Mrs May’s wretched Northern Ireland “backstop”.Some even tip him as a dark horse in the leadership stakes.There is one other big change needed at the heart of Britain’s Brexit team.Our next PM must have a new EU negotiator.Nobody could be worse than Olly Robbins, already reportedly eyeing up a £m-a-year golden parachute into a top City job.Lelong Europhile Robbins has led Mrs May into so many disastrous EU traps — especially her humiliation in Salzburg — he is often cast as an EU “double agent”.It was Robbins who told EU negotiator Michel Barnier that Britain might stay indefinitely in “transition” while the fantasy Northern Ireland backstop was sorted out.And pay £bn more on top of the £bn ransom for the privilege.The idea that Robbins is the “EU’s man in Whitehall” is not such a stretch when you consider his Jeremy Corbyn-style applause for Communist Russia.Kremlin leaders, he told fellow Oxford students in , “changed Russia from a backward peasant autocracy, despised by the West, into a technological giant at whom the world cowered in fear for half a century.”Everyone is entitled to youthful naivety.But can anyone imagine Olly Robbins fighting our corner for EU democracy and accountability, let alone the referendum verdict of .m Brexit-voting Brits SAUDI Arabia’s rulers must be really annoyed with dissident Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi.This elderly trouble maker walked alone into his country’s Turkish consulate knowing he might never emerge alive.He was clearly looking for trouble.Once inside, using his bare hands, he attacked a gang of  innocent Saudi torturers who had just flown in for a couple of hours’ holiday armed only with a bone saw and a hypodermic syringe.Then, to the embarrassment of kindly Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, he went and hid his own body.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I didn’t reply at the time but I’m going to give Sun readers the answer now – and it’s very simple.None of this is about me. It’s all about you.That’s why, when I’m confronted with tough choices during the Brexit negotiations, I don’t think about what the implications are for me. Instead, I ask myself what it means for you, for your family and for the whole of the United Kingdom.Am I bringing back control of your money, your borders and your laws Am I protecting your jobs and making sure nothing gets in the way of our brilliant entrepreneurs and small businesses Am I protecting the integrity of the United Kingdom And, above all, am I delivering the Brexit that the people of this country so clearly voted for I need to be able to answer “Yes” to every one of these questions.Andthat means there are some dficult days in Brussels, well that’s just something I have to deal with.Because the Brexit talks are not about me or my personal fortunes. They’re about the national interest – and that means making the right choices, not the easy ones.Inevitably, that will take time. Brexit is the UK’s biggest constitutional change for generations. Unpicking more than  years of treaties, agreements and laws would be a challenge under any circumstances and, as no country has ever left the EU before, it’s not asthere’s an instruction manual for those either side of the negotiating table to follow.I know it can seem like the talks are never-ending, and that many of you have been frustrated by the endless back and forth on technical points – I certainly feel that way sometimes too.But with five months to go until we leave the EU, we have already reached agreement on the vast majority of our exit deal.What became clear at last week’s meeting in Brussels is that the very last stages of the talks are going to be the hardest of all.This includes dealing with the so-called “backstop”: making sure that, no matter what our new relationship with Europe looks like, there will be no hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland.I’ve been very clear that this must be achieved without creating any kind of border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK – doing so would undermine our precious Union and put at risk the hard-won peace.So I am working closely with my counterparts in Europe to explore every possible solution to the border issue.Does that mean I think this negotiation will get tougher before we reach our goal  YesDo I have some long and dficult days ahead  I’m sure I do.But what I’m thinking about is not how hard it all is today.I’m thinking about the prize that lies before us tomorrow about the great opportunities the Government will help open up for you once we clear the last few hurdles.As we enter the final, crucial phase of the talks there will undoubtedly be some unexpected challenges to which we must rise.But the finish line is in sight. And I am more determined than ever that we will get there together, with a Brexit deal that’s right for you, right for your family and right for our country.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Smoking tobacco is bad news.But vaping is dferent.You heat up a solution called an e-liquid, which typically contains nicotine, a propellant called propylene glycol and or vegetable glycerin and flavourings.What you don’t do is burn tobacco or produce tar or carbon monoxide — two of the most harmful elements of all in tobacco smoke.Sure, some vapes may contain a fraction of some of the harmful chemicals found in cigarette smoke, but they are present at much lower levels,detectable at all.So are they safe  According to all the international medically-reviewed evidence from such expert organisations as Public Health England, the Royal Colleges of Physicians and General Practitioners, the British Medical Association and Cancer Research UK, e-cigarettes are at least  per cent safer than traditional cigarettes.The American Cancer Society and the National Academies of Science, Engineering and Medicine both agree with them.Yes, the nicotine, of course, is addictive. But so what  So is caffeine, even eating.Contrary to popular belief, nicotine does not give you cancer and it is relatively harmless generally.Apparently only  per cent of the population know this.Happily, there is no evidence of harm to other people from vaping and,used instead of nicotine replacement gum or patches, may even help expectant mums remain smoke-free in the long term.As a doctor I don’t want any young person or non-nicotine user to try vaping. Ever. Period.As it happens, regular use of e-cigs among “never” smokers is still very rare at just . per cent.But look at what they’ve done to help tobacco smokers quit.In the UK, .million vapers have quit smoking completely and more than , have given up both smoking and vaping.In fact, this is Britain’s most popular method of quitting with two-thirds stopping successfully when used alongside professional stop-smoking NHS support.In this country we have some of the strictest regulations in the world.E-cigs are subject to minimum standards of quality and safety as well as clear packaging and labelling requirements.All ingredients have to be notied, advertising is prohibited in media such as television, newspapers and magazines, it is illegal to sell them to under s and to adults intending to pass them on to under s.That is responsible regulation whichever way you look at it.This month’s national Stoptober campaign recommends using e- cigarettes as a stop-smoking aid andit helps some of the million smokers in the UK kick the habit for good then perhaps doctors like me will see fewer people in our surgeries struggling to breath or devastated by a cancer diagnosis.AndI see any ex-smoking patients of mine having a quiet vape outside my surgery door, I shall give them a heartfelt pat on the back and cherish the fact that there will be one less nasty fag end polluting the street.NICOTINE contained in e-liquids is a highly addictive substance that raises blood pressure and spikes your adrenalin, increasing the chances of having a heart attack.This is particularly worrying as we see a number of iniduals who are constantly vaping, especially as it is seen as more convenient and cost-effective than lighting up a cigarette, as well as being considered more socially acceptable to vape indoors.While vaping appears to be safer than cigarettes, the truth is that it hasn’t been around long enough for us to know the potential damage it can cause to our health.The long-term effects of the chemicals contained in e-liquids haven’t been examined.However, I have looked into ious research that has been carried out on certain e-liquids that were found to contain substances that can cause damage to the immune system and are linked to other health conditions such as cancer.Vaping isn’t great for your oral health either.It’s common for vaping to cause a dry mouth, and I’ve met a number of iniduals who have developed oral thrush, most likely caused by vaping.Although nicotine does not have a colour, it becomes yellow when combined with oxygen which could lead to tooth discolouration.As nicotine is a vasocon-strictor, it limits blood flow in oral tissue, which can cause gum disease and bad breath.As time goes on, I am reading new research which proves vaping has a negative effect on health.To what extent, only time will tell.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Why do they not get paid what they are worth to their company, and why are so many overlooked for promotion The sad fact is that for every £ men earn, women make just  pence.Just over one in ten women negotiated their starting salary, while more than half of all men haggle with their boss before they have even started work.When women do ask for more pay, they are  per cent less likely to get a raise. Andthey do receive a wage increase it will be  per cent less than men get.Sadly, it is common in business that women are often viewed as weak or unable to cope. And once we think about or start a family, we become toxic to employers.I receive hundreds of direct messages on social media from women asking: “How do I get a pay rise  How do I get noticed at work  How can I get promoted  How can I get on after maternity leave ”So now I am launching Get What You Want, a series of online masterclasses and podcasts covering everything from getting promoted to dealing with the word no, overcoming challenges, negotiating pay, writing a fantastic CV and nailing an interview.It will also cover baby-proofing careers, as well as becoming a super-mum after maternity leave.A lot of women have skills but just lack confidence. As women, we don’t shout about our wins enough for fear we will appear arrogant, even though men talk about them all the time.Here are some of my tips to winning at work.When people say: “I hate my job” I always ask: “Why are you telling me  I can’t do anything about it.”YOU have to do something. Sit down and work out what it is you don’t like about the position and set yourself a task of getting a new one.Be very dedicated and very professional and excel when you get to the interview.Many people don’t realise that when you are invited for an interview it is because they believe you can do the job.The secret is convincing them that you can do the job better than anyone .You should be able to talk about your specialist subject, which is yourself.People find it very dficult to list all the things they have done really well in a professional way to show good examples of why they can do the job.Opening a negotiation is all about knowing your worth.And knowing your value is really about your self-worth. They are totally linked.Write down all the things where you have made a big ­contribution, all the things that you have changed and made a dference, how you have added value. Put together testimonials to really back up what you have done.Then work out what more you want to do, because going above and beyond your job description is very important.Take out all the emotion, go in and lay out for your boss the facts of what you’ve contributed to the organisation.Sometimes people can be very passive. They say: “I’ll go along with what everyone  agrees with.”They want to avoid conflict. They don’t really think their opinion is as important as other people’s, so they are simply giving others a licence to ignore them.Learn to say no. Say: “I don’t really have the time butI can make the time I can do it for you.” Otherwise you become like a human sponge. Don’t let them take advantage.Employers take advantage of women’s lack of confidence, especially a mother ing from maternity leave. Many feel so grateful to have a job that they tend to put up with almost anything.Eleven per cent of new mothers report that they have been dismissed or made redundant where others in their workplace were not, or were treated so poorly they felt they had to leave.That means as many as , women are losing their jobs each year.Have a really clear plan of how you will manage at home and manage work.

Ms Knightley, who adds, “Rescue yourself,” clearly feels she is protecting daughter Edie by banning something that doesn’t concur with her own off-the-shelf, Poundland version of what feminism should be.But what she’s in danger of doing is wilfully nurturing a potential “snowflake” who, rather than develop the critical thinking skills that allow healthy debate, will simply stick their fingers in their ears and cry foul when they see or hear something that dfers from their own world view.Keira, tonight’s homework is to really readCinderella and analyse it.Look past the Disney-esque cute rodents, pretty frocks and glass slippers and instead dig a little deeper to ­appreciate the original’s narrative of how hope can turn unjust oppression into ­triumphant reward.Cinderella is a young woman who has not only suffered the loss of her loving father, but now faces a letime of abuse from an uncaring stepmother and her equally unpleasant daughters.But instead of sitting in the ashes ­waiting unquestioningly for whatever fate might have in store for her, she remains resolutely ­optimistic and decides to secretly defy her nemesis by gatecrashing a hot-ticket party to which she hasn’t been invited.Now that’s girl power.Ultimately, she “‘rescues” herself by proactively going to the ball where, instead of abuse, she experiences the redemptive qualities of love and kindness.They just happen to come in the form of a handsome prince.In the same week, Kristen Bell — who coincidentally voices Anna in the Disney film Frozen — found herself caught up in the slipstream of Keira’s PC virtue signalling after reportedly saying that Snow White gives young girls the wrong ­message about consent “because you cannot kiss someonethey’re sleeping”.Except Kristen’s comment was taken out of context and she’s got the balance right.Because what she actually said was that she reads the story with her two ­daughters, aged five and three, then asks them: “Don’t you think it’s weird that Snow White didn’t ask the old witch why she needed to eat the apple ” before starting up a conversation about the dos and don’ts of taking food from strangers.Or, “Don’t you think that it’s weird that the prince kisses Snow White without her permission ” to float an almost subliminal, age-appropriate understanding of what does and doesn’t constitute ­consent.Kristen isn’t banning tales of old, she’s using them to stimulate discussions.In other words, teaching her children the vital le skills of critical thinking — dictionary definition: “the objective analysis and evaluation of an issue in order to form a judgment” — and being able to rationally debate that judgment with someone whose view might dfer from your own.Attempting to sanitise a child’s world by airbrushing history will hinder, not help them.Instead, wield history’s lessons as a tool to educate.Cinderella was of its time and now the Disney pendulum has seemingly swung the other way to depict a world where all the central characters are feisty, opinionated young women who power-kick their way through le.But how will Keira’s daughter know how far the depiction of Disney ­princesses has comeshe’s not allowed to see where they’ve been ONE morning last week, I spent a glorious couple of hours walking around Westminster Abbey.Buried or commemorated there are, among others, more than , great Britonsincluding Sir Isaac Newton, Jane Austen, Noel Coward, Charles Darwin, the Bronte sisters, Clement Attlee, Charles Dickens, David Livingstone, Stephen Hawking and, of course, the grave of the unknown warrior, buried on November ,  “in honour of the many multitudes who during the Great War of - gave the most that man can give . . . le itself.”My mother works at the Abbey as a “blue-gowner” – the volunteer guides there to answer any questions not covered by the electronic headsets – and, while showing us the ft by ft grave of poet Ben Jonson, who is the only person there to be buried upright, she was approached by a couple of earnest-looking women in their early twenties.Amid such a rich seam of history, rigorous intellect and achievement, what did they ask “Excuse me, where did David Beckham sit for the royal wedding ”THE number of stay-at-home dads has dropped to the lowest level in five years.Experts reckon it could be due to men “growing tired” of the tough job of raising kids.Proof,needed, might be the glassy-eyed expression of Bond actor Daniel Craig,  just six weeks after we Rachel Weisz gave birth to their daughter.He never looks this knackered when he’s jumping off buildings and dodging bullets.Stay-at-home parenthood can be isolating, sometimes dull, frequently thankless and relentlessly bloody exhausting. Only the strong survive it.THANKS to Ryanair’s ­astonishing failure to act when a passenger racially abused Windrush immigrant Delsie Gayle on one of its flights, the man will likely escape prosecution because of jurisdictional issues once a plane takes off from one country’s airspace to another.Instead, he is likely only to be banned from ever travelling on Ryanair again.Which, as plenty of the budget airline’s past ­customers might tell you, could equally be regarded as a blessing rather than a punishment.COMEDIAN Seann Walsh and his Strictly partner Katya Jones have survived the dreaded dance-off to, presumably, jive another day.Because, let’s face it, since that snog, the Strictly bosses are ­rapidly running out of drearily chaste dances to give them.Last weekend it was the unsexy Charleston, ­performed in equally unsexy “Where’s Wally” outfits that virtually screamed “nothing to see here”. Then this weekend it was a faintly ­ludicrous, undeniably platonic quickstep that saw them trotting around the floor like a couple of hyperactive show ponies.Assuming the sizzling Argentine tango is, er, strictly no-go, whatever next  A jive in burkas  A Viennese waltz in sackcloths Not least from Tom himself, perhaps, whose first we Mimi Rogers bemoaned the lack of intimacy in their union because, she claims, he wanted to be a monk and “thought he had to be celibate to maintain the purity of his instrument, but my instrument needed tuning, and we had to split.” Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

A woman came out and we hid around the house. When she came back in we soaped all her windows. We all had a good time.”But the tide did turn for some kids, as The Bourbon News in Kentucky reported a Harrodsburg man “who anticipated the removal of his gates put molasses on them, and several nice young men had their clothes ruined.”An investigation was launched in  when an Evangelical church was “desecrated on Halloween” when “miscreants placed a beer keg on the altar”.A more terrying prank, though, involved a “shapely tailor’s dummy, taken by jokesters from a dressmaking establishment” and used to imitate a corpse in Oklahoma.The Morning Tulsa Daily World reported in  that the mannequin was so lelike that “police, an ambulance and a wrecking crew were hurriedly summoned when a terried car crew found the ‘body’ of a woman jammed beneath the trucks of their car on reaching the barns.“Police and the wrecking crew raised the car and hauled out the ‘body’. It was a shapely tailor’s dummy.”It wasn’t until the s and s that trick-or-treating became more commonplace.American author Lesley Bannatyne, who has written five books on Halloween, said the“destructive element of Halloween was distasteful to Victorians”.Halloween celebrations during the early s saw a leap from the late s when, “children’s magazines printed pretty pictures of fairies and witches and ladies’ periodicals became concerned with how a Halloween party was given”, Bannatyne explains.While kids were allowed to run wild and be a menace on the streets, it was a dferent situation for hostesses, who by the turn of the century were leaving jack-o’-lanterns on doorsteps.“As Victorian ladies were expected to be handy with crafts, most Halloween party invitations were handmade in the shape of Halloween symbols and featured a rhyming verse,” Bannatyne added.Also, at this time Halloween parties were “often used for matchmaking” with plenty of opportunity for romance to blossom.The author said: “Halloween celebrations in the Victorian age seem to be made of one part romantic inspiration, one part reconstructed history, and one part Victorian marketing.“Halloween stories became almost operatic with regard to passion, and less concerned with actual ghosts.”When it came to throwing parties, Bannatyne said: “A highly dramatic entrance was a must.The party-giver’s house was completely dark, lit only with jack-o’-lanterns, fireplaces or long snakes made of tin and fastened above a light, whose heat made the serpent writhe.“Dark-robed figures led guests to the cellar, the kitchen or some other darkened room… some hostesses greeted their guests with an old elbow glove filled with sawdust.”Others, though, used decorations such as tall hanging ghosts or monstrous cobwebs made of yarn.Some hostesses served Scottish scones and party guests were also offered the likes of half-pumpkins filled with apples, grapes and pears, or chicken salad in hollowed-out turnips.A dangerous party game in Victorian parlours involved people jumping over a candle flame, “with full dress trains and tight, hitched-up pants”.They would hold storytelling contests around the fire, where guests would each take a “twig and set it burning, at the same time telling an impromptu ghost story.“Popular theme parties appeared in the early s, centred on black cats or a haunted house, for example turning cellars into caverns.Halloween disguises were “still a novelty at adult parties as late as  they gained popularity during the first decades of the th century,” she added.In the early s as new traditions emerged, such as town-wide Halloween parades, the American press labelled the occasion as the “Halloween problem”.Papers reported kids setting off fire alarms, throwing bricks through shop windows and painting obscenities: They begged for money or sweets and threatened vandalismthey didn’t receive them.Unamused adults fought back, however, as early th century newspapers published stories on homeowners firing “buckshot at pranksters who were only  or  years old” in America.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Everybody was saying we need unity.”The PM spelled out to the room why she was pursuing a softer Brexit vision, warning that the referendum decision to leave the EU could have “consequences”.One MP told The Sun: “She said that we will be able to look voters in the eye and say we have honoured our commitment to uphold the referendum.“But she also said it’s the job of government to make sure that whatever Brexit we end up with, we will protect the economy from the cosequences.”Home Secretary Sajid Javid told The Sun that it was a “solid performance” that “will put to bed once and for all that she is the person to lead us”.But other Tory MPs branded the meeting “totally stage managed” with Whips planted to bang on the doors to make the applause from inside seem louder.One Leave-backing MP told The Sun that Mrs May’s pitch “wasn’t great”, adding: “She hasn’t won me over”.Some of the PM’s biggest critics, including former Tory leader IDS, stayed away altogether.Another senior Brexiteer backbencher said: “It was your standard  meeting, tightly controlled and designed for one thing - to give the leader a good show”.Most of the questions aimed at the PM were supportive, with MPs urging loyalty.But Brexit backer Andrew Bridgen tackled Mrs May directly on her handling of the negotiations on what concessions she had won from Brussels.As the PM began to reel off what she saw as wins on Citizens Rights, the ECJ and the transition period, MPs broke into applause in a bid to shore her up against her fiercest critics.Brexiteer Nadine Dorries also repeated her call for a change of leader after leaving the room.More Cabinet isions emerged yesterday when it emerged that Energy minister Claire Perry had made a thinly veiled dig at Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt for taking a position on Brexit just to further his leadership hopes.Ms Perry’s attack came during a meeting of the PM’s top table in No on Tuesday.Last night Theresa May was urged to back a FIVE-DAY debate on her final Brexit deal – where MPs would have the ability to consider alternatives before voting on the PM’s agreement.Former Tory Attorney General Dominic Grieve said this would allow MPs to see the scale of Commons support for other options such as a Norway-style deal before the crunch vote.Trying to avoid debate on alternatives would “be both wrong, and,I may add, I think it would be a very big mistake”.Today Environment Secretary Michael Gove will introduce the Fisheries Bill in Parliament – promising Britain is on the way to “taking back control of our waters”.The legislation will end the automatic right of EU vessels to fish in UK waters and proposing powers to ensure the UK can set its own fishing quotas.An Ipsos MORI poll yesterday revealed growing pessimism amongst the British public on Mrs May’s chances of getting a good deal.We are wary of it lasting a day beyond .

The Prime Minister appeared to steady her position after she delivered a heartfelt appeal for Conservative MPs to stand firm as EU withdrawal negotiations enter their frantic final phase.The move came as the Government prepared to unveil parliamentary preparations for a no-deal Brexit in less than three weeks time, according to The Times.A raft of legislation intended to deal with the consequences of the UK exiting the EU without an agreement will be launched in the second week of November, the newspaper reported.  Despite Mrs May seeming to dampen speculation of an imminent bid to oust her with a well-received address to a meeting of the  Committee of backbenchers, former Cabinet minister Nicky Morgan predicted the PM only had months left in power. AskedMrs May had her backing, Ms Morgan told ITVs Peston: She has, absolutely, for now.

The PMs address came after a torrid week in which an anonymous MP was quoted as saying Mrs May should bring her own noose to the meeting.  Ms Rudd praised the PM, saying: She got a warm welcome, she talked quite emotionally about why she was doing this for the good of the country and how it was important that the public and our party members realise that we are behind her and that we all wanted the same thing - which is to lead in the best interests of the country.

Amid claims that the number of letters to the chairman of the  Committee from MPs calling for a vote of no confidence in the PM was close to the  level needed to trigger a ballot, Ms Rudd insisted Mrs Mays position was now safe. Ms Rudd said: She was able to win the room and deliver something quite personal and emotional about why she was committed to doing it, despite being quite frank about the dficulties that were still there.

Intelligence chiefs launched a huge surveillance operation to track the hit squad sent by Riyadh. The Saudi consulate in Istanbul was bugged, and spies listened in as Mr Khashoggi was killed and dismembered, it is claimed. But sources say Turkey had believed the Saudi operatives were planning to kidnap Mr Khashoggi, not execute him at the consulate. Intelligence services learned the journalist was allegedly targeted under the orders of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, in revenge for opposing his reign.  The “Saudi ” hit squad included a key member of his entourage. A senior security source said: “Turkey launched a large-scale surveillance operation. Many in the intelligence community believe the consul was bugged, and this Saudi team was followed. “The uncomfortable truth may emerge one day that the hit team was listened to live as they killed Khashoggi, but [Turkey] was powerless to do anything about it.” Sources said authorities would have had little time to respond.  The Mirror revealed recently that Western intelligence agencies knew of Saudi plans to kidnap dissidents, echoing jihadi renditions by the US, Israel and Russia. The source said: “Turkey was expecting a rendition attempt, which they could interdict, rescuing Khashoggi. Instead, they witnessed a murder and [used] it as leverage against the Saudis.” Turkey claims it has taped proof of the murder. Thanks to its major intelligence operation, it is thought it has further information on Mr Khashoggi’s killing, which it is not admitting to.  Mr Khashoggi was murdered in the consulate on October . Afterwards, one of his suspected killers left the building in his clothes to make it appear he was still alive. The search for Mr Khashoggi’s remains continued today in the consulate garden, close to where some of his body is believed to have already been found.  Today, bin Salman described the killing as a “heinous crime that cannot be justied”. Speaking at an international conference in Riyadh, he said: “The incident is very painful. Justice in the end will appear.” "},{"url":null,"title":"single mums reveal true horror","story":"NewsSingle mums reveal true horror of Universal Credit in damning testimony to ParliamentWomen told how the benefit left them with £, bills, fines and a £-a-day survival rate.

The four women gave evidence to the Work and Pensions Committee as UC - already rolled out to .million people, and due to hit million by December  - pushes the poor to rent arrears and food banks. Theresa May is facing huge pressure to pump more money into the benefit, which has been bundled up with billions in welfare cuts since it launched in . So far campaigners have focused on this and other problems with the benefit, like the five-week wait for payment. But today the single mums talked about a dferent side to the story - how Universal Credit affects childcare. Working parents on UC can claim back % of their nursery fees. Yet they have to pay up-front first, and claim the money back later. The mum fined and saddled with a pound, bill  The policy saddled mum-of-two Vikki Waterman with a pound, bill which she had to wait five weeks to be paid back. The -year-old was also fined pound by her nursery because a late benefit payment meant she was two days behind paying for childcare. She told MPs: We dont want to sit at home when we didnt plan to be single parents. We shouldnt be penalised for that. That is not what we are here for. We want to be able to go to work and to provide for our own families, and at the minute it seems asthere is a roadblock everywhere we turn.  Hairdresser and mum-of-three Gaynor Rowles, from Heywood, Greater Manchester, was forced to pay up-front costs for her three-year-old twins. It’s pound per week. Where do I find that money from ” she said. Describing how she was just pound. a week better off in work, I’ve changed as a person. I’m not my normal happy self. Its quite sad really. Theres more people out there who are worse off than me. Ive got good family, good friends and good support. The Mirror are demanding a halt to the expansion of Universal Credit and for a review to take place. We say there are three options:Redesign UC to be fit for purpose Axe it in favour of the old systemUC is unfixable Introduce a brand new systemSign our petition to stop the rollout of Universal Credit across Britain and to replace it with a fairer system by signing our petition. Thuto Mali revealed her little boy was even suspended from nursery. “I was paying, I think, half or three quarters of it and his dad was supposed to pay the other - it didn’t quite happen, she said. So I got whacked with an pound bill. She said she was forced to turn down a job with a pound, salary because after paying pound, a month for a full-time nursery spot for her son she would be left with pound a month to cover bills. Thats effectively pound a day, she said. Work didnt pay for us.  Nail technician Lucy Collins, from Manchester, told MPs she left her job in the police because she couldnt fit shts around her kids, aged  and . Only then did she discover the problems of being on Universal Credit. You just get passed from pillar to post, she said. It’s so complex.  Astonishingly, MPs heard the system is more lenient on well-off parents than it is on people claiming benefits. People on Universal Credit must submit receipts and invoices on an online journal to ensure they get the money back. Dalia Ben-Galim, policy director at the charity Gingerbread, told MPs: Theres a very dferent burden of proof on more middle-class parents. You don’t need to submit receipts - you need to have a registered childcare provider.  The moneys in your account and you, as a parent, are able to transfer that directly. I think that is ideological - it’s an active decision that has been made. Shocked Tory MP Heidi Allen branded the double standard terrible. Committee chairman Frank Field added the whole system is middle-class management of money. It doesn’t take into accountyou have a daily wage or a weekly wage. What the DWP says  A Department for Work and Pensions spokeswoman said: We are doing more than ever before to support parents with the cost of childcare and by - we will be spending around a record pound billion on childcare support. Under Universal Credit, working parents can claim back up to % of eligible childcare costs, compared to % of costs covered under the previous legacy system. This is the highest level of support ever. Andsomeone has accepted an offer of paid work, they are eligible to be paid these costs for the month prior to starting work. This generous provision has been widely welcomed by stakeholders and is available in addition to an entitlement of up to  hours of free childcare.

As the Mirror revealed today, Sainsbury’s will stock three dferent vibrators, priced pound to pound, from next week. Its Food Commercial Director Paul Mills-Hicks said: “We hope to give customers the option to buy quickly and conveniently in an environment they feel comfortable with.” But is it just a case of big buzziness chasing dirty money with this buy one, get fun free, idea. Here, two of our writers give their verdicts on whether selling sex toys in the supermarket is a master stroke – or a great, big turn-off.  Yes, Yes, Yes! Rachael Bletchly Daily Mirror Chief Feature WriterHave you written your list for the big weekend shop yet  Loo roll, cat food, washing-up liquid, bread ... “And what do you fancy for Sunday lunch, love ” Meat, two veg and something saucy for afters, I expect. So how about ditching the sticky toffee pudding in favour of a pound vibrator or a cut-price clitoral stimulator  Fewer calories, far more fun . Sainsbury’s shoppers will soon be able to slip a sex toy in their trolleys as they whizz down the aisle for the Colgate and bubble bath. The supermarket giant did a lestyle survey which showed one in three customers were dissatisfied with their sex lives.  And the firm, which once urged us to “try something new today”, decided to help folk love well for less, by selling three, own-brand vibrators priced pound to pound. Good for them. Supermarkets have been selling condoms, lubricants and vibration ringsfor ages. So why are some people still getting hot under the collar about dildos on display  Haven’t we already smashed the stigma that sex toys are shameful, secret, dodgy devices for swingers or nymphomaniacs  They are a normal part of millions of couples’ – and iniduals’ – sex lives. They bring pleasure, fun and confidence to the bedroom for both sexes, bridging the orgasm gap between men and women. When I was an Agony Aunt I’d get letters from women who had been married for  years and never had an orgasm. Others had no idea what their genitals should look or feel like and felt ashamed to touch themselves “down there.” Men are urged to examine their testicles for signs of cancer and women to check their breasts for lumps. But what about getting to know their vaginas too  Sex toys can help with that. The more mainstream toys become, the less embarrassed people will be about discussing sex. Sainsbury’s know this will be a huge hit because the sex toy market is buzzing faster every day. The global market is worth around poundbillion a year and tipped to reach poundbillion by . It made Jacqueline Gold, the woman behind Ann Summers, twice as rich as the Queen, and online retailers like Lovehoney are booming. Last year the firm sold a sex toy every  seconds. And their sex toys are now almost as common in UK homes as pet cats. Perhaps Tesco will bring out a range of in miniature vibrators – as every little helps. No thanks Julie McCaffrey Feature WriterOf all the unexpected items found in my bagging area, a sex toy will not be one of them. News that Sainsbury’s will soon start selling them has left me shaking with fury. Call me an old prude, but I see no place for sex at the supermarket and would rather the shelves remain unsullied by unmentionables. Surely such intimate items should not be nestled between baked beans and teabags  Just the thought of bumping into my neighbours browsing bondage gadgets is enough to give me a headache. And I could never look my friends in the eyeI saw them umming and ah-ing over which Rampant Rabbit they fancy. Sainsbury’s is definitely taking a risque risk here. Is it fair to expect their staff to take customers up their aisle so they can search for stimulation  Heaven forbid they offer a try before you buy scheme, in-store demos or refunds on toys that didn’t quite hit the spot. Then there’s the blush factor. I feel embarrassed enough buying verruca creamat the till. So I can’t bear the thought of standing behind someone and seeing their sex toy roll on to the conveyor belt alongside their baking potatoes. Inevitably it will fail to scan, lead to a Tannoy announcement for a price check and red faces all round. There will be poor old ladies with failing eyesight inadvertently buying a vibrator when they only popped out for a cucumber. And kids innocently asking awkward questions way beyond their years. I’m well aware of the recent surge in sex toy sales and urge to make them mainstream, but it’s left me cold. Because, although I have a filthy sense of humour, I still hurry past Ann Summers stores in the same way I hold my breath walking by a butcher’s shop – they make me feel a wee bit squeamish and uncomfortable. Don’t bother inviting me to your sex toy party night. I can guarantee that nothing on sale will push my buttons. I’d much rather see sex toys sold more discreetly – or not see them at all. I don’t caremy old-fashioned ways make me the butt of jokes. Because, for me, I feel good vibes from someone who can make me laugh a lot, charm me with their intelligence, good looks, conversation and style. A piece of plastic does not have the same appeal. Talent and brains make me feel a frisson, not toys with batteries. So Sainsbury’s, please just put it away. ,],totalVotes:,votesToShow:,mentometerId:,publicationId:,callbackUrl:https:www.mirror poll-ws poll  status,voteActionUrl:https:www.mirror poll-ws poll  vote,closed:,closedMessage:This poll has been closed!,hideResults:,features:,video.header.bidding.enabled:true,bundledCss:,recommendations:https:mab.data.tm-awx rhs,modularCss:true,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,nativeAppBanner:true\""},{"url":null,"title":"ambulance worker told just months","story":"NewsAmbulance worker told she had just months to live two days after her dream weddingAmbulance worker Julie Allen, nee Jones, married her partner Ian Allen but their happiness and plans for decade together was quickly shatteredShareCommentsByHannah Maltwood:,  OCT NewsJulie Allen, nee Jones, with her husband Ian Allen on their wedding day \"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email A bride was diagnosed with inoperable cancer - just two days after her dream wedding.Ambulance worker Julie Allen, nee Jones, married her partner Ian Allen but her happiness was quickly shattered. She had only been married  hours when she was was told she had pancreatic cancer - and had just months left to live. The only symptom she had experienced before the diagnosis was stomach pains and she was offered an ultrasound examination to be safe. Julie, who works as an Emergency Care Assistant, met Ian in the ambulance service and has helped hundreds of patients over the years. Many of them have already contributed to a fundraising page set up to help her.  She has been undergoing chemotherapy but due to the position of the tumor an operation has been deemed too risky. Julie, of Hayle, Cornwall, said she almost cancelled the ultra-sound operation as she felt completely fine. She added: After the ultrasound I got a call to say they had found a shadow. I wasnt worried. I didnt think it would be anything because I felt so good. Then, two days after my wedding, I got the diagnosis - it was pancreatic cancer. The first thing that went through my mind was that I would never get to celebrate my first wedding anniversary with Ian. It was hard. I thought I wouldnt be around for Christmases or my grandchildrens birthdays. So I actually went out and bought four years worth of cards for them all, in case I wasnt around. Every  minutes someone in the UK is diagnosed with a blood cancer, according to the non-profit advocacy group DKMS. This may be leukaemia, lymphoma or myeloma. Blood cancer is the third most common cause of cancer death in the UK. However, only one in three people with it - and in need of a transplant - will find a matching blood stem cell donor within their own family. Two in three need to look outside of this.Around  per cent of all donations are made through a method called peripheral blood stem cell . This is where blood is taken from one of the donor’s arms and a machine extracts the blood stem cells from it.The donor’s blood is then ed to them through their other arm. The outpatient procedure is typically completed in four to six hours. In  per cent of cases, donations are made through bone marrow collection. This is done while under general anaesthetic. To register as a potential donor, visit dkms.org.uk.Once youve received your home swab kit, it takes a few moments to swab. When you thenthe kit, you go on standby to help save a le. Now she is hoping that, by sharing her story so that others can be more aware, it could help more people catch the illness early and recognise symptoms. She added: They havent given me a set prognosis but the le expectancy for people with inoperable pancreatic cancer isnt long at all its about nine months.  Treliske said that due to where the tumour is, it is inoperable. So I started emailing every expert and professor I could find as I dont feel like I should be written off. I have been up to the Royal Free Hospital in London and spoken to a professor up there who has agreed to operate providing the tumour shrinks. I have contacted every clinical trial going. With Julie having to take time off work, covering the costs of travel to London, fees for any trials she gets accepted for and having also been given notice to leave her home, financial strains have taken their toll. Now, through an online fundraising page set up by one of Julies co-workers, Nicola Rashleigh, more than pound, has been raised to help Julie and her family. Donations have been made by friends, family, colleagues and people she has helped through her role as an emergency care assistant. Gran Julie said: When it snowed I was working with a paramedic and we were called out to an elderly woman, but the ambulance was a nightmare in the snow. We had to abandon it and go on foot. Her daughter donated. She wrote a message about how Id helped her mum. I was so touched. Its things like that that really humble you.

But what Meghan might be finding a bit odd is that all eyes are now on her stomach, which the mum-to-be has been sweetly cradling while at events. And people were surprised when her bump seemed to miraculously grow over the course of a day when the Duke and Duchess touched down in Fiji. Meghan, who is around four months pregnant, was seen wearing an elegant white dress to land on the island, and her bump wasnt that visible.  But when she changed into a stunning blue cape gown for a state dinner that evening, social media users went wild with confusion.  Emily Andrews, the Suns royal correspondent who is following the couple on the tour, said on the night of the state dinner: I also note that Meghan’s baby bump is getting bigger by the day! I swear it was not this big last week! I think it’s the clinging nature of the dress but she’s sure looking swell! Although the fact the dress is clinging to her - and the fact she is holding her bump - might make it appear larger, one doula thinks it might be down to a biological factor. Susanna Birch told Trimester Talk: At night time, your abdominal muscles are tired from holding your bump [and they] loosen as they grow more tired, which allows your bump to sit out further and appear larger.An obstetrician also told Mamamia that it could be down to bloating from having eaten over the course of the day.But another possible cause of womens bumps being bigger at night is the hormone progesterone, which is released from the placenta.  Dr Joseph Sgroi said: One of the things progesterone does, which is the primary hormone thats secreted from the placenta, is it actually slows down gut motility, so it slows down the transit time from when you eat something to when it comes out the other end. The hormone is thought to be an evolutionary advantage for pregnant women in days when there was not as much food available - so food digestion is slowed and they absorb all possible nutrients to pass on to their unborn baby. Dr Sgroi also believes Meghans bump is likely to look even bigger by the end of the tour - which is less than a week away - given it is thought she is around four months pregnant.  After about  weeks onwards, this uterus which is predominantly in the pelvis now starts to move to the tummy or the abdomen, and thats when you start to show more and more, he told Mamamia. He added that Meghan is at a time in pregnancy where a womans uterus is expanding at great knots and the changes may not be subtle. Meghan and Harrys baby is due in Spring .

The back-up of a safe exit route seemed not to be in place.  Given that the Duchess is pregnant, and temperatures high in the s in the market, without this walkway the visit should, in my opinion, not have been allowed.

The Duchess of Sussex, , had visited the indoor site in capital Suva as part of their royal tour while the Duke, , was  miles away in a rainforest. Meghan was seen to whisper in one aide’s ear seconds before she entered the “hot and humid” environment, where people were packed in waiting to see her. Witnesses said she looked “flustered” and “afraid” inside and was whisked away just eight minutes into her scheduled -minute visit. People had waited four hours to see her and many clambered on tables and chairs. Kensington Palace aides told the Mirror she was pulled out due to “crowd control issues”.  Bodyguard Ken Wharfe, who worked for Harry’s mother Princess Diana, said he believed the security situation was “chaotic”. After examining video clips of the incident, he claimed “the very basic elements of personal protection were found to be wanting”. A royal source said Harry, , will have been “deeply concerned” and the Mirror understands Meghan’s close protection officer and Kensington Palace staff met after the scare. A source said: “The event was cut short due to the large number of people within the market, which made the event uncomfortably busy. There were much bigger crowds than people had been anticipating.”  Vendor Asenaca Salusalu, , who saw Meghan, said: “She didn’t really speak at all, like she was a bit afraid. But I’m happy to have met her.” On-the-scene Mirror photographer Ian Vogler said: “It was crowded, really cramped. The alleyways were narrow and I could understand why Meghan’s protection officers would judge it an unsafe environment, especially with her being pregnant. It was also very hot and humid and there were a lot of people in very close shyquarters to the Duchess. Unfortunately, it was just not a safe environment.” Royal family latest: Never miss a moment with updates straight to your inboxMeghan had been due to speak to female vendors about women’s empowerment and many were part of the UN project Markets for Change. Harry was in the Colo-i-Suva rainforest planting an endangered native tree for the Queen’s Canopy Project during the scare. Meghan did not go due to the risk to their baby from the Zika virus. shyKensington Palace would not comment.  The Duchess has missed several events on the -day tour Down Under. She skipped the Invictus road cycling contest in Sydney on Sunday and a rainforest trek on Fraser Island on Monday. Palace aides previously said “she’s not sick, just resting after feeling tired”. The Duke and Duchess today visit Nadi, western Fiji, to unveil a statue of Sgt Talaiasi Labalaba – a British-Fijian soldier killed in the Battle of Mirbat in  – before flying on to Tonga. Her team has to review the very basics By Ken Wharfe Former protection officer to Diana The success of any royal tour depends upon planning and the visit to Fiji has called into question some chaotic security arrangements. TV coverage highlights an enthusiastic crowd scurrying for a closer view of the Duchess, who is seen “penned in” by officials and security, and a disengaged facial expression saying at best “Where are we going ” or at worst “Get me out of here!”  The lack of a defined roped or barrier walkway was clearly the root cause of the problem. The back-up of a safe exit route seemed not to be in place. Given that the Duchess is pregnant, and temperatures high in the s in the market, without this walkway the visit should, in my opinion, not have been allowed. As with all royal visits, the inevitable debrief will follow. Royalty protection will need to address basic elements of personal protection, found to be wanting in Suva.

However, Meghan went for a more low-key look and did not wear any jewels on her head at the event. She looked stunning in a floor- blue gown and topped off her look with a dazzling pair of earrings.  Meanwhile, Kate Middleton wore a tiara last night at the Dutch state banquet. It was a beautul diamond-encrusted tiara Kate has worn several times before, the Cambridge Lovers Knot tiara, which once belonged to Princess Diana. So, why did the Queen and Kate wear tiaras at state dinners but Meghan didnt  It turns out that royal protocol regarding tiaras actually has nothing to do with the Duchesses royal ranks - so its not because Kate is closer to the crown.  The choice of whether or not to wear a tiara is determined by the dress code of the event, as well as personal preference. In this case, the event was evidently black tie - so a tiara is not necessary. Another important factor is that state dinners are less formal than state banquets, which could have been one of Meghans reasons for going tiara-free. She may also have been advised not to travel with the expensive jewellery.A royal source told Hello magazine that there was no expectation for the Duchess to wear a tiara at the event, but said she was suitably attired for a state occasion."},{"url":null,"title":"socialite accuses businessman centre metoo","story":"NewsSocialite accuses businessman at centre of #MeToo gagging order row of sexual assaultThe anonymous businessman won a high court injunction preventing the Dailyfrom reporting allegations of sexual assault against himShareByNatalie EvansUS Editor Brian FarmerSam Blewett:,  OCT Updated:,  OCT NewsThe woman accuses the businessman at the centre of the gagging order row of sexual assault \"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA woman claims she was sexually assaulted by an anonymous businessman who won a high court injunction preventing a national newspaper from reporting #MeToo allegations against him.

Writing anonymously in Thursdays Daily , she said: He loved that I was scared. It comes after thelost the latest round of a free speech fight with the company boss accused of discreditable conduct. Three Court of Appeal judges barred the newspaper from publishing confidential information after analysing rival arguments at a hearing in London. The paper wants to reveal what it calls alleged sexual harassment and racial abuse of staff, who have been prevented from discussing their claims by non-disclosure agreements .  The woman is reportedly not among staff who are said to have signed NDAs.

Jess Phillips, Labour MP for Birmingham Yardley, urged victims to contact her, adding that she was done with these rich men using our laws to hide you away. Speaking totoday, she said: I dont know his name so I cannot name him. But she added: I plan to find out as much as I can about the case, hope that victims would seek me outI can offer some sort of cover, and make sure that, whatever I do, I dont damage them.  Under Parliamentary privilege, Phillips would have legal immunity against civil or criminal liability for actions done or statements made in the course of their legislative duties - for example, naming the businessman in the House of Commons. The unnamed businessman, a senior executive in a company group, plus managers at two companies in the group, took legal action in a bid to stop thepublishing a story. A High Court judge had, in August, refused to gag the newspaper. But the executive and managers at the two companies mounted a challenge and three appeal judges have overturned Mr Justice Haddon-Caves decision. Sir Terence Etherton, Lord Justice Underhill and Lord Justice Henderson have outlined their decision in a ruling. They said five employees of companies in the group had made allegations of discreditable conduct by the executive. In all five cases complaints had been compromised by settlement agreements under which substantial payments were made to the employees who had complained. Both sides had undertaken to keep confidential the subject matter of complaints. The three judges had overseen a Court of Appeal hearing in September and published a ruling on Tuesday. The three appeal judges have not named anyone involved, apart from the newspaper. They named the claimant executive and companies as ABC  others.

Indigo not only continue to raise the prices of parking, they also limit the payment method to coins only.“No card payments notes which can cause staff to be late on sht trying to get change from shops or being stuck in the car park due to no shops being open after a late sht .”Vicky Cameron added: “Fees are high enough.

win at Tannadice to make it five wins from five games played after a % record in their Betfred Cup group.That was with an impressive  goals scored and included a deserved - win at Premiership Dundee.Now, though, Johnston faces a new man in the other dugout with intense scrutiny from fans now on him rather than his opposite number.After their perfect start to the campaign, it took Dunfermline another five matches to register a second victory in the Championship and have only racked up eight points from eight matches since.In the process they only managed six goals, conceding  and being dumped out of both the League Cup and Irn-Bru Cup on penalty shoot-outs.Going into Saturday’s game at East End Park, the Pars sit adrt of the play-off places, four points behind United in fourth place.Another poor result, after their - home defeat to Queen of the South at the weekend, will leave them well behind in the race for the top four, heaping all the pressure on Johnston and his side.And the contrast with Neilson, his United players and the atmosphere among the support is stark.After kicking off his reign with a - victory at Partick Thistle, the new gaffer led the Tangerines out for the first time at Tannadice at the weekend.Despite not managing to make it two wins from two, drawing - with Inverness CT, the players were boosted by the biggest home crowd of the campaign.The belief that Neilson can repeat the feat of promotion to the Premiership he achieved at Hearts is clear among the United support.Optimism throughout the stands has been almost completely absent over the past couple of seasons but the hope is now with former chairman Stephen Thompson having departed, and Neilson taking the reigns, good times might be on the horizon.And the ideal time to fuel that fire is now with games against sides below them in the table coming up – Dunfermline this weekend and then Queens the week after.With both the sides coming up in indferent form, points are a must to keep the good feeling flowing.Because what Dunfermline did show the last time the teams met, despite what’s happened since, is they can actually beat their bogey side United.What Neilson can’t afford now is to let the early momentum slip away, something that happened with both Ray McKinnon and, more obviously, Csaba Laszlo.Preventing that could well show the fans’ early optimism is justied come the season end."},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/09/SMac_Beast_East_Comparison_Perth18030801.jpg.jpg ","title":"green spaces and river tay cited as perth becomes only city to oppose car ban","story":"Perth is the only city in Scotland where most residents oppose car bans, a new poll reveals.There is widespread support for vehicle-free measures in city centres across the country, according to a Panelbase survey.But more than half oppose the embargoes in Perth, which is home to one of the most polluted streets in the country.Andrew Llanwarne, from Friends of the Earth Tayside, said low support for car bans in Perth could be linked with a lack of awareness of the impact of pollution.“Maybe in Perth, many people are lulled into a  sense of security by the proximity of the River Tay and the green spaces of the two Inches,” he said.The poll found % of Scots are in favour of car-free measures, % are against and % did not express an opinion.In Perth, % said they are a good idea, with % against and the rest not taking a position."},{"url":null,"title":"jim mcintyre expected to make first dundee signing ahead of celtic clash","story":"Dundee boss Jim McIntyre is swtly set to bolster his options by adding free agent Martin Woods to his squad.The former Ross County midfielder has been without a club since leaving Partick Thistle after their relegation last season and is set to be re-united with his former gaffer.McIntyre signed Woods twice while gaffer in Dingwall, the first a month after taking charge before the -year-old had a spell down south with Shrewsbury before ing north.Woods has been training with the Dark Blues since last week and was present at last night’s -

He was always ready with a quip, which was probably from all those years of teaching.“Charlie had only just retired from supply teaching earlier this year and had taught at Harlaw Academy for more than  years.“Whenever I would tell former pupils that Charlie was my brother-in-law, they always say he was a legend.“One thing I remember about him is what a smart dresser he was. He always looked classy.“Charlie was a keen gardener too. We could never get him out of his garden sometimes. He had this amazing garden – it was like the Winter Gardens with all these dferent plants.“Charlie also played football back in the day for Cove Rangers, and when he stopped playing, he became a referee too.“He loved his family, garden and teaching.”George said one of the lasting legacies of Charlie’s le was the discos he arranged for adults with special needs.The monthly Feel Like Dancing events were first held a decade ago and were inspired by his son Austin, who has special needs.The events were regularly attended by nearly  people.A post on the Feel Like Dancing Facebook page said: “We are beyond gutted and heartbroken to announce the passing of DJ Charlie. He was the leading light of our disco and a superstar DJ on the stage and behind the mic, always ready with a joke and a song and a smile for everyone.”George added: “He had a great attitude for le and his teaching and the disco will be his legacy.“Both Freda and him did it originally for Austin but it soon became a way of le, they put so much into it. It will be a massive blow and we will be continuing it with Austin.”Hundreds of messages of support have poured in on social media from pupils taught by Charlie over five decades.Friend and north-east radio presenter John McRuvie said Charlie was more than just a great teacher – he was also a great entertainer.He said: “He did this great impression of Chic Murray, the old Scottish comedian, and had the flat cap too.“It was spot on. He actually did the famous Chic Murray stand up at a show we did as we were raising money for the Sea Cadets.“It wasn’t something we thought he would do. He was a very funny man and a great entertainer.“He had his own dance version of Gangnam Style which the kids actually loved too.“I never knew him as a teacher but you can see how many people who come into contact with him had lovely things to say.“You can see how many people loved and respected him.”Aberdeen FC director Dave Cormack, who had Charlie as a football coach, paid tribute to his “mentor”.He said: “I was so very sad to hear the news of his passing. Charlie was a lovely man. He was a mentor to many, he was supportive and he was very funny. But he was also very firmyou got out of line.“Charlie, Lenny Taylor and Bobby Clark were our football coaches at Harlaw and in our fourth year, in , we won the Aberdeen Secondary Schools Cup by beating Kincorth after a replay in the final.“The first game was at Pittodrie and I’ll never forget that Charlie was in the dugout and was wearing a neck brace, only to exacerbate his neck injury by slamming his head on the dugout roof after Jim Bisset had equalised.“At the end of fourth year, Charlie and Lenny took us for a week to the Crystal Palace sports centre in London, where we actually played the Nigerian men’s army team in a friendly.“Their army team in these days was also the national team. Talk about men and boys! We were kicked all over the park in the first half.“So incensed was Lenny that he came on in the second half, and after he sorted out a few of their players, the game was abandoned. Charlie was in total hysterics.“I’ve nothing but fond memories of Charlie.“He was a bright light for all of us pupils that had the privilege of being in his company.”Ex-pupil Jimmy Lynch, who was taught English by Charlie at Powis Academy in , remembered his former teacher fondly.Jimmy said: “He was a classic man – an all-round nice guy.“Powis had a lot of under-privileged kids and Charlie taught them all with dignity.“I was devastated when I learned of his death and feel heart sorry for his son.”"},{"url":null,"title":"heres the next set of roads to shut for work to bring superfast broadband to aberdeen1","story":"A project to install superfast internet is set to close a number of Aberdeen roads for more than a month.Areas of Torry will be closed while Cityfibre carries out work.Parts of Kirkhill Road, Old Church Road and Gregness Gardens will be closed twice each between November  and December .The closures have been put in place in order to protect public safety during duct-laying works in the area.A no waiting rule will also be put on the roads,  metres either side of the closures, with illegally parked vehicles being removed.Cityfibre is looking to make Aberdeen one of the three cities in Scotland to become Gigabit Cities.The firm has partnered with phone provider Vodafone UK to deliver full fibre coverage across the UK by .The works are moving to Torry after having previously started in Kincorth."},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2018/10/leonamariemaver.jpg ","title":"in pictures aberdeen treated to stunning sunset","story":"Tonight’s stunning sunset provided the perfect inspiration for amateur photographers in the North-east.mdash Adele MersonOctober , mdash Helen BakerOctober , mdash Natalie HoodOctober , mdash Emma AnneOctober , mdash Martin IngramOctober , mdash Laura COctober , mdash Allan McIntoshOctober , mdash Dan BarnettOctober , mdash Catriona NicolOctober , mdash No Recourse, North East PartnershipOctober , mdash bazzaredOctober , "},{"url":null,"title":"north east public to have say on plans for new turbines at windfarm","story":"Public exhibitions are to be held to display proposals for new turbines at a north-east windfarm.The extension would be to Mid Hill windfarm in Fetteresso Forest, Aberdeenshire.Plans were lodged to build  extra turbines on the site, which was already home to .Members of the public have been given the chance to voice their opinions on the proposals at three dferent exhibitions.The first will take place at Banchory West Parish Church on November  between pm and pm.Another will be in Auchenblae Village Hall on November  between am and pm.The final event will be held at Drumlithie Village Hall, also on November , between pm and pm.Finnish energy firm Fred Olsen Renewables Ltd originally built the windfarm through its subsidiary Fetteresso Wind Limited in , with a further extension of eight turbines having since been added.A spokesman for the company said: “Fetteresso Wind Limited invite members of the public and interested stakeholders to attend public exhibitions, which will illustrate the proposed -turbine extension to the operational Mid Hill Windfarm, located on the hills of Turf Hill, the Builg and Mid Shanks, near Fetteresso in Aberdeenshire.“We are committed to Scotland’s ambitious renewable energy targets and always aim to consult widely.“The public exhibition will be in the form of an informal drop-in session.“Our team will be on hand to answer any questions you may have.“Any comments relating to the proposal may be made by email to press@fredolsen by the end of December .”"},{"url":null,"title":"time running out to apply for free salt bag from aberdeen city council","story":"Residents across Aberdeen have just a week left to apply for a free salt bag before winter.The deadline for applying is November  for iniduals or groups who want to salt pavements and roads.The offer, part of its winter plan introduced in -, allows community groups to request a one-tonne bag of salt as an alternative to salt bins.Aberdeen City Council transport spokesman Ross Grant said: “We’d urge people to apply now for the one-tonne community salt bags as we have a cut-off date of November  for them to ensure we can deliver them in plenty of time.“Unfortunately, our hard-working gritting staff can’t be everywhere all the time as there are  miles of roads in Aberdeen, slightly more than the distance from the city to London, and there are , miles of pavements, which is the distance from Aberdeen to Rome, so the community-spirited help is much appreciated.He added: “We hope there won’t be a harsh winter but it’s good for everyone to be as prepared as possible.”In addition to the one-tonne salt bags, residents will also be able to access big community salt bins which are being placed in  locations so far across the city.

What’s more, eventhey don’t mutate as occurred in the case outlined here,released into the wild either by design or mistake these foreigners can cause havoc to local ecosystems.In a letter to the scientic journal Nature in , a group of German scientists began ‘it has been rumoured that an unidentied crayfish…of marbled appearance and uncertain geographical origin that was introduced into the German aquarium trade in the mid s, is capable of unisexual reproduction ’.The authors ended by warning that: ‘This crayfish…could become a menace to European freshwater systems, as the release of even one specimen into the wild would be enough to found a population that might out-compete native crayfish’.Now,  years later, this all-female crayfish has escaped into the wild.  Identied as a descendent of the fresh water slough crayfish from Florida, it is now called the marbled crayfish or Marmokrebs. So far it has invaded the waterways of at least nine European countries as well as Japan and Madagascar. Unravelling its origin reveals that a unique macro-mutation must have occurred in a single slough crayfish egg probably caused by heat or cold shock whilst in transit from Florida to Germany for the pet market.The resulting female hatchling possessed three sets of chromosomes per celland the ability to produce clones of itself without a mate and at very high frequency.Because of its warm climate and abundant freshwater habitats, Madagascar has seen the most rapid colonisation with Marmokrebs. Millions of the animals have invaded the countries lakes, rice paddies and swamps and are threatening its seven endemic crayfish species.It is only a matter of time before this scenario is repeated in other locations, destroying valuable ecosystems and eliminating indigenous species."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor week 37","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated -days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as  pence per week.Sir,It is always a delight when a letter awakens a landowner.James F Lithgow#s insult about ‘blow-ins’ is a typical trait. I worked extremely hard to buy my farm, not being able to piggyback on my forebears’ efforts, and I didn’t ‘blow-in’, it took two forty-foot pantechnicons four days.It is clear he has an interest in wind turbines, and no doubt with a pair of wellies, a fish farm or two. His blinkered refusal to accept the huge body of evidence regarding fish farm contamination suggests he has an investment and it needs protecting. But only, of course,you don’t have a commercial interest.There is a huge amount of evidence that mechanical kelp harvesting does irreparable damage to the sea bed. Could I draw your readers# attention to the Facebook page #Stop Mechanical Kelp Dredging# The sea bed can’t be seen, but a bank statement can. No prizes for who is the loser. The  jobs in aquaculture will not last longmass kelp harvesting is allowed to decimate sub-sea environments and the only jobs on fish farms will be pushing barrows of diseased and dead fish.I’ve no doubt he knows that wind turbines have a -year le span and then the hugely disruptive process will start againan alternative has not been discovered. It has been calculated that the energy costs of a wind turbine will never be recovered during its lespan, but those receiving grants really don’t care.Why, given the amount of rainfall in Argyll, are hydro schemes not pursued  It used to be a mystery, until one looks at the vast sums of subsidy given by a gullible government to so called ‘alternative energy sources’, which actually means ‘alternative revenue sources’.There are any number of pretty glens that could be dammed, providing an extra environmentally-friendly leisure resource, create an opportunity for aquaculture and would not require a replacement somewhere down the line.Alexander Hamilton, Tayvallich.Sir,With reference to James Lithgow’s letter of September , it is important to make a couple of points.Mr Lithgow is right to say kelp has been sustainably harvested in Argyll for generations. There can be no comparison, however, with the current proposal to mechanically dredge up entire stands from the seabed together with all the fragile le that depends on them. This is not sustainable as evidenced in the few countries which have allowed this practice to take place.  Seaweed cultivation, on the other hand, is sustainable and more can be found on this through the Scottish Association for Marine Science.The  parliamentary inquiry into the environmental impact of salmon farming warned current methods could cause #irrecoverable damage#.  This is deeply concerning to those of us who live here, raise families and rely on the sea for our creel fishing, shellfish and tourism businesses. We also all have an inherent responsibility to care for our environment and there is increasing urgency to do this.Enterprises do need to be encouraged to grow and to provide opportunities and employment. This, however, must be done responsibly and with thought for the long-term viability of our communities.The profits of the predominantly multi-national salmon farming companies, who benefit from current loopholes in our environmental regulations, are well able to fund a responsible and researched approach for sustainability and erse employment opportunities.

Fish generate their own electricity by biological means, you see, and so have no need for charging points.Perhaps I shouldn#t even try to explain the joke to Mr Lithgow.I had hoped for a more cogent critique of the points I made, rather than the amateurish attempt to cover his lack of reasoning by smearing my origins and character, or what he erroneously imagines them to be, and by repeating the endless waffle of the wind industry#s PR department.One example: whenever a new wind farm is proposed there is a claim that it will provide electricity for a certain number of homes, say ,. What is not mentioned, however, except in very fine print at the bottom of the page, is that these figures are only achievable under perfect wind conditions, which rarely occur, and that the real output of usable electricity is a small fraction of the headline figure.What is also not mentioned is who is going to pay for the decommissioning costs when the wind farms inevitably turn into junk. Somehow, I don#t think it will be those who benefited financially. More likely, it will be us, the public, already being fleeced by inflated electricity bills, who will have to pay to haul thousands of tons of unrecyclable trash from our mountains or live forever with enormous eyesores.Let me restate the case for tidal power. The tides are generated by the moon as it orbits the Earth which creates gravitational pull on the oceans. These tides are predictable, both in power and timing, for centuries in advance, and will carry on being so until the moon eventually flies off into space some billions of years hence. There are two incoming tides and two outgoing every day, a total of four, each one involving an enormous quantity of moving water and thereby presenting the opportunity to generate electricity, totally free of carbon dioxide emissions.The UK, and especially Scotland, has an enormousof coastline. Scotland#s coast is about , kilometres, and Argyll accounts for a very high proportion of this because of the legacy of the last ice age which left us with such a convoluted coastline. So we have plenty of scope to exploit this resource.And we are doubly blessed because the complexity of our coastline results in the tides reaching dferent points at dferent times of the day. Therefore, by using several dferent sites, we could have an even amount of electricity always on tap.Wind and solar power cannot match this, either in quantity of power or dependability. They require a duplicate system of nuclear, coal, gas, and oil-fired generators always fired up and ready to kick in when the wind and sun refuse to co-operate # an enormously expensive system both in money and CO emissions.There is a case for subsidies during the infancy of any industry to get it started off.But the wind farm industry is not an infant # it is now a fully grown cuckoo. It has never has earned its keep and never will so it is time to chuck it out of the nest.Stuart White, Minard.Friday September  is World Alzheimer’s Day.There are , people with dementia in Scotland and , people with dementia across Argyll and Bute.

As he says, it is far too dependent on the vagaries of the weather.Tidal power can never fail and here in Mid Argyll we have potentially the most efficient and cost-effective tidal system under our noses. This, in turn, would open up additional tourist and recreational facilities at virtually no extra cost. This would be a win-win situation, but without, I suspect, sufficient profit to satisfy the usual parasitic financial interests.What is this simple and relatively inexpensive answer Simply build a sea wall or dam, call it what you will, across the relatively narrow entrance of Loch Gilp from the Lingerton promontary towards Ardrishaig via the rocky skerries, which would reduce the cost, and finish short of the Ardrishaig lighthouse harbour wall, thus funneling all the tides through a very narrow area.Then simply incorporate as many sea locks and gates as needed to allow passage of boats in and out of the harbour and the Crinan Canal.The additional locks would be used for either lower-able turbines or permanently submerged tidal units such as in the Pentland Firth. This would be simple and cost-effective, as the generating turbines catch the tides both in and out. After all, the Romans were using tide mills , years ago, so the idea is nothing new.In addition to this, Ardrishaig would finish up with an enhanced harbour  and marina and, with a few rocks removed from the beach, the wide open area at low tide back to Lochgilphead # now wasted # would make a splendid international course for activities such as land yacht racing.The other deceitful cuckoo that we should consider debunking is the very misleading fallacy that electric cars are helping to save the planet. Yes, it is ideal and justied for town or city use to keep the fume level down in densely built up areas where fresh air is in short supply among high buildings. But generally their use is unjustiable because pollution would actually increase considerably overall because to generate every single power unit of electricity it takes roughly two polluting units of other fuels such as coal, oil or even gas to produce that single electrical unit.So, unless the electricity is always generated from renewable systems such as hydro, tidal, solar or wind, then total pollution would go up, not down.One more cuckoo destined to be the sham of another expensive white elephant.Bob Henderson, LochgilpheadSir,We would like to say a huge thanks to all the bands who played on the Sunday of this year#s Tarbert Music Festival for making it a successful afternoon after the event had to be moved from the quay to the village hall # this has to be our most stressful decision.Thanks to all the hotels and pubs for organising the great music for the weekend.We raised just over £ at the coffee morning, so thanks to everyone who baked or donated and also to all the helpers # Anne, Gail,Jane, Allie, Nina and Zena.Many thanks also to the award-winning Mid Argyll Pipe Band, who entertained a huge crowd in the pouring rain and also the Loch Fyne Pipe Band who played to the Sunday survivors.To Mrs Brown, our very own collector extrondanaire, her wee buckets totalled £.Finally, and most importantly, thanks to visitors and locals for turning out to support our music festival.Thank you all.Margaret, Duncan, Barbara and Kirsten of Tarbert Music FestivalSir,The National Autistic Society is looking for people and organisations who have done something amazing for autistic children, adults, or their families.Perhaps it’s a teacher who has helped a child achieve something great, an autistic adult who has been campaigning tirelessly or a business that has put a lot of effort into making their workplace accessible.If any of your readers know of a person or organisation like this, please nominate them for our seventh annual Autism Professionals Awards.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as .

And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13470760.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_AMP_SDR_150718_TRUMP0013JPG.jpg","title":"ayrshire dad who blocked president","story":"NewsDaft dad in the dock after blocking Donald Trumps motorcade while he popped into the Co-op for milkPeter Goudie was stunned to be confronted with armed cops when he came out of the Maybole supermarket with his shopping.ShareByStephen Houston:,  OCT Updated:,  OCT NewsPeter Goudie came face-to-face with armed cops when he held up the Trump motorcade when he popped into the Co-op for milk \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailHe had dashed out to buy some milk from the Co-op.

RoundThe Pupils never really got going in this cup-tie, ending the game as second best to a moderately talented visiting side.Kinross were fortunate to be confronted by a uncharacteristically tame performance from the McFadyen sponsored home favourites.Lacking the key elements of drive, determination and quick controlled possession, the home side, playing with a threadbare squad due to injury and call-offs  used the long ball far too often in the first half.During the first twenty minutes the Pupils had territorial advantage, but were never able to string enough passes together to make a telling impact on the game.With the visitors hardly an attacking force, the home crowd was shocked when Kinross unexpectedly grabbed the lead shortly before half time.It’s ironic given that the Pupils back four seemed to be on top of their game, that one mistake should prove so costly.There seemed little danger, but the ball was lost in a crucial area and turned across goal for the incoming forward to score with the visitor’s only shot of the whole first half.The second half began disastrously for the home side, a through ball exposing the last line of defence whose first real action was to pick the ball out of the net.Given what went before, it was unimaginable that the Pupils were two goals behind at this stage the visitor’s ‘smash and grab’ tactics a complete contradiction to their earlier failure to attack.With the confidence of an unexpected but comfortable two goal cushion, the Fe League side turned the screw by controlling possession from the back.Mistakes had cost the home side dear, and, for the first time in the match the visitors looked like a team heading for the next round of the Scottish Cup!The home side tried desperately to retrieve the situation, but gaps appeared at the back as they threw caution to the wind.The keeper, young Alastair Ferguson, saved the day by fisting clear inside the six yard box, a timely intervention which kept the Pupils in the game at a crucial stage.Almost immediately, the home side were awarded a penalty kick on the back of a wild challenge in the box, and Gary Grumoli drove the ball into the net.Sensing blood, the Pupils powered forward at last using the ball to good effect with some fine possession football.However, it proved a  dawn and only a prequel to another defensive mistake which resulted in the visitor’s restoring their two goal cushion via a poacher’s finish from point blank range.In a breathtaking finish, the Pupils gained a second penalty with minutes remaining however, resisting the urge to change the kicker, Gary Grumoli placed his second effort to the keeper’s opposite side, only to see his kick saved dramatically.It was the final act of an uninspiring, but ultimately exciting game.The Pupils will try to put the cup disappointment behind them when they travel to play old foes, Hillington, in a league fixture tomorrow.Ellis Robertson played a solid game in the centre. _cpupilsvkinrossRyan

My wee daughter wanted to have an ldquoapple shower and so we stood under the trees. The mere touch of a branch resulted in a cascade of fruit. It was a wonderful ritual of autumn and I loved my kidsrsquo joy in it all, but within me there was a nagging feeling. As Irsquove got older, the oncoming of winter has had a depressive effect on me.Is it a process that affects us more as we get older, with each autumn marking the slow closing of yet another year To be sure, autumn is a beautul time of year and many people tell me it is their favourite season. I can understand that. The woods are magical, the sunsets seem more spectacular than at other times and itrsquos a time of harvest and forage. Our house is full of conkers, apples and colourful leaves collected on walks.Another part of the magic is the migrating birds. I heard the geese above me the other day, honking and flying in formation as they headed for Aberlady. They arrive at this time of year with winter on their tails. The assembly of pink-footed geese there at this time of year is a truly spectacular sight and sound. Tens of thousands of them gather at Aberlady Bay during their migration south.It almost has the atmosphere of an airport countless numbers of honking birds arriving from Iceland and Greenland, joining an already crowded bay. There are thousands of excited geese mingling together, sharing flight stories and looking forward to the next stage of their journey. Many feed in nearby fields before taking off once again to venture further south.As they fly over us their honking sounds like cackling witches. I often hear them when in the woods, as I did the other day. I looked up to see them through the branches of balding autumn trees, flying in their characteristic V flight formations. It seemed their honking was warning me of something: ldquoWinter is cominghellipwinter is coming.Some people of course follow the example of the geese and head for a kinder climate as winter approaches. But for most of us itrsquos a case of ritual and preparation. Hallowersquoen, really a later development of the Celtic Samhain festival, is one such ritual.But for me now, despite my love of autumnrsquos display, it cloaks my senses with a sense of melancholy which I find increasingly dficult to throw off.I spend as much time outdoors as possible in the other seasons but the darkness of winter forces me to retreat into my home. Hence we will soon be decorating our wee house with cosy and colourful lights to ward off winterrsquos dark blanket. But this dark blanket can cover our emotions as well, not so easily warded off.Many people I know likewise dread winter because of its depressive effect on their mental health. They wish that, like the geese, they could find a way of escaping the worst of it. I have often wished I was a bear who could hibernate away the winter months.But we are not bears or geese, and in my own battles with the oncoming of winter I have come to understand more than ever the importance of social connections and preparing for them. The truth is winter can be a time of flowering and rebirth, just like spring but in a dferent way ndash the flowering of friendship and rebirth of social connections perhaps lost or waned in the flurry of summer activities.In the past it was so self-evident. People huddled in each otherrsquos homes around the fire, keeping each other company. Like so many things these traditions have now been commercialised, yet the simple antidote of social connection in the approaching dark times remains as powerful as it ever was for us.It should be a time for visiting and getting together making time for friends and coming together in defiance of the darkness.

Members are drawn from local residents, licensees, health professionals and police.The board, which approved its new revised licensing policy for the next five years at a meeting earlier in the morning, scrapped the overprovision statement.Forum member Elizabeth Oldcorn said the decision was ldquodisappointing and against the views of the forum and the NHS, which she represents on it.She said: ldquoI think the board has done itself a disservice.And concerns were raised that not having an overprovision statement ndash which allows the board to reject licence applications from new premises on the argument an area already has enough premises ndash left it vulnerable.Forum convenor George Hood warned: ldquoI thinkyou do not have an overprovision statement you will find it very dficult not to grant a licence.The board argued that, while there were ldquosignicant health and crime problems in our communities that should not be ignored and ldquoaccess to alcohol is a key issue, it did not believe the harm caused by alcohol in East Lothian was a ldquodirect and sole consequence of the number of premises.Councillor Jane Henderson, board member, said: ldquoWe have to be absolutely certain about the causal link.Rudi Fruzynski, the boardrsquos licensing standards officer, said that one of the issues was a lack of guidance from the Scottish Government as to what qualied as overprovision.He said: ldquoThere has not been clear guidance from the Governmentrsquos policy unit.ldquoIt does not give us the information needed to put a policy in place with confidence it will not be challenged."},{"url":null,"title":"six-new-electric-vehicle-charging-points-for-east-lothian","story":"The Department for Transportcash will create chargepoints in residential areas in Aberlady, Dunbar, Stenton, North Berwick and West Barns.East Lothian Council applied to the DfTrsquos Office of Low Emission Vehiclesfor the funds following calls from residents who wanted to invest in electric cars.The new funds will be topped-up with money from Transport Scotland.Councillor Norman Hampshire, the councilrsquos cabinet member for the environment, said: ldquoThese chargepoints will improve access for everyone in the area, not just the residents who made the initial approach.ldquoIrsquod encourage anyone with suggestions about locations for new points to get in touch.The cash comes on top of pound, funding from Transport Scotland awarded to the council this year to increase the number of electric vehicle charging points.The six locations for new electric chargepoints are: Haddington Road, Aberlady Church Car Park, Stenton Forth View, West Barns Links Road, North Berwick Dunbar Leisure Centre Car Park and Dunbar High Street Car Park."},{"url":null,"title":"tims-tales-a-halloween-tale","story":"HIDDEN on the edge of Gford woods are the lonely ruins of Yester Castle. The remains of the castle are ancient and the oldest part is called Goblin Ha. It is partly underground, and its name means Goblin Hall.According to legend, a wizard named Hugh de Gford made a deal with the Devil nearly  years ago, and inan army of goblins swarmed up from hell and built Yester Castle for him. Goblin Ha is the part of the castle dating from that time and thatrsquos how it got its name.It is said goblins lurk in the shadows of the ruins, and especially in Goblin Ha itself. At sunset, when night falls, they come out of their hiding places and crawl about in the darkness.One autumn day quite recently a dad decided to take his two children on a trip to find Yester Castle. He worked long hours during the week so he kept weekends for his children.His daughter Suzie had just turned  and his son Jake was eight. Jake was mad about Harry Potter and wizards, and when he discovered there was a castle nearby made by goblins for a wizard he begged his dad to take him. Suzie was given the choice to stay at home with her mum, but at the last minute she decided to come.It was sunny when they set off. ldquoA perfect day to explore a castle made by goblins, said the dad jokingly. They parked at the golf course and walked towards the woods.ldquoMaybe the goblins play golf, Suzie joked to her wee brother.ldquoYou shouldnrsquot make fun, they might hear you, he said.They finally reached the edge of the wood and peered into it. Suzie found the bridge over the ravine that led to the ruins but then Jake ran ahead very excited, looking for goblins.It was dficult to imagine what the castle had originally looked like because it was so ruined. Jake said it reminded him of the ancient ruined temple in The Jungle Book movie. But one thing was for sure: it had an eerie atmosphere. As they explored, the dad walked under an archway and suddenly felt a shiver down his spine. He turned round and saw something move in the shadows.For a moment they stood absolutely still. Then a bird flew out, giving them a fright. The dad and Suzie burst into laughter.ldquoJust a stupid bird! said Jake, disappointed.After a careful search they found the entrance to Goblin Ha. It was a small entrance leading to a low, dark passageway. Jake bravely led the way, with his sister and dad close behind.A cold and damp atmosphere hit them as soon as they entered the chamber. Although it was dark, two windows above gave just enough light to see.ldquoSo all this was supposed to have been made by goblins  asked Suzie.ldquoYeah, said Jake, who was still getting over the excitement that he was actually in Goblin Ha, ldquoand they came from hell up that stairway. He pointed to the dark steps in the corner.All three stood peering into the dark stairway which plunged deep into the ground.ldquoAccording to the legend, this stairway was made by the Devil after he had done a deal with the wizard and it leads to hell. But itrsquos blocked up now, explained Jake. He looked at his father: ldquoCan we go down dad, please!ldquoSeems a bit dangerous to me son.ldquoAw, come on dad, said Suzie, ldquowe canrsquot come all this way and then not go down the stairway to hell.ldquoVery well, but Irsquoll go first and wersquoll use the torches on our phones, said the dad.Slowly they began to climb down the stairs. The light from their mobiles lit up the old walls and ancient worn steps as they descended. Suzie took photos in the darkness, although the flash wasnrsquot powerful enough to light up everything.Eventually they reached a point where great stones blocked the way so they couldnrsquot go any further. ldquoThey were put there to keep out the goblins, said Jake. His sister was now feeling a bit uneasy: ldquoCan we go now, dad  Itrsquos too spooky down here.ldquoScared of the goblins are we  her wee brother mocked.ldquoYes, letrsquos go back up, said the dad. Jake led the way up to Goblin Ha. ldquoItrsquos time we should be going, wersquove found the place so mission accomplished. Itrsquoll be dark soon, letrsquos go now while therersquos still good day light.So they left the ruins and walked back across the golf course, laughing and talking and admiring the beginnings of a sunset and a full moon in the darkening sky. They were at the car when Suzie realised she didnrsquot have her mobile phone.ldquoIt was in my back pocket, it mustrsquove fallen out, she insisted.ldquoAw no Suzie, it could be anywhere, her dad said, annoyed.ldquoDad, we have to go back to get it, please. I know I had it in Goblin Ha, it might have even fallen out there. The dad wasnrsquot happy but the mobile was expensive and so reluctantly he agreed.They retraced their steps all the way back to the castle. It had only been  minutes since they had left the ruins but the atmosphere in the dim twilight was very dferent.Finally they reached the entrance to Goblin Ha.ldquoYou go first, dad, said both children at the same time.And so the dad put on his torch and entered. His children followed close behind.When they emerged into Goblin Ha it was dark so the dad shone his torch on the ground, searching. ldquoWhere could you have left it  he asked Suzie.ldquoAnywhere, she replied, shrugging her shoulders.They couldnrsquot phone it as there was no reception, so they kept searching.It was Jake who heard it first: a faint sound coming from the dark stairway. He lted his head and looked in its direction but it was too dark to see anything. There it was again, it sounded like breathing.Jake froze in real terror. ldquoDadhellip he whispered, ldquodad, therersquos something there.ldquoStop it you wee bam, said his sister, ldquoyoursquore just trying to spook us. But then she heard it too. It was louder this time, a strange breathing sound. It was definitely coming from the stairway.Intrigued, the dad shone his light down the steps, although the mobilersquos torch wasnrsquot strong enough to completely light up the dark.Then suddenly a pair of red eyes appeared, staring back at him.The dad screamed, making his two children scream as well, and they instinctively ran for the exit. But it was dark and they couldnrsquot see the way.ldquoDad, for Godrsquos sake shine it over here, cried Suzie, now completely terried.The dad shone the torch and they ran through the passageway in a total panic. Once outside there was more light, from the full moon.ldquoWhy did you scream, you scared the hell out of me! Suzie shouted angrily at her dad.ldquoIrsquom sorry Suzie, it just gave me a fright, I didnrsquot mean to scare you, he said.ldquoWhat gave you a fright, what did you see dad  asked Jake, who was now scared himself despite his earlier bravado.ldquoNot sure really, I thought I saw, erhellipldquoYes, yes what  asked Suzie stretching out her arms impatiently.The dad hesitated, then said: ldquoWell it looked like eyes.ldquoI am now officially freaked out, said Suzie, ldquoplease letrsquos just get out of here, never mind the sodding phone.ldquoIrsquom sure it was some kind of animal, maybe a fox or even an owl, said her dad, trying to reassure her, ldquobut yes itrsquos too dark now, we should go back to the car and maybe we can come back tomorrow in the light to look for your mobile.Jake was suddenly distracted. He saw something in the passageway.ldquoDadhellip dad, whatever it is, itrsquos coming after us, look!The shadow of some creature was in the passageway, moving towards them.Both Suzie and Jake were now in a state of complete terror and they ran.ldquoNo, no, itrsquos dangerous, therersquos a steep fall there, donrsquot run! called out the dad.The kids stopped just in time. In the moonlight they could see they were standing on the edge of a steep fall. Their dad caught up with them and took their hands. They walked together carefully with hearts racing through the trees towards the bridge that led to the golf course.Behind them, a dark shadow came out of the entrance and crawled into the wood.They were just past the arched wall when they saw the dark shadow move in front of them, blocking the way. The dad shone his torch directly at it, and for a split second he saw it before it vanished into the darkness. He looked shocked.ldquoWhat the hell was that, dad  shrieked Suzie.ldquoI honestly donrsquot know, he saidWhatever it was, it was still in the woods, moving in the darkness. Then it came towards them once again, this time making strange noises.Jake suddenly yelled out: ldquoOur father who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name, thy kingdom come thy will be done, in heaven as it is on earthhellip Whatever it was made a sound like a scream and retreated back into the dark wood towards Goblin Ha. Jake continued the prayer and finished with a loud ldquoamen.ldquoLetrsquos get out of here, said the dad. All three ran in the moonlight out of the shadows of the wood onto the golf course. They kept running until they reached the car park, legs aching and completely breathless.The dad fumbled for his keys while the children stared at the golf course, looking for a moving shadow.Finally the dad found his keys and they were in the car and away as fast as possible.Suzie was the first to speak: ldquoI ask again, what was it ldquoI think the dark was playing tricks on us, said her dad, ldquoit was an animal of some sort.ldquoBut what about that horrible scream  she asked.ldquoFoxes can make a strange screeching noise at night, Suzie, thatrsquos what I think it was, said her dad, trying to reassure her.ldquoIt was a goblin, wasnrsquot it dad  asked Jake.ldquoAye right, replied his sister sarcastically, ldquoyou read too much Harry Potter. And what was all that praying about  That was just weird.ldquoIt was a redcap goblin, said Jake, ldquoyou canrsquot outrun them and the Lordrsquos Prayer is the only thing that will stop them. I had memorised it before our visit, just in case.ldquoHowrsquod you know that  asked SuzieldquoI read about it, said Jake.Suzie was just about to say something when her dad winked at her and interrupted: ldquoWellit was a redcap then the prayer seemed to work. He hoped this would stop them arguing. And it did. Jake smiled and put on his earphones.ldquoIrsquom sure it was a fox, whispered the dad to his daughter, ldquoor maybe a big rat, but just let Jake think it was a goblin.They got home with a story to tell their mum!In a quiet moment, when the children were busy, she asked the dad: ldquoSo what was it you saw He hesitated to answer the question, ashe wouldnrsquot be believed.ldquoTo be honest, I donrsquot know, he said. ldquoI told the kids it was a fox because I didnrsquot want to spook them, but I really canrsquot say.Who knows the truth of it all  If Suziersquos phone is ever found, the photos she took in the dark stairway might reveal what was really hiding in the darkness on that day."},{"url":null,"title":"be-prepared-for-next-beast-from-the-east-says-council-emergency-planner","story":"Severe weather is the biggest risk to people living in East Lothian, according to Sandy Baptie.And he has issued advice ahead of a one-day workshop to help communities prepare for any future emergencies.It includes going back to old-fashioned handsets in a time when more people rely on mobile phones.Mr Baptie, East Lothian Councilrsquos emergency planning, risk and resilience manager, has been visiting community councils and groups in the wake of the lsquoBeast from the Eastrsquo snowstorm, which brought much of the country to a standstill in February and March this year.Heavy snowfalls and strong winds caused chaos on the roads and left many people stranded in their homes.It also saw a surge in community spirit, with tales of people helping neighbours and looking after the more vulnerable people.Now Mr Baptie is hoping that spirit will help all communities prepare a Community Resilience Plan which they can use in case another severe weather front hits the county.And he has issued some advice for people to prepare in their own home for what could happen.He said: ldquoSevere weather is the biggest risk to East Lothian.ldquoBeing prepared for it is important and people can do things themselves, such as keeping an old-fashioned phone in their house in case mobile signal is lost, having a torch to hand in case power goes.ldquoIt is also important to stock up on food when warnings that severe weather is on its way are issued.More than  people are expected to attend the community resilience workshop at The Brunton, Musselburgh, on Saturday.The one-day event, which is being funded by EDF Energy and the Scottish Government, will bring together representatives from community councils, groups and schools.Advice on a range of aspects of drawing up community resilience plans will be available, including ensuring groups who take on responsibility are covered by insurance.It will also inform people of services they can sign up to with energy companies to ensure they receive a phone callpower goes out.North Berwick Community Council, which already has a plan and implemented it successfully during the Beast from the East, will be there to talk about how they did it and what worked.Mr Baptie hopes the event will result in community plans from across the county, with each one appointing a Single Person of Contact or SPOC.He said: ldquoThe idea of a SPOC is that there is one point of contact between each community and the council so we can get information to them and they can let us know what is happening, for examplepower has gone out in one area.ldquoThe plans are about drawing up lists of vulnerable people in the community, finding out who has a x and can get medicine to people or take them to hospital or the doctor.ldquoIt is about being prepared.

Once the provider of a fth of the worldrsquos ships thanks to yards such as Fairfields and Stephens on the Southside, Connels and Yarrows to the north, and John Brownrsquos at Clydebank, almost all but a few pockets of marine engineering on the Clyde would eventually fall silent.The Clydersquos proud history as one of the worldrsquos greatest sources of passenger liners, naval vessels and steamers slipped away to yards in Japan, Korea and China. Where those th and th century yards spewed out around , ships during their letimes, emerged new industries of financial services, tourism and media, and the Clydersquos quaysides became home to flats and shopping malls.Now, however, therersquos fresh hope that the Clydersquos proud marine heritage could be reborn for a modern era.The banks of the Upper Clyde ndash once home to yards like Napier and Miller which in the  built passenger ships and Great Lakes traders for American, Canadian and Norwegian companies before crumbling during the Great Depression ndash are set to reunite with the water, in the shape of a major new marine lsquoincubatorrsquo hub.The ambitious plan to restore marine manufacturing and support industries to the Upper Clyde ndash and with them, around  jobs ndash has been revealed by Glasgow-based marine engineering company Malin Group, which itself can trace its Clydeside roots to the Victoria era.The Scottish Marine Technology Park, planned for at Old Kilpatrick in the shadow of the Erskine Bridge, will be developed on -acres of derelict land which once housed the Carless oil storage facility. Wounded during the Clydebank Blitz when Nazi bombers left its tanks seeping oil into land.Unsuitable for housing, the brownfield site is one of the few of its kind remaining from dozens of shipyards and industries which once lined the river. That, along with direct access to a deep-water channel via an -metre long deep-water quayside berth with heavy lt facilities, means the site is ideally placed to help position the Clyde once again as a marine pioneer.As well as construction works, there are plans for the site to become a vibrant base for a wide range of modern marine industries, which could include radar developers and marine technology start-ups, to large scale developers of hydro-electric and renewable energy structures.Malin Group managing director John MacSween said: ldquoThe heritage of the Clyde is something of which we should all be rightly proud.ldquoWe have been working in the shipping industry for over  years and have a passion for the river and its history, but there is a need to be looking to the future to ensure the long-term success of the Clyde as a maritime centre of excellence.ldquoWe want to create a Marine Technology Hub which brings together providers of research, skills development, design, manufacturing and practical marine operational and logistics experience in a location that has complementary facilities backed by direct access to the deep-water channel of the River Clyde.As well as restoring the Clydersquos links with its proud marine heritage, itrsquos hoped the Old Kilpatrick site will help stem a drain of talent that sees Scottish university-educated marine architects and highly-trained marine researchers quit Scotland for overseas roles.Itrsquos also hoped that bringing together marine-based technology and construction companies in one location will creative an innovative spark to help create a new golden age of marine industry on the Clyde.ldquoBusinesses have struggled to find industrial land next to the river to allow them to work on marine-related issues, Mr MacSween added. ldquoItrsquos a sad state of affairs where there was once  miles of quayside along the Clyde, and now itrsquos down to just three or four.ldquoGlasgow has become a cosmopolitan city, with flats and retail parks along the river. But perhaps thatrsquos gone a bit too far, and the city is missing an opportunity to attract some of the marine-based businesses back.He said while BAE Systems and Ferguson Marine are keeping the Clydersquos shipbuilding heritage alive, more needed to be done to nurture marine-based talent.ldquoTraining and ship-management are very well represented and the Department of Naval Architecture at Strathclyde University is a world class centre for research and learning in the marine sector.ldquoWersquore known around the world for producing scientic talent, but most go overseas because they canrsquot find work in their field closer to home.ldquoWersquove been sending a signal that because of a dearth of space we are not open for business, and marine specialists canrsquot come to the Clyde because therersquos no opportunity to set up even though they are right next to the sea.ldquoNow therersquoll be a site that offers just that opportunity.The development, which is in an advanced stage of planning with West Dunbartonshire Council, will see a poundm remediation and regeneration of the contaminated land that is a legacy of the past oil refinery.Preparation works have already uncovered signs of the arearsquos shipbuilding past trenches have revealed an old slipway and signs of a harbour wall which appear to pre-date the oil depot. The structures could be linked to Napier and Miller, based at Old Kilpatrick from , and which built over  ships before falling victim to the Depression.Malin will move its own fabrication company, which currently builds workboats for the aquaculture industry and other marine fabrications at Renfrew, to the site to kick start the development.The construction phase of the project will see over  additional short-term jobs created, while itrsquos hoped that eventually the marine incubator could create  jobs and contribute pound.m annually to the local economy.Mark Newlands, Regional Head of Partnerships at Scottish Enterprise, said: \"We welcome Malinrsquos ambitious plans to revitalise this site and create much needed jobs in the West Dunbartonshire area. We look forward to working alongside the company to support its growth aspirations.ldquoWhat wersquore planning will never be on the same scale as in the past, but therersquos more to marine manufacturing than just shipbuilding, added Mr MacSween.ldquoBut therersquos a lot of exciting technology that needs to be built and sent off around the world.ldquoAnd therersquos potential for Glasgow and the Clyde to once again be at the forefront.ENDS"},{"url":null,"title":"teach-mandarin-urdu-and-arabic-to-save-language-learning-says-report","story":"But a new report argues our population now speaks more languages than ever before thanks to the establishment of communities from across the globe.There are now  languages spoken by Scottish pupils at home with the most common after English including Polish, Urdu, Punjabi, Arabic and Chinese.The report by the Reform Scotland has called on schools to harness the language expertise in such communities to lead a revolution in language learning.The findings come as figures from the Scottish Qualication Authorityshow entries in traditional languages have decreased over the last  years.Entries for Higher French are down by more than  per cent while entries for Higher German dropped by nearly  per cent.Reform Scotland called for an end to distinctions between so-called ldquocommunity languages and other modern languages.Chris Deerin, director of Reform Scotland, said: ldquoIf we want to see genuine growth in language skills rather than just paying lip service to the idea we need to rethink our approach.ldquoThere is a danger the languages currently on offer within the education system are not keeping up with Scottish or global society.ldquoWe need to think much more freely -

I believe that this amendment will help transform the landscape of residential and economic development in Scotland.ldquoMost crucially, this will enable more houses to be built, more communities to be created andmore people will have more opportunity to own their own home.Mr Wightman added: ldquoWith average house prices seven and a half times the average salary we must take every opportunity we can to help people afford to buy or rent a home.ldquoGiving local councils the power to buy land at existing use value rather than the inflated value caused by planning permission is an important tool in the box.ldquoA classic example is the Waterfront in Edinburgh where there are swathes of vacant land that have been allocated for housing for years.

We all love it.\"Gill Arrowsmith and Shirley Sinclair both thought the painting was \"fantastic\" while Annemarie Simpson thought that a similar venture in Wick would help tackle the \"towns eyesore\" buildings.While on that subject, one dissenting voice condemned the piece and said there was a \"masterpiece eyesore now in Wilson Street thanks to Caithness Horizons\".Beauty is, of course, in the eye of the beholder.The mural depicts a portrait of Thursos renowned botanist and geologist Robert Dick surrounded by a kaleidoscopic representation of the CHMAG facade and the scientists specimen collection.The bold use of line and colour based on modern urban graffiti cannot fail to be noticed just like the mural on nearby Tollemache House but is sited in a much less conspicuous space ndash the gallerys car park.CHMAGs curator Merran Gunn, who was instrumental in commissioning Delaye to create the work, said the artist had also spray painted a wall within the building as part of a show running called Graffito.His earlier piece has an explosive anime style figure punching out of the wall toward the viewer.\"Marcs work is bold and vibrant, electric colours jostle for dominance, and the new outside mural is no exception with tangerine skies set behind the historic Thurso of Robert Dick,\" said Gunn.Thursos illustrious scientist had his herbarium collection feature in an earlier work by the artist Joanne Carr which in turn is featured within Delayes mural ndash a clear case of one artist paying homage to another.\"Graffiti and street art is more relevant than ever whether it be in the art world ndash with the recent record sale of Banksys girl with a balloon ndash or here in the Highlands where graffiti has made its way onto the syllabus at Farr High School through art teacher Tracy Wilkinson,\" she said.After garnering great positive feedback from the current show Merran decided to \"have a moment of spontaneity\" and raised funds through a crowdfunding website and the Dounreay Communities Fund to commission Marc Delaye to breath some le into a fairly drab corner of the town.Tracy Dodson, commercial manager of CHMAG, said that the gallery was \"breaking boundaries\" with Graffito.\"It questions what actually constitutes art and what gets shown in a gallery. Graffito is an exhibition that celebrates artwork that is available to everyone.\"Traditionally graffiti has been seen as anti-social, fringe or even as criminal vandalism, but with an emphasis on social inclusion, we are celebrating street, pop, comic and zine work as mainstream art for hanging in our gallery.\"Tracy unabashedly declares that Graffito is \"aimed at young people and the young at heart, as a way of inviting new and future audiences to a museum and gallery experience\".\"This is a multicoloured on-the-wall exhibition devoted to all manner of graphic mark-making and breaking the boundaries of what art is all about,\" she said. \"We have also hosted street painting and comic workshops, guided gallery tours, and collaborating with our local schools and council.\"Marc Delaye is an established community projects artist with Freshpaint.org which is based on the Black Isle.\"Murals are as alive now as ever before and an excellent way to introduce art to internal and external spaces, giving iniduals and communities something that they can be proud of and enjoy each and every day,\" said Marc.The murals can be privately commissioned and can be an \"ideal means of advertising products, services, messages and campaigns\".Other exhibitors at Graffito include Andy Strachan, of Comic Creations Studios Dundee, David Robertson of Fred Egg Comics and Zu Dominak, all of whom work at the University of Dundee within the Masters degrees in Comics and Graphic Novels ndash the only course of its kind in the UK.Other exhibitors include Victor Nobis and his series Fallen Giants ndash a fantasy dream space where cities like Edinburgh rise and twist through the torso of neon lit giant figures.Graffito finishes on Saturday with a day of childrens workshops, guided tours and a colouring competition.Thursday  Oct  : AM"},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"October ,  at : pmThe annual Bonfire and Fireworks display, organised by the Rotary Club of Orkney on behalf of Kirkwall and St Ola Community Council, will take place on Saturday November  at the Peedie Sea.

It is a neurological disease which results in changes in animals# mental state, abnormalities of posture and movement and of sensation. The clinical disease usually lasts for several weeks and it is characteristically progressive and fatal.According to The World Organisation for Animal Health statistics very few cases of BSE — fewer than  each year since  — are reported in the UK.Rural Economy Secretary Fergus Ewing said: “Following confirmation of a case of classical BSE in Aberdeenshire, I have activated the Scottish Government’s response plan to protect our valuable farming industry, including establishing a precautionary movement ban being placed on the farm.“While it is important to stress that this is standard procedure until we have a clear understanding of the disease#s origin, this is further proof that our surveillance system for detecting this type of disease is working. Be assured that the Scottish Government and its partners stand ready to respond to any further confirmed cases of the disease in Scotland.”Chief Veterinary Officer Sheila Voas said: “While it is too early to tell where the disease came from in this case, its detection is proof that our surveillance system is doing its job. We are working closely with the Animal and Plant Health Agency to answer this question, and in the meantime, I would urge any farmer who has concerns to immediately seek veterinary advice.Ian McWatt, Director of Operations in Food Standards Scotland said: “There are strict controls in place to protect consumers from the risk of BSE, including controls on animal feed, and removal of the parts of cattle most likely to carry BSE infectivity.“Consumers can be reassured that these important protection measures remain in place and that Food Standards Scotland Official Veterinarians and Meat Hygiene Inspectors working in all abattoirs in Scotland will continue to ensure that in respect of BSE controls, the safety of consumers remains a priority. We will continue to work closely with Scottish Government, other agencies and industry at this time.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Veterans, army and sea cadets and other groups will muster at the Royal British Legion, setting off shortly afterwards to form up on Broad Street.A short service led by the Salvation Army captain will lead to a two-minute silence at am, before a special Armistice Service takes place in the cathedral.In the afternoon, volunteers will begin to create a large-scale portrait in the sand at Scapa Beach, of an Orcadian soldier killed during WWI as part of Danny Boyle’s - NOW commission, Pages of the Sea. It was previously reported in last week’s The Orcadian that the event would take place at Waulkmill Bay, but this location has since changed to Scapa Beach.The artwork — one of  across the UK and the Republic of Ireland — will signy both the departure of the soldier from the county to serve in the war and, as the tide washes their image away, the loss of their le and those of many others.At pm, Orkney’s young people join forces with Orkney Rocks! Choir and others to remember those lost, and the impact the war had on those left behind, in a special concert at the Orkney Arts Theatre.Admission will be free and there will be an opportunity to make a contribution to the charity, Help for Heroes. Tickets for the concert will be released on Monday, October , and will be available at the council’s customer services points in School Place, Kirkwall, and Warehouse Buildings, Stromness.At .pm, a lone bugler at St Magnus Cathedral will join , inidual buglers from across the UK and oversees territories in sounding the historic ‘Last Post’.This will be followed by the lighting of a beacon on the St Magnus Cathedral kirk green at pm as part of the national Beacons of Light event which will see beacons lit across the country, symbolising an end to the darkness of war andto the light of peace.St Magnus Cathedral will remain the focus as, at .pm, the bells will ring alongside , others across the nation and beyond.Between pm and pm, the short film specially commissioned by the Kirkwall Townscape Heritage Initiative for the centenary of the armistice will be projected onto the cathedral for the last time.The convener of Orkney Islands Council, Harvey Johnston, said: “We are grateful to everyone who has worked with us so far to ensure we have a fitting programme of events here in Orkney for people to mark this momentous occasion and pay their respects to forbears who suffered so much.

Inkson, have been fondly remembered down the years and credited with greatly boosting the French linguistic capabilities of those involved.As well as sowing the seeds for lasting friendships, one of the exchanges also led to the eventual marriage of Alistair Swanson of Dingwall and Belgian Marie-Anny De Landsheer. Alistair lived next door to Marie-Annyrsquos Scottish exchange partner, Sandra, daughter of the late Sandy and Lilly Macrae.With some of those attending a th anniversary meeting in Dingwall now in their s and s, there was much to catch on. One of those present, George Robertson, said the stark contrast between the new and old Dingwall Academy buildings amazed those present.\"The day began with a guided tour of Dingwall Academy, graciously hosted by rector, Mrs Karen Cormack and two equally charming assistants, Ceitidh Petrie of fth Year and head girl, Anna-Maria Stewart of sixth year. We were amazed by the change in the Academy mdash from the grim corridors with its memories of rooms with formal rows of desks, piles of jotters and frequent administrations of summary justice mdash with the lsquoLochgelly Specialrsquo mdash to the cosy, student-friendly comfort of modern classrooms, sumptuously equipped with digital projectors and interactive whiteboards.\"Gone are the dingy cloakrooms, in the corners of which, stressed-out procrastinators struggled furiously to finish their homework on time! Gone too, are the endless, uncouth nicknames we used to give our teachers, Pirrac, Froggy, Daisy-lugs, Kate Stew, Inky, Willie the War, Kramer, Horace, Scabbac, Sinkie, Snottery Tom and so on.\"He added: \"We soon realised that Dingwall Academy is a much happier, kinder place than the strictly regimented establishment, where we learned, suffered, cried, laughed and fell in, and out, of love! The old school, however, was not all bad, because we had the good fortune of being taught by many caring, brilliant teachers who inspired and challenged us, and whom we still remember with great fondness. J.K.Inkson was one of those par excellence, but kind and modest, despite his many gts.\"After welcome refreshments in the Academy cafe, the group enjoyed a tour of Dingwall Museum.Mr Robertson said: \"The culminating highlight of our day was, without doubt, the get-together and dinner in the Royal Hotel, Cromarty. We were able to catch up with more of our old friends and former schoolmates. We were formally welcomed by Sandra Collardand by Marie-Anny, who addressed us in flawless English. The dinner was a splendid affair, with a host of gastonomic delicacies, all excellently prepared.\"The old friends recalled the lasting benefits of their exchanges down the years. Mr Robertson said: \"We were particularly glad to have a representative of the Inkson family with us, in the form of J.K.rsquos daughter, Helen, and we were pleased to hear a message of greeting from his son, Kerr, who lives in Auckland, New Zealand.\"Kerr wrote of his pride in the job his father had done, developing and managing the exchanges. He also wished us all a happy evening together. We remembered with fondness, all those who were no longer with us, and especially J.K.Inkson himself, to whose memory all drank a fitting toast.\"Warm thanks were also expressed to Sandra Collard who helped maintain contacts and organise the event and Marie-Anny who \"emulated mdash and surpassed mdash her fictional compatriot, Monsieur Poirot, in locating so many of our Belgian friends\".Although Marie-Anny was the only surviving Belgian veteran who felt able to undertake the long journey to Ross-shire, Mr Robertson said: \"There has been a great exchange of email addresses, and it looks like the ether will be buzzing with electronic correspondence between old friends in Britain and Belgium.\"Well done, Marie-Anny and Sandra, for giving us one of the most memorable days of our lives, and thank you Alistair, for your magical photographic memories of this wonderful occasion!\"Thursday  Oct  : AMBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

I would like to put on record my gratitude to Network Rail for listening to concerns of the local community and of representatives like myself.\"Despite matters relating to Network Rail being reserved to Westminster, I knew the best hope was for the Scottish Government to try and make clear that the sorry state of affairs that we have all witnessed, couldnrsquot be allowed to continue. Let me be frank, these changes would not have been possible without the intervention of the Scottish Governmentrsquos Transport Secretary, Michael Matheson MSP.\"The local communities deserve a huge amount of credit as well. Local representatives have campaigned tirelessly and have sought to keep people informed when information wasnrsquot always forthcoming from Highland Council.\"I hope now that we can move forward from what has been an extremely trying situation for local communities.\"Network Rail confirmed the new system is something it is actively looking into, but that it was not yet in a position to proceed and had no specic start date for its introduction.But a spokesman added that the system was similar to one that was introduced on the same stretch of track in  after another serious landslide, so the idea is feasible.Thursday  Oct  : AMBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

It is part of the Year of Young People activities.The youngsters involved will come up with ideas but they are also keen to hear what other young people would like to see on the mural.Year of Young People ambassador Jonathan Dorrat said: “We’d really like children and young people aged eight to  years to come forward with designs or concepts for the new mural. Some of the themes could be, #What do you enjoy about Shetland #, #What makes you proud of Shetland #, #What is Shetland famous for #.# Send any ideas, before Friday th July , to youthservices@shetland.gov.uk or call or contact SIC Youth Services through their Facebook page.The SIC#s education and families chairman George Smith said: “This is a really exciting project that will capture the creative talents of young people, who will design and create this substantial piece of graffiti street art.#This project will help to channel their energy, and produce something expressive and colourful that helps to transform the area of the Viking Bus Station. It will be a fitting local legacy of the Year of Young People .”Are they going to remove the bus shelter to allow for the mural to be doneI sincerely hope the art work or whatever, is not some form of contemporary, conceptual, expressionism or modern art rubbish, where splashing paint onto the wall is regarded as art when in reality it is utter rubbish##.oh, but you can see the movement of the paint, the blending of colours and the meaningless shapes etc etc###and then give an equally rubbish title like Lerwick on a stormy night, the meaning of le or some other pointless title.Over the years art has very much lowered its standards signicantly to make and justy it becoming more commercially viable####.just as bad, selling a reproduction at almost the same price of the original work as a so-called # limited edition rubbish #.I would think even Graffiti would be more interesting to look at###atleast, for the best part, you can still see what was being represented in terms of graphics and text.No doubt the PC Brigade would like it because it gives the opportunity for somebody to express themselves through art and le experience###..despite the fact everybody  looks upon it as pointless and meaningless rubbish.Love the art, shame about the bus service, waiting for an area and all that. Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildle centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me .. Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!Why not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like    It#s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.There are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined. Next you#ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!I think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.If you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, #The Arts#, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved    SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, #Status Quo#, thanks, Malcomn Younger and #Scottish National Ballet, #Highland Fling #, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildle centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £ million on that. A scientic, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.Would not even need a bar!!!The Shard in London, an amazingly beatul structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass. Building methods change along with building materials.I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.Come on Haydn I agree there are many beautul building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.The Shard is a massive glass pyramid#.I#m wholly indferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug##.Mareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.If I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used # There#s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.All the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.Call me old fashioned but I would love to see the modernbuilding business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of  to  tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles,all done  years ago.It#s true you really can#t get the staff nowadays. I wonderthe Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops # the British ways of one can#t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is aboutto finish offanother burgeoning industry.I’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up! As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in theirbucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.Aluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.I’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of theterm ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much inidentying the material nature of that being used but more an attemptto denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure Rather like calling a van a box on wheels  I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaningcomments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.@ Haydn Gear.When there is nothing of note to dferentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.Pretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.Unless you already know Mareel#s purpose and that its supposedly an #iconic# design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that#s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname #The Pagoda# as soon as it was built.Let us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for #Mareel# to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst#s #Pickled cow and calf.#, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel#s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.I have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel. What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kickout of venting there spleens in those directions.I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.Leaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man Those of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.Purely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda wasin any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it I wondertakeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architecturalsimilarities.The viking was a chippy when it opened.#What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.# Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, # is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments  #, #I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever# and # Pig ignorant prats.# Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!Well Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there  All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , prolerate.Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.Love hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my le involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of someby those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and tomaintaincredibility from the watchful public at large. In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.Look what happened!So let today’s critics mock onit makes them feel better.Paraphrasing MGM#s famous motto, the phrase #Arse gratia artis#, springs to mind. LOL 🙂As an artist myselfdoing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildle, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.I have been to many art exhibitions andart shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as # ripping off the customer # with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody  can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.It takes me about  hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.I have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products dficult to accommodate should pay a visit. Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spenceis an all too common feature in mostwalks of le —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns isnot too far removed from theactions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!So talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.Nobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as #pig ignorant#. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such #arty things#.We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £ million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained consecrated.No doubt it was deliberate and theopportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !Had you checked out Ian#s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I#d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous #Sam the Eagles# among us. That said, it#s a concept I wouldn#t wish to see spread any farther!🙂No insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to #The Black Mountains#. Iwill try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found inMareel#s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing , nasty little creatures!!! .Fairenough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artistswhen it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds.

To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say # there is a strong likeness to themselves # and they are very pleased with the outcome.Alternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.I could always get away with this by saying # It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art # and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lolWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself andyou look at my products you would find this to be true. My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generatesympathetic responses.It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted.

The - scoreline flattered the home side. Shetland could easily have had another two or three goals and it has to be remembered that Orkney only got their last two with the game either entering or having gone into stoppage time.Molloy’s introduction  minutes into the second half obviously made a dference, as he went on to score the type of goal I doubtanyone  in the squad is capable of – muscling his way into the box, holding off a couple of defenders, creating space for himself and firing home.But the damage had been done in the first half – at - down Shetland were always facing an uphill struggle and it was no surprise that Orkney put the icing on the cake with a couple of breakaway goals.Some have suggested it was a game too far for captain Leighton Flaws, who reversed his decision to retire after last year’s win in Lerwick. I wouldn’t necessarily go along with that. Flaws, who maintains it was not the carrot of the centenary match that prompted his U-turn, looked as good as anyone in the Shetland side in the second half.I felt really sorry for manager Kevin Main, who spoke openly beforehand about both his hopes for the big day and his selection tactics. As someone who was described this week as “the Gareth Southgate of Shetland football”, he deserves the chance to turn this setback around.Two years ago the then management team of Allan Graham and John Scott Christie, whom Main had assisted, were basically forced out of their positions after a - defeat in Kirkwall.There is no way that should be allowed to happen again. Hopefully Main and his assistant Robert Geddes will now take stock and work hard towards next year, when the match at Gilbertson Park in Lerwick will celebrate Shetland Football Association’s th birthday.It’s just a pity we have to wait a whole  months until a chance of revenge.: : : : : : : :A couple of hours earlier another team in blue slumped to defeat, but with Orkney’s recent record on the hockey pitch that was less unexpected.There are continuing signs of improvement among the hockey players, however, in spite of an ever-increasing list of failures at inter-county level.A score of - was probably about right, as Orkney were much more clinical and displayed a quality of crisp passing and control which was a shade above their opponents.The Shetland players work incredibly hard and show much commitment, however, especially with the added handicap of having to travel to Brae for any kind of action.A few caught the eye on Saturday, among them goalkeeper Megan Nicholson who pulled off at least one fine save, Cara Leask who notched the opening goal and Kristan Robertson who got the nod as Shetland’s player of the match.I would also mention Victoria Duthie who was in the thick of the action throughout, making several excellent runs and showing much determination both in possession and when chasing an opponent. The fact that Duthie was still limping quite heavily a few hours later was testament to how much she gave for the cause.: : : : : : : :Orkney football historian Jockie Wood addresses the Milne Cup th anniversary reception at the PIckaquoy Centre in Orkney last Saturday. Former Aberdeen striker Joe Harper, the evening#s guest of honour, is in the centre of the picture. Photo: John CouttsThe reception at the Pickaquoy Centre later on Saturday evening, attended by over  guests, was a great opportunity for former county football adversaries to meet up again.Unfortunately the meal was nothing to write home about – the main course of roast beef and trimmings was cold – and the acoustics of the building were downright awful.The speeches which followed,anyone could hear what was being said, were on the y side. And I have no idea at all what guest speaker Joe Harper, the former Aberdeen and Scotland striker, was on about. All you could hear was the occasional “effing” this and “effing” that.It was fitting, however, when Jockie Wood called on a couple of former Shetland players to take a bow. Both Geordie Hunter, or the “big game Hunter” as Wood referred to him, and the inimitable striker Bert Sinclair certainly did their bit in years gone by.Sinclair in particular was in his element, reminiscing with Orkney opponents Alan Findlay and Eric Hutchison who also featured in the famous  game when he hit the back of the net five times in the - victory.: : : : : : : :And finally, as this week’s column is all about the inter-county weekend, it is surely fitting to end on a high note.On Sunday morning, although the match really should have taken place as a warm-up to the main Milne Cup encounter, over two dozen veterans took to the field again.Helped by the fact that one or two of the team are still turning out occasionally at B-team level, the blues were much fitter and faster than their opponents.Robert Adamson, who fills out his shirt rather better than he did -odd years ago, was on the scoresheet along with his former Thistle team mate Stuart Smith who netted a hat trick.The others came from Delting’s Stuart Hay and the aforementioned Main, who surely merited it after Saturday’s setback, and a penalty from the oldest man in the side Bruce Williamson of Spurs.The final score was a - win for Shetland, which as some wise guy put it made for an aggregate - football victory. But unfortunately not many will see it that way. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 24 ","story":"Congratulations to Delting on their hard-fought Parish Cup win on Saturday, and commiserations to Southend United who pushed them so hard.It is rare enough for a local game to end -, and even rarer for it to remain scoreless after extra time when tired legs can often lead to goals.Astonishingly, Delting’s - triumph on penalties meant they relied on the spot-kick route throughout the whole of this year’s campaign. So they certainly had plenty of practice.The final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.Delting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.Devonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.This is the th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back  years for Southend’s solitary success.Apologies to older readersI’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in , but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.The quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw - with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay - away from home.The semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another - draw and another replay was necessary.After Delting won that one - at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.Delting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.Although it was tough ask to play two games in about  hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.So on Saturday th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.Goals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a - lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.Player manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.It was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.But it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.: : : : : : : :In professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.The benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the  clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.During the - campaign the clubs benefited from over £. billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £ million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £ million.Just where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.While players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.On the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Cha, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.In Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.Following Rangers’ - draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.It could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.That was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.Perhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes findsdficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.Rogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.There are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.: : : : : : : :One of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.Although the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and  runs.Much has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.Unfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.I’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.Maybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.The only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped dfuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.Some apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.In answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame. Kohli would do well to take note. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"big turnout to welcome the eighth serene to whalsay ","story":"The latest Serene arrives at the pier at Symbister.

The Rangers v Aberdeen tie will be played at Hampden at .pm the same day.Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers described the process as “irrational and discriminatory”, saying he had never been to Murrayfield in his le.This is the same man who could not offer any comment when quizzed at the weekendit was unfair to ask Aberdeen fans to travel to Glasgow for a noon kick-off.The handling of this by the authorities has been a shambles, and it was a bit rich to hear Scottish Professional Football Leaguechief executive Neil Doncaster say that the U-turn was because the situation had changed.Initially Hampden Park Ltd had insisted on sticking to its contract to host all semi-finals involving Celtic and Rangers, Doncaster said. The SPFL was unwilling to breach that contract and risk legal action and apparently Police Scotland were okay with the original decision. Incredibly it was said to be “the best and most practical solution”.But after the inevitable outcry, Hampden Park Ltd changed its mind and decided to waive the legal obligation.No-one should really be surprised at such a monumental cock-up, however, as you’d be hard pushed to find two organisations with as little credibility as the SPFL and Police Scotland.The idea of staging both games at Hampden on the Sunday, with Rangers taking on Aberdeen at noon and Celtic meeting Hearts at .pm, was beyond belief.Dons supporters were rightly up in arms, having been forced ious times in the past to travel to Glasgow for lunchtime kick-offs. Unless Scotrail, another organisation not known for covering itself in glory, agreed to put on extra trains the first was due to arrive in the city  minutes after the match had begun.Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes pointed out that the scheduling would have little or no effect on his team’s preparations which would just go ahead in the usual fashion. That may be so but for the fans it would have been a complete nightmare.Hearts boss Craig Levein was more outspoken, which is becoming a regular feature of a man who was once seen as boring. He described the SPFL’s decision as absolute madness.The Edinburgh club’s owner Ann Budge also voiced concern, given the dficulties that could arise from having over , supporters from four dferent clubs in Glasgow on the same day.She was quite correct. The probability that it would deter younger Hearts followers from travelling, as it could be a very late trip back to the capital, was a very real one.Budge was one of those who asked the SFPL to think again, saying the body should be encouraging fans to attend and not making it dficult for them.If the first game had gone to extra time and penalties it could have been well after pm before the stadium was emptied. That would not have given much time to clear up the inevitable mess, get rid of , people and get another , in.If any evidence was needed about what is wrong with Scottish football, here it is. The Scottish football authorities had placed all its eggs in one basket with Hampden and had no option but to try and justy the daft move. It really did beggar belief.: : : : : : : :Fortunes have been mixed for Shetland’s rugby teams so far in their mainland competition endeavours.The men’s side began by losing all three games and finishing bottom of group one in the oddly named North Region Referee’s Cup, although they were only well beaten in one of the ties.Then, on the back of a promising home league win against Aberdeenshire, they unfortunately came up short on Saturday after a long trip to the Western Isles, going down - to Stornoway.The revamped Tennents Caledonia North  ision looks very competitive, with the likelihood of most teams being able to beat anyone on their day.Shetland, as we all know, will be a match for most at home. But it remains dficult to do the same when travelling, with so many players not able to commit due to one reason or another.The depth of the squad is very important, which is why it is heartening to see more youngsters coming into the equation. They, after all, are the future of the club.The women’s team, on the other hand, have enjoyed a great start to the season, beating both Banff and Inverness Craig Dunain and currently leading the Tennents North League table.Last year’s league winners Orkney have already lost a game against Inverness, and a fascinating battle could ensue at Clickimin on Sunday when the island rivals go head to head.: : : : : : : :As someone who has supported Manchester United for over half a century, it pains me to see the state of the club under manager Jose Mourinho.This week’s home peformance against Valencia was abysmal, with several players totally devoid of pace and urgency and obviously not doing the business for the man in charge.The stunned silence among the fans was something that has rarely,ever, been seen before. Many of them began leaving Old Trafford with  minutes still remaining, and you really can’t blame them.The once-great club has been on the way down ever since the retiral of Alex Ferguson. The treatment of his replacement David Moyes was shocking, being sacked after only eight months in charge, and the appointment of the next incumbent Louis Van Gaal was a mistake.The worst move of all though was to hand the job to Mourinho. Winning the Europa League and the League Cup in his first season obviously gave  hope to some but he really was an awful choice.This walking advert for narcissism needs to go now before things become even worse. But the question is who will be next in line. Zinedine Zidane has been tipped because of his supposed “humility”, in contrast to Mourinho, although that was hardly evident with the infamous dismissal for head-butting Marco Materazzi in the  World Cup final.Others who have been tipped include Didier Deschamps, who led France to World Cup success a few months ago, or former United player Laurent Blanc who was recently in charge at Paris Saint-Germain.While it will most likely be another foreign manager who succeeds Mourinho, I reckon the club could attempt to reverse the trend by appointing an Englishman.Why not give someone like Eddie Howe of Bournemouth the job  He is one of the brightest young bosses in the country and has performed wonders at a club where the ambitions are basically to stay in the Premier League. But sadly I can’t see it happening.: : : : : : : :Contrary to my views on Mourinho, it was very disappointing to see the likeable Steve Bruce handed his marching orders by Aston Villa this week.Bruce led the club to the final of the Championship play-offs last season, but was sacked on Wednesday after a - home draw with Preston North End the previous evening.Villa are now th in the table but had they beaten Preston they would have risen to fth equal, only five points behind the leaders. A couple more matches and things could have been on the up again.Bruce had a cabbage thrown at him by a so-called fan before the game on Tuesday and later said the incident unfortunately summed up society at the moment.“There’s no respect for anyone any more,” he told interviewers, a statement which was borne out by the actions of the Aston Villa board of directors the following day. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"whalsays new research arrives in lerwick for first time ","story":"The Research leaves Symbister with bunting flying as she heads for Lerwick on Saturday.

A lot of visitor experiences are going to be marred.\"Adam Gough, CairnGorm Mountain representative, who had told of the need for the slopes aimed at beginners and intermediates, was clearly stunned by the rejection.Asked immediately after the decisionan appeal was likely, he said that a statement would be issued later.CNPA head planner Gavin Miles had stressed from the outset the application had to be determined on planning issues ndash landscaping impacts in particular ndash and not on its commercial merits, which had generated much argument.He said the business case was a matter for Natural Retreats.Mr Miles told the committee the articial slope would not extend the ski area in any signicant way but the footprint of obvious development would increase.He commented: \"Initially the team were very concerned about the landscaping but as more information was given to us by the applicants it was considered that in the long term planting would mitigate against that. There would be an impact in the short term of the dry ski slope.\"Whether it will ever be an attraction in its own right and generate signicant income, who knows, but that is not a consideration of the planning process.\"In effect it is a ersication of business in this area and therefore acceptable andit was to strengthen the stability of CairnGorm Mountain then thats a good thing.\"He said there were some hefty planning conditions attached to control the development.CairnGorm Mountains representative said some  per cent of total visits to the resort were in just three winter months of the year.Mr Gough had told the committee Natural Retreats had explored several options in depth to remove the reliance on winter income including mountain biking and zip-wiring but this plan was the most viable at this time.He said it was imperative the attraction can provide year-round employment in order to retain its best staff. This site was the most sheltered for the ski slope and close to other facilities without impacting on other slopes, he said. It could also be used for tubing and other activities.Mr Gough acknowledged the clamour for better ski uplt at CairnGorm which has been overtaken as Scotlands most popular ski resort.He said: \"We would like nothing more than to be able to upgrade ski infrastructure to improve the snowsports experience for everyone but this has to be a long term process built on solid commercial foundations.\"He said the slope could be in operation for  per cent of the year outwith winter and ice would not be a problem as it was easy practice to break it up.ABA secretary Alan Brattey said history showed articial slopes at Scottish resorts including the Lecht, Glenshee and Glencoe had not worked.He also said a bright green Snowflex slope would stand out like a sore thumb and no consideration had been given by the operator to an alternative by market leader, Neveplast, which could be camouflaged.He said that of just over  votes on Facebook on the application,  per cent were against it.Tessa Jones, of the Badenoch and Strathspey Conservation Group, asked the committee: \"What are you going to say to the world about this peatland destruction \"Committee member Dave Fallows moved the application be refused and he was seconded by Carolyn Caddick.He said he appreciated the efforts to mitigate against the ski slope but said: \"It cant possibly soften in the long term the impact that this makes on the area.\"Mrs Caddick said: \"We are going to see it for miles and miles around.\"Peter Argyle had moved in favour of the application saying he had faith in the planning officers conditions but was not supported.Mr Brattey said after the vote: \"This was very much the right decision and wed like to congratulate the planning committee for deciding to reject this planning application against the advice of their planning officials.\"We very much hope that common sense will now prevail and that the plans for the Ptarmigan Building will be dropped.\"We are left to wonder just exactly why HIE allowed their tenant to take such a madcap plan all the way to the CNPAs planning committee who were very decisive in their rejection of it.\"He said HIE should ert the pound million to new uplt. \"The hill business requires to be funicular proofed as soon as possible,\" said Mr Brattey.Thursday  Oct  : AM"},{"url":"https://www.strathspey-herald.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04118000/04118063.jpg","title":"Green light for Dalwhinnie quarry work","story":"Gavin MusgroveA quarry operator has said that measures are in place to allay concerns that their excavation plans could lead to a surge in speeding lorries in a Badenoch village.Leithshas been given the green light by the Cairngorms National Park Authorityrsquos planning committee to recommence operations at the site at Carn Dhomhnuill Bhain on the doorstep of Dalwhinnie.The company has said that it is not contingent on winning a contract to supply aggregate to the dualling of the A but that the produce will be used for housebuilding and other local construction projects.The firm was granted temporary permission for  yearsatthe CNPArsquoslatest planning committee meeting at Boat of Garten Community Hall.Production will be stepped up dramatically at the quarry around one mile north of Dalwhinnie by the A.It was previously in operation up to .But now Leiths has permission to extend the site from two to  hectares.

Importantly that means that visitors will be travelling through the Sleat peninsula, where communities have worked long and hard to build up a viable industry.“In the midst of the important debates about ferries and not least the importance of the MV Coruisk to the Armadale-Mallaig crossing, it’s important to celebrate the huge contribution that RET has made to the island economies.”If CalMac#s league tables of ferry route usage tell us anything, it is that moving the MV #Coruisk# from its purpose-built harbours on the busiest crossing in the north-west remains inexplicable.If the two tables of passengers and coaches highlight anything , it is that CalMac badly needs its two new ferries from the Clyde to be delivered according to their revised schedule and not experience a third delay.It is a mild surprise, as Kate Forbes MSP says, to discover that more people sail between Mallaig and Armadale in Skye than between Stornoway and Ullapool and that more coaches cross the Sound of Sleat than make any other journey on CalMac#s itinerary.It is good news not only for Sleat but for the whole of the island. It is good news which is tempered by the fact that this busy, bustling route is now served only by whatever ships CalMac can spare, when the tide permits them, while its purpose-built vessel, the MV #Coruisk#, which can dock at Armadale in all tidal conditions, is ploughing between Mull and Oban  nautical miles away.If CalMac had the ships, Mallaig Armadale would be dependable and therefore even busier, Mull would have a vessel of its own and almost everybody would be happy.CalMac do not have the ships in large part because two new deep-sea vessels which were commissioned in  from Ferguson Marine Engineering at Port Glasgow show no sign of turning up for duty.One of them is due to operate on CalMac#s busiest passenger route between Ardrossan and Arran. The other is to work between Uig, Tarbert and Lochmaddy, which last year carried almost , people.The delivery date for those two ships has been put back twice. On each occasion, the £ million contract to Ferguson Marine — which is the property of one of the Scottish Government#s friends, advisors and allies, the billionaire tax exile Jim McColl — was topped up by a multi-million-pound handout from the public purse.If all was on schedule at least one of those ships would now be in service, and CalMac would have substantially more leeway in manoeuvring its fleet from one part of the west coast to another. They might even be able to keep the #Coruisk# on the Sound of Sleat.They are very far from on schedule. The new Ardrossan Arran ferry is now supposed to be delivered next summer, and the new Uig Tarbert Lochmaddy ship in spring .Will they be delivered  Or will we experience a third delay, which would certainly plunge CalMac into even greater chaos as its ageing fleet breaks down or requires routine maintenance somewhere in the Baltic Those are important questions. As we reported last week, the chief executive of Outer Hebrides Tourism, Rob MacKinnon, has criticised the Scottish Government for a lack of any #tangible action# to address the islands# ferry problems.The Scottish transport ministry, said Mr MacKinnon, must #pursue all feasible options to increase ferry capacity in both the long and the short term for the benefit of both visitors and islanders#.As we report this week, Labour#s Western Isles# candidate Alison MacCorquodale has added her voice to the many demanding to know the precise terms of the private finance initiative deal which has bound the Scottish Government into using just one ferry for all passengers and freight between Ullapool and Stornoway, with unacceptable consequences.Ullapool Stornoway may not yet carry as many tourists as Mallaig Armadale. But it is the definition of a leline service, with , passengers last year, many of whom found themselves unable to squeeze onto an overbooked #Loch Seaforth#.We should be told how and why one of our biggest and most important ferries came to be owned by Lloyds Bank.We should be toldJim McColl is going to deliver two badly-needed ships at the third time of asking.It is not enough to say, as does transport minister Michael Matheson, that building CalMac#s ferries is #providing vital support to our shipbuilding industry#The way things are going, building and rebuilding CalMac#s ferries will keep Scottish shipbuilding alive well into the next decade. Their higher purpose, and Mr Matheson#s job is to provide vital support to the Hebridean ferry service.

Published by LilliputPress, Dublin. Price hardback €. Like Fenianism itself, this book hadmodest beginnings but grew to cover all of Ireland, a good part ofthe globe and half a century. Eva Ó Cathaoir began a study ofFenians in Tipperary which has evolved into one of the mostcomprehensive and important scholarly works on the Irish RepublicanBrotherhood yet published. If the film ‘Black ’ is a storyof revenge set during the Great Hunger, the phenomenon of Fenianismarose to a great extent as a political response to that colossalcrime against the Irish people by the landlord system and the Britishregime. But there was far more involved than simple vengeance.Fenianism was a democratic movement, consciously in the tradition ofthe United Irish leaders of the s, and rejecting privilege andclass distinction. In  the IRB staged the funeral of TerenceBellew McManus and brought many thousands of people onto the streets.The working-class character of the movement was clear from thisdemonstration and the author quotes the following from the haughtysnobs of the ‘KilkennyModerator’, lamenting the absence of the‘great and the good’ from the procession:“When we look back to the O’Connellgatherings or even the Young Ireland ‘Confederation’ assemblies,and remember the array of names, of borough magistrates, professionalmen and traders, accustomed to put forward as representing Kilkennyon such occasions, we cannot but view in the most ludicrous light,this miserable farce of an ‘imposing demonstration.’” The recent visit of the Pope reviveddebate among Irish republicans about the role of the Roman CatholicChurch in Irish politics. This book shows again that, with very fewexceptions, the hierarchy abhorred the IRB for its democratic andrepublican principles and the ‘princes of the Church’ fearedFenian inculcation of their ‘flocks’ with a sense ofindependence, no longer reliant on clerical and aristocratic leadersto guide them. Such guidance had led to catastrophe during the GreatHunger as the passivity preached by Daniel O’Connell and thebishops facilitated the peaceful passage of food out of a starvingcountry.Students of Irish history will befamiliar with the story of the Fenian leadership on both sides of theAtlantic, abortive rebellion and invasion, the internecine disputesand personality clashes. This book recounts all that but it goes muchdeeper. For example it tells of the Fenian women, whose storiessurely need to be rediscovered. They were treated as subordinates bymost of their male comrades but many played important roles. It was atime of deep chauvinism with even otherwise progressive Fenians suchas John Boyle O’Reilly opposing votes for women. The book covers all aspects ofFenianism and a great part of its value is in its first Appendix‘Biographies of Munster and Kilkenny Fenians’ which providesbrief profiles of , rank and file Fenians. I have never beforeseen any ‘Roll of Honour’ of the IRB but this is now providedwith a list of ‘Fenian Casualties -’ while the book closes,appropriately, with a list of Fenian monuments in Ireland andManchester.

For anartist of his stature this was courageous, dependent as he was, tosome extent, on commissions from people who, to say the least, wouldnot be subscribers to our paper. But this was an artist who went hisown way in art and who acted as a citizen with a conscience in anIreland where State-imposed censorship distorted not only politicaldebate but also national self-image. For Robert Ballaghcreative work and active citizenship have gone hand in hand all hisle. This is depicted in his double self-portrait ‘Upstairs No.’,one of the many illustrations of his work in this superbly writtenand beautully presented book. It is not a standard autobiographywith chapters set out in chronological order beginning with genealogyand ending with this week’s news. As you would expect from Ballagh,he takes a dferent approach, starting towards the later years andcircling through his days in no particular order before coming backto the present. More than that, he weaves narrative, anecdote andreflection together seamlessly and conversationally showing a skillwith words akin to his skill with brushes. He has a story to tell ofa very ied le, from his unusual family background to his time asa showband guitar player, through his unorthodox beginning as apainter and his development as an artist and an activist. Withfrankness and clarity he tells us how he learned and matured as anartist and his brief commentaries on many of his works areilluminating both of how they were made and the concepts behind them.It makes the reader want to look again and more intensely at thepictures. The Prologue isessentially a dedication to Robert’s late we Betty, his lelonginspiration, mentor and most important critic. The first chaptertells the harrowing story of how Betty, in her serious illness, wasdisgracefully let down by a healthcare system which basically allowedher to die through neglect, as was admitted in legal proceedings. Butthis does not cast a shadow over the book, as her positive presenceis felt throughout, and is celebrated by the author. These days I rarely getthat urge immediately to re-read a book when I reach the end, but Idid with this one. Thankfully the chapters are so well defined thatthey can be read as stand-alone essays or stories. Take just twoexamples: ‘Who Fears to Speak ofEaster Week’ recounts the tremendous people’s commemoration ofthe  Centenary in which Robert played a central part, aculmination of his activism which has included campaigning againstapartheid, for the Birmingham Six, for artists’ rights, with theIrish National Congress opening border roads, in solidarity withPalestine and as an enthusiastic participant in Féile an Pobail inWest Belfast from its commencement.‘Dining at McDonald’s’is a brilliant critique of the dominant and stultying modernistideology and practise in art and an appeal for an opening up. Ballaghattacks “the notion that the artists’ choice imbues a givenobject with special properties which are tantamount to a metaphysicaltransformation of the object that it ceases to be a pedestrianartefactand becomes,by virtue of the artist’s choice, art”. This ideology leads tothe absurdity of much of the ‘installation’ stuff in galleriesthat baffles all but elitist insiders and, as Ballagh recounts, theclaim by loyalist killer Michael Stone that his attack on Stormontwas a piece of performance art. He argues that the bureaucracies mustset aside this ideology and make galleries more open and democratic .For these views and forhis artistic method and, among some I suspect, for his politics,Ballagh has been frowned upon by certain elites. One prominent figurein the Irish art world said of him with dripping condescension thathe is “not a real artist, he is a mere illustrator”. Typically,Ballagh responded with humour and defiance in a self-portrait wearinga t-shirt saying ‘Fuck the Begrudgers’. I cannot recommend thisbook highly enough. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27482  ","story":"Pearse Doherty: The Interview  Ruairí Doyle“Society is organised in the wrong way - we should not have a housing crisis - what is happening with our children in emergency accommodation is immoral. It is a scandal that we will look back at in twenty years with shame.” - Pearse Doherty TDSinn Féin TD and Finance spokesperson Pearse Doherty has spoken of his origins, his le and how they influence and inform both his political ideology in an extended online interview. He also outlined his vison for a New Ireland that provides achance for people to live, to work and to raise their families without thechronic levels of deprivation and inequality facing so many today. Speaking ahead of Sinn Féin’s Alternative Budget launch nextweek Deputy Doherty laid out his party’s vision “for a new economy for a NewIreland”.The Donegal TD was born in Glasgow and lived with hisparents and five siblings in a one-bedroom flat in Ibrox before the familyed home to Gweedore in Donegal in the ’s. This informed his belief that no matter when someone leftIreland, evenit were  or  years ago, they still have a great sense ofbelonging, of that tangible bond with home “that’s home - you know - Níl aontinteán mar do thinteán féin - that’s their home”, commented Teachta Doherty.Pearse, who has been a TD since , talked about his drivehome when the Dáil wraps up at the week’s end, crossing the border twice on hisway up the winding road to Donegal to his we and four boys. He also gave aninsight into the dficulty of the balance between work and home le, and theunique challenges of being a public representative. The Gaoth Dobhair resident added that it is not solely challengesthat come with being a Teachta Dala. He said: “It is what shapes you and your values. It’s yourexperience - it’s your past experience - it’s your family experience and it’swhat shapes you in Irish society, the people that are around you. The peoplewho influence you and that help shape you and that’s the values that I bring tomy job today as Finance spokesperson for the lead opposition party. It’s thevalues I will bring to the job as Minister for Finance,I am in thatposition.”Sinn Féin regularly faces accusations of employing “fairy-taleeconomics” or “economic illiteracy”.Pearse dismisses these comments as cheap throw-away remarks,designed to stunt political debate. This is a debate that Pearse opines that the establishmentparties do not want because “any fair minded person would see clearly thatthere is a need to build houses, to bring our children out of emergencyaccommodation instead of cutting taxes for the wealthiest in society.”He continued: “Where despite the fact that the three main banks aremaking €. billion in profits every year, they don’t pay any Corporation Taxand some of them won’t pay for the next twenty years.  That’s the debate they don’t want to have.”As Pearse puts it, the Budget is not just about numbers -it’s about our values and ensuring we create a new economy with strong publicservices and shared prosperity where no one is left behind and no child goeswithout.Deputy Doherty said: “Society is organised in the wrong way. We shouldnot have a housing crisis. What is happening with our children in emergencyaccommodation is immoral and it is a scandal that we will look back at intwenty years with shame.  “What is happening in our hospitals is outrageous, in a country thathas the wealth that it does.  “It is just not shared properly and it is not allocated properly andthat isn’t the fault of citizens. That is fault of politicians that decided onBudget day that the resources created by the Irish people are going to beallocated in this way.”Touching on the spectre of Brexit, as a TD for a borderconstituency, Pearse argues that the North of Ireland remaining in the EU andgiven a Special Designated status is the only way to protect people on bothsides, particularly Donegal which is isolated from the rest of the  Counties.Pearse also remarks that “the debate about Irish Unity needs to go toanother level”. He continued: “We are moving, in my view, to a position where we willhave a border poll. Where a majority of people will vote for Irish unity.  “And that will come about because of demographic changes. It will comeabout because Sinn Féin is agitating for it, and other people are recognisingthat it is in their interests that we have an end to the Irish border.”Sinn Féin is not interested in maintaining the status quoand not content to merely “tinker along the edges - where you might get anincrease in public services, an extra few gardaí, an extra few public sectorworkers, a little tax cut here” Pearse Doherty said. This Budget, and every Sinn Féin Budget, would be about our vision fora new Ireland and that vision of an equal and fair society. We would also focuson the political choices that have always been available to create that society one is prepared to make them. Teachta Doherty states in the conclusion of his interview: “Our job isto provide opportunities so that people can live and work at home. We need togive people the opportunity to raise their families at home, so that they canget through le and reach their opportunities and reach their potential athomethat’s what they wish.” test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27483  ","story":" Mary Lou McDonaldPresident of Sinn FéinWe are facing into a politically challenging time.

They must ensure that the British Government cannot renege on their agreement to protect the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts, in the Brexit process.- Mary Lou McDonaldDUP Leader Arlene Foster has called for fundamental changeto the Good Friday Agreement to facilitate Brexit. In other words an agreement endorsed by the majority of people north and south must make way for Brexit, a proposition rejected by a majority in the north. The latest position of the DUP leader lays bare the root of thecrisis in the north. Remember, the DUP opposed the Good Friday Agreement, campaigned for a No vote in that historic referendum and they continue to oppose the Agreement. An Agreement that has underpinned peace for over two decades.They oppose the all Ireland nature of the Agreement, they oppose the rights and safeguards of the agreement and they oppose power-sharing.   to be in them.” The institutions in the north could no-longer bear the weight of this contradiction and collapsed. This was brought to ahead by the continual refusal to implement agreements, opposition to marriage equality, rights to an inquest, an Irish language Act and the financial scandal that is the RHI Cash for Ash scheme.Add to the mix a British Government that has no understanding of Ireland, our economy or our agreements. The Tories are at war with themselves over Brexit and seem intent to bring their own country down with them. This same Tory Government entered into a toxic deal with the DUP to stay in power. That is why there are no institutions in the north, and why the DUP leadership walked away from the deal they had made with Sinn Féin in February this year to get the Assembly up and running.These latest comments by Arlene Foster are a desperate throw of the dice by an increasingly marginalised Unionist leadership. The deal with the Tories will end. Its only legacy will be Brexit. Meanwhile Ireland north and south is changing and a New Ireland is emerging. The joyous revolution of Marriage Equality and Repeal of the Eighth has resonated with a new generation in the north. The largest political demonstration in Belfast is Pride. A magnicent event that celebrates the ersity of identities that make up our communities.Similarly there is a growing demand for access to abortion services. As a placard proudly announced in Dublin Castle when the Repeal result came through, “The North is Next”.Brexit has also unied those who voted to remain within the EU. Brexit will be a disaster for the economy in the north, particularly for agriculture. A community that values prosperity and access to the EU is looking beyond Brexit and Westminster and instead towards Irish Unity. We are facing into a politically challenging time. However it is one which we can and must navigate. The position of the Irish Government and the EU is critical. They must ensure that the British Government cannot renege on their agreement to protect the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts, in the Brexit process.As for Arlene Foster and the DUP - the game is up. If their leadership want the institutions in the north up and working then they must support real power sharing, respect, equality and the rights of others. When this happens Sinn Féin will be a willing partner. Now is the time for political courage, to look forward in the interests of all communities. Meanwhile the debate on Irish unity and a unity referendum grows. I am confident that we can build a New United Ireland, a home for all that share this island. That is the big challenge for our generation. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27484  ","story":"• RUC unleashed an unprovoked attack on the crowd with batons Mícheál Mac DonnchaCivil Rights campaigners in Derry had been pressing for a march in their city which had long been a byword for unionist sectarianism and discrimination.Using gerrymandered electoral boundaries and a corrupt voting system which allowed wealthier citizens to have multiple votes in local elections, the unionists maintained a majority of members on the council in a city with a nationalist majority.Nationalists lived in very poor housing conditions and were affected disproportionately by the % unemployment rate in the city.Unionists had long regarded the old walled town as a citadel that could never be surrendered and their dominance was symbolised by the walls towering over the crumbling th century terraced streets of the nationalist Bogside. The last time nationalists had attempted to hold a parade inside the walls was on St Patrick’s Day  – when they were batoned by the RUC.Housing was a massive issue in Derry and the Derry Housing Action Committeeprovided the focus for leadership as the Civil Rights campaign took off. The DHAC had organised a James Connolly commemoration in the city in July  which was banned by the unionist government.The Northern Ireland Civil Rights Associationagreed to hold a march in Derry on  October. The loyalist Apprentice Boys organisation immediately announced a counter-demonstration with the purpose of forcing the unionist government’s hand to ban the Civil Rights march. But the regime at Stormont did not require forcing because the Home Affairs Minister was ultra-unionist William Craig, who promptly imposed the ban.NICRA held an emergency meeting with the DHAC. Many on the NICRA Executive and some Derry nationalist figures, including John Hume, wanted to cancel the march, but the majority of Derry activists were determined to defy the ban. They won out and the march was to proceed as planned.It was a relatively small march, beginning on Craigavon Bridge with several hundred people. The objective was the Diamond in the city centre.The march was stopped in Duke Street by the RUC. A meeting was held with speakers including Gerry Fitt, Betty Sinclair, Eddie McAteer, Ivan Cooper, Austin Currie and Eamonn McCann. Three Westminster Labour MPs were also present.After the meeting, the marchers found themselves hemmed in on all sides by the RUC. They could not disperse and after a tense stand-off the RUC, oblivious to the presence of TV cameras and photographers, unleashed an unprovoked attack on the crowd with batons, boots and fists. Water cannons were then used.Bernadette Devlin McAliskey, then a young People’s Democracy activist, recalled:“Quite deliberately, they hosed in the upstairs windows and shopfronts, and they went right across Craigavon Bridge, hosing all the onlookers. The police just went mad.”The RUC attack in Duke Street brought the Civil Rights struggle in Ireland to a world audience for the first time. It was a complete eye-opener to many people in the  Counties and in Britain. But most profound was its effect on young nationalists.Derry man Mickey Devine , the last of the ten Hunger Strikers to die in the H-Blocks of Long Kesh in , recalled:“Like every young person in Derry, my whole way of thinking was tossed upside down by the events of  October . I didn’t even know there was a Civil Rights march I saw it on television.“But that night I was down the town smashing shop windows and stoning the RUC. I developed an intense hatred of the RUC. As a child I had always known not to talk to them or to have anything to do with them, but this was dferent.The RUC attacked the Civil Rights march in Duke Street, Derry, on  October .test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27485  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonThe past cannot be changed, nor can our shared hurt, suffering and pain be undone. While there may never be agreement on the ious contested narratives of the past, these must all be respected and acknowledged.- Declan KearneyThis week the NIO consultation on dealing with the legacy of thepast in the north of Ireland closed.It will inform a legislative process and bringforward future legacy legislation.Failure to deal with the past remains one of the most signicantimpediments to political progress here.It is a barrier to the development of a comprehensivereconciliation and healing process in this society.British state policy has been the primary factor in preventinglegacy issues from being addressed or resolved.Powerful sections of the British military and intelligence systemhave never embraced the peace process. They remain psychologically andpolitically locked into a conflict mind-set even twenty years after the GoodFriday Agreement was signed.The role of British State forces and their agents, a refusal toacknowledge and be accountable for their actions, combined with a disregard forsuccessive binding court rulings, has defined the British state’s approach tolegacy matters.That has been reinforced in recent times by a cynical and narrative, including interventions by the British Prime Minister Theresa May,and British Secretary of State in the north, Karen Bradley, to suggest thatonly state forces were being made subject to legacy investigations.These statements are offensive and wrong, and are an egregiousdemonstration of the partisan nature of British policy towards dealing with thepast.They are consistent with the British practice of denying wrongdoing, concealing the truth, and preventing accountability.This poses a major challenge to ensuring that a robust,independent, and impartial facilitation of the legislative process will emergefrom this consultation on addressing the legacy of the past.All sides suffered, and caused suffering to each other during theconflict.There are multiple narratives regarding our tragic past. There isno single narrative despite the attempts of the British state and politicalunionism to assert otherwise.The past cannot be changed, nor can our shared hurt, suffering andpain be undone. While there may never be agreement on the ious contestednarratives of the past, these must all be respected and acknowledged.The Stormont House Agreement, , , set out an agreedframework of legacy mechanisms which provided an unprecedented opportunity tocomprehensively deal with the past in all its aspects.Subsequent draft legislation reneged on the British government’sobligations under the SHA by introducing a national security veto, which hadthe effect of blocking a way forward on the issue of legacy.Full implementation of the SHA on a human rights compliant basispresents the best opportunity to deal with the legacy of our past and guaranteea framework which is victim centred.Facilitation of any future legislative process will require thatthe British government must ensure all victims are treated with equality,respect and dignity that the legislation reflects the policy intent of theAgreement and, that the legacy architecture is fully independent, human rightscompliant, and properly resourced and funded.The following key principles should be central to the operation offuture legacy legislation and mechanisms.-          Allprocesses should be victim centred-          Allprocesses must secure the co-operation of all relevant parties to ensuresuccess-          Allprocesses should be based upon equality, respect, and dignity-          Allprocesses must be free from political interference and be absolutelyindependent-         Acknowledgement should be central to the operation of the legacy framework-          The aim ofthat framework should be to enable reconciliation and healing within widersocietyIf there is to be a collective and comprehensive engagement withthe past in a human rights compliant manner, there can be no hierarchy ofvictimhood or humanity.There must be no change to the definition of a victim.High-quality services should be provided to all victims at thepoint of need.This should extend to the immediate provision of a pension for allseriously and psychologically injured during the conflict.The British Government should also immediately release therequired funding to resource the Lord Chief Justice’s inquest plan, as aseparate distinct process from any new legacy mechanisms.The Office of the Police Ombudsman should be adequately andimmediately resourced.Any attempt by the British state to introduce a statute oflimitations to protect its forces and agents would be a violation of the SHA and must be opposed.Full participation and unfettered disclosure by British stateforces and its agents with the legacy mechanisms will be essential to achievefull public confidence in their ability to deliver on behalf of all society.Periodic reviews should be carried out to inform the extent offunding requirements and necessary timeframe, for all legacy mechanisms.Legacy processes should not be limited or impeded by closedmaterial proceedings. In addition, for future legacy mechanisms toasintended, it is essential families are given full access to legal aid.The legacy legislation which ultimately emerges from theconsultation must comply with the policy intent of the SHA by:-          Promotingreconciliation-          Upholdingthe rule of law-         Acknowledging and addressing the suffering of all victims and survivors-         Facilitating the pursuit of justice and information recovery-          Beinghuman rights compliant-          Beingbalanced, proportionate, transparent, accountable, fair, and equalThe full implementation of that Agreement representsthe best potential and opportunity to address the legacy of our politicalconflict and the suffering experienced by everyone during the conflict inIreland, Britain and beyond. So, it is now time to finally deal with the past.  It is time tobuild for the future.

permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic norms, social modernity, political integrity, and standards in public office”Ive been wondering lately whether anyone in Democratic Unionist Partyleadership circles actually try to reflect upon what republicans, nationalists, and other progressive minded citizens think about the current political situation.Do they even care what others think The evidence suggests not.Several days ago the DUP leader pronounced that her party could and would change the Good Friday Agreementat a whim. There was no hint of irony in her claim – the DUP has spent the last  years opposing the GFA, ever since it was signed.In another extraordinary, but not untypical, outburst she declared her blood red line position on Brexit and, that in the same week as the consultation on dealing with the past was concluding!Of course the DUP leader, and other key figures have form in making offensive and provocative political interventions.Her dehumanising description of republicans as \"crocodiles\" in  comes to mind.Notably, she previously called republican and nationalist Ministers in a ing Executive ‘rogues and renegades.Only the DUP knows whether this leader is naturally predisposed to being rhetorically gaffe prone, or is being deliberately offensive.Perhaps some figures in the DUP do think about wider opinion: the DUP is not a monolith after all.But, those currently in charge of the DUP have turned away from power sharing.  They oppose equality and rights, and reject reconciliation.Instead they have chosen to join forces with the extremists in the British Tory party to help steer the Brexit train wreck.The DUP leadership is living in a delusional bubble.Meanwhile, the party brand has become indistinguishable from the financial scandals of recent years such as Red Sky, NAMA, Brexit dark money, and financial relationships with Sri Lanka.The ongoing RHI inquiry exposé of how the DUP behaved in government makes a complete mockery of its purported adherence to good governance’.The party MPs have become power drunk through their pact with the Tories, and a serious misconception that they are king makers in Westminster.  Edward Carsons cautionary words have clearly been forgotten or disregarded.  He warnedWhat a fool I was.  I was only a puppet, and so was Ulster… in the political game that was to get the Conservative party into power.’ The DUP has a tactical approach towards everything including maintaining the status quo on its own terms, slowing down and frustrating progressive societal change, and maintaining sectarian dominance within the unionist constituency.The DUP leadership is permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic norms, social modernity, political integrity, and standards in public office.  Its inability and refusal to embrace dference or celebrate ersity is reflected in an institutionalised bigotry against, and intolerance towards the Irish national identity and cultural traditions, and LGBT rights.The partys contempt and sharp practice in government has destroyed wider public confidence in the political institutions, and led to the decisive tipping point of RHI and withdrawal of the Líofa grant scheme in the winter of .As a result of its ingrained arrogance and lack of political humility the DUP leadership is constantly in denial about how society in Ireland views its sectarianism, homophobia, and toxic pact with the Tories.The overwhelming majority of republicans, nationalists, and many others, including sections of civic unionism, do not believe the DUP is serious about restoring genuine power sharing. These citizens want the institutions to be restored, but not at the risk of allowing the DUP to continue practicing discrimination, disrespect, intimidation, bigotry, and sharp practice. They will not be giving the DUP permission to get back into power on that basis.  And, neither will Sinn Féin.The DUPs behaviour, and the onslaught of Brexit have together brought back graphically into focus the denial of rights which resulted in the Civil Rights Movement fty years ago.A generational realignment has occurred within northern nationalism.Acht Gaeilge, marriage equality, womens reproductive health rights, legacy justice rights, and the demand for a Bill of Rights are the modern day acid test equivalents of one person, one vote.  The current crisis in the north of Ireland is the visceral culmination of  years of DUP push back against the GFA.Intoxicated with its imaginary power at Westminster, the DUP leadership has finally over played its hand. The political institutions could have been re-established by the th February last, but the DUP leaders walked out of negotiations.Instead of selling the deal which they negotiated in February with Sinn Féin, the DUP leader, deputy leader, party chief executive, and its senior talks team bottled out.Since then the party has been convulsed with the resultant internal fall out.  There has been no meaningful contact with Sinn Féin, and absolutely no willingness demonstrated to resume negotiations.Any advocacy of blood red lines is a total anathema to democracy.The wider nationalist constituency is fed up to the back teeth with the subversion of the political process by the DUP, the British Tory government and others in political unionism.It is more impatient than ever for equality, rights and parity of esteem.  The history of  is being replayed. Thousands marching from Duke Street in Derry city on Saturday th October to mark the iconic civil rights march  years before is the latest example of that.  An exciting momentum for change is taking place across Ireland, north and south.  Old orthodoxies are being eclipsed by discussions about new, modern, all-Ireland constitutional and political arrangements. The permanent unionist electoral majority is gone and demographic changes are irreversible.All of this puts the onus back upon both governments to act decisively to address the denial of rights.The Irish government needs to take the lead because for now the DUP has this British government over a barrel.  But thats a short-term situation.  A British general election in the immediate to mid term cannot be ruled out.A new political discourse has begun about the future. All sections of society need to be involved in this and the unionist is critical in all of this.Brexit, the GFA, citizens rights, and an Irish unity referendum are central to that. Progressives should explore common ground and alliances for change.Republicans and unionists need to start to face the same way.  We have to begin looking at each other through eyes of the future.The benchmarks of a rights-based society guaranteeing civil and religious liberties and equality for all, are set.  These are not negotiable.So, whoever is actually in charge of the DUP for the time being has a lot of serious thinking to do...Who now leads the DUP  Do they have the authority to negotiate and stick to an agreement Are they committed to a shared future with republicans, nationalists, and others in the north Unless, and until the DUP can clearly answer these questions for the rest of society, it will remain exactly where it is now – out of power, and facing the inevitable fate about which Carson warned: getting dumped by the British Tories.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27487  ","story":" Mícheál Mac DonnchaThe Liberal Party was in government in Britain and had introduced the Home Rule Bill with the support of the Irish nationalist MPs in Westminster.

Leading members of the British landed aristocracy, capitalists and senior military figures jumped on the bandwagon and backed up Unionist leader Edward Carson with threats of civil warHome Rule was brought in.Amidst the political frenzy there were very few Protestants in Ulster who were prepared to oppose Carsonism.

A minister of the Presbyterian Church, Armour stood out from most of his co-religionists in advocating self-government for Ireland. In , he opposed a resolution at the Presbyterian General Assembly condemning Gladstone’s second Home Rule Bill. He was also a strong critic of landlordism.In , he again opposed a resolution against Home Rule at the Presbyterian General Assembly.Calling for freedom of conscience for Protestants to support or oppose Home Rule, Armour slammed the intolerance of Carsonism when he told the assembly:“If you deny the right of private judgment and of free speech, how much do you have of Protestantism worth keeping  Nothing at all.”Armour organised a public meeting of Protestants in Ballymoney to support Home Rule and oppose Carsonism. Banners in the hall proclaimed “No provisional or provincial government for us” and “Ulster for Ireland and Ireland for us”.The resolution stated that the meeting of Protestants of Ballymoney and the protests in The Route“against the claim of Sir Edward Carson and the self-constituted Provisional Government of Ulster to represent the Protestant community of north-east Ulster” and “disputes the narrow claim that dferences of creed necessarily separate Irishmen and women into hostile camps”. Among the speakers at the Ballymoney meeting were JB Armour himself, historian Alice Stopford Green, Jack White, son of a British Army general and later a leading figure in the Irish Citizen Army, and Roger Casement, who was executed in . This was Casement’s first appearance on a political . With his Antrim family background, Casement regarded the occasion as hugely signicant and in his speech he denounced any notion of partitioning Ireland. The meeting was a once-off and failed to turn the tide of Carsonism but it did show that a signicant minority of Protestants in the North-East were still prepared to stand up for Irish unity and self-government. The meeting of Protestants in Ballymoney in support of Irish self-government was held on  October ,  years ago this week. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/200/2018/AP-New-top-side-logo.jpg","title":"27489  ","story":" Michael McMonagleThirty years ago today the British government, fearful of the growth of Sinn Féin, introduced the broadcasting ban to stop Sinn Féin representatives being heard on television and radio. The ban was introduced by the British governments Home Secretary, Douglas Hurd on October , . The ban was brought in an attempt to halt the growth of Sinn Féin in the north and to prevent a wider audience hearing a republican analysis of the ongoing conflict at the time. It prevented Sinn Féin representatives from appearing on television and radio interviews. When it was first introduced many broadcasters were unsure of how it should be implemented and effectively blocked all republicans from the broadcast media, even those who were not members of Sinn Féin. Broadcasters and journalists unions disliked the ban because of the disruption it caused and some sought ways to get around it, the most well known being the actors voice compromise where actors were brought in to speak the words of Sinn Féin representatives. This led to the bizarre situation where viewers could see Sinn Féin representatives on their screens but could not hear their voices. Several actors who went on to have successful stage and screen careers started out by providing the voices for Gerry Adams, Martin McGuinness and others. Of course, this was not the first time Sinn Féin representatives had been banned from the airwaves the Irish government used a similar tactic  years earlier. Section  of the Broadcasting Act, introduced in , banned Sinn Féin representatives from the media.

For some time now I have been concerned about the Council’s policies when it comes to the employment of agency workers.“In order to establish the facts last month I tabled a series of questions to the Council which have done little to remove my fears that agency staff are getting a raw deal from Mid and East Antrim Council.I have established that although  agency staff are employed by the council not one has transferred to become council staff in the past year.Councillor McDonald continued: One of the agencies used by the council charges % of annual salary as a feean agency worker becomes a member of council staff proper.“The averageof time an agency worker has been employed by the council is . years with one agency worker employed for  years and pound. million has been spent on agency workers in the year   - an average weekly cost of pound,.“The council could not advise me how much of that weekly cost of pound, ends up in the pockets of workers and how much of it is taken by the agencies. “Mid and East Antrim Council recently hired three new directors.They didn’t go to agencies to get them.He added: “I am concerned that staff are receiving a raw deal from these arrangements.While agency work doubtless suites the needs of both the council and the employee in some cases I know that there are many agency workers who would welcome the additional benefits and security which would come with obtaining a position with the council proper.With the average agency worker in post for almost three years it is clear that many have been providing invaluable service to the council with no need to swap and change employees.  “I believe the people of Mid and East Antrim want to see happy staff paid as they should be with the proper security of employment we would like for ourselves and our families.I will continue to press this issue from within the council chamber and committees.”Council statement A spokesperson from Mid and East Antrim Council said: Mid and East Antrim Borough Council is a multi-award winning council with a reputation for innovation, dynamism and leadership at a regional level.“Since the creation of the new council in , our entire team at Mid and East Antrim has had a truly transformational impact in creating what is now widely regarded as one of region’s best-performing councils, across many areas.“We continue to lead the way as Northern Irelands top performing council for planning and the achieving of job targets for business start-ups, and currently rank second out of all  councils in the region in relation to the percentage of household waste sent for recycling. “Like all Northern Ireland councils, we are continuing to deliver the transformation of local government structures and ensuring our organisation is best fit for purpose, working closely with our elected members and trade unions.“The use of agency staff is often the most effective solution to ensuring the delivery of essential services, particularly during periods of short-term upsurges in workload. “However, we expect that the use of agency workers covering these type of posts on a temporary basis will reduce, moving forward.”  "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_1106582.jpg--.jpg?1540373104000\n","title":"allen s meats moves to larger premises in cullybackey","story":"AFTER  years serving the people of Ahoghill Allens Meats has moved to larger premises to meet the demands of the growing business.The butchers shop has relocated to Cullybackey to take over the former Lamont Butchers at  Main Street in the village.Allens Meats needed to acquire larger premises and decided to make the move to Cullybackey after David Lamont retired.Lamont Butchers has been based in Cullybackey since  and Derek Allen and his team will continue to provide the same excellent customer service and top quality produce.Derek said: “The business is growing and we needed more space to enable us to offer a wider range of products.“We would like to thank all our customers in Ahoghill for their support over the last  years.

Founded in , VisPa is run by local Kenyan staff. The charity has an orphanage, a nursery, a primary school and a secondary school which care for and educate almost  children every year, as well as supporting young people through university. The aim of the Everest trek was to raise funds for a new Primary School at Vispa Emmanuel School and Orphanage in Kisumu, Kenya, which will benefit over  needy children from that area.Arriving at the base camp is no easy achievement.Richard and the team took several days to trek and had to overcome many dficult journeys while adjusting to the ever changing altitude pressures along the way.Their first big ascent was to ,ft for the stunning views of the surrounding peaks.Getting up to this height gave their bodies the chance they needed to acclimatize to the low levels of oxygen, which helped prepare them for their destination of Everest Base Camp a few days later.After taking some rest, the team trekked to Lobuche .The trail from Tukla started steeply to climb up beside the glacier moraine. However, after a six hour trek they arrived tired, but safely at Lobuche.Rest and recovery was key in the mission, however most days started early and included long periods of walking, often along tricky terrain.The next main trek was to Gorak Shep which took three hours to complete. After taking a short break they were off again for a further four to five hours to reach their destination of Everest Base Camp.Finally reaching the Everest Base Camp at ,ft was a huge achievement.The team were able to get up close and personal with the highest mountain on earth and were able to go to the edge of the icefall, and see the start of the climbing route up Mount Everest and Lhotse before making their way back to Gorak Shep to stay the night.They then started the ascent of Kala Pattar to see a beautul sunrise view of Everest and the Khumbu icefall. They then ed to Pheriche for the night before they started their final descent.Congratulations!Speaking on social media, Friends of Vispa said the achievement was: “Absolutely amazing! Praise God! So proud of every member of the team who took part in this challenge! WELL DONE!“This great achievement by the team will change the lives of many children at Vispa School and Orphange, Kenya.”Richard’s we, local music teacher Sylvia Burnside, has also been involved with the Friends of Vispa charity.Over the Summer, she travelled to Kenya and to the Emmanuel School to do music and singing with the children there.With a big heart for the children, Sylvia said: “I’m so very proud of Richard for completing this challenge.“He’s always been a great support to me and has stayed at home to let me go to Kenya and do music with the children.“So now that it’s his turn, I’m so proud of what he has achieved.”Friends of Vispa is committed to putting Christian faith into action in the provision of education, food, clothing, healthcare and spiritual guidance to highly vulnerable children and young people in Kenya .If you would like to donate to the Everest challenge, please go to the Just Giving page: www.justgiving campaign vistaeverest "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_1104319.jpg--.jpg?1540283951000\n","title":"remembering the 1978 vumba massacre","story":"FORTY years have passed since the Vumba Massacre in former Rhodesia which resulted in the death of  Elim missionaries including Cullybackey man Roy Lynn, his we and their three week old baby.Royand Joyce Lynnand their daughter Pamela were killed by Rhodesian black nationalist guerrillas at the Eagle School in Vumba on June , .Twelve people died in the brutal attack, including four children, whilst one missionary was found alive but sadly passed away in hospital six days later.In tribute to the “martyrs of Rhodesia” performing arts expert Richard Hasnip has written a moving play which is being showcased across Elim churches this year. The play is part of a collaboration with Elim Sound and Elim International Missions entitled A Call to Mission which includes worship, preaching and drama.A Call to Mission took place at Cullybackey Elim Church on October  which remembered the  missionaries who lost their lives including Roy Lynn and his family.The event is part of a special tribute to mark the th anniversary of the massacre which shocked the world.General Superintendent Elim Pentecostal Churches, Chris Cartwright said: “Ordinary people, some single, others married with small children, from Elim churches all over the UK and Ireland obeyed the call of God to serve people of that stre-torn land. They were motivated not by politics or the rights and wrongs of the cause, but by the cause of Christ. “They served primarily as medics, nurses, teachers and educators. They started small fellowships, taught the scriptures and helped and encouraged local indigenous churches.”Robert JohnLynn , the eldest of four children studied at Ballymena Technical College and worked as an apprentice motor mechanic at General Motors. Roy, along with his siblings and parents, attended Trinity Presbyterian Church in Ahoghill. With some of his young friends he enjoyed the fellowship at Cullybackey Elim Pentecostal Church and it was from there he left to study at Elim Bible College in Capel, Surrey.Following college Roy was inducted as the pastor of Brookeborough Elim Church and in  he responded to the request of Elim International Missions to travel to Rhodesia to help at Katerere Mission Station.It was at Katerere that Roy met the young woman that was later to become his we, Joyce Pickering from York. Roy married Joyce, a highly skilled nurse and midwe, in the UK on July , .During this time Rhodesia was in conflict and the situation was becoming increasingly more dangerous. Despite this every one of the Elim missionaries bravely and unstintingly opted to stay in Rhodesia to continue with their work. It was agreed, however, that they would move from Katerere to Vumba on July ,  as a safety precaution.Whilst there, Joyce Lynn opened four clinics in nearby areas while her husband Roy preached and ministered to the men. The couples daughter, Pamela Grace, was born on June , , just three weeks before her tragic death. She was killed along with her parents and  others when a group of about  Rhodesian black nationalist guerillas turned up at the school. The murders took place after the guerrillas had given political talks to  pupils.Roys brother Geoffrey first heard about their deaths the day after the massacre when a man from their local church conveyed the news to him.In tribute to all those who died in the Vumba Massacre a memorial garden has been opened at Elims headquarters in Malvern.Pastor Chris Cartwright said: “For many who visit the garden, they will know something of the events that happened on June , . It is very much part of a deeply ‘personal’ Elim story and certainly a story that the immediate families of the missionaries will vividly remember.”It is in memory of Peterand SandraMcCann their children Philipand SharonPhilipand Susanna Evansand Rebecca EvansRoyand JoyceLynn and Pamela GraceWendy WhiteCatherine Pickenand Mary Fisher who died on June , .

Now the proud pilot of an Easyjet airbus , Alex, , graduated from Oxford Aviation Academy earlier this year and is based in Venice.She lives with her Italian boyfriend Edgar, whom she met during her pilot training.It has been  years since Alex left her home in Waringstown at the age of  to start a new le in Canada.The move came about after her mum Alison – a flight attendant for many years – married a Canadian pilot whom she met on her travels. They married in  and the family now live in Kitchener, Ontario, roughly an hour outside Toronto. Inspired by her step-dad Doug Glussich, Alex gained her full private pilot’s licence, her first step towards her dream of becoming a commercial pilot.She said: “Mum was a flight attendant so I was kind of exposed to flying from an early age, but it was when I met my step-dad that I first thought that maybe I could be a pilot.”She admitted that having realised her dream, it was not all plain sailing given that her profession is male-dominated: “I’m based in Venice with EasyJet. I’m the only female first officer and there’s also a female captain. “There’s just the two females out of -strong flight crew.” She said: “I do think things are going in the right direction, especially with EasyJet. They have a scholarship called the Amy Johnson initiative which offers fully paid flight training to females who they pick. “They are trying to drive more females into it, but it is a slow process.” Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"She added: “It can sometimes be challenging. You feel you have to prove your worth.“A lot of the males, the captains, are very good. They take the sex out of it. If you’re a good pilot, your a good pilot – end of story.“Through training I felt that I had to be a little bit better than the boys because I’m a girl.“I have unfortunately encountered a few negative comments, not from any co-workers, but from passengers. It’s been especially from older male passengers when they see a female pilot sitting in the cockpit they things like, ‘maybe I’d be safer getting a dferent flight’. It’s said in jokey way, they’re from a dferent time, but I don’t like hearing it because to me being a pilot is not a joke.“I’ve only had two or three of those comments, it’s not a regular thing.”Talking about the longevity of a career as a pilot, Alex said: “Pilot retirement age is  simply for medical reasons. You have medicals once a year until you get to over , then your medicals come once every six months.”She said: “I’m very settled where I am for now. EasyJet is a fantactic company, they really look after their employees, the money is good, the benefits are good. “To start your career flying an Airbus  is fabulous – it’s one of the best jets around.“However I’ve always had my sights on going long haul. I’d love to try the Boeing ‘triple sevens’, or the s or even the Airbus s, because the bigger the better, right “Before my career ends I would definitely like to try a bigger jet.”She continued@ “The longest flight I’m doing now is from Venice to Edinburgh. It’s two and half hours but from October we’ll be doing Lanzarote and Tel Aviv – those will be three and half hours each.“The Airbus that I fly now simply wouldn’t have the mileage to do more than seven hours. To do that I’d have to go to a bigger airbus – a , or to the Boeing .”Going back to her first time on board an airplane, Alex said: “The first time I was on a commercial aircraft was when I was four years old. I was going to Lanzarote with my parents and brother. “I was really excited. The noise was a bit frightening, but I loved the speed of the take off. “Back in those days you were still allowed to visit the pilots in the flight deck, so my brother and I went up with a flight attendant and I remember wondering what all the buttons were for.”Alex is now pleased to offer the same opportunities to children: “After we land we’ll have young boys and girls coming in to the cockpit. They give you so much respect, and are so interested. “If I could give any advice to the girls out there thinking of becoming a pilot, I’d say go for it.”The reassuring tone of a pilot is something that goes hand-in-hand with air travel, but are the men and women in the cockpit putting on a special voice to talk to passengers or is it their actual demeanour Alex explained: “They say everybody has a PA voice, they just want to sound as professional as they can. When I speak on board, I don’t want to come on with a really thick Northern Irish accent because nobody will understand me. It’s about clarity and getting the message across.”She added: “Pilots don’t only do medical testing. We do psychoanalysis testing. Pilots are calm. It’s in our nature. If a bad situation occurs we need to be able to handle it quickly and efficiently.“They’re not faking the voice, that’s their personality and how they are. That’s why they’re pilots.”Of her own journey she said: “Training was loads of hard work. My programme with Oxford was  months. It’s non-stop.“You have to say goodbye to your social le, but what’s  months in the grand scheme of things.“As a pilot, I’m quite happy to be a passenger. We work hard so it’s nice for me to let someone  fly. I’m completely as ease because I know the training the pilots have been through.”Talking of the most challenging manoeuvres she has had to carry out, Alex said: “When we went to Oxford we had to do upset recovery training. “We went into an aerobatic aircraft which is designed to be able to do all sorts of manoeuvres. “They put us into barrel rolls, spiral es. “Because we’re flying the big jets it’s very unlikely they will be able to get into a spiral e because computer systems have protection it wouldn’t let you. “However we always have to think of worst case scenariothese protections failed.”She commented: “In high school my strong subjects were maths and physics, when it comes to the theory behind flying I didn’t find it too overwhelming.“To get to spin an aircraft is a lot of fun. I feel like I’m in the red arrows.“I’ve been in planes from a young age. “It’s second nature to me, I don’t even flinch at it.”But what of those people who more than flinch at the prospect of air travel Alex said: “EasyJet actually do have a programme from Luton once a year where they take nervous fliers up on a free flight. “They have two pilots up front and two pilots in the cabin with the passengers explaining to them step-by-step from the take off to the landing what is happening and what are the noises you hear.“I can promise you this,it was completely dangerous I wouldn’t be doing it every day. “I think it’s fear of the unknown that makes people afraid.”Askedthere was training in place to deal with terrorist attacks, Alex said: “We do hijack training. We’re trainedanything were to happen we’re able to send out a squawk code which sends a message directly to Air Traffic Control.“Even everyday stuff – before we push back for the taxi until we get to the gate – the cockpit door is closed and will only be open for examplewe need to go to the bathroom. “We need to call cabin crew and they need to come to guard the doorwe have to leave the cockpit. “We take measures to ensure the cockpit door will not be breached. It’s also bulletproof. They’ve changed everything since  .”She explained how she came to be stationed in Italy: “The reason why I’m in Venice is because I met an Italian called Edgar during the training.”Alex and Edgar, , who is from Milan, soon became an item.She said: “Towards the end of our course we were able to say where we wanted to go. Edgar and I said we don’t mind where we’re placed but we’d like to be together. They put us both in Venice.“I’m still struggling a bit with the language – Italian has a lot of grammar in it. To get by I know the basics. It’s great to have an Italian speaker with me, in Italy a lot of places are remote and they don’t speak English.”Asked how much they see of each other, Alex said: “For the first year with EasyJet you’re on a flexi-roster so you can be working for three days then have two days off. “Sometimes we’re on completely opposite shts. He could be starting at am and I can be on lates working pm to midnight. Sometimes we’ll just see each other in the crew room, say hello and that’s it. “Some weeks you pass each other but others we get time off together when we can do whatever we want. It’s part of the job.”Alex said she also tried to go back to Waringstown as much as possible to visit relatives."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8670196.1539680805!/image/image.jpg","title":"council rolls out 2018 enterprise week activities","story":"With this year#s Enterprise Week rolling out from November  to , businesses and entrepreneurs across the borough of Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon are being urged to be part of this enterprising initiative.Spearheaded by Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council and sponsored by Bank of Ireland, the week-long programme will see a range of inspirational and informative events take place across the borough, demonstrating council’s commitment to nurturing and developing the local economy.

Myself and other volunteers would prepare Sunday dinner, talk to those using the centre, after the centre moved to Divis we still take it in turns to prepare, serve and wash up after Sunday dinner.“I asked the Bishop and he has agreed for me to start a new chaplaincy to the homeless and the idea of that is to find out what the spiritual needs of the homeless are and I really want to take the lead on that. As a deacon we are available to go to wake houses, visit with the sick and assist at the altar.”The -year-old described the ordination ceremony on Sunday as one he “enjoyed every minute of”.“I have a lot of friends who are Presbyterian, Protestants and everyone said how much they enjoyed it too, that they had never seen anything like it in their lives. There were four Bishops there and beautul music from Louis McVeigh, the Cathedral was packed and we had a ball. It lashed all day Saturday and the sun came out on Sunday, it was great after four years to finally get it done.”Gregory – whose first job at  was selling the Andersonstown News around the Norfolk area – said the deacons intend to make a really good dference in their parishes and act “as an extra pair of hands across a iety of ministries”.“In my view, the homeless, the poor, the sick, whether mentally or physically are the aristocracy of the Church and I say that word very deliberately. Pope Francis is saying it all the time now.“We have got to take people seriously when they lose someone, whether they are aged  to  in terms of their grief, give our resources, our time, this is what the Church is for.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"sailortown tribute","story":"A TRIBUTE afternoon is to take place in Sailortown this weekend to remember two men who died in a UVF sectarian shooting,  years ago.Gerard ‘Coke’ Grogan,  and Thomas ‘Tucker’ Osborne,  were killed in the shooting at their workplace, Casey’s Bottling Plant in Millfield on October , . Marie McGrattanand Frances Donnelly , daughters of the owner Sam Casey, were also murdered in the incident.On Sunday afternoon, a commemorative plaque will be erected at St Joseph’s Church in Sailortown at pm in memory of Gerard and Thomas who grew up in the area.A tribute book of testimonies from family members and friends will then be launched in the Mission to Seafarers Centre.The book, entitled ‘Ifs and Buts and the Toss of a Coin’ is a collection of humble and human stories about Thomas and Gerard as told by their friends and heartbroken family members.Brian Quinn, who has helped organised the event with the Docksiders Senior Men’s Group and friends of Thomas and Gerard, is hoping Sunday will be a fitting tribute.“It will be a nice day. We are pleased that  years after their brutal murders they will be publicly recognised in a respectful way.“Thomas and Gerard’s friends were all around the same age, lived a few streets apart, schooled together, worked together and in a special childhood bond, both were baptised in St Joseph’s Church.“We never got the chance to grow old with Thomas and Gerard. The least we can do now is to pay proper respect and where better to site the tribute than St Joseph’s in Sailortown.”The book also includes a tribute story to StephenBegley who is widely regarded as the fth victim of the Casey’s atrocity.

For too long they have been treated as second-class citizens, with women and girls denied healthcare in breach of their human rights.“This amendment is a signicant step forward on the path to equality, holding Westminster accountable for monitoring and addressing these issues, and giving guidance to civil servants in Northern Ireland on the issue of abortion.NC - Stella Creasy and Conor McGinns amendment forcing the government to take responsibility for the ban on abortion and equal marriage in Northern Ireland PASSES.  - .

I fear that it does.”The legislation will give civil servants greater clarity over what decisions they can take in the ongoing absence of ministers enable UK Government ministers to make a number of stalled public appointments and remove a standing obligation on Mrs Bradley to call another snap Assembly election.The Bill later received a third reading and will undergo further scrutiny in the Lords."},{"url":null,"title":"chinabuilt titanic ii to set sail in","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeRHI ScandalBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHomes  InteriorsSeptember CarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The company behind the plan, Blue Star Line, said the new ship will include all the latest safety and technical equipment to make it fit for the st Century seas. Originally the Titanic was owned by the White Star Line.Reports claim there will be nine decks and  staterooms that can accommodate , passengers and  crew members, the same as the Belfast original.First, second, and third class tickets will be available, just like the original and there will be a swimming pool, gymnasiums, and Turkish bath.However, the engines will be diesel-powered rather than coal fired but the iconic smoke stacks will remain. Clive Palmer, the Autralian business man behind the project said the maiden voyage will take travellers from Southampton to New York on the same route as the ill-fated  voyage. Then it will cruise around the world from Dubai hoping to \"enchant\" passengers with the style of the old world mixed with the new.It has been rumoured the ship will first lt anchor in , however, the company has said it is still in the early stages of planning and due diligence for the plan. “Millions have dreamt of sailing on her, seeing her in port and experiencing her unique majesty. Titanic II will be the ship where those dreams come true,” Clive Palmer said, thereported. A computer generated graphic of the new Titanic II.“The ship will follow the original journey, carrying passengers from Southampton to New York, but she will also circumnavigate the globe, inspiring and enchanting people while attracting unrivalled attention, intrigue and mystery in every port she visits.\"Speculation over the project has gathered pace over recent weeks after a series of announcements from Blue Star Line. On Tuesday it announced it would base its European office in Paris as opposed to London which will open in March .The photograph shows bodies in sacks piled three high on the deck of the CS Mackay Bennett, before being tipped overboard as the ships priest conducts a service. Photo issued by Henry Aldridge and Son.“It is of little use having a European headquarters outside Europe,’’ Mr Palmer said.Mr Palmer confirmed discussions were underway between project’s World Director and suppliers and consultants world-wide to get Titanic II underway as soon as possible.And last week the company announced the appointment of a European director - who had originally been part of the project in  - for the project who will be responsible for commercial negotiations, recruitment and training for Titanic II, the company said. At the end of September, the company released a new technical specications update in a YouTube video. Palmer was a former elected member of the Australian parliament and has announced he is standing again for election under the slogan \"Make Australia Great Again\". He has a dinosaur theme park in Australia and the Titanic project plan has been described as his \"pet project\". A second Titanic II is also being built in a theme park in China. However it will remain docked and not take on sailings.

A number of openings in the glasshouses were also repaired with broken panes replaced.Consultants have been appointed to conduct a series of studies at the forest park and in addition to the Arboretum and Annesley Garden, have been focusing on the parkrsquos bioersity and built heritage, traffic and car parking as part of the funding application process.Earlier this year, a study highlighted a wider entrance to the sprawling forest park and the development of an interpretative centre beside the Walled Garden.Council officials say that while they recognise the parkrsquos undoubted heritage signicance, parts of it require investment to preserve and help promote an area which has ldquoexceptional tourism and recreational potential.Initial restoration work will focus on the -acre walled garden which is at the centre of the acclaimed arboretum, Bothy Yard and pathways which wind their way through the Rhododendron Wood..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Beaches among top with bathing water in Europe  ","story":"FOUR local beaches continue to enjoy some of the best bathing water quality in Europe, it has been revealed.Kilclief, Ballyhornan, Tyrella and Murlough are among a group of  beaches which have come top of the excellent water quality class, but it is a case of must do better for Newcastle beach where the water quality is labelled ldquosufficient.Tyrella and Murlough already hold the prestigious blue flag awards for the quality of their beaches with those who live along the Lecale coastline mdash who have been working to improve both Kilclief and Ballyhornan mdash delighted the beaches were identied for inspection for the first time, with the water quality included in the excellent category alongside beaches like Castlerock, Benone, Portballintrae and Portstewart.The districtrsquos beaches provide an excellent opportunity for people to get out and explore the arearsquos unique geological heritage and enjoy a wide range of activities which are available.Blue flag status assures visitors that the beaches have excellent water quality, are clean and that the environment is safe and accessible.The latest water quality figures published by the Department of the Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairsshow that the local beaches rank alongside some of the Provincersquos best, in particular, those along the North Coast and North Downrsquos so-called gold coast.A total of  bathing waters around the Provincersquos coastline have met strict European standards for quality, with  of these classied as excellent, which is the prerequisite for the coveted blue flag award.A further six beaches met the lsquogoodrsquo standards and the rest mdash including Newcastle mdash were placed in the lsquosufficientrsquo standard category alongside Crawfordsburn, Carnlough and Cloughey.David Small, head of DAERArsquos Environment, Marine and Fisheries Group, has welcomed the publication of the latest water quality results.He said: ldquoThis is a superb result for our beaches, especially given the changeable weather our coastline is often subject to. But, more importantly, itrsquos good news for our holidaymakers and bathers who can confidently enjoy our fabulous beaches.ldquoWe take great pride in these results and know that maintaining them will take a sustained effort. We will continue to work to reduce water pollution to keep our bathing waters clean and safe.Mr Small added: ldquoOur beaches are a priceless resource to tourism and to the health and well-being of our local communities and visitors alike. It is imperative that we continue to strive for the very highest of standards.NI Water has also welcomed confirmation that all  beaches tested have met European standards for bathing water quality.Angela Halpenny, head of environmental regulation, said protecting the environment was an important part of NI Waterrsquos business.She said NI Water was delighted to hear that all  designated bathing waters have met European standards but warned against complacency, highlighting the need to push forward with further investment to ensure continued improvements are made.The beach water quality results were announced by the Better Beaches Forum whose members include DAERA, NI Water, coastal local authorities, Keep Northern Ireland Beautul, the National Trust, Surfers Against Sewage and some coastal community groups.Mournes councillor, Willie Clarke said he delighted that Kilclief, Ballyhornan, Tyrella and Murlough beaches have recognised as having excellent water, but expressed disappointment that Newcastle was only placed in the ldquosufficient standard, despite major investment by NI Water in the resortrsquos sewage treatment works.He said there was an onus on Newry Mourne and Down Council to work with its statutory partners to improve the water quality, suggesting this yearrsquos warm bathing season should have helped prevent pollutants from being flushed down rivers and out to sea.ldquoWe need to establish what were the reasons for Newcastlersquos water quality to have only secured a sufficient water quality standard, Cllr Clarke continued.ldquoThe tourism industry relies on its beaches and water quality and more needs to be done to ensure this is as good as it can and should be.

While our colour may have been an issue for some people, race has never been one for us or our families.ldquoWe did get some looks when we were together in South Africa, and maybe would still do when we are back, but itrsquos not something we take notice of.While the young couple viewed falling in love as natural, their love has helped to inspire others.Claire recalled: ldquoI remember Bongi and I were visiting his family home and we walked into the town one day hand in hand. An old black man approached us and held our hands and said, lsquoThis is what I call real freedomrsquo.Bongi, who works in engineering, says that Claire was more smitten with him at the beginning.However, Claire says that he told her he loved her as she as about to go to the airport tohome.ldquoWe kind of knew we were in love fairly quickly and decided to become boyfriend and girlfriend, even thought it was going to be a long-distance relationship, said Bongi.ldquoWe kept in touch by telephone.

Therefore I appeal to those who have money to invest it in creating jobs for our youth.Dr Maguire said economists were painting ldquogloomy pictures of the economic system and were warning that levels of unemployment had become ldquoendemic.ldquoIn particular the level of youth unemployment is rising rapidly and it seems certain that growing numbers of our school leavers are destined to move directly to the dole queue, he stressed.NEWCASTLE mdash Newcastle receptionist Dolores Malone is the top hotel receptionist in Co Down and now she has the chance to prove that she is also the best in Northern Ireland when she takes place in the Coca-Cola Receptionist of the Year finals night in the Culloden Hotel next month.Dolores, receptionist at the Brook Cottage Hotel, won her way through to the finals by beating receptionists from hotels in Co Down and Co Armagh in the regional heat at the White Gables Hotel in Hillsborough.Dolores goes forward to compete for a pound holiday cheque, a specially engraved Tyrone Crystal vase and specially designed winnerrsquos badge and a framed certicate.CASTLEWELLAN mdash Castlewellan councillor Mrs Ethel Smyth has won her fight to have a five year-old girl transported to school in Dundrum.The girl, who lives near Castlewellan, began her first year of education at Dundrum Primary School on Monday and special transport arrangements have been laid on for her.ldquoThe girl is now being lted by minibus at her front door each day and is also brought back home. This is very pleasing, Mrs Smyth said.A dispute over the provision of transport arose when the girlrsquos father demanded his daughter should be allowed to attended a state controlled school in Dundrum or Castlewellan.But according to Mrs Smyth the South Eastern Educationand Library Board said that the child would have to go to a maintained school in Annsborough which would exclude the need for transport arrangements.Mrs Smyth, who took up the girlrsquos case, said this week: ldquoI am very glad that I was successful in this matter because it has clearly established the right of the parent.ARDGLASS mdash More than five thousand bales of hay and a wide range of farm equipment were destroyed in a blaze near Ardglass in the early hours of Sunday.Fire broke out in a large hay shed owned by Mr James Crangle, of Ardtole, and Downpatrick firemen spent more than eight hours containing it.Among the machinery which was destroyed were two tractors, a trailer, a threshing machine and several potato sorters.

The newly-formed Ballynahinch United played in a local summer league which involved teams such as Montalto, Drumaness Mills, Plessey, Saintfield, Magheradroll and another called the Bachelors, who apparently had an Italian playing for them.The club made their competitive debut in Division  of the Newcastle and District League in September  when they travelled to Ballykinlar Army Camp to take on the Light Infantry.This fixture would prove to be quite an ordeal in many ways with the team being beaten - as player and car owner Ted McKibbin had to make double journeys to ferry players to and from Ballykinlar.Not a single league victory was recorded that season, although they won a number of friendly games.Although the   season started more optimistically with a - draw away to Down Olympic, it was a further seven games until they defeated the RAF at Bishopscourt -. During the summer of  the team won all eight games to win the Kilmore and District Summer League.Things improved signicantly in the   season as they were promoted as runners-up in Division  and also won the Enterprise Cup, which was played on a league basis, beating Saintfield AYC ndash in the replay after a - draw in the first match.The Swts were formed for the   season and they played in the Willowfield League recording their first win against Saintfield United on October , .Having been promoted to Division  of the Newcastle  District League, they won it at the first attempt and with the Swts moving to the Newcastle League for the   season, both teams performed a unique double by winning Divisions  and  while United reached and lost the Harry Clarke Cup final.United went to the Northern Amateur Football League for the   season and were promoted from Division B and they also reached the Irish Junior Cup only to lose to Moyola Park. They won the Division A title in  In the   season they lost the Irish Junior Cup final to st Bangor Old Boys while the Swts were probably the first reserve team to reach the Harry Clarke Cup Final which they lost after a replay to Downshire Hospital.Consecutive Cochrane Corry Cup finals were lost in   and  , as well as a second County Antrim Junior Shield final in .Manager Billy Hamilton, who had guided the team through the s so successfully, stood down at the end of the   season and then went on to become secretary of the County Antrim Football Association for a number of years. The playing strength within the club led to the formation of the Albion, in .In the mid s Ballynahinch Recreation folded. United took over the Millbridge playing fields and undertook signicant development work which led to it being admitted to Division C of the Northern Amateur Football League.Under the management of Bobbie Reid, they played their first games at intermediate level in the   season while the Swts switched to the NAFL reserve section, However the Albion remained in the Newcastle League.Success came quickly when Brian McKibbenrsquos team won the Border Regiment Cup in the   season after extra-time and penalties. Brian stood down as manager in  and through the efforts of Gerry McCormick and Cyril Lennon mid-table league positions were achieved.Under the leadership of club chairman Campbell Allen, great strides were being made with improvements to the drainage of the pitch, erection of tubular steel fencing around the pitch, construction of new dugouts and the erection of floodlighting to the training pitch with the clubhouse being substantially refurbished.For the   season Noel Dean was recruited as manager and he steered the team to their first and only promotion at intermediate level when they moved from Division B to A as runners-up to Dromara Village.The following season a mid-table position was achieved together with a memorable midweek Irish Cup replay defeat of Harland  Wolff Welders at Millbridge.Dean stepped down during the season and he was replaced by Michael Savage, who led the team to the final of the Clarence Cup which they were awarded as a result of Knockbreda Parish fielding an ineligible player.That same season the Swts, under manager Geoffrey Smith, lost the Purdy Cup final while Davy Teggartyrsquos Albion won the Bignian Cup and were also promoted to Division  as runners-up. Sadly, this team broke up and there followed a decade of struggle during which managers Eamon Wilson, Norman McCullough, Davy Teggarty and Alan Brown worked tirelessly to halt the downward trend.The occasional bit of encouragement came along with the Albion reaching two successive Shimna Cup finals in   and   only to lose out in penalty shoot-outs while in   the Albion won the Donard Dairy Shield defeating Castlewellan IIIs ndash.Campbell Allen stepped down due to business commitments and the current chairman Gilbert Cromie took over.In May  the club were awarded the honour of hosting the Britton Rosebowl International between the NAFL and the Scottish Amateur League at Millbridge.Nigel Neale managed the team for the   season, but resigned with ten matches remaining. Experienced first teamer Alan Stevens took over, assisted by John Jones, and they led the team to one of their highest finishes in years.Former manager Cyril Lennon came in for the   season and United enjoyed their highest league position for years. Stuart Buchanan came in as manager of the Swts and led them to the Newcastle  District League Division A title.The following season United again narrowly missed out on promotion, as well as reaching the quarter-finals of the Intermediate Cup when they were defeated by Harland  Wolff Welders at Millbridge. The Swts re-entered the Northern Amateur League and were promoted as runners-up in Division E to Bangor Rangers.Much to everyonersquos disappointment, Cyril Lennon stepped down and Steven Bell took over along with John Jones and they led the team to a very respectable fourth place in Division B. United were awarded the North East Referees Association Merit Award for Fair Play at the AGM of the NAFL.The Swts continued their good form to finish runners-up to Downpatrick IIs in NAFL D, but manager Stuart Buchanan stepped down due to study commitments.In the summer of  the club celebrated its th anniversary which a special former playersrsquo night and a friendly match against Irish Premier League side Lisburn Distillery. The Albion managed by Johnny Reid won Division  of the Newcastle  District League.In   the club was awarded a % grant from the IFA to undertake an upgrading of its facilities to meet new Intermediate regulations.Steven Bell stood down in January . A new management team of Colin Murray and John Jones took over the role and they guided the first team to a fourth place finish on goal dference. Much to the clubrsquos disappointment the Albion had to be withdrawn from the Newcastle League due to a reduction in the clubrsquos player pool.In the   season the club embarked on its usual Irish Cup campaign little knowing that it would reach the fth round for the first time and be drawn against Premier Division side Coleraine. This brought about a wonderful adventure during which the club was able to garner a massive support which necessitated the ordering of two double decker buses for supporters as well as a bus for the team.Everything was done as professionally as possible and despite a heavy defeat, although the score was - at half time, the players and their management gained enormous respect.In more recent times the team has been managed by Keith Hamilton, Scott Brashaw and Ross Hayes as caretaker managers, Alan Davis and Paul Allison. In the current season, former player Glynn Robinson and Dale Davidson have taken on the role and have made a promising start with good results in both league and cup competition.Over the last  years the club has been involved in a number of proposed amalgamation initiatives involving Ballynahinch Recreation, Ballynahinch Olympic and Temple Rangers, but none materialised.One amalgamation that did happen was with Ballynahinch Youth Football Club, which now means that the club includes male and female from age six years forward and a ladiesrsquo senior team. This fits in superbly with the clubrsquos ethos of being inclusive to all within the local community which has been something that is reflected in its history from day one.It also brought to the club an outstanding group of coaches and administrators which has invigorated the club.No club could everwithout committed iniduals being involved in its organisation and the club has had a cadre of them over five decades.The passing of the clubrsquos elder statesman, Billy Hamilton senior, in December  brought to an end outstanding service not only within the club as a player and administrator, but also within the leagues and governing bodies.Billy was no stranger to working hard on the ground, putting up nets and marking the pitch both at Feersquos Field in Dromara and Millbridge, aided and abetted by club president Winston Brown, who works away in the background and has done so for  years.Jimmy Brown has toiled tirelessly and selflessly for well over  years, keeping Millbridge well-manicured as well as using his building, plumbing and plastering skills to maximum effect.In addition to Billy senior, the Hamilton family have made an outstanding contribution with Billy junior managing for over a decade. Graham scored hundreds of goals over those early years while Wilson mdash better known to all as Chico mdash played for all three teams and continues to serve as a committee member to the present day.We can never forget the contribution that Sally Hamilton has made as she continues to attend the home matches and has made the sandwiches served to visiting teams at the Millbridge for decades. In addition to managing the team and being involved administratively with the club, Bobbie Reid has served as the clubrsquos Newcastle League representative for many years. Last, but not least, there is Davy Teggarty, who has fulfilled every role possible.While all of these iniduals and others have helped over the years we are most fortunate to have a new generation who have stepped forward and will see the club move forward for which we are extremely thankful..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Peace lantern walk marking WWI end 100th anniversary  ","story":"A UNIQUE peace lantern walk is to be held in Killyleagh to mark the th anniversary of the end of the First World War.The lantern will be carried in a relay chain from Shrigley to Killyleagh, and through its main streets, before a flame from it is used to light a gas beacon at the front of Killyleagh Castle on Remembrance night.A Killyleagh veteran, who is one of Northern Irelandrsquos last RAF survivors from the Second World War, has been given the honour of carrying the lantern on the final relay before the Beacon of Light is lit.Martin lsquoTinarsquo Charters, who is aged  and who survived more than  bombing missions as a rear gunner in Halax and Lancaster bombers in the Second World War, will light the beacon to mark the moment the guns finally fell silent in  after four years of the world at war.The Bomber Command veteran who still walks up to six miles a day and is one of Killyleaghrsquos most instantly recognisable residents, will be joined in the final relay of the cross-community walk by local schoolchildren and  unsung heroes from the local community.The Killyleagh Beacon of Light will be among the first of around  bonfires and beacons to be lit across Northern Ireland at pm at the end of Remembrance Sunday, as part of the Battlersquos Over commemorations on Sunday, November .Chris Hagan, the chairman of the Killyleagh Remembers the Great War project, revealed that an original candle and lantern, used on the th anniversary of the start of the war, will be used as part of a chain to light the beacon.ldquoWe extinguished a candle lantern in August  to mark  years from the beginning of the war, he said. ldquoIn remembrance of the end of the war and the millions who were killed or came home dreadfully wounded, the lantern will be lit again.ldquoThere were two bonfires lit in Killyleagh on the night the war ended at the Castle Square and at the Cross.

Armagh were largely at full strength with influential number  Neil Faloon passed fit.Armagh took an early lead with a penalty from promising young out-half Cormac Fox.The game then became entrenched around the halfway line with both sides either unwilling or unable to put any width on the ball due to the conditions.Armagh edged the possession and territory, but with defences well drilled on both sides it looked like only a mistake would provide any try-scoring opportunity on either side.There were a few fumbles from speculative kicks on both sides but defences were able to scramble into place and snuff out any chances relatively comfortably to leave the half-time score at -.The second half brought more of the same. Ballynahinch had to withstand a period of sustained Armagh possession, but did so without any major alarms.However, they were unable to stamp any real authority of their own on proceedings and as the match drted into its later stages it seemed that Armagh had done enough to escape with a famous win.Former Armagh man Richard Reaney had other ideas and he converted a penalty in the final minute to earn the home side a draw.Armagh will be happier with the result, but the Ballynahinch players and coaches will take the two points and move on to the tricky trip to Old Belvedere next week.The final round of the Celtic Cup took place last weekend, freeing up Ulster squad members for club rugby, but it remains to be seen how soon they become available.

A number of parked cars have also been damaged.It is being reported that some shops have closed early to protect staff, while residents who live near the historic Grove area in the shadow of Down Cathedral have revealed they have been verbally abused.Representatives from residentsrsquo groups in Stream Street, Bridge Street, Russell Park and Lynn Doyle Place have been invited to attend the meeting which they hope will result in an action plan being devised to tackle a problem caused by what some have described as ldquoferal youths.Grove Shopping Centre caretaker Peter Smyth, said businesses were frustrated that nothing is being done to address the problems and wanted local police to do more.ldquoBusinesses have had to pull down shutters either temporarily or shut early to protect staff in the St Patrickrsquos Square area, he said.ldquoWhile the trouble is largely centred on area between the Grove, the Saint Patrick Centre and the Downpatrick and Co Down Railway, it radiates out to town centre neighbourhoods and last week a number of young people climbed on to the roof at the nearby bus station.Anthony Trainor, of the Stream Street Residentsrsquo Association, said local people, including those who work in the town centre, have had their cars deliberately damaged.ldquoResidentsrsquo groups are telling us that there have been assaults on adults and children. All this needs to stop and people want to see police doing more, he added.Jeanette McCarthy, chairwoman of the Tosuacute Uacuter residentsrsquo group which includes the Lynn Doyle area, revealed parents were afraid to let their children out to play in the evening.She added: ldquoThere is just no way we can let our children play around the parklands below the Cathedral. It is getting to the point where we have to go to Delamont outside Killyleagh with the kids to make sure they are okay and can play safely.Downpatrick councillor Cadogan Enright, who has organised tomorrowrsquos meeting, said the town centre issues were affecting the whole community.ldquoI have also been approached by residents in the Quoile Fold where senior citizens expressed concern that they are afraid to go out for milk in the evenings, he said.ldquoIt is my understanding that those involved in the anti-social behaviour are known to police so itldquoThe fact this trouble has been going on for months is wholly unacceptable.ldquoRepresentatives of residentsrsquo groups have been invited to attend tomorrowrsquos meeting to reflect how what is happening in the town centre is also spilling over into the areas where they live.Confirming the attendance of representatives from Downpatrick Youth Initiatives at tomorrowrsquos meeting, Cllr Enright said the organisation also wanted to ensure the young people it was responsible for could play safely in the town centre and surrounding area..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/16063912.Festival_guests_left_feeling_cheesed_off_call_for_a_refund/resources/images/8860161.jpg","title":"She did it  Swindon star Maisie Sly s film wins at the Oscars","story":"And while a little young to be enjoying a champagne celebration, Maisie will be ing to her Upper StrattonTHE.

A bomb had damaged Enniskillen Townhall, and for a while the Council moved out to the Ardhowen.Pardon the pun, but there were times when Council meetings were ldquoas good as a play, as my granny used to say. Reporting the meetings for the paper was enjoyable, and I remember on one occasion two Councillors had a, er, lively exchange of views and we all held our breath as John Joe McCusker marched down the chamber to confront Jim Lunny.Of course it all ended amicably. The two men, both Nationalists and both with a mischievous sense of humour, were very dferent characters ndash genuine characters and not the fictional types which would tread the boards later at the same venue. I got to know them both and enjoyed their company.Jim Lunny was a great campaigner for retaining townland names, and John Joe fought his corner for his area. I recall them both having a sense of community, and not only would they do their best for Fermanagh in their day, both were also conscious of the need to pass things on to future generations.So they were very supportive of the then Chief Executive, Gerry Burns, a public servant with real vision, when he was the driving force to transform the Ardhowen into the beautul ldquoTheatre by the Lakes. And the architecture-award winning building became the envy of many places at home and abroad.Pardon the clicheacute, but the ldquojewel in the crown was an apt description, but more than just being a beautul building in a beautul setting, the Ardhowen under the dedicated and expert guidance of people like Eamonn Bradley and others, gave a real boost to the arts and entertainment.Enniskillen, and indeed Fermanagh generally, has a fine tradition in amateur drama and itrsquos gratying to see the likes of Adrian Dunbar and Ciaran McMenamin go on to have distinguished careers. About four years ago, I had the pleasure of chairing the Xchange summer school at the Ardhowen when Adrian spoke of his passion for the arts and as a regular visitor to his home town he still boosts the arts here. As does Ciaran, who engaged locals at such events as the film club. The range of activities at the Ardhowen is ied and we are, indeed, fortunate to have such a venue.Itrsquos starting to show its age, though. Even so, I cannot imagine that the people who got the theatre project up and running  years ago would have expected that already the Council is undertaking an exercise to look at the future of the theatre. Some of the options include an upgrade or extension, but worryingly another option is to build another theatre on another site.All this has been well reported by Colm Bradley in this newspaper.The situation has led to a number of people expressing doubts about the future of the Ardhowen, and Fermanagh Film Clubrsquos Jules Caithness wrote about ldquograve concern at the fog of uncertainty over the theatre which he said had been ldquohorribly neglected.The Council attempted to downplay this by saying they have ldquono plans to sell the Ardhowen site.No plans  Whatthey go for the option of a new theatre on a new site  What happens to the Ardhowen site then  Irsquod have preferred a straightforward, no wersquore not selling it. Itrsquos a uniquely beautul site and wersquod be mad to sell it.Irsquom told a meeting was held in August of ldquostakeholders which unsettled some of those present, and that no Councillors were present.Irsquom wondering how the succeeding Councils over the years allowed the building to get into such a state of repair, to the point where they now need to spend a large sum of money.So much money, in fact, that it exceeds the threshold that an ldquoeconomic appraisal is required.Irsquom sure some bean counter will weigh it all up but how do you place on a balance sheet the richness of cultural experience which the Ardhowen has brought to Fermanagh over three decades, and the reputation our centre of excellence has across Ireland In the current climate, I think the way we are governed isnrsquot as ldquoopen and accountable as it should be. There is certainly a massive disconnect between the people and those in authority at Stormont, though one would expect thatany public body would have the ear of the public it would be the local Council.Some decisions have implications for years to come. I still get annoyed when I walk past the old ldquostreets area opposite the police station in Enniskillen and see a lot of public sector buildingswhere once stood a thriving community of people living in homes on the island.OK, housing conditions were awful, but homes should have been built there instead of what the planners did with the area.So, please members of Fermanagh and Omagh District Council, consider carefully what you do with the Ardhowen. Itrsquos not really yours, and itrsquos not totally a matter of money.Part of the problem, apparently, is a lack of car parking. Aside from the fact that this would suggest itrsquos a popular venue, surely itrsquos not beyond the Council to sort that one out There are other problems, of course, and I fully accept that these are stringent times.Butyoursquore looking for feedback, Councillors, mine is that you should recognise what a magnicent asset you have on your hands. Pluck the jewel out of the crown and abandon it at your peril. In fact, find the money, go the whole hog and turn the ldquotheatre by the lakes into an even greater asset which will build on what has already been achieved and be lauded for years to come.Your predecessors, McCusker, Lunny and Burns among other, had the foresight to do that.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It was a conflict in which his uncle, Charlie Dunbar had been persuaded to volunteer for ldquoto fight for his religion.But the experience of what Charlie saw left a deep scar and changed him forever.Adrian was the focus of the ldquoWho Do You Think You Are  on RTE on Sunday evening, and it was a fascinating watch.As we all get a little older, many of us seem to have an increasing interest in our own past, especially our own family history. In Ireland, family is still a powerfully symbolic and emotive part of our DNA, and the programme often reveals some interesting context for inidual celebrities.As Adrian said: ldquoAll of us are interested in our backgrounds where we come from and what yoursquore born into. Those things shape who you are.Therersquos no doubt that we will have been particularly interested in Dunbarrsquos journey into his background after all hersquos one of our own.But the interest in the programme went much deeper and much more meaningful. With several little vignettes showing the complexity of identity in Ireland.A word used frequently these days in all sorts of context is binary, meaning only two parts or ision into two groups. Itrsquos particularly apt to the world view of Northern Ireland. Protestant equals Unionist British, Catholic equals Nationalist Irish, would be the perception.It isnrsquot the case, of course, and shouldnrsquot be. But the troubled th century in Ireland, particularly the last quarter of it, saw both groups driven further into a silo mentality.Irsquove always felt that there was a certain irony in the fact that a violent Republican campaign to achieve Irish unity did, actually, create more ision.Now, the current circumstance of changing demographics in the north combined with the Brexit crisis are focusing on identity as we go forward.Adrian Dunbar is a clever inidual and, indeed, a perceptive one and the story of his family background in the programme was punctuated with comments which should evoke some thought about the past, present and future.Adrian was brought up in Enniskillen in a mainly Nationalist area, though for a few years the family moved to Portadown, Garvaghey Road in fact, where he recalls loyalist paramilitaries parading close by in a show of strength to people in Nationalist areas to know their place. The memory of two communities living apart is eloquently described by Adrian as ldquosocial engineering to suit sectarianism. While Enniskillen was much less hostile, the time, the place and the neighbourhood environment where he and his siblings grew up were far from ideal recruiting ground for the British military.And yet, on his mother Pauline Camplingrsquos side, there is an incredibly strong link and a history of service going back three generations.Adrian visited St. Michaelrsquos Church where Frankie Roofe was able to give him intriguing detail of his great-great-grandfather coming to Enniskillen as a soldier from England and converting from Church of England to Catholicism.Recounting some of the history of the Inniskilling Fusiliers, when the regiment ldquoheld the line for Wellington at Waterloo about half of the  men were killed, Adrian himself pointed out that about a third of the men spoke only in Irish. Itrsquos a quirk of how history develops that hundreds of years later the native tongue of men who died serving the British Army is somehow portrayed controversially as anti-British.Adrianrsquos grandfather, Walter Campling served in the Inniskillings, and three of his sonshad distinguished service in the British military in world war.The programme shows Adrian coming home to Enniskillen to discuss this with his brother Liam.Interestingly, though, Liam said that because they were brought up in Nationalist areas they didnrsquot go round talking about their ancestorsrsquo British military service. And Adrian himself said that the idea that he and his siblings would have followed the tradition of their three previous generations had gone.Such service to the British military by Catholic Nationalist families was common, as a look at the names of both communities on the Enniskillen War Memorial show.Yet, it was a feature not talked about in recent history and illustrates the complexities of identity that weave their way through our communities.Conversely, of course, the perception suggests that all Protestants consider themselves ldquoas British as Finchley and thatrsquos just as much an oversimplication. Surely the two identities donrsquot slot handily into their own homogeneous monolith There were a couple of telling moments, I thought, in the Dunbar programme.His uncle Charlie, whom Adrian remembers fondly dishing out sixpences, had been convinced in the late s to join the Irish brigade fighting for the fascist Franco in the Spanish Civil War under the guise of fighting to preserve the Catholic religion against the evils of Communism.On hearing some of the shocking atrocities that his uncle witnessed, Adrian reflected: ldquoPeople do a lot of things in the name of religion, donrsquot they  Sadly, as we know only too well in the north.And he added: ldquoThe combination of religion and politics is not a good one.And there was another line which struck me. Adrian was shown a photo of Queen Victoriarsquos state visit to Dublin in  when the city was still under British rule.He was shown the regimental band, including his grandfather, and considering the protest and fight for independence in Ireland which was about to change everything, Adrian referred to his grandfather and other comrades as being ldquoon the wrong side of history.A century on from that Royal visit, the country saw a war of independence, a civil war, decades of conflict in this part of the island and more recently more Royal visits by the current Queen both north and south of the Border.And now itrsquos a pertinent question to ask what side of history the ious identities are on now.The confusion and uncertainty over future membership of the European Union has thrown the subject of identity to the forefront, and there is the suggestionthat the issue of Irish unity is firmly on the agenda.To be honest, I donrsquot think evena Border poll was held that it would result in unity just now.But herersquos a thing. On Sky News last week, journalist Adam Boulton was interviewing Scottish Deputy First Minister, John Swiney and his opening question was: ldquoWhat do you think is more likely to happen first, a united Ireland or an independent Scotland The fact that he asked it seriously is telling, as is Swineyrsquos serious reply which began, ldquoItrsquos a close run thinghellip.In the current political climate, the DUP say they are engaged in a ldquobattle for the Union. Aside from the fact that all politics here seems to boil down to that, in this case the DUP may well be right.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

I have been moved to tears by so many honest and heart-wrenching accounts.I canrsquot even begin to imagine the pain of losing a child at any stage of le it is inconceivable for those who have never suffered such a loss. But sadly, itrsquos more common that we imagine.It is estimated that one in four pregnancies in the UK ends in miscarriage, defined as a loss of pregnancy up to a gestation of  weeks and  days. A loss after that is considered stillbirth and in  there were , stillbirths ndash thatrsquos nine babies stillborn every day ndash and , neonatal deaths.As part of baby loss awareness week, bereaved parents, along with their families and friends have been coming together, joining with others across the world, to commemorate their babiesrsquo lives.The campaign was started  years ago and yet the fact remains that in our society, it is really only in the last couple of years that we have started to talk openly about baby loss.Indeed it remains a subject that few of us feel completely comfortable navigating. I will admit that before I became a mother three years ago, I had conversations with women who lost their baby during pregnancy and I know I didnrsquot handle those conversations very well.Maybe there isnrsquot a right thing to say, but I recognise now that that I, like so many of us do, shied away from much,any, conversation. Despite knowing that the phrase ldquoIrsquom so sorry was lacking, I refrained from empathising any further or asking questions because I felt I didnrsquot have the right words, I was afraid of saying too much, of saying the wrong thing, of being insensitive, and most of all I was afraid of upsetting that mother.But what I have learned since is that many women ndash and men ndash who have said goodbye to a child in pregnancy or during birth, want to talk about the loss. They donrsquot want you to cross the street to avoid them. Many want you to askthat baby had a name, or when his or her birthday would have been. Of course, itrsquos hard to know any of this unless we have the opportunity to have open and transparent conversations about such a sensitive and dficult issue.Talking about the subject of death is still quite taboo in our society, particularly when it is the death of a baby. But we shouldnrsquot underestimate the importance of talking about baby loss. Not only does it help those who are grieving, helping them to process what has happened, to stop blaming themselves and feel less alone in what can be an emotional and physical rollercoaster, it also gives us all the opportunity to develop the tools and language to discuss this emotive subject with greater understanding, helping to normalise something that is common - and indeed normal - but not talked about enough.Itrsquos ironic and perhaps a cruel reality of social norms that women are encouraged not to tell people about pregnancy until after the first trimester when sickness abates and the risk of miscarriage is greatly reduced. Surely the early stage is when pregnant women need compassion and understanding. The expectation to remain silent during the first  weeks of pregnancy means many couples faced with loss are left to grieve without the support that they need. After all, it doesnrsquot matter whether the loss of a baby is at eight weeks gestation or  weeks, the trauma felt by those who loved and wanted each child are the same. They had imagined their new family they had probably considered whether that baby was a boy or a girl and all sorts of other exciting plans.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This campaign is aided and supported by a number of the Prime Ministerrsquos own Conservative Party members.Sadly, what we are witnessing from many sections is an anti-British position rather than a debate based on any sound principles as to why there are not more pragmatic positions on providing a good deal for everyone involved.As someone who voted to remain within the EU I am extremely disturbed at the antagonistic stance being displayed by the European Union towards the democratic wish of the majority of the citizens of the United KingdomThis has brought me to thinking thatthis is their attitude in general to the UK, then we are better out of this vastly over regulated group. What is even more surprising is the attitude of the Irish Government. They are our near neighbours and have signicant trade with the UK, but are certainly making no attempt to have a conciliatory attitude to finding a positive deal.Given the potential economic loss to the Republic of Ireland, Irsquom curious as to why they are not attempting to use their influence, by their public utterances and in discussions with other EU members, to provide a more assuaging attitude to the situation. This I feel would be more conducive to sustaining beneficial trading relations between the two nations post Brexit.Thankfully the United Kingdom has a strong economy which has supported and assisted many smaller nations, including the Republic of Ireland in the EU for many years.It is hugely positive that Northern Ireland is part of the UK, the fth largest economy in the world.

They are up at Stormont making the decisions.”Ms Travers, who along with TUV leader Jim Allister championed the introduction of the Civil Service Special AdvisersBill in , was reacting to statements made during Tuesday’s inquiry hearing by former Finance Minister Mairtin O Muilleoir, during which he confirmed that Sinn Fein had effectively ignored the law on employing Spads.Although the legislation was introduced five years ago, Mr O Muilleoir told the inquiry that Sinn Fein put in place a structure to allow one-time senior IRA member Aidan McAteer – then Spad to Martin McGuinness – to continue in his role, because they disagreed with the law.The Civil Service Spad Bill, which became known as Ann’s Law, was designed to prevent ex-prisoners who were jailed for five years or more from becoming highly paid political advisers. It was brought forward after former IRA prisoner Mary McArdle – who was involved in the slaying of Mary Travers – was appointed as adviser to Sinn Fein Culture Minister Caral Ni Chuilin in .Reacting to Mr O Muilleoir’s comments, Ms Travers pointed out that while Sinn Fein may be employing advisers with serious criminal records, they are being paid out of party funds rather than the public purse.But condemning their circumnavigation of the law, she said: “I think it is quite abhorrent that they ignore and still don’t get the hurt that was caused that actually caused this Bill to come into being. They haven’t learnt anything from it.”Branding Sinn Fein’s actions as “anti-peace process”, she continued: “It shows that whenever the law suits Sinn Fein they will use it, butthey don’t like it then they ignore it.“We just had a consultation about dealing with the past and legacy issues, and here heis sitting saying Sinn Fein just didn’t agree with a piece of legislation that was brought forward with a victim and with plenty of victims supporting it. All that was being asked of Sinn Fein was to acknowledge the families’ hurt and help them, yet they couldn’t even do that.”With the RHI Inquiry having uncovered details about how Mr O Muilleoir reported to a series of unelected republican figures – one of whom, Padraic Wilson is reportedly one of the most senior members of the IRA – Ms Travers questionedSinn Fein is just “a face” for “shady characters lurking in the shadows.”“It just seems they are just there as a face and they just do what they are told to do and say. People need to be aware that whenever they are voting for their local Sinn Fein candidate, actually in reality are they really able to do anything  Is it really them that you’re voting for or are you voting for these shady characters in the background, still lurking in the shadows, still telling themwhat they can and can’t do, what laws they should follow, which ones they should ignore  I just find it completely depressing.“We have just had the anniversary of the Shankill bomb. We are having other anniversaries this week of other people who were murdered in retaliation, including Greysteel, so you would think at this stage we should be able to trust our politicians, but actually it looks, certainly for this particular political party , that we can’t trust them at all because we don’t know who we are talking to.” of Portaferry. \"   of Portaferry. \"  PSNI identy murdered NI man Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Stressing that trust and trusting people are major issues for victims and survivors, she continued: “Here we are in ,  years on from the Good Friday Agreement. I would have thought by this stage in politics and as a society we should be maturing and working towards a true reconciliation where we actually know that when we sit and talk to somebody that the person we are dealing with is the person who is in front of us and not this unelected person in the background.“Any victims I have spoken with during the whole legacy consultation were all very dubious about how it would really and truly deal with the past in a fair way and it is quite obvious that it won’t. If Sinn Fein can’t even respect a law that was made five years ago how on earth are we to trust them with the legacy issue ”Mr Allister was unavailable for comment, but a TUV spokesperson said Sinn Fein’s actions had “come as no surprise”.Accusing others at Stormont of facilitating Sinn Fein’s attempts to get round the law, the spokesman said: “It is clear that the law on special advisers was flouted left, right and centre.“All of this does nothing to increase confidence in politics. And it begs the question, does Northern Ireland really want to go back to such a fundamentally flawed system of government ”try catch     .               ..

and asked a man who had a conflict of interest to identy an investigator, according to new evidence.David Sterling, who is now the head of the civil service, made the revelation in a written statement to the RHI Inquiry which it published last night ahead of his final appearance before Sir Patrick Coghlin’s inquiry this morning.The evidence raises questions about how serious the DUP and Sinn Fein were at that point about really getting to the truth of the RHI scandal, a process which has ultimately led to damaging revelations about both parties.At the time when the RHI scandal became a crisis for Stormont, Mr Sterling was permanent secretary in the Department of Finance.Recalling that time he said that the Audit Office report which first publicly exposed the RHI scandal in July  “gave rise to relatively low media comment” and it was not until after the BBC Spotlight programme on December  that the issue became a crisis – and particularly “the subsequent focus by the BBC Nolan radio programme” which “gave rise to major concern within the Executive about the damage the fall-out from RHI was doing to the reputation of the Executive”.However, despite the public outcry and the revelation that a whistle-blower had personally approached Arlene Foster, the minister who established the scheme, Mr Sterling said that there was still “meaningful and constructive cooperation between Spads after the Spotlight programme and broad agreement that the Executive would need to try to regain some control of events”.He said: “During the week beginning December   consideration was being given to conducting a short, focused investigation by someone with expertise and independence, but short of a full public inquiry. “I was involved in a conference phone call with the head of the civil serviceon the morning of Thursday December  at which such an idea was being pursued. My recollection is that Hugh Widdis, [senior Sinn Fein aide] Aidan McAteer and [top DUP Spad] Timothy Johnston were with HOCS at the time. “I was tasked with trying to find a suitable independent person ideally with expertise on the energy sector.”Mr Sterling had been the top official in Mrs Foster’s department when RHI was set up and during its first few years, before moving to the finance department where he was again involved in closing RHI. For that reason, he is an important witness and when the public inquiry was later being established by his department Mr Sterling recused himself from that process.Mr Sterling said that it was Jonathan Bell’s remarkable televised interview with Stephen Nolan, followed by an interview with Mrs Foster, which “changed the dynamic” and by the following day “it became clear ... that Sinn Fein were fundamentally reappraising their approach”.Mr Sterling also spoke at someabout how the revelations of the inquiry have undermined public confidence in the civil service.He said: “The extent of the failings uncovered by the RHI Inquiry so far has, quite understandably, given rise to questions about the competence and capacity of the NI Civil Service to develop and deliver complex policy.”Ann Travers: IRA, not Sinn Fein, is at Stormont making decisionsRyan Macrae murder: People of Portaferry stunned at death Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"However, he said it would be “unjust to infer from the RHI scheme that all government policy-making, the administration of public funds and the delivery of public services in Northern Ireland is beset by the kinds of problems and issues that have arisen in the case of RHI”.He said he believed there was “a strong case for a review” of how Spads operate before anyto devolution.try catch     .               ..

But all their clients are asking for it. Others asking how long they have before the loophole is closed.”Inquiry  member Dame Una O’Brien said: “That is unbelievable.”At that juncture, just  boilers were on the Northern Ireland scheme – about % of the ultimate number.Dame Una added: “Here we are in the last week of the inquiry and we can still be shocked by how blunt these emails are – people who, to be fair to Ms Balian, she was out on the ground listening to what people were saying and feeding it back.

The paper was founded a year earlier, in September  but all the earliest papers are lost:LONDON, Sept.  and . \u2028There are private Letters in Town which are filled with Accounts of the gallant Behaviour of the Right Hon. the Earl of Crawford, a Voluntierin the Russian Army, commanded by Count Munich all these Letters mention his Lordship having sustained an important Part in every Action that Army was engaged in, but are so far from saying any thing of his Lordship’s being killed, as was reported, that they assure us, that he has had the good Fortune to escape unwounded.[A war was raging between Russia and the Turks. The previous day’s paper had reported that the earl had been killed by a cannon ball, but news moved slowly in the s and was uncertain. This is an early example of the record being corrected in a bid to convey accurate news]FRANCE. Paris Oct . Last week a very old Man, who had , Livres in ready Money by him, wished to see himself possess of , before he died, for which Purpose he prevailed upon his Son to borrow  Livres for him as soon as he got that Sum, he shut himself up in his Closet in order to join it to his own Stock but while he was busy in telling over his Money in his Chest, the Lid of it fell upon his Head, and he was found dead the next Day. The Reward of CovetousnessBELFAST. Last Tuesday the Right Honourable the Lord Viscount Hillsborough waited on the Rev. Presbytery of Bangor,in Order to have a dissenting Minister, whom his Lordship recommended to the Presbytery, settled at Hillsborough: It is not doubted but that the Presbytery will do what they reasonably can to graty his Lordship.[Trevor Hill, who was the first Viscount Hillsborough, died within four years of this report, while still only aged in his s. His son and heir Wills Hill later became a key British statesman as Secretary of State for the Colonies shortly before the July , American Declaration of Independence, which was reported on the front page of the News Letter in August of that year. A man who would become a founding father of the United States, Benjamin Franklin, visited Lord Hillsborough at Hillsborough Castle in . Later suggestions that the pair did not get on, helping precipitaterupture between Britain and the colonies, are disputed, and Franklin is said to have recorded that he was warmly treated by his host] The first two surviving News Letters from October  are the only early copies between September  and December . From December, there is a nine-month batch of papers until late . This December, we will resume our serialisation of some of the first surviving editions• Do you have an old News Letter from the s  We are aware of many readers who have old News Letters from the s and s, but would particularly like to hear from anyone who has copies from the s, which are very rare.

A petition has also been sent in to the National Assembly.Many local residents from Penarth, Barry, Cardf and further afield have shared their frustrations over the sediment being dumped off the coast.Penarth man Anthony Slaughter, who is the Cardf and the Vale Green Partyrsquos campaigns officer and also the chairman of Gwyrddio Penarth Greening, said: ldquoWe understand and share local residentsrsquo concerns over the dumping of this potentially hazardous mud in the Severn estuary.ldquoIn addition to any possible risks associated with this waste we are opposed to any action that enables the development of the Hinkley C nuclear power station.ldquoAs the only political party in Wales that is completely and unambiguously opposed to all nuclear power we do not support the plans for either Hinkley C or Wylfa B power stations.Even rock musician and anti-nuclear campaigner Cian Ciaran, who is the keyboard player for the band Super Furry Animals, has come out against the matter.The musician lodged papers at the High Court seeking an injunction to stop the dumping and said that the ldquonuclear establishment cannot be trusted.ldquoAbsence of evidence is not the evidence of absence, and therefore the precautionary principle should dictate a rethink, said Mr Ciaran. ldquoA rethink by our politicians and policy makers to do the right think by its people.ldquoThe implications and consequences of this dredging could be far reaching.South Wales Central AM Neil McEvoy has set up a CrowdFunder page to raise pound, for the protest as he believes there may be a judicial review.He said: ldquoOur initial target of pound, was so that we could carry out an interim injunction in order to temporarily halt the dumping of the Hinkley nuclear reactor mud.ldquoHowever, in order to stop the mud dump for good we will need toto court, which could lead to a judicial review. Judicial reviews are very costly and so extra funding will be required. This will be used for court fees and to put together a strong legal challenge against the mud being dumped in Wales.ldquoIrsquom concerned because I do not believe enough testing has been done. Wersquore talking about mud being dredged from outside a nuclear reactor.Energy company EDF are dredging the mud ahead of building two new nuclear reactors at Hinkley Point C in Somerset.

The results showed the material was suitable for disposal at sea.ldquoWersquove tried to reassure people that the proposed activity will not harm people or the environment.EDF says the dredging of mud from the seabed off the Hinkley Point C site is necessary ahead of drilling six vertical shafts for the cooling water system for the new nuclear power station.However, those against the dredging say it could pose health risks.Max Wallis of Friends of the Earth, Penarth and Barry said: ldquoThe NRW up to recently stated the EIA for dumping had been covered in the EIA for the jetty development in Somerset, covered by the Environment Agency but this was contradicted by CEFASrsquos statement of , Nevertheless the NRWissued the  license.

A petition has also been sent in to the National Assembly.Many local residents from Penarth, Barry, Cardf and further afield have shared their frustrations over the sediment being dumped off the coast.Penarth man Anthony Slaughter, who is the Cardf and the Vale Green Partyrsquos campaigns officer and also the chairman of Gwyrddio Penarth Greening, said: ldquoWe understand and share local residentsrsquo concerns over the dumping of this potentially hazardous mud in the Severn estuary.ldquoIn addition to any possible risks associated with this waste we are opposed to any action that enables the development of the Hinkley C nuclear power station.ldquoAs the only political party in Wales that is completely and unambiguously opposed to all nuclear power we do not support the plans for either Hinkley C or Wylfa B power stations.Even rock musician and anti-nuclear campaigner Cian Ciaran, who is the keyboard player for the band Super Furry Animals, has come out against the matter.The musician lodged papers at the High Court seeking an injunction to stop the dumping and said that the ldquonuclear establishment cannot be trusted.ldquoAbsence of evidence is not the evidence of absence, and therefore the precautionary principle should dictate a rethink, said Mr Ciaran. ldquoA rethink by our politicians and policy makers to do the right think by its people.ldquoThe implications and consequences of this dredging could be far reaching.South Wales Central AM Neil McEvoy has set up a CrowdFunder page to raise pound, for the protest as he believes there may be a judicial review.He said: ldquoOur initial target of pound, was so that we could carry out an interim injunction in order to temporarily halt the dumping of the Hinkley nuclear reactor mud.ldquoHowever, in order to stop the mud dump for good we will need toto court, which could lead to a judicial review. Judicial reviews are very costly and so extra funding will be required. This will be used for court fees and to put together a strong legal challenge against the mud being dumped in Wales.ldquoIrsquom concerned because I do not believe enough testing has been done. Wersquore talking about mud being dredged from outside a nuclear reactor.Energy company EDF are dredging the mud ahead of building two new nuclear reactors at Hinkley Point C in Somerset. The company said the dredging is necessary ahead of drilling that needs to be done ahead of works for the new reactors.       ,params: .pushEnvironmental watchdog Natural Resources Walesgranted the licence for the dumping and insist that it is safe.A spokesman for NRW said: ldquoEvery element of the application was considered thoroughly including testing of the sediment from the dredge sites by independent experts in accordance with international standards and guidelines, and advice from health experts. The results showed the material was suitable for disposal at sea.ldquoWersquove tried to reassure people that the proposed activity will not harm people or the environment.EDF says the dredging of mud from the seabed off the Hinkley Point C site is necessary ahead of drilling six vertical shafts for the cooling water system for the new nuclear power station.However, those against the dredging say it could pose health risks.Max Wallis of Friends of the Earth, Penarth and Barry said: ldquoThe NRW up to recently stated the EIA for dumping had been covered in the EIA for the jetty development in Somerset, covered by the Environment Agency but this was contradicted by CEFASrsquos statement of , Nevertheless the NRWissued the  license.

Knowing this, John gave up his teaching course and took a full time job at the boatyardhellipand the rest is history.Mr Freemantle moved from Penarth and started his own boat building workshop in South Clive Street in  with British Road Services ndash now National Freight Consortium.In , the business was expanded and relocated to a greenfield site within Cardf Marina, which is now the exact location of Bayscape.The boat yard at the time stored around - boats. Long before the Cardf Bay Barrage was built, the water was tidal and boats moored in the middle of the river.As there was no road to the marina, Mr Freemantlebuilt a track to enable him to get to and from the boat yard. In  he put pontoons for the boats and laid the first cement for the slipway which was all created by Mr Freemantles own hands.In  the Freemantlesset their sights on retiring and sold the boat yard - which had grown to storing more than  boats - to a family friend of their business partner who used to visit the boat yard as a child. And so Bayscape began.One day the couple were walking along the waterrsquos edge and looked across to see the unique development taking shape in the exact spot of Mr Freemantles beloved boat yard, where  years previously they brought in the original electrics, telephone line and water. The couple decided to move back to where they had spent many happy years.Mrs Freemantlesaid: ldquoWe love living here, it feels really safe and therersquos a great sense of community.

The town council has stated that staff are waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its grounds.But Mrs Gardner, Mrs Herniman and Mrs Huxtable say they heard rumours it could be sold and say they want to ensure it is kept for the community use.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoIt is a fantastic venue with lots to offer.ldquoThe Kymin has childrenrsquos parties here, bowling outside, craft fairs and everything you can think of here. There are many rooms and there are wonderful grounds here as well.ldquoWe have had my sonrsquos wedding here and barbecues here. As members of PODS we have our annual barbecue here every year.But the women say they believe the number of people and groups who use The Kymin has dropped over the years.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoI think its underused, I donrsquot know why that is particularly.ldquoWhen I have come down here, I would just see one group in the building. It is a big building and itrsquos a shame to just see one room being used instead of it being lively and filled with a iety of groups.ldquoIt would be a crying shame for it to be taken away from the public because it is underused.Mrs Gardner, , added: ldquoWe want to be proactive about this rather than just sit back and not know whatrsquos going on.Neither the Vale of Glamorgan Council or Penarth Town Council confirmed or denied that the building and grounds could be sold.But Penarth Town Council did say they had enquired about the transfer of the site as a community asset.A spokesman for Penarth Town Council added: ldquoThe Kymin is a Vale of Glamorgan Council asset which has been operated for a number of years by Penarth Town Council.ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council are undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets which will take several months to complete. Penarth Town Council is waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its groundsldquoThe Vale council advised Penarth Town Council that it would not enter into a transfer of the Kymin as a community asset. The town council had requested to do so in order to improve the facilities for the people of Penarth and future generations.Cllr John Thomas, the leader of the Vale of Glamorgan Council, said: ldquoThe council recognises The Kymin is a strategically signicant asset for the Vale of Glamorgan as a whole, due to its prominent location in Penarth. Work is currently under way to consider how the Penarth Esplanade area can be further enhanced to deliver attractive uses for the townrsquos residents and visitors.ldquoWe recognise that there will be many people with an interest in the future of the site and we will continue to engage with the town council, as current tenants, and others as work continues in exploring options. ldquoThis will need the council to be creative with our ideas for how the arearsquos assets are managed at a time of diminishing budgets, as we continue our work to further enhance this important location.. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Journalist TomosPoveysat down with himONE of the culinary worldrsquos most talented figures has revealed his extraordinary journey, from the hardships of being made redundant to achieving the dream of opening his own restaurant, in a new book.James Sommerin released his -page autobiography - Generations - two months ago.The book takes readers on a turbulent ride, which documents the fall and remarkable rise of this multi-award winning chef.In no time at all, it has proved a major hit for the -year-old, with more than  copies having being sold.This is not surprising for this is no ordinary autobiography, as it also contains many eagerly-anticipated recipes and picturesque images.ldquoThe book is basically a round-up of my le so far, he said.ldquoIt also has a lot of personal information about me that people do not know. It has my childhood and when I was travelling, as well as some recipes in the back.ldquoIt was quite hard to come up with the title.ldquoAfter a lot of thinking, I came up with the name and it sums up what the book is about. It was my grandmother who inspired me to cook.ldquoI dedicated the book to her because she got me involved in cooking. I would cook with her on weekends and holidays.ldquoMy children are also involved with cooking. With these two points in mind Generations came forth.The chef, who was brought up and educated in Caerleon, left the area aged  and moved to Scotland.In the book he talks of Scotland in great depth, as this is where he ldquolearnt the craft.ldquoI did corporate and cooking in Caerleon. I then took my first full-time cooking position at the Cwrt Bleddyn Hotel, near Usk. Shortly afterwards I then moved to Scotland and it was there that I learnt my craft.ldquoThere was so much that I learnt when I was there and it helped me a lot in broadening my skills.He added: ldquoWhen I was there I also met my we. Then I came back to Wales a few years later and the rest is history.Despite the dficulty of doing so, Mr Sommerin also re-lives the ldquolowest point in his le by putting into words how he felt when the unthinkablehappened.ldquoThe book also gives the highs and lows, he said.ldquoDue to my wersquos persuasion, I also include the lowest point in my le. This was when I was made redundant from the Crown at Whitebrook.ldquoI had started there in  and was later made head chef.ldquoWhen I was made redundant it was a massive low for me: I went from an exceptionally good salary and having my first Michelin Star to nothing.ldquoI talk about this in depth in the book. I was devastated when I had to go. I even lost my cars.ldquoI had no income yet had to support my family.ldquoTo bring in money, I had to resort to cooking in peoplersquos homes.ldquoIt was dficult to writeabout this. But later I went on to open a restaurant in Penarth and that for me was one of my highest achievements. In the beginning it was a headache. It is not for the faint-hearted to open a restaurant. There were delays and things not falling into place.ldquoBut now Restaurant James Sommerin is a high point because this place is a family restaurant and we are all involved in it. My daughter is training to become a chef too.ldquoAnother high point for me was getting a Michelin Star. It is a hard thing to put into words how it felt, really.And for all the foodies wondering ldquoare there any recipes included  there is a plethora of mouth-watering dishes to cook at the back of the book.Mr Sommerin said: ldquoThere is about  recipes in the back ndash some are complicated and others easy. There are vegetarian dishes too.ldquoSome of the dishes are for a more challenging cook, rather than an amateur.The Michelin Star chef also expressed gratitude to his we for putting the book together, saying: ldquoThe book would not have happenedit were not for some strong people.ldquoThe strongest person is my we, who wrote it all.

He said: ldquoWe were blown away by such a generous offer. Our playgroups and workshops make a real dference for people who arenrsquot always able to access creative activities, and we have been lucky to secure funding this last year to run our playgroups free of charge for families and help the community.He added: ldquoBeing not-for-profit it is always a stretch to buy resources and sadly the instruments get worn out quickly and are expensive to replace. The children and adults we work with benefit hugely from music and creative expression and always enjoy having a go with the instruments. A donation like this means so much and the new instruments have been very happily received.\"Music is a universal language that transcends ability, age and every other demographic. We are so grateful to Phil and Adrian, the patrons of Penarth Acoustic Club, Grfin Books and of course Pencerdd who were really helpful and accommodating too.KeyCreate welcomes new families to the playgroups and invites anyone to get in touch.

They will also prepare the puppy for her future as a working guide dog by taking her on trains and buses, and into shops.After a year or so in their care, Gem willto the charity to begin specialised guide dog training.ldquoIt was a challenge at first, especially as we never owned a dog before, but we felt it was a really worthwhile thing to do, said Mrs Arthur.ldquoI was aware of the isolation experienced by many people with a vision impairment and wanted to make a dference by giving something back to the community.

Gem is so sociable and would like to say hello to everyone.The couple remember vividly the arrival of their first guide dog puppy, a yellow Labrador retriever named Gilly.ldquoWe were excited, very well prepared, and fell in love with her straight away, said Mrs Arthur. ldquoIt was the most joyful and wonderful experience, but you have to be prepared to put in the hard work to train the puppy.ldquoHanding her back after a year was hard, but we were kept informed of her progress and wersquore proud that she is now a qualied guide dog.The charity is seeking more puppy raisers in the Vale of Glamorgan area. Volunteers need access to a car and must be free to spend time with the puppy for most of the day.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The package contained a live explosive and an envelope with white powder, and the substance was being tested to seeit was dangerous, authorities said.Two law enforcement sources said the device was crude but operational. It was addressed to former CIA director John Brennan, who regularly appears as a television contributor and who has publicly clashed with Mr Trump.The president and his aides routinely criticise CNN over its coverage, and he calls the network an example of fake news.ndash George SorosGeorge Soros A suspicious device was found on Monday at the New York compound of the billionaire who is a major contributor to Democratic causes. An official said investigators believe the explosive discovered near the Clintonsrsquo home was linked to the one at the compound.ndash Debbie Wasserman SchultzAll the envelopes listed representative Ms Schultz as theaddress. The FBI also said it was responding to a report of a suspicious package at one of Ms Schultzrsquos offices in Florida.She is the former chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee who was accused by Clinton rivals of secretly boosting the former secretary of state to the partyrsquos  presidential nomination.Debbie Wasserman Schultz, left The envelopes, only a few inches long, had typed letters and six stamps that bore no cancellation mark.ndash Eric HolderThe FBI says Mr Holder, the countryrsquos chief law enforcement officer for most of the Obama administration, was the intended target of a device that was similar to the others but was sent to the wrong address.ndash Maxine WatersThe FBI late on Wednesday said two additional packages addressed to Ms Waters had been intercepted that were similar in appearance to five others.The outspoken Democrat representative is frequently criticised by Mr Trump. He has called her ldquoan extremely low-IQ person and has pegged her level of intellect as ldquosomewhere in the mid-s, which is considered the range for a mental disability. She has called him ldquothe poster boy for what a mob protester looks like.ndash What we do not knowHow dangerous the devices were.Emergency services personnel with a bomb snfing dog The pipe bombs were packed with powder and shards of glass. The devices, each with a small battery, were made from PVC pipe about in long and covered with black tape, said a law enforcement source who viewed X-ray images.Officials do not knowthere are other devices out there, undelivered.ndash ldquoMob politicsThe discovery of the devices comes at a tense time, with Republicans and Democrats casting each other as a ldquomob that would do anything to win or keep control of Congress in two weeks.Mr Trump has a history of advising supporters to ldquoknock the hell out of protesters and saying he would like to see opponents carried out ldquoon a stretcher. Last weekend, he said at a rally in Montana that a congressman who body-slammed areporter was ldquomy kind of guy.Donald Trump addresses a rally in Kentucky As the scope and targets of the device deliveries became clear, Mr Trump called them ldquodespicable acts.ldquoActs or threats of political violence of any kind have no place in the United States of America, he said during an event at the White House.ldquoThis egregious conduct is abhorrent to everything we hold dear and sacred as Americans, he added. ldquoWersquore extremely angry and upset and unhappy about what we witnessed this morning, and we will get to the bottom of it..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title: What we know about the bombs targeting Democrats article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"  comments        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg --\"Most popularMost commentedLoading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos nowMost popularCommentedLoading...Read more         ,CommentsSorry, an error occurred.Thank YouYour complaint has been sent to the site administrators.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a commentContact UsPhoto SalesNewsquest PrintingAdvertiseArchiveSite MapAnnouncementsLeapExchange and MartDatingTerms  ConditionsPrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyManage ConsentTerms of AdvertisingContributor TermsDiversity StatementIpsoregulatedThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Ulster Business speaks to Gavin Kennedy, head of business banking NI and some of those burgeoning firms it has developed strong relationships with over the decades Long-term support is very much at the heart of the decades of partnership between Bank of Ireland and its business customers.And whether it’s offering a wide range of financial assistance, growth support or general advice, the bank has formed le-long partnerships with companies from right across the sectors, and from the large to the very small.It’s been there for three of its longest-running customers – with a combined almost -year history – from the start, and played a key role as a partner in each of their own growth stories.Gavin Kennedy, head of business banking NI at Bank of Ireland UK, told Ulster Business:“We base our business on a relationship management model – we spend a lot of time with the businesses, we know the owners and their management teams, their growth objectives and ambitions and understand the businesses.“That enables us to provide the right suite of products – challenging business plans, providing funding and help. There’s also the chance to introduce them to potential customers, signpost to expert advice, and become a partner to that customer, rather than just be a funder. It’s very much a partnership approach.“We provide lending facilities to business from the very small micro firm, right through their le-cycle, their growth phase, and scaling up to small and medium-sized businesses.”And for Gavin, it’s all about offering a range of services and assistance “under one roof”.“We have the ability to lend up to £m for business customers. There is the consistency to our approach, and that’s really important in the Northern Ireland market.”Partnership is a phrase that continues to raise its head in Bank of Ireland, regarding both its relationships with business customers, and the longevity and generational nature of the companies it’s developed long-term relationships with.“We would have many instances where a mother and father have built a business, and now the second generation is taking on the management,” Gavin said. “We are involved across both generations, and we are very privileged to be part of that family and business development.”“It’s in our interest that the company continues to grow and thrive and we have been very important in that role.”Nowhere is that more evident than with the hugely successful family-owned McKeever Hotel Group.What started out as a family restaurant business in Randalstown, Co Antrim back in , has blossomed into a burgeoning food and hospitality business boasting five hotels across Northern Ireland and Donegal.And the McKeever Hotel Group is still very much a family affair. In the last  years, the breadth of the business has grown to include Corrs Corner in Newtownabbey, the Dunsilly Hotel in Antrim, Ballymena’s the Adair Arms, Dillons in Letterkenny, and its latest hotel, the Dunadry in Antrim.Today, Eugene McKeever, along with his we Catherine, daughter Bridgene and son Eddie, run the thriving hotel empire which employs around  part-time and full-time staff.“The family business started in  when my parents opened the first restaurant in Randalstown – my dad was a chef and mum was teaching,” Bridgene, who is marketing director, said.“They then bought Corrs Corner. That’s when Bank of Ireland really become involved in the company and helped us out.“We have been supported by Bank of Ireland in a number of ways.”That includes the multi-million pound funding for the refurbishment of the Dunadry Hotel, in addition to funding support provided for the acquisition in .“Bank of Ireland has been with the company during its entire history. In , with the Adair Arms, we were one of the few people back then who were buying, due to the recession,” she said.“There has always been trust and the faith with the bank. My dad has always said – speak to your bank manager, and be honest with them.”The McKeever Hotel Group’s single biggest investment has been with the -bedroom Dunadry.Gavin says that one of Bank of Ireland’s core objectives is to help “customers to thrive”.“In doing that, it covers a lot of dferent things, and it’s not just about being profitable,” he said.“We specically tailor our packages to the customer needs. Their success, is our success and we are very privileged to be part of that growth story.”Eamon McCay started his cooking oil business at a small Strabane premises. He’s now grown Frylite from a small family operation to an Ireland-wide firm with more than  staff, boasting a turnover of £m.And he’s been helped along the way by Bank of Ireland amid ongoing expansion and growth. It’s a relationship which has so far lasted more than  years, and shows no signs of slowing down.“I started Frylite in , delivering fresh oil and collecting used oil. I combined all of the areas in one,” Eamon says.And that initial  sq ft building has grown to five depots across Ireland, with a further site on the cards for yet more expansion. “We supply our vegetable oils to hotels, fast food outlets, commercial businesses, bakeries, industrial food service sector… it’s been gradual growth.”A depot in Galway in  was followed by another two years later in Dublin, with Coleraine and Cork following a short time later. And its Strabane base is now a , sq ft building on a four-acre site.Since , Bank of Ireland has provided facilities to the business including invoice discounting, asset finance and term and cash flow ending, and also previously used stockline facility.Speaking about his strong relationship with Bank of Ireland, Eamon says a commercial finance package ensured the businesses growth.“The bank have gotten to know the business. I felt like I have had a partner, which is invested in the business. Building good relationships is one of the values,” he said.But it’s not just about providing help and finance to customers. Bank of Ireland is sponsor of Catalyst Inc’s Invent competition and is also working with organisations such as the NI Chamber and CBI to showcase and help companies improve skills, digital prowess and scale exports.Another business with a more than two-decade relationship with Bank of Ireland is Pinnacle.And just some of the Sage Platinum Reseller’s top customers include everyone from the Irish Football Associationand Ulster Rugby to Titanic Belfast and Mash Direct.The software partner, which was set up in Belfast in , now boasts a team of more than  experienced providers of Sage business management software solutions, IT services and support.“Going from humble beginnings, the company has grown into a £m business,” Fran McKee, Pinnacle’s marketing director said.The firm, which is headed by founder Ken Montgomery, has been supported by Bank of Ireland through its stages of growth, which has included organic expansion and acquisition. “We have a solid partnership with Bank of Ireland, which has nurtured our business since its inception in .”The firm offers businesses solutions from simple to more complex business needs with Sage. It now has  offices across the UK and Ireland, but according to Fran, there is “massive growth on the agenda”.“We want to be a £m business within the next few years and as well as growing our Sage ision we want to also grow our IT services offering and with the bank’s support we’ll achieve our growth ambitions.  You can come to us as a one-stop-shop for IT and software requirements.“Customers today are very focused on providing a good service as well as achieving their growth ambitions, so they want to have the software in place to help them make decisions and run their businesses effectively.”And Gavin says the key message is that Bank of Ireland is a “proven and consistent funding partner for businesses over a long period of time.”“We work hard to build a great rapport and great trust with our clients and these long term relationships are testament to that. It is exciting to share the journey of young and small businesses to growth and expansion and we’re keen to help the next generation seize new opportunities for their businesses.” ■View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/Premier.jpg","title":"premier inn looking at two new ni hotels","story":"Posted on Wednesday October  by John Mulgrew Premier Inn is eyeing up opening new hotels in Newry and Enniskillen as it seeks to expand across Northern Ireland, Ulster Business can reveal.The hotel chain, which has seven hotels here, is seeking developer opportunities in the two new locations, alongside growth in Dublin.The company, owned by Whitbread, has said it secured  new hotels in the UK during the last financial year, and has the same aspirations this year.It also says it is looking for “property partners and freehold development sites in Dublin and other major cities” as it seeks to grow Premier Inn across Ireland.Meanwhile, a new report from PwC says hotel prices in Belfast are rising five times faster than the UK average.In June , the average cost of an overnight stay in Belfast was £. but has now grown to £..Belfast is now the fourth most expensive city to stay in the UK, outside London.PwC Northern Ireland partner, Martin Cowie, said: “The influx of high-quality rooms to the market have driven and continue to support improved RevPAR and ADR for the city. “Though the full impact hasn’t been realised with easyHotel and the George Best Hotel yet to open as well as Signature Living’s new hotel at the Crumlin Road courthouse which just received planning permission, demand continues to be driven by inbound tourism, domestic holidays and events.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/Pete-2.jpg","title":"in focus peter hannan on beef brexit and business","story":"Posted on Thursday October  by Ulster Business Peter Hannan tells John Mulgrew about turning away the big retailers, growing trade by % and that he doesn’t believe Brexit will happen once people see what’s at the edge of the clf Like many in his industry, Peter Hannan is no fan of Brexit.But the top-end beef and red meat supplier also doesn’t think it’s going to happen, given how disastrous the post-Brexit landscape is painted, now that it’s been starkly laid out in front of everyone.The Kildare-born businessman runs Hannan Meats, based in Moira. He’s become something of a star of the Northern Ireland food scene in the last decade – buoyed on by dry-aged beef and an array of the UK’s best and brightest using his produce.He’s aged beef for , days – yes, more than three years – although purely experimental, boosted turnover by around % in the last two or three years, picked up more three-star awards from the Great Taste Awards than almost any other food firm, and now plans to expand into Dublin as his next venture, by the end of the year. Anyone who’s met the Meat Merchant – the moniker given to his retail business in Moira – will know that the -year-old is a personable, larger-than-le character, whose own personality contributes as much to his business and brand, as does his meat.“Our main areas of growth in the last three years have been into the UK, Republic of Ireland and the continent. We haven’t been looking at doing more at home here, because we have a presence, and we think it’s very adequate. We don’t push that, or cold call. We think the clients that we have in Northern Ireland are the best, and we aren’t looking to expand on that.”France is also becoming a growing market for the company, and Pete says business there is growing “very rapidly”.He’s also recently signed a deal to supply all of the Hastings Hotels’ spots.“We have approaches from all sortsover the years,” Pete says. “We are primarily a food service company, so dealing with any of the multiples – doing it a lot more, or not doing it as well has never been on our radar. We’ve had them drive in to the yard here – four suits getting out of a black-windowed car. You are watching on the camera and say ‘oh, that’s somebody’.“Everyone has dferent ideas. We just don’t believe they are the type of partner that we would want. We don’t want to do  tonnes a week of commercial product.”But a few years ago, he did the highest-profile grocer of its kind in the UK – arguably the world.“Five years ago we started to deal with Fortnum  Mason, and they are truly magnicent to deal with,” he said. “That was a turning point because, regardless of what anybody says, the best front window for food in the world is Fortnum  Mason.”According to Pete, business in the five years since the relationship began has increased by ,% – or around  times.What started as a meat wholesale business, blossomed thanks to the success of Hannan Meats’ Himalayan salt-aged Glenarm beef, and has grown into a business with a wide-iety of products – many of which have been done for the first time in NI.Aside from selling lesser-known cuts of beef, such as hanger and rump cap, Pete’s business has ersied into dry-aging lamb, and curing both pork and beef in a sugar-pit – producing hugely flavoured bacon and cured-beef.It doesn’t take long for Pete to start naming some of the greatest chefs which call Hannan Meats their beef supplier. That includes Angela Harrnett and Mark Hix. He was one of the first UK restaurateurs to exclusively use Peter’s dry-aged beef across all of his restaurants – it all started when Pete met Mark outside one of his eateries and gave him an honest retort to whether he had enjoyed his meal. The beef wasn’t up to scratch.But it’s not all just awards, top chefs, suppliers, restaurants and celebrity-backing. Pete says turnover is up around % in the last two to three years – sitting at around £m.“We have lots of other things going on in the background. Taking our next step forward is something we have been considering. We are at a crossroads as to where we take the business next. We are now at a point, do we go forward with the likes of our Meat Merchant , do we take that to a city  Dublin would be next on the radar.”On Brexit, he doesn’t think it’s going to happen – given a clearer image of what le outside the EU could look like.“No doubt, all of us in business have been reluctant to make decisions because there is no clarity,” he said. “Personally, I don’t think we will Brexit. We need to go and apologise, and say ‘as we were’ and just get on. It was a hell of a bad idea. It was sold based on rubbish information, and that’s why people made a rubbish decision.“Now that we have a bit of clarity – Theresa May is bringing us to the clf edge, and saying ‘that’s how far down it is – have a look,you tell me to jump, I’ll jump… but we don’t have to’.“This whole thing about immigration. The thing about bringing , people into this country every year needed to be explained to take that issue off the table. If you want your fruit picked,you want doctors and nurses in the NHS, for example...you want any of those things, then let’s put up the barriers. Unless we take those people in, we don’t have have those things done.“… we shouldn’t be in this position, and I don’t think we will be for much longer. Once Theresa May brings these things to the clf, no one will say that they want to jump.“I think there is a huge head of steam. People will say ‘we won’t take that deal’.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"pinnacle marks  years with huge bash in portugal","story":"Posted on Thursday October  by Ulster Business Belfast firm Pinnacle – a leading provider of Sage software and IT solutions – has celebrated  years in business by taking more than  of its staff to Portugal for an an all-expenses paid trip.The company, which has branches throughout the UK and Republic of Ireland, flew its workers to a five-star resort in Vilamoura, to mark the occasion.The five-star celebrations included welcome lunch overlooking the Vilamoura Marina, followed by spa treatments and water sports.

I grew up in an era where comedians actually had the benefit of free speech and you simply switched off or walked outyou didn’t find them funny. Common sense used to prevail and adults were able to admonish children as part of their development process. Today the world is dferent, everyone’s opinion matters evenit is illogical, ill-conceived and does not stand the scrutiny of even the most cursory of cross examinations. Politicians have always manipulated the message to try and persuade the electorate that the policy they are peddling today is for our benefit. Once elected they then change tack, claim they never supported the policy that they were elected for and blame the opposition. One of my clients’ recently told me to stop wasting my time writing about Brexit because nobody cares and the subject is now boring. I tend to agree that the subject has been over discussed but sadly it appears to have been under considered by almost all associated with our path to European exit. Local, national and European politicians have patently no clue as to how to deliver a workable and practical orce with both sides predicting a range of dire consequences for the UK economy whether we stay or go. As ever the true position will never be visible to the vast majority of voters and, therefore, we will probably never have the chance to understand our exit deal, whether or not we get the chance to vote on it. Never has the duplicitous nature of politicians been more evident than this shambles we are now watching. Businesses do not have the luxury of endlessly debating a myriad of options, we need to make decisions and act upon them. If we don’t then jobs are lost and families suffer. Locally we are pathetically represented by a group of politicians who appear not to want to undertake the jobs they were elected to do. Maybe I am just cynical but it appears to me that they are hiding in the shadows hoping that someone comes up with a plan for which they have no actual responsibility. That way,it works they can quietly move forward asthey were a part of it,it fails then it was not their fault. Do we not deserve better than this  I read an article in another publication recently, penned by one of my competitors, in which he invoked property professionals to be more optimistic and sell the positives of the NI market. I have spent my entire  year career trying to sell the positives of investing in NI. I have stayed here, built a business, paid taxes, employed many people and hopefully delivered pleasing results for our clients. It would be really nicefor once our politicians could simply deliver us a viable business oriented solution that made le easier rather than the constant uncertainty we face. Imagine business owners delightthe punchline to the gag was “went to the pub and agreed a workable plan”. Now that would make me smile.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/Rocket.jpg","title":"how to make a business rocket","story":"Posted on Wednesday  October  by Ulster Business How does a growing company help its expansion plans really take off  John Mulgrew takes a look at the options available to SMEs here when it comes to fundingWhat does a burgeoning small business do when it’s time to scale up There a numerous options for companies right across the business spectrum – and the options across the traditional banking world are plentul.But there’s additional assistance that can be garnered from less traditional sources, with feedback and support also coming from outside the conventional sphere.David Nelson, partner at KPMG private enterprise, a global professional services firm, says it “works with companies of all sizes and at every stage of their development -  from start-ups to established family businesses.”.“Our people understand what it takes for companies to be successful at every stage of development – from idea to exit – and will help them make the right decisions at every step of the way,” he said.“So the support we give to our clients ranges from business planning and raising capital through to help with expanding internationally, MA, tax advice, RD incentives, technical accounting matters and complying with regulatory requirements.”According to First Trust Bank’s head of business banking, Seamus McGuckin, there are “ious funding options available to assist SMEs as they grow”.“… be that asset finance, invoice discounting, revolving working capital, loan financing or overdraft facilities.“First and foremost, however the more important support we can offer our clients is our expertise and commitment to understanding their needs and then delivering a service to match. It’s through getting to know our clients and their business that we can best share our knowledge and advice around the type of financial support they need.“At First Trust Bank, having listened to what our customers wanted, we invested in six new business centres across Northern Ireland to support fast, local decision making. We also established a Small Business Centre to meet the needs of our smaller customers. Now firmly embedded in their respective communities, these centres – coupled with our expert sectoral advisors – are on hand to help business owners identy opportunity and risks and how best to mitigate or capitalise upon them.”Richard Donnan, head of Northern Ireland at Ulster Bank, says it “is strongly committed to supporting businesses of all sizes, from micro firms right through to large corporates”.“Our latest results show a % in small business drawdowns, and we continue to work hard through initiatives such as our Boost initiative and our Entrepreneur Accelerator to build mutually beneficial relationships with firms across Northern Ireland. “A key focus for the bank is the development of digital services that make it simpler, easier and safer for customers to bank with us. “Our digitally active customer base grew by % year-on-year and we are continuing to respond to that change, for example, by introducing our Business Growth Enablers and through the development of our digital s such as our mobile app.”But it’s not all bank financing. The Growth Loan Fund offers assistance to Northern Ireland-based companies who demonstrate growth, and tend to work within the manufacturing, engineering or tradable services sectors. “Loans will be typically unsecured and personal guarantees will not be sought. The loans provided are expected to be complementary to existing sources of finance, including banks, trade finance sources and equity investors.”Some of the companies availing of the finance include Belfast-based BLK BOX Fitness, which secured £, to grow its online  and boost exports, along with Fermanagh gin-maker Boatyard Distillery.Meanwhile, the BGF was set up in  with £.bn and has since backed close to  companies. Last year, BGF was the UK’s top institutional investor and ranked the seventh most active private investor in the world by number of investments. Upstream is a Belfast-based alternative finance company specialising in SME funding, and has also now introduced a trade finance option for clients. The market-first solution unlocks the ability for businesses to finance their working capital needs end to end, from supplier to buyer.Niall Harkin is director of customer journeys at Danske Bank. He says “personal engagement is still really important” when dealing with small and medium-sized firms looking at expansion.“That’s why last year we introduced a team of  dedicated small business advisers back in to key branches across Northern Ireland, giving customers access to expertise in their local area to discuss business plans and explore funding options,” he said.“Meanwhile, teams of experienced relationship managers supported by specialists in areas such as cash management, markets and trade finance, support our larger SME customers.“At the same time, we’re investing heavily in our digital offering, and recently added the capability for SMEs to get lending decisions in a matter of minutes in ious situations. ‘future financing’ makes the whole credit process much easier for our customers. For an overdraft, we’ve seen approvals in four minutes and access to money well within  hours. “In the future, customers should be able to go online and request an overdraft increase on a smartphone at home.”But aside from the financial support, businesses here can also turn to the support from hubs. That includes Ormeau Baths’s Barclays Eagle Labs – which is located at the south Belfast listed building – and the Ignite NI Propel Pre-Accelerator. The options are out there and available for companies wishing to take that next step, whether traditional banking or alternative streams are the way to go.

The Northern Ireland Hotels Federation said a \"shudder\" was going through the industry, which comprises  hotels and , bedrooms. In Belfast, , rooms were added over the past year, thanks to new construction of six new venues, including the Hampton by Hilton and the Grand Central, and extensions to two existing hotels. The federation said the market was going through a \"stutter\" with occupancy and room rates going down. \"It is important to note that demand for hotel rooms has grown over the last year, but it hasnt kept pace with the increase in supply,\" it added. A separate report by PwC put the cost of an overnight stay in a Belfast hotel at £. The federation predicted a signicant fall in demand next year and , with demand unlikely to catch up with supply until . On day two of industry event Hospitality Exchange, federation chief executive Janice Gault said: \"Market snapshots indicate a stormy  with volatility in the market. Overall analysis shows a reduction in occupancy levels and a decline in rate.\" She said Northern Ireland needed a new tourism selling point - suggesting something like Failte Irelands Wild Atlantic Way promotion, but for the north west and west coast. \"Demand is growing, but this needs to be accelerated with a number of interventions, including increased promotion, a bigger marketing budget and a proposition of scale for Northern Ireland along the lines of the Wild Atlantic Way,\" she added. \"Measures like this will allow the market to adapt to and absorb new supply. There has been a seismic change and a response of equal measure is required to create new business.\" Ms Gault said challenges for the sector included skills and staff, as well as Brexit, which had led to \"considerable uncertainty\". \"Added to this are the issues around tax, in particular VAT, access constraints and capacity at key attractions,\" she said. \"You can see why the market is experiencing a shudder as we come to the end of an era of exceptional trading.\" And while  would be quiet in comparison to the flurry of openings in , it was \"far from dormant\", the federation said. There are to be new openings in Londonderry and Newry and Mourne, while ventures on the north coast are now \"dependent on what has become a protracted planning process\". But Ms Gault said that despite some problems, the hotel sector \"has strong prospects\". However, drawing in more visitors was paramount. \"We need to increase the size of the tourism cake to ensure that each hotel gets a good slice of business,\" she said. \"Having spent in the region of £m, the hotel sector is keen to see aon this investment and a realisation of the industrys potential.\" A full briefing on the forecast takes place this morning at a business breakfast at Hospitality Exchange, which is taking place at the Crowne Plaza, Belfast.
