The unusual background caused a great deal of comment among people on twitter         Mark Coughlan said Barnes was \u0027knocking it out of the park\u0027 despite being in bed         Another user said the interview position was \u0027perfectly normal behaviour\u0027         Callum Chadwick was impressed by the interview between Barnes and Kay BurleySpeaking to reporters at St George\u0027s Park, the Lionesses boss said the most recent outbreak of overt racism on social media shows the problem is \u0027not going away\u0027 despite the positive work being done by anti-discrimination groups such as Kick It Out and the football authorities.\u0027I think we probably have to take drastic measures now as a football community - I\u0027ve had it with my players on social media, the Premier League stars and the Championship have had it,\u0027 said Neville.\u0027I just wonder whether as a football community we come off social media. Because Twitter won\u0027t do anything about it, Instagram won\u0027t do anything about it - they send you an email reply saying they\u0027ll investigate but nothing happens.         Tom Gillespie wanted to know why John Barnes was lying down in bed during the interview         Dave Kayfabe said Barnes was making \u0027great points\u0027 while being interviewed from his bed\u0027I\u0027ve lost total faith in whoever runs these social media departments, so let\u0027s send a powerful message: come off social media (for) six months. Let\u0027s see the effect it has on these social media companies.\u0027Whether enough broadcasters, clubs, leagues, players and sponsors would avoid social media for so long is debatable but the Professional Footballers\u0027 Association did organise a successful boycott in April following a spate of racist incidents targeting Danny Rose and Raheem Sterling.         Manchester United midfielder Paul Pogba, pictured, received online abuse after missing a penalty on Monday night at WolvesNeville said his players are regularly subjected to abuse online and he reminded the room of the appalling death and rape threats that were sent to Karen Carney following a Champions League game between Chelsea and Fiorentina last year.\u0027My players get that kind of abuse all the time, whether it\u0027s racist, whether it\u0027s sexist, whether it\u0027s homophobic, they get that kind of abuse,\u0027 he said.\u0027Nothing gets done about it - that\u0027s why I\u0027ve lost faith in social media companies.\u0027Asked if the football industry should collectively sit down and discuss this with social media companies, Neville said: \u0027Don\u0027t we have that? Don\u0027t we have a task force? The FA are doing everything possible, the Premier League have got campaigns and are doing everything possible.\u0027We\u0027re plugging holes here and then there\u0027s leaks elsewhere, and I\u0027m just focusing on the social media aspect of what Paul went through last night, Tammy last week, my players daily.\u0027Twitter responded to \u0027strongly condemn\u0027 the online abuse aimed at players and revealed it had \u0027permanently suspended a series of accounts\u0027.The social media company is in dialogue with the PFA and Kick It Out but, in a statement released to the PA news agency, claimed \u0027this is a societal issue and requires a societal response\u0027.Twitter\u0027s statement read: \u0027We\u0027re fully aware of and share the concerns surrounding online racist abuse towards certain footballers in the UK over recent days.\u0027We strongly condemn this unacceptable behaviour, and have now permanently suspended a series of accounts for violating our Hateful Conduct Policy.         Several Manchester United players have come out in support of Pogba while the club has also strongly condemned the actions of a minority of fans on social media\u0027We\u0027re proactively monitoring the conversation online and will continue taking robust action on any account which violates our Rules.\u0027This is a societal issue and requires a societal response. This is why we maintain a dialogue with both the PFA and Kick It Out and are committed to working together to address abusive online and racist behaviour across the industry.\u0027We continue to liaise closely with our partners to identify meaningful solutions to this unacceptable behaviour - both offline and on.\u0027 "},{"url":null,"title":"Amazon opens biggest global campus India","story":"Share this article          Indian employees walking inside Amazon\u0027s newly inaugurated campus building in Hyderabad yesterday         More than twice as much steel than the Eiffel Tower in Paris was used in the construction of the new Hyderabad building         Indian employees working on laptops during the first day of operation at the new Amazon Hyderabad buildingFounder Jeff Bezos has committed an investment of over $5 billion for India operations as the company seeks to fend off competition from Walmart Inc\u0027s e-commerce unit Flipkart.Amazon has also been exploring other possible tie-ups with brick-and-mortar retailers in the country.In late December, India modified rules around foreign direct investment in e-commerce, adding to hurdles for Amazon and Flipkart.Amazon started operations in India in 2004 from Hyderabad, but it launched its retail operations only in 2013.The company has since added video streaming and grocery delivery services under its Prime offerings and is also working on a restaurant food delivery service.

The diary appears to have been available to the public online for at least a month. Australia detected the security breach and approached the premier’s office, Asio, and the home affairs minister, Peter Dutton, for comment.The diary was removed from public view almost immediately.Sign up to receive the top stories from  Australia every morningIt is now no longer visible online in any way. Links to the diary have disappeared, and the URL has been removed.The premier’s office described the publication of the name as “an administrative error”.“It has been removed,” a spokesman said. “We apologise and have taken steps to ensure it doesn’t happen again.”The Queensland opposition leader, Deb Frecklington, said the bungle was a “disgrace” and has called for a full investigation.“It has compromised national security and compromised an intelligence officer who is serving our nation,” Frecklington said in a statement.“A full investigation must be carried out into this farce by the Palaszczuk administration.”The mistake is also likely to attract a scathing response from Dutton, a frequent critic of the Queensland Labor government.The law states that names of Asio officers must not be published “except with the consent in writing of the minister or of the director general”. That includes publishing any information that could lead to the identification of an Asio officer, or disclosing that someone residing at an address is “an Asio employee or Asio affiliate, or is in any way connected with an Asio employee or Asio affiliate”.“Protection of the identity of Asis and Asio officers is critical to human intelligence collection as those officers are either working in foreign countries beyond the protection of the Australian government or their identification can lessen the ability of Asio and Asis to perform their national security functions.”Australia’s security agencies have been enforcing secrecy laws with increasing zeal in recent years. The whistleblowers Witness K and Bernard Collaery have been prosecuted for disclosing protected intelligence information.The pair helped reveal an unlawful spy operation conducted by Asis against Timor-Leste, and are now facing potential jail time.Asio declined to comment. Dutton did not respond to a request for comment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bf4b3e2dae9509a92b21f05c5152270bb776c10b/0_340_1080_648/master/1080.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=79a158dd6fce08942495a1a27f2d1b42","title":"tips links and suggestions what are you reading this week","story":"Your space to discuss the books you are reading and what you think of them Welcome to this week’s blogpost. Here’s our roundup of your comments and photos from last week.Let’s begin with a tribute to Ronald Blythe’s Akenfield by PatLux:I just spoke to my 88 year-old mother who is reading Akenfield, which is reminding her of her own rural childhood and the stories told to her by her parents. I had discovered it in a charity shop in Edinburgh and brought it back to Luxembourg to read and enjoy. I then passed it on to my sister in Spain who devoured it and discussed with me scenes that resonated with her. She then gave it to my mother in northern England and when she has finished it we will donate it to the bookstall in our family’s village church for someone else to discover. I wonder where it will go next and I trust that it will give as much joy to the next reader as it has done to three of us. Many thanks to whoever it was on Tips, Links and Suggestions who inspired me to add this title to the list which I take with me to charity shops.MereMortal has “finally got round to starting” Howard Zinn’s “legendary” The People’s History of the United States:I’ve known about it for a decade or more and have owned it for about three years. He’s the most marvellous and sympathetic writer and he brings out of obscurity a wealth of highly character-driven stories of African slaves, American Indians, indentured white European servants, and women. People he considers were always omitted by the founding fathers when they declaimed “we the people”.I’m loving it. Zinn was that rare thing, an American socialist and a superb academic and this book was a massive hit as a history book and has been widely translated around the world.LLCoolJ is in need of lighter reading after finishing one of this year’s Booker nominations, Lost Children Archive by Valeria Luiselli:Here we have a “No names, please” family of four – Ma, Pa, boy, girl – driving from NYC to Arizona. The parents are documentariansdocumentarists (definitions and distinctions provided) who worked together on a sound-recording project that among other things recorded the over 800 languages spoken in NYC (I had no idea there are that many). Ma is now focused on a project about the “lost children” and detained migrants from Central America, and Pa is working on a project related to the Apaches. The marriage, it is announced early on, is ending, and it is projected that the parents will separate at the end of the trip, each taking one of the children.The first half of the book is narrated by ‘Ma’, and I was pulled in right away by the style of the writing. Much of it is muted, internal, Ma’s ruminations about her children and her marriage and her project ... I didn’t participate in the last two RG books because I didn’t feel I had the strength to take on Levi or Steinbeck. This book turned out to be just as harrowing. I expect it will haunt me for a long time, and I feel the need for something frothy next. So … Nina Stibbe, here I come.GELBuck has “just finished” The Frayed Atlantic Edge by David Gange:His series of kayak journeys down the Atlantic coasts of Scotland, Ireland and bits of Wales and England is the thread linking history, culture, geography and nature. A different perspective on our history and a book that makes me want to retire immediately and spend my time reading and kayaking on a west coast somewhere!Ubik by Phillip K Dick has been keeping Bacon78 guessing:The question of what is reality is explored here with a fun plot that keeps you guessing, and the philosophy never gets in the way of a good story. How do I know what I am experiencing is reality? How do I know that I’m not a simulation in an advanced computer, or that my reality is a product of my own imagination, and I’m actually in a coma somewhere on life support? Well, I don’t and neither do the characters in Ubik!!Richard Flanagan’s The Sound of One Hand Clapping has moved paulburns:A heart-wrenching story of a father-daughter relationship, set against the background of WW@ refugees living and working in Tasmania from 1954 to 1990. There are so many twists and turns in the story, most of them unexpected, that it would be unfair to other readers to give too many details. Suffice to say Flanagan writes with lyricism and passion of his beloved island, with his usual deep and sensitive understanding of the human condition.Finally, a eulogy in honour of Sebastian Barry from JayZed:Crikey, Sebastian Barry‘s a splendid writer, isn’t he? I was blown away a few weeks ago by Days Without End, and I’ve now been moved by The Secret Scripture. If I didn’t rate it quite as highly as Days Without End, that’s mostly because I loved DWE so much.A lot of similarities between the two books, despite the contrasting plots. In both Barry is masterful in creating compelling and distinctive narrative voices and both books are ultimately stories which celebrate love and humanity within a context of brutal cruelty.He can certainly write them.If you’re on Instagram, now you can share your reads with us: simply tag your posts with the hashtag #Books, and we’ll include a selection in this blog.

It is putting plans in place to try to cope with the potential impact on a significant portion of its almost 10,000 staff who are EU nationals.O’Reilly said that staff crossing the Spanish-Gibraltar border for work were already frequently becoming stuck in significant queues.“The EU national issue is particularly centred on London for us we have eight casinos in the capital,” he said. “The challenge is potentially after a no-deal Brexit they might not be able to stay in the UK.”O’Reilly said the company is working with staff who want to stay in a post-Brexit scenario to gain the necessary “settled status” to legally remain working. “We are helping people to do what is necessary to get settled status if they want it.”However, he added that Rank could struggle to replenish its workforce in the capital post-Brexit if there are problems with EU nationals being able to come and freely work in the UK."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b45a585d8f511c9f8e0c45b83f401169c95a050a/0_47_3800_2280/master/3800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5f4780d445f5ba605c7cafa7f1078925","title":"qantas tests direct flights from uk and us sydney australia","story":"Three flights scheduled on new Boeing 787-9 as airline looks at introducing route in 2022Qantas is to test non-stop direct flights from London to Sydney to see whether passengers and crew can tolerate what would be the world’s longest commercial flight at 19 hours.The Australian airline will carry 40 passengers and crew on two flights from New York to Sydney and another from London to Sydney.The test passengers on the flights this autumn will mainly be Qantas employees, as well as scientists, with no seats sold on the flights. Passengers and crew will be fitted with wearable technology devices to monitor sleep patterns and food and drink consumption, and to see how lighting, physical movement and inflight entertainment impact their health.Qantas aims to operate regular, non-stop flights to London and New York from Brisbane, Sydney and Melbourne as soon as 2022. The airline will make a decision on whether to introduce the ultra-long routes commercially by the end 2019.The airline, last year, launched direct flights between London and Perth, on the west coast of Australia, a 17-hour journey. However, the three most populous cities in Australia are all on the country’s east coast, and Melbourne is more than 10,300 miles from New York. London to Sydney is 10,500 miles.The test flights will use new Boeing 787-9 planes, with fewer passengers and less luggage than usual to extend the range. However, successful test flights would fire the starting gun on a race between the US firm Boeing and its European rival, Airbus, to sell Qantas their new ultra-long-range aircraft, the 777X and the A350 respectively.The A350 is currently in service on the world’s longest passenger flight: Singapore Airlines’s New York to Singapore slog, which covers 9,500 miles, taking 18 hours and 25 minutes.The proposed new routes reflect a trend in the airline industry to increase direct, long-distance flights, which are generally preferred by passengers. Alan Joyce, Qantas’s chief executive, said that flying a commercial airliner non-stop from New York to Sydney was “truly the final frontier in aviation”, reflecting the immense distances involved.Joyce said the start of the commercial flights on the routes was not a “foregone conclusion”, with questions remaining as to whether the routes would be profitable.“This is ultimately a business decision and the economics have to stack up,” Joyce said.No commercial airline has ever flown direct from New York to Australia, according to Qantas. It said it flew non-stop from London to Sydney in 1989 to mark the entry into service of the Boeing 747-400 jumbo jet, but with only 23 people on board in order to preserve fuel.The working patterns and health of crew will be a key determinant of the viability of the routes. Other ultra-long-haul services currently carry multiple crews who operate on four-hour shifts.Pilots will wear an electroencephalogram (EEG) device to track their brain activity and monitor alertness, so the airline can study the most effective rest pattern. Researchers from Melbourne’s Monash University will also record levels of melatonin – a chemical determining travellers’ experience of jet lag – before, during and after the flights.Qantas has already used its Perth to London route to test shift patterns. The airline will also test variations on food choices, separate areas for stretching and different entertainment options.Qantas, Australia’s flag carrier, has operated a service to Britain since 1938, using flying boats made by the UK company Short Brothers. In 1959, Qantas became the first non-American airline to take delivery of jet aircraft that enabled it to reach the US direct. However, until the Perth flight, travellers between the UK and Australia had to stop in airports such as Singapore or, more recently, Dubai.Aircraft manufacturers are getting better at making cabins habitable for extended periods of time, according to Dr Richard Dawood, a specialist in travel medicine at the Fleet Street Clinic.Modern planes using carbon-fibre construction can withstand higher air pressure, reducing the uncomfortable feeling of altitude that makes flyers’ ears pop. Humidity can be higher with fewer metal parts, reducing some of the discomfort associated with flying.Long-haul travel still takes its toll on the body, however. Deep-vein thrombosis (DVT), blood clots that can form particularly in the legs, is one peril. Although it is rare in otherwise healthy people, it has led some airlines to consider allowing more space for passengers to move.“Sitting in any seat for 19 hours is something that carries an increased risk of thrombosis,” said Dawood. “It would be even more important than normal to get up, move around, stretch.”There is some evidence that irregular sleeping patterns have a negative effect on the health of shift workers, he added, making monitoring crew health even more important.There’s also jet lag, but no amount of clever design can prevent changing time zones from disrupting the body’s internal clock. Flying from west to east is worse because the body finds it harder to adapt to a shorter day than a longer one. Scientists are ided as to the effectiveness of melatonin supplements in fighting jet lag, while exposure to bright lights can help the body to adapt."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/893ef89796e0d80cc149701401f0ad20e1497c83/0_0_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d8c00dcd1a3af1f8a067c98226c2aaf9","title":"royal mail union to launch strike ballot over workers rights","story":"More than 100,000 staff given vote on strike over job security and ‘culture of bullying’ More than 100,000 Royal Mail workers will vote on whether to strike over grievances about job security, an alleged culture of bullying, and the terms and conditions of their employment.The Communication Workers Union (CWU) will begin balloting its members from 24 September, with the result expected in early October.Relations between Royal Mail and the union have deteriorated amid disagreement over the implementation of the four pillars agreement, a deal reached between the two parties last year.The union has said a culture of bullying in the workplace had not been tackled since the agreement, with local CWU officers being disciplined.The deputy general secretary, Terry Pullinger, told a CWU meeting that members should get ready for the “fight of your lives”.The CWU said Royal Mail bosses were “following their own agenda that will have long-term detrimental effects on our members’ terms and conditions of employment, job security and the future of Royal Mail Group as a whole.”The four pillars agreement was one of the final acts of the former chief executive, Moya Greene, covering pay rises, pension proposals and moves to reduce working hours from 39 to 35 a week by 2022, subject to productivity improvements.The CWU said that labour relations have worsened since Greene was succeeded by Rico Back, who courted controversy when he picked up a £6m “golden hello” for taking over the company.Walkouts are now running at more than one a week, including small, rural offices not noted for militancy, a CWU source said.The union has also voiced concern about the company’s decision to move its Parcelforce business to a separate legal entity.Parcelforce has previously attracted criticism over the employment conditions faced by drivers, some of whom claimed they were charged £250 a day if they were off sick. has approached Royal Mail for comment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9da4258611b8462f1549b0fc6c16591dd49853e3/0_237_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=acc1d26c792b06864fc7bb0ebd42f300","title":"brexit northern ireland border","story":"As Boris Johnson journeyed back from this week’s desperate trip to Germany and France, he might have reflected on his hero Churchill and those “dreary steeples of Fermanagh and Tyrone.” Somehow those totems of Britain’s archaic colonisation of Ireland refuse to release their stranglehold on British politics. And here was Johnson at their mercy, being lectured by Angela Merkel and Emmanuel Macron on how to govern them. It was intolerable.Johnson got no joy in Berlin or Paris. Merkel’s meaningless 30-day “talks” period was greeted with ecstasy by his Tory press claque. But Macron merely pointed out that nothing had changed. The steeples were still there, telling London what not to do.As of now, the Downing Street cabal of Johnson, Dominic Cummings and Michael Gove may have a plan, however costly, on how to crash out of the European Union’s customs union. They still have no plan for Northern Ireland. There, no deal promises the ultimate horror, of a return to policing the 1921 partitioning of Ireland, this time with some ramshackle arrangement of border posts, customs checks and massive evasion.The partition was meant to be temporary. It has long been an agony for Britain, leaving it with an overseas province ided on religious lines and simmering with hostility towards and from its neighbour in the south. Two decades ago the Good Friday agreement appeared to ease the tension. Economic convergence replaced political antagonism. At long last, Northern Ireland generated good news, not bad.A soft Brexit offered no change to this state of grace. It honoured the economic union of Ireland by keeping the UK within the customs union and single market. But Johnson wants a hard Brexit. In his letter to the EU this week, he openly trumpeted “ergence” in trading standards, regulations and tariffs within the island of Ireland. He seeks to liberate Northern Ireland, as an indissoluble part of the UK, from what he sees as intolerable intrusion by outsiders in UK laws and regulations. He somehow believes these intrusions would not apply to trade with China or the US. He disagrees with Macron, that British free trade with China or America would lead to more insistent “vassalisation” than anything from Brussels.To avoid fixed barriers across 300 miles of lanes and cart tracks in Northern Ireland, Johnson now imagines a “virtual” border, bureaucratic and technological, pulled back from the frontier to a digital wonderland of trusted traders, certificates, surveillance cameras, inspection points and passport checks. These would be located somewhere between the Irish border and Belfast airport and docks. The same checks would have to apply to the £3bn a year of British goods moving south to Dublin and the EU. Trucks would flow as now, but the customs would catch up with them later on, to monitor animal health and food standards, collect tariffs and somehow chase after those evading new limits on EU immigrants.All involved in these negotiations – from Merkel and Macron to the humblest border official – say the same. What is Johnson talking about? A border is a border, wherever located. Trade ergence is ergence, a tariff is a tariff and a check a control. These are frictions, barriers to trade, whether concrete or virtual. Could Johnson please cite just one comparable example of his border, as the EU tariff expert Sabine Weyand asks, “anywhere on Earth?” Or is this just posturing for the rightwing press? Most people I know do not understand the Irish backstop. They treat it like the Schleswig-Holstein question, so impenetrable as to be merely a badge of tribal machismo – for or against. That “question” too was over a provincial border, and it took Prussia to war twice with Denmark. Borders are real. They are not just gates. They mark out the geography of sovereignty. They need guards and they draw blood.The Irish backstop is not a guarantee, as the EU calls it. It is a demand that London acknowledges its blatant inconsistency. Northern Ireland cannot both remain in commercial union with the rest of Ireland and yet join whole-heartedly in Johnson’s new WTO regime for Britain. There is no point in kicking this can down the road. Britain should confront the contradictions long inherent in Northern Ireland’s ambiguous status. The EU is saying to Britain, grow up.In the present context of hard Brexit, this can only lead in one of two directions. The EU can back off and indeed agree to kick the can down the road. It can pretend to time-limit the Irish backstop and see what happens. If that might reactivate Theresa May’s withdrawal agreement, permit Brexit in October and let tempers cool for a negotiation of a new trade deal in the transition, it might be worth it. But in reality it would just postpone the agony, and the EU clearly has no intention of doing that, however much Johnson puffs and blusters. Or the prime minister could defy the DUP and agree to a separate, soft-Brexit status for Northern Ireland in relation to the south. This would accept some border arrangement down the Irish Sea, with a de facto border at sea ports. It would eliminate any need for the backstop. Brexit could proceed as Johnson promised on 31 October.This must be the moment for Johnson to call the DUP’s bluff. If Britain really is to crash out of the EU in two months, there will have to be border controls somewhere round the shores of the Irish Sea. The EU cannot let Ireland become open country for smuggling. Nor can Britain accept a flood of incoming EU food when its own exports are subject to EU tariffs.A majority in the north is clearly ready for exceptional status. Northern Ireland would remain in the United Kingdom. It might be drawn more into the orbit of the south, but that has already been the consequence of the Good Friday agreement – and a welcome one. It is better than a slither back to super-partition, as horribly echoed in this week’s paramilitary shooting in Belfast.Northern Ireland must one day free itself from the shackles of its past, shackles that still drearily hang round its political neck. It cannot be too much to imagine a beneficial legacy of Brexit being the liberation of the province from this anachronistic incubus, a legacy that steers all of Ireland on a path, however slowly, towards a stable and contented union."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fd847f380d2c45864e155b7a9d45c93d277b40dd/0_62_4928_2955/master/4928.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=44a4eb8fbbaf0f29896fc3ad6798f45d","title":"children arts ebacc gcse","story":"The Ebacc system puts children off arts subjects at GCSE. They should be allowed to study the subjects that interest themThese figures show one thing very clearly: that politicians should stay out of the pathways pupils choose throughout their education. I am excited by the increase in pupils taking visual art, but I am dismayed that some children who are good at art as well as drama, or art as well as music, have had to choose one subject over the other because of the structure of Michael Gove’s Ebacc wheeze, whereby even if a child can find a school that offers a timetable where art and music do not conflict, then only one subject will be counted in the Ebacc league table.Many headteachers ignore the Ebacc league table and sensibly focus elsewhere when it comes to celebrating their schools, but nonetheless the Ebacc is skewing the focus of our young people and damaging their wellbeing, their voices and their careers. There has been some comment from the creative industries that this uptake in visual art is a good thing for Britain plc as it puts us back on the mythical map as “Creative Britain”. But it’s not very creative if pupils are not studying design technology in a school with no woodwork shop. A school is not a creative space with no music.Let children do the subjects they want to do.

They can afford to teach arts subjects out of school hours – and they know that pupils who study the arts, who can sing, who can design, design their own future and ours. Our culture is made from all of us – rich and poor, black and white – and so should our art be made by all people, not just the wealthy who can afford to pay for music lessons and independent schools.I studied art in a different age. In the 1970s there was an idea in the comprehensive system that the arts were key to the development of all children. Art teachers were working in the aftermath of the child art movement. The movement was initiated by the Austrian printmaker Franz Cižek in the late 19th century. He strongly believed in the value of creativity to children – and he used his methods to help children deal with trauma in the aftermath of the first world war. Art was used as an antidote.Earlier this year, with the help of the Imperial War Museum and the 14-18 NOW project, we invited all A-level and FE students to make a work about what peace meant to them. The project was called Make Art Not War, and some extraordinary work was made. The project will run again next year.It’s exciting to think of the arts as something unique in the school day. Art is a subject that can involve all areas of study and critically encourages children to have the confidence to air their original voices and thoughts. All school leavers need to feel that their contribution matters and counts for something.I am sick of operating in an art culture that is run by the privileged, where politicians who studied classical culture have the temerity to tell the general population what their children should be studying – and where culture is seen as something some people have and others don’t. All people have culture and all schoolchildren should be shown it and asked to participate within it.I teach at London politan University in east London. It’s probably the only art school in the UK that can claim to be properly erse. Our students come from a broad range of cultures and show up what’s on offer in most art schools because the art world is too male and pale. When will we learn to hear our children’s voices? We have so much to learn from them, and the first step in doing that is ditching the Ebacc.• Bob and Roberta Smith is the pseudonym of British contemporary artist Patrick Brill"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a06cff28aa8e6a04dfb2154f0cbdb2668e469ff0/0_310_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1cfe5620bc2e03bba5b430d652155c1f","title":"peppa pig world value nostalgia","story":"I felt bad about what I was going to do – drag my children to a town off the south coast where I used to go on holiday as a child – and I thought they deserved a reward for indulging me. At the end of the trip, there would be a two-day pass for Peppa Pig World, vaguely on our way back to London and as tedious for me, I assumed, as the experience of eating crab sandwiches on the front at Ventnor would be for them.The entire vacation this summer has featured this kind of unstated trade-off for my twin four-year-olds, the price of the fun fair, the endless cave-in to demands for sweets and ice-cream (and some heavy lifting in the Sainsbury’s toy aisle), was two cathedrals, a museum about Roman Britain and a trip up a 14th-century bell tower, featuring 249 steps and some commentary about the tomb of King John. But the Isle of Wight was the big one: four days devoted entirely to the experience of watching me wander, misty-eyed, around small gift shops and a lot of extremely long walks along the cliffs.This was the definition of a wholesome holiday itinerary. And yet it wasn’t one I entirely approved of. Revisiting the past can be a bad idea and when it came to the Isle of Wight, I felt sheepish about my own needs. It seemed a bit mawkish, travelling the vast distance from our home in New York to a tiny corner of southern England, and for what? The people I had known on the island were long gone. It was an exercise in nostalgia that promised to be entirely lost on my children.Last summer I made them walk outside the house where I grew up while they bickered and remained stoutly uninterested. Driving through central London last week, my excitement at passing Gray’s Inn Road and reminiscing about the times I’d walked up it failed, amazingly, to elicit any follow-up questions. When your kids are young, you can hit on any destination or activity and call it tradition, coding them to remember it fondly in adulthood. We could make a pilgrimage to the beach on Long Island every year and they would, of course, connect with it as strongly in adulthood as I do with my own childhood memories.When it comes to vacations, however, sentimentality seems to be a general condition this summer almost everyone I know has been marching their children across the country to some out-of-the-way place where their parents, in turn, had marched them. The strength of this impulse has proven weirdly irresistible. It is partly, I suspect, because of the special status afforded to summer holidays in one’s memory, and partly a foreshadowing of midlife crisis, with its panic that the world is too changed.To my eyes, the Isle of Wight seemed in some ways bizarrely altered. It was smaller and a little shabbier. It also seemed more eccentric. We wandered into a second world war-themed coffee shop one day, where gas masks dangled peculiarly from the walls, and backed up to wander straight out again. Union flags flew on many buildings throughout the town. “It was always like that,” said my dad when I rang him, and I had a momentary realignment of memory. In other ways, the place was gloriously as I remembered. The clifftops were gorgeous the crab sandwiches sublime. The food was so fresh it made our decision to live in the city seem foolish.One day, coming back from the cove we visited every day of the trip, my friends and I stopped by a clear-running stream and had a full Swallows and Amazons moment – watching our children fish in the shallow water with nets, shrieking with delight at the pebbles beneath their feet and shivering in the under-par weather. It might have been sentimental, but the continuity with my own childhood was so soothing it was practically narcotic.On the way home, we duly went to Peppa Pig World. The buildup for the trip had gone on for three months, and the kids were almost hysterical. I can hardly blame the park for that, but still the queues were too long, the rides were too short and the entire place seemed to have a problem with wasps. My kids fretted and groused and lost their minds in the gift shop, which punters were forced to walk through before they could exit the park.Given the choice, I’m sure my kids would pick fairground rides over a walk along a cliff, or a 14th-century bell tower at that. But the fact is that the no-frills theme park of going back in time was the best bit of the holiday for all of us. Very occasionally, the past beats the present.• Emma Brockes is a  columnist based in New York"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5f3dffe5dece5d940dce820237edf7584415910d/479_151_2983_1790/master/2983.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=79f6d8427081c9099a73f4d113272cd5","title":"the best stephen king movies ranked","story":"With It Chapter Two out next month, plus the news that an adaptation of The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon is back on track, we count down the finest big-screen versions of King’s terrifying talesCujo arguably has more thrills. Apt Pupil certainly has more chills. But with his sole directorial effort, Stephen King – that great chronicler of retro Americana – somehow made the perfect drive-in movie: a silly, slapdash nightmare of murderous vehicles and appliances attacking hysterical patrons (including a bewildered Emilio Estevez) at a truck stop.King gets arguably his prettiest screen surrogate in this slick, twisty thriller about a blocked writer (Johnny Depp) whose favoured lakeside retreat is interrupted by a vengeful rival (John Turturro) in a distinctive hat. The original novella – adapted and directed by the veteran scriptwriter David Koepp – perhaps reveals one of King’s own greatest fears: being accused of plagiarism.Ban this sickle filth! King’s unsettling short story about a pagan cult of killer kids was originally published in Penthouse in 1977 and has so far inspired 10 screen adaptations. The atmospheric original – featuring a supremely creepy choral score and a young Linda Hamilton having a Midsommar moment – is the best of a mostly rotten crop.This exuberant horror anthology, styled as a disreputable comic, features five tales of cosmic comeuppance scripted by King and directed by the zombie overlord George A Romero. One of its greatest delights is King’s extended cameo as an unlucky hillbilly transmogrifying into a mossy mutant, an appropriate metaphor for his fecund imagination.Originally debuting on HBO before a negligible cinema release, this cheap chiller based on a King short story is worth tracking down for Miguel Ferrer’s ferocious performance. The RoboCop star plays a needlessly combative tabloid hack who takes to the skies to hunt for a bloodthirsty airborne serial killer.Fur good or ill, this earthy adaptation of one of King’s most upsetting novels messes with audience’s memories of the previous 1989 movie. But the story of a young family attempting to reverse tragedy with the help of an unholy burial ground retains a gut-churning charge, and clearly benefits from recent advances in creepy cat makeup.After expanding King’s novella The Shawshank Redemption, the writerdirector Frank Darabont went even bigger with another of the author’s old-timey prison tales, originally published in serial form. At a leisurely three hours, The Green Mile is a textured tearjerker that finds magical realism on death row in 1930s Louisiana, with prison guard Tom Hanks looking increasingly anguished as Michael Clarke Duncan’s gentle but doomed inmate symbolically absorbs the pain of his captors.No ghouls or demons for a change, but a real-life monster still lurks at the heart of King’s 1992 bestseller, written as one continuous screed to mimic the testimony of its title character. Kathy Bates is terrific as the flinty carer suspected of murdering her well-off charge the intervention of her estranged journalist daughter (Jennifer Jason Leigh) triggers flashbacks to their traumatic shared past. The caustic back-and-forth between mother and daughter anchors Taylor Hackford’s resonant drama, skilfully adapted for the screen by Tony Gilroy.Blood and chrome: Christine is a sentient, supernatural 1958 Plymouth Fury with the power to turn her dweeby owner Keith Gordon into a pomaded dreamboat – plus a killer jealous streak. This bloody coming-of-age tale takes a while to shift into high gear, but the director, John Carpenter, crafts some memorable images from King’s slightly daft source material, notably a flaming Christine bearing down on a fleeing greaser on a lonely country road.This enjoyably wham-bam sci-fi satire is an adaptation of a quickie King novel – written under his pseudonym Richard Bachman – that bins most of the plot except the juicy premise: in the near-future, a lethal, rigged TV manhunt distracts the masses while the elites live it up. Schwarzenegger is the freedom fighter who looks indomitable even in yellow dex while real-life US gameshow host Richard Dawson brings some authentic smarm as the villain.Looking back, 2017 was a feast of Stephen: a cinematic King love-in with ballooning highs (the runaway success of It) and whoopee-cushion lows (the shrug that greeted would-be epic The Dark Tower). Amid those extremes, Gerald’s Game – one of two King movies released that year by Netflix – got a little lost in the shuffle. Essentially, it is 127 Hours with added Viagra: Carla Gugino is left handcuffed to a bed in a remote love nest after some role-play with her husband goes awry. The slap-and-tickle set-up swiftly becomes a claustrophobic life-or-death struggle, with the never-better Gugino digging deep through past trauma to find the means to survive.Writerdirector Frank Darabont’s third (and most recent) King adaptation swaps the golden-hued past of The Green Mile and The Shawshank Redemption for something far more contemporary played out in shades of grey. Big-city artist Thomas Jane and his son are trapped in a small-town supermarket when an unearthly mist rolls in. If the fog is obscuring nightmarish tentacle-monsters outside, things are not much better within, where a microcosm of US society rapidly fractures into volatile tribal factions. The critical response was muted on release – perhaps because of Darabont’s revised ending to the 1980 novella, a wicked kicker that King openly admired – but it increasingly feels like a prescient modern fable.How to explain the runaway success of It, one of the most successful horror films of all time, making $700m worldwide? King’s bestselling 1,100-page whopper of a book and the 1990 TV mini-series helped elevate shape-shifting killer clown Pennywise into a potent cultural bogeyman. But the decision to chop the novel’s cross-cutting timelines into two discrete chunks probably helped, too. Argentinian director Andy Muschietti delivered a well-crafted ghost train of slick, disorientating shocks against an evocative 1980s backdrop. Now all he has to do is repeat the trick without the Stranger Things trappings for the looming sequel, Chapter Two.In this inventive chamber piece – originally a King audiobook short story – John Cusack plays a failed novelist turned paranormal debunker surveying supposedly haunted B\u0026ampBs. Lured to a grand old NYC hotel by a mysterious postcard, he insists on staying in accursed room 1408 despite grave warnings from the dapper manager, Samuel L Jackson. That Cusack’s wise-ass cynic will get rattled and unravel is a given. What is impressive is the visual panache that, with the logic of a dream, slowly turns an ordinary-looking room into a phantasmagorical apocalypse.“Do you guys wanna go see a dead body?” King’s novella about a hardscrabble young gang trying to kill time during the holidays by embarking on a questionable quest ended up being directed by Rob Reiner. The Spinal Tap man coaxed winning performances from his fresh-faced ensemble, notably River Phoenix’s soulful scrapper. Despite the occasional ersion into mass puking, the movie is infused with such heart and warmth that it has become a touchstone for almost every smalltown lazy-summer tale since. Reiner even wraps it all up in 90 minutes, adding to the sense of something ineffable gone too soon.Hammer time: Reiner took another rather less heartwarming shot at adapting King with this suspenseful thriller. James Caan is the mangled author who wakes up after a snowy car crash to find himself being nursed by Kathy Bates’s attentive fan who, despite her perky exterior, takes a rather dim view of his plans to kill off her favourite character. It is a tightly orchestrated battle of wills with one rightly infamous scene of anti-surgery. Bates deservedly won an Oscar, but Caan – usually Hollywood’s most capable bruiser – is great, too.King’s original novella about a seemingly mild-mannered banker imprisoned in 1948 for a double murder was all about playing the long game. So it seems appropriate that it took a decade or so for Darabont’s well-appointed adaptation (evocatively shot by Roger Deakins) to creep up the IMDb rankings to reach the giddiest heights of all-time best film polls. The abuses that Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) endures in Shawshank Penitentiary over almost two decades seem all too real and relatable, but they also make his victories – one particularly operatic – seem all the sweeter.Stanley Kubrick’s poised and chilly adaptation of King’s third novel is literally a cult movie: the 2012 documentary Room 237 profiled the fans and theorists who have pored over its meticulous production design for clues to some higher truth. It is certainly the most heightened of slashers, hacking a route into our collective consciousness thanks to Jack Nicholson’s feral performance. For years, King apparently hated it, but has belatedly brought Stanley in from the cold: his 2013 novel Doctor Sleep is a sequel to both his 1977 novel and Kubrick’s version (with its own movie due this Halloween).It didn’t take long for Hollywood to realise the prolific King was the equivalent of discovering a new oil field when it came to horror movies: his debut novel was in cinemas within two years of publication. Brian De Palma turned King’s tale of horrendous high-school bullying and psychokinetic wrath into something like a high-school heist movie, with mean girl Nancy Allen patiently plotting disproportionate revenge against Sissy Spacek’s browbeaten, willowy wallflower. Despite the 2013 remake, De Palma’s bloody blowout remains the definitive version.When Christopher Walken’s likable everyman Johnny Smith wakes up from a coma, the rest of the world – including his sweetheart – has moved on. All he has left is an increasingly frazzled hairstyle and the ability to predict the future through touch. Then an encounter with a rabble-rousing populist politician (Martin Sheen, a long way from The West Wing) fills Johnny’s noggin with a nightmare vision of the future president, and he goes to extreme lengths to prevent nuclear war. Built around Walken’s wistful performance, David Cronenberg’s thriller is patient, understated and – despite his surgical reputation – surprisingly warm-hearted, while also being a timeless examination of the age-old quandary: would you kill baby Hitler?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/46b26e36390e9068ca9d988bbf2e9be258d999d4/0_76_3390_2034/master/3390.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=82d9464126f265ffd44afe1ad8ce937b","title":"share your reaction and experiences to gcse results day 2019","story":"Share photos, videos and stories with us as pupils across the country get their GCSE resultsAs we reach the third results day since the new, tougher GCSE exams were introduced, we would like to hear your experiences.The reformed GCSEs were reported as causing stress and serious anxiety for schoolchildren, while the tougher exams are widening the gap between the results achieved by disadvantaged and better-off pupils in England.We want to hear from pupils and educators about how you been affected by the new GCSEs.

On Koehler’s arm is a scratch – red, jagged and freshly acquired, though not in the way one might expect of a dog groomer.“There was no way I could pin the head,” Koehler says, referring to the snake that was partly responsible. She had grabbed hold however she could, which made it “pissed”: “It decided to coil up and just throw itself at me.” Startled, Koehler had fallen backwards, cutting herself on a vine – an injury far preferable to the bite of a Burmese python.“I have never been bit,” she proudly adds. “Peggy’s been bit once, but really, we’re very careful.”Three days a week, Koehler runs Hair of the Dog with her partner of 31 years, Peggy van Gorder. The other four days the couple are usually out chasing pythons as members of Patric: the Python Action Team – Removing Invasive Constrictors, which is managed by the Florida fish and wildlife conservation commission (FWC).Koehler and Van Gorder’s love affair with Burmese pythons began in 2016, when the FWC held its second python challenge. (The first was held in 2013 there have been none since.) A month-long public hunt held on a vast expanse of state forests and other government-owned land north of Everglades national park, the challenge was designed to cull numbers while also raising public awareness about a growing ecological problem.The couple registered and were issued a permit to hunt in designated areas of south Florida. Then they attended a live-capture tutorial, also offered by the FWC. “They bring one in a bag and they drop it on the ground, and they say: ‘Catch it!’” says Van Gorder, adding that this is where they learned the safest way to grab a snake is by its head.After 80 hours of trudging through cypress forests and freshwater marshland, Koehler and Van Gorder did not catch a single snake, but fellow participants removed 106 pythons. Those who had caught the most and also the longest pythons shared in over $16,000 of prizes.“We usually achieve our goals,” Koehler says, still disappointed by their efforts in the challenge. Determined, they acquired another permit (no longer required for 22 FWC-managed areas as of 2017, when the commission declared open season on pythons) and kept looking for another two months, until they came across an eight-footer. “My heart stopped,” Van Gorder recalls, though now the size seems, to both of them, almost quaint.Burmese pythons have no natural predators here. They do, however, have an uncanny ability to swallow things significantly larger than their own heads. Able to grow to more than 20ft in length, these stealthy invaders ambush their prey, squeeze until the prey stops breathing and then split their jaw apart to take the prey whole. They can inflict a nasty wound on humans – when Van Gorder was bitten, it took five months for one of the broken teeth to work its way out – but the chances of anything more serious happening are slim (though not impossible). Masters of camouflage, they can slide by an eagle-eyed biologist in just a few inches of water, and they can cover huge distances. One was recently discovered coiled up on a floating crab pot more than 15 miles out to sea.But it’s not just the smaller, soft animals who have been attacked. In December 2016, a YouTube video showed a Burmese python in Big Cypress national preserve, next to the Everglades, strangling an alligator. This viral video led the executive director of the South Florida water management district, who was horrified by what he saw, to create the district’s own Python Elimination Program, in 2017. “He said he wanted to put 25 outdoorsmen with guns out in the field,” recalls Mike Kirkland, an invasive animal biologist who was charged with assembling the original team.Damage done by the pythons to south Florida ecosystems has become so acute in recent years that the quest to stop has turned into a collective crusade. Wildlife biologists, government agencies, zoos and universities are deploying a full arsenal of responses, from telemetry tracking to early research into pheromone manipulation.In addition, the FWC and the South Florida water management district each created independent python removal squads in 2017 of hardy, civic-minded iniduals who are skilled at capturing the non-native constrictors. These iniduals must be over 18, and they must pass a stringent vetting process. Once licensed as professionals, they are charged with removing pythons from a patchwork quilt of district, state and federal lands that also, in the case of the Python Action Team, includes Everglades national park, which is off-limits to non-Patric hunters. The issue is also on the minds of ordinary citizens who haven’t been officially tasked with stalking the species. When I mentioned the pythons in passing to a well-known Florida author, he emailed back a photo of himself holding up one he’d recently shot. “Them damn pythons,” he wrote.Koehler and Van Gorder applied to the FWC and were accepted on the second round. They found a hatchling their first night on the job. “Nobody’s doing this for the money,” Van Gorder says, though team members are paid for their time and effort. Instead, she sees it as an act of community service. A self-described “army brat”, she is not really from anywhere. But she feels like she finally has a home in Florida. Catching the pythons is a way of “protecting what I care about, the environment and my home,” she says.Some of the couple’s customers have caught wind of what they get up to in the wilderness. “They’re like, ‘Whatever you do, just keep them from getting up here.’” As Koehler says this, a small papillon dog skitters across the waiting room floor. I can’t help but ask if they’ve ever considered the fact that a Burmese python would swallow all of their clients’ pets if given half a chance. Both women laugh as Van Gorder retrieves a dog collar. It is made from the skin of a python hatchling. She crafts these herself.Tom Rahill meets me at a gas station on the outskirts of Miami, not far from the Everglades and Francis S Taylor wildlife management area, which is where he has agreed to take me on a “python survey”. Like Koehler and Van Gorder, Rahill is a member of the Python Action Team. He’s also founder of the Swamp Apes, a grassroots organization that has been approaching the python problem in a very different way – to help veterans address trauma.Around the same time, he was thinking about two family members in the armed services who were “banged up emotionally”. And then it occurred to him that what he was doing in the Everglades might be of value to them, too: “What a perfect group of people to get out here and experience the ruggedness of this, honor on a mission.”The “mission” being the trail clearing and Burmese pythons. Describing it as “wilderness therapy”, Rahill estimates he has taken out more than a hundred veterans over the past 10 years, and he says that the adrenaline of the hunt gives them an opportunity to work through PTSD – a claim that has the backing of psychologists at the University of South Florida. The Swamp Apes do not kill pythons because the last thing a veteran needs is further exposure to violence, Rahill says. Instead, they name many of the snakes they catch and deliver them live to an FWC facility roughly 40 miles north-east of the Everglades, where a coordinator can humanely euthanize them.With his ponytail and unruly beard, Rahill looks like he spends a lot of time out in the marsh, and he does: at least three nights a week, often until sunrise. He spontaneously bursts into song about snakes, about his grandson, about rural decline in America.As dusk turns to darkness, we swing off the paved road on to a dirt levee surrounded by vast expanses of saw grass. White mayflies cover the windshield, and invisible midges (appropriately named “no-see-ums”) begin to bite my eyelids. Outside is an eerie quiet, the faint smell of watery rot, an orange glow from the city refracted across the wetlands. Nighthawks swoop through the headlights, but we keep our eyes fixed on the dirt, watching to see if it moves.After nearly three hours of driving without a single python sighting – “I caught three last night!” Rahill protests – he pulls up behind another truck. He hands me off to two comrades, Sgt Joe “Mojo” Detre and Sgt Maj Tom Aycock.Detre rides in the flatbed with a spotlight while Aycock, born to be a drill instructor, steers along the levee. “My wife was like: ‘This is the craziest thing,’” he says. But Melanie Aycock soon demanded they take her out too, and she has since become an avid python tracker herself. Both are now also members of the FWC’s Python Action Team, and they usually spend Valentine’s Day hunting.Melanie suffers from debilitating migraines, which causes depression. “So being able to get her out and into nature, and exposed,” he says, “it’s kind of the same concept as getting the veterans out here.”After another few hours of driving, we have still seen no pythons. But Aycock and Detre are not particularly bothered there’s always tomorrow, or next week. Before we part ways, Aycock says that he has something to show me.We pull into a poorly lit section at the back of a casino and he and Detre lift a white box out of the truck. It looks like a beer cooler, except it’s padlocked and has air holes. Inside the box is a material bag, and inside the bag is a 9ft Burmese python that Aycock captured the night before and named Fred.“Calm down, Fred,” Aycock says, as Detre grabs the agitated reptile and hoists it out.Liberated from the bag, the python writhes like an octopus tentacle. For a moment its tail coils around Detre’s calf. “See that? It’s trying to grab him,” Aycock says, launching into another story about the time a python coiled around his own leg, and then his arm, and then went for his neck, until he bodyslammed it.Behind us, patrons trickle out into the parking lot. A woman, singing to herself, wanders past and climbs into a car, blithely unaware of what is unfolding right next to her.There are many unknowns when it comes to Burmese pythons in south Florida. The earliest recorded sighting was on the edge of Everglades national park in 1979, but nobody knows for sure how one became many. A popular (but possibly apocryphal) theory is that hundreds of them escaped from a breeding facility flattened in 1992’s Hurricane Andrew. Another theory, more widely accepted, is that the blame rests largely with irresponsible pet owners.Much of what is known about the python invasion is due to efforts by the Conservancy of Southwest Florida and its collaborators – what Ian Bartoszek, the conservancy’s research manager, calls “six years of hard work of staying on the tail of these animals”.When I visit the conservancy, an environmental advocacy not-for-profit in Naples, I am ushered into a lab filled with snake skeletons and a giant screen showing a map of south-west Florida covered in dots, each one representing a python that is currently being tracked. A freeze-dried constrictor is coiled up in the corner, but the star attraction is 16ft and 160lb of grossly intimidating girth draped across a dissection table.“You should have seen us trying to pull this thing out of the freezer yesterday,” says Bartoszek, who is 42 but as passionate as a teenager at his first science fair.If left unchecked, the impact of such gorging will be silence. Native mammals are already being overwhelmed, either eaten or (like the Florida panther, which hunts deer) outcompeted for food. Pythons have been found to feed on at least 43 species of bird, too, including the magnificent frigatebird, which is an alarming achievement. (“It soars!” Bartoszek says.) What will remain – what already remains, in some areas – is a landscape empty of virtually every animal except fish, rats, a few amphibians and more snakes.While Bartoszek talks, his colleagues slice the python’s underbelly open from head to tail. Inside are 86 eggs, arranged like rows of hand grenades.Within a 55 sq mile chunk of Collier county, the conservancy has removed enough pythons to outweigh a small aircraft. Bartoszek and his team have also weaponized male pythons out in the field.

For the whole back end of the last century, butter – for its animal fats – was the enemy of the health-conscious. We all ate spreads (Flora for everyday, Olivio if you were fancy), as part of an ongoing commitment to being better than other people. You don’t ask too many questions about how things taste when that is your motive. How else do you explain the mung bean?Then fat dropped out of the banned-substance list, replaced by processed food in general, and refined carbohydrates in particular. Butter and marge had a complete reversal of reputation: the first, having little process attached, was rehabilitated, while the second, forged with methods so complicated they had to introduce ridiculous non-words for it (interesterfied, anyone?), fell out of fashion.Butter’s golden age lasted mere seconds: veganism, dairy-related animal cruelty concerns and environmentalism have driven a fresh appetite to find alternatives. We are typically not swapping it out for heavily processed vegetable fat spreads, whose sales continue to decline. There is a difference between margarines and their affiliates, but not enough to trouble anyone with aspirations to gourmetdom. I have become convinced that they are so engineered that any variation in taste is based on focus groups – how much do you want it to taste of butter? Will you accept any real butter mixed into it? – rather than some manufacturers being better than others. Flora is anodyne – almost entirely mouthfeel rather than taste, and a very inoffensive, almost absent mouthfeel at that. Bertolli is perfectly serviceable, though it is not entirely olive oil – the greater part is sunflower and palm oil – and is not free from animal products, so useless if your future is vegan.The real creativity boom is in replacements for butter that are natural and unprocessed (I am not counting “grinding things up” as processing, even though it is plainly a process).You have to decide what you wanted the butter for in the first place. On bread, for instance, I want that oleaginous solid layer, against which your classic carb poses some elementally perfect textural counterpoint. Victoria sponge against cream bagel against cream cheese bloomer against butter – these things cannot exist without one another. Nut butter is the obvious substitute and the focus of much experimentation. It no longer has to be peanut: cashews are the best all-rounder, also featuring heavily in vegan cheese. Almonds have a surprisingly delicate delivery. Pine nuts work for the very determined. The problem, to my mind, is not that all these taste of nuts, but that their integrity is compromised: the oil separates from the solids and very subtly leaks from the edges, which leaves the rest a bit too substantial and claggy. The beauty of butter is that it has so much oomph but so little density. Nut butters are the opposite. Paradoxically, I could enjoy a peanut butter sandwich so long as it had butter in it as well, but on its own it is mouth-drying and tastes like punishment.The fatty fruit or vegetable is a better, more lateral alternative – avocado, mashed banana, or carrots and butternut squash, roasted then mashed, make much more satisfying spreads.Without disappearing too far down the baking wormhole, it is far safer to swap out butter when cooking with it. Most bundt cakes can take oil instead. All my snootiness about margarine vanishes on the matter of the fairy cake, in which you can’t really taste the fat anyway under all that icing. Low-fat baking has been known to replace butter entirely with prunes, which knackers your low-sugar dreams and makes it a pruny colour, but tastes so close to fat as to be mysterious. (On colour: part of the folkloric power of butter is that, in every variation, from the palest unsalted butters of Ireland to the deepest yellow salted butter of the tiny isle of Noirmoutier, the colour is bewitching. You would paint your kitchen any shade of butter. Margarine, meanwhile, is grey until they bleach it and add food colouring.)Butter’s other stranglehold – I am taking out steamed vegetables, which you can douse in anything, or nothing – is toast. It melts anyway, so you are not trying to replicate its texture. But the entire muscle memory of your mouth, from your pre-verbal understanding of the world, does not even recognise the experience of toast without butter. I swap it for olive oil, but rub the toast first with a half clove of garlic, which is so disruptive that I forget what it was like before. This only works on wholemeal and rye. No idea why.There is a view that some foods – cheese, bacon – are so fatty on their own that they don’t need butter underneath them. This is ridiculous. There are cheeses I can’t even taste without butter underneath (comté), and those that are plainly too dry (Monte Enebro). Part of the point of bacon is what it tastes like against melted butter. But then I even put butter with Nutella, which, I am given to understand, makes me an unreliable witness.

Their domestic campaign hasn’t started yet, but they’ve looked good in Europe so far, thumping Debrecen and Shakhtyor Soligorsk, and Wolves will need to pay close attention to Andrea Belotti up front. The Italy striker already has four goals in four games and has long been targeted by bigger clubs. But perhaps there’s a sneaky way forward for Wolves.

Unfortunately Kobe’s impression of Barcelona has been equally dodgy and the club that was supposed to be winning the Japanese title this year and challenging for the Asian crown in 2020 is two points above the relegation zone with a third of the J League season remaining.The so-called and much-vaunted ‘Barcafication’ of Kobe has been a failure. In 2014 the Japanese e-commerce giant Rakuten bought the club that had never finished higher than ninth in the top tier. Two years later and the company was sponsoring Barcelona, marking the start of what was supposed to be a beautiful relationship between Kansai and Catalonia.Iniesta signed in May 2018 and when I visited the club’s unremarkable office at Kobe’s harbourfront, optimism was almost as high as the August temperatures. Merchandise sales were going through the roof, staff were being hired to deal with the international interest and there was even talk of the potential need for a stadium bigger than the existing 30,000 capacity.On the pitch plans were equally lofty with the club aiming to become the best and biggest in Asia. The new money had already brought in Lukas Podolski in 2017 and with the arrival of Iniesta there were two World Cup winners in the team. Then came David Villa. Another Camp Nou alumnus arrived in March 2019 in the shape of Sergi Samper, and Thomas Vermaelen signed from Barcelona in July.By that time, there were no Spanish hands at the helm. Near the end of the 2018 season, Juan Manuel Lillo was appointed as head coach, with much made of the Spaniard’s label as Pep Guardiola’s mentor, but six months later he was gone.Lillo may not have been regarded as the last piece of the jigsaw but this master strategist was supposed to make the big picture visible. The target of the top three in 2018 had been missed before he took over and the season ended with Kobe in 10th. To jump from mid-table in 2018 to top in 2019 (the target set two years earlier) was always going to be a long shot but Kobe were expected to at least mount a challenge.The arrival of Lillo suggested that the Rakuten founder and Kobe chairman, Hiroshi Mikitani, understood that it was going to take time to achieve his goal. To become another Barcelona was not going to happen just by signing a few former players but through building a philosophy over a number of years.Lillo’s exit last April suggested, however, that Kobe had serious issues. He stepped down after seven league games of the season and an underwhelming but hardly disastrous haul of 10 points. Lillo said that it was the best move for his family but the job already appeared to be an impossible one. He did not have the time to build a Barça style of play but he had more than enough to understand that it was never going to happen.The next day, Podolski stepped down as captain and tweeted: “Stop expecting loyalty from people who can’t even give you honesty.” It was unclear as to whether this was aimed at teammates, Lillo or the club. The German, who impressed so much on his debut, will not go down as one of Kobe’s better signings and will be remembered more for his remonstrations with referees and colleagues than anything special on the pitch.Iniesta, who took the armband relinquished by Podolski, has performed better, seemingly enjoying his time in Japan. The class and the passes are still there, with even those that are misplaced often having more to do with teammates not making the right runs. Although the midfielder still misses games here and there for reasons often not given, in different circumstances Iniesta would be driving Kobe to the title. While Podolski bemoans the lack of stability on the pitch, it merely mirrors the situation off it.Days after Lillo was out, Makitani was announcing a July friendly against, unsurprisingly, Barcelona. “As you know, the world is paying attention to this match,” the chairman told a Tokyo press conference in which he declined to talk about the issues at Kobe.Maybe his reticence was understandable as few were excited by Lillo’s successor. Takayuki Yoshida had been sacked from the same job in September 2018 but was given a chance to show that he had acquired major skills in the seven months since. He lasted seven weeks. This time he was replaced by Thorsten Fink. The former Hamburg and Grasshoppers coach is a move to a more pragmatic style but results have yet to improve.On Friday the German takes his team to Sagan Tosu, who have the misfiring Fernando Torres in attack, for a six-pointer. Defeat would see the star-studded side slip below the hosts into 16th and the relegation play-off spot. There is not much talk of Barcelona these days. For Vissel Kobe, a club that was supposed to be the number one in Asia, the focus is now on avoiding the drop to the number two league in Japan."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/715900ffd9bdd05fc4295416bf82463d58407b3a/0_225_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=aca62fdb56aea0b7d3db4990ad038088","title":"penalty palaver neymar and strife at bolton and bury football weekly extra","story":"Max Rushden, Barry Glendenning, Nicky Bandini and Philippe Auclair discuss penalty rock-paper-scissors, strife at Bury and Bolton, the return of Serie A, Neymar’s movements and breaking news from the NetherlandsJoin the conversation on Facebook, Twitter and email.

Motorcycle accidents are rarely pretty, but this one was beautiful. By incredible luck the only injuries Mitchell appeared to sustain were aesthetically pleasing grease smudges on her arm. A handsome man was on hand to tend to Mitchell and the entire scene was bathed in soft light, captured on camera and posted on Instagram.When Mitchell first documented her accident, on 31 July, her followers were largely sympathetic. But then doubt started to set in. Why were Mitchell’s injuries so minor? Why had her helmet been removed straightaway when protocol dictates that, in most circumstances, it should stay on? Why had everything been professionally photographed? And, most suspiciously, why was there an artfully positioned bottle of Smartwater in one of the photographs? Was this horrible accident actually a deliberately staged advert?Absolutely not, according to Mitchell. In an article published on Monday, Mitchell told Buzzfeed News that she “would never turn a very important personal story like this into a brand campaign”. She also asked Buzzfeed to refrain from writing a story about the controversy as it would “draw negative attention”. (Someone should probably tell her about the Streisand effect.)After Buzzfeed’s story came out, Mitchell posted an Instagram story accusing the outlet of “sensationalizing what I went through that day, and making a mockery of the post I shared”. She reiterated that it wasn’t an advert, saying she discloses “every single sponsorship”.So what the hell is going on? Has Mitchell been unfairly maligned? Or have we now reached the stage of late capitalism where people fake motorcycle accidents in order to increase their social media followers? I’m afraid we may never know the full story, but it should be noted that Smartwater representatives have said they did not have a sponsorship deal with Mitchell.Perhaps the bigger issue, however, is the fact that we’re even debating whether an Instagrammer staged an accident or not shows just how out of control the influencer industry has become.During the early days of social media, influencers were the anti-celebrity. People trusted them because they were normal people. They were authentic, and brands loved them because authenticity sells you’re more likely to buy something endorsed by someone you trust.But in the last couple of years, we’ve become increasingly disillusioned with social media’s perfectly filtered version of reality and extraordinary amounts of vitriol have been levelled against influencers who help perpetuate the idea that our lives should be picture-perfect.Last year, for example, a 24-year-old influencer called Scarlett London said she was sent death threats after posting a sponsored photo of her morning routine on Instagram – which apparently consisted of posing on a bed surrounded by heart-shaped balloons. “The best of days start with a smile and positive thoughts,” she gushed in the caption. “And pancakes. And strawberries.”A man called Nathan took umbrage at the post, tweeting: “Fuck off this is anybody’s normal morning. Instagram is a ridiculous lie factory made to make us all feel inadequate.” The post went viral and Twitter detectives discovered the pancakes were actually dry folded tortillas. Let me tell you: the best of days do not normally start with a stack of dry tortillas.London is far from the only influencer to have been called out for less-than-authentic depictions of her life. Earlier this year, a vegan influencer called Rawvana was caught eating fish and had to issue a tearful apology after a vicious backlash from her followers. Shortly after, another “vegan” influencer known as Raw Alignment riled the internet by releasing a video confessing that she’d given up veganism months ago. Then there was the New York beauty blogger whose “surprise” marriage proposal appeared to have been meticulously planned and pitched to brands.And, perhaps most bizarrely, there’s an entire contingent of influencers who try to pretend their posts are sponsored content when they’re not – because being perceived as having brand deals gives them clout.So there you go: Mitchell might not have been faking anything but, at the end of the day, it doesn’t really matter. What matters is that we’re so bombarded with marketing that our first instinct is to suspect that everything, even a motorcycle accident, is an #advert. What matters is that we’re so sick of influencers lying to us about their lives that we don’t believe them even when they’re telling the truth.If this has got you feeling down about our hellish world, then may I suggest you hydrate? I find taking a sip of highly Instagrammable bottled water is a really effective way to wash away the ennui."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0eeaf73882679d28b294c47c0c92289382ad95e5/0_0_2283_1370/master/2283.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b79e0c94fb36c8424f8f6fa25131e827","title":"meet thatcher wine the celebrity bibliophile you didnt know you needed","story":"He sounds like a Brexit party candidate. In fact, he is the latest mind-body-spirit magnate gifted to us by Gwyneth PaltrowImportant news: we have been gifted a new curator by mind-body-spirit magnate Gwyneth Paltrow. Of course, even that is too limiting an epithet. Gwyneth is, if you will, a curator of curators, lovingly assembling a rolling collection of some of the most preposterous people in late-stage capitalism, and repackaging them for consumption via her Goop website at an undisclosed mark-up.The latest curator to be raised up by association with madam is one Thatcher Wine, who has assisted Paltrow with the augmentation of her Los Angeles bookshelves, and is described as a “celebrity bibliophile” in an interview with Town and Country magazine.And so to “Thatcher Wine”. Hand on heart, if you’d just told me his name, I’d have assumed that Thatcher Wine was one of the newly announced candidates for the Brexit party, who in the past week alone have included Marc Bozza, Les Durance and Haydn Brameld. Thatcher Wine could easily take his place alongside those soldiers of fortune advocating for a no-deal exit from the EU, just as any of them could in turn be a credibly named celebrity bibliophile. “My shelves were curated by Hadyn Brameld.” “This library is a Les Durance original.” (Les to be pronounced like the Les in Les Misérables, obviously.)Anyway, back to Thatcher’s interview with Town and Country magazine. I don’t know how familiar you are with this US publication. The few copies of it I have seen in my life have always been hugely entertaining, packed cover to cover with gracious Americans talking about the style and class of their period homes, some of which date as far back as 1986.In terms of the Thatcher interview, to give you an immediate flavour of the delights contained therein, I will simply reprint the intro. “After everyone tired of reading on their Kindles,” this begins, axiomatically, “there was a delightful, if unexpected, realisation. Book lovers remembered that books aren’t just for reading, they can also be beautiful objects in and of themselves.”Thatcher was at the forefront of this great remembering, you sense, and he has a business that sources books “based on interest, author and even colour”. Ah yes. This business of arranging books by colour of the spine, which – while obviously ghastly – enrages a certain type of person more performatively than burning rainforests or children being raised in shipping containers and so on. We shan’t lavish much of our time on it today.Mainly because Thatcher has gone one better than this, offering clients the chance to buy a load of books, then have special dust jackets made for each in one shade, or as part of a wider image that coheres when they are all on the shelves together. Again, ghastly – but over to Thatcher. “My invention for the book jacket means that someone can have the complete works of Jane Austen, but in a certain Pantone chip colour that matches the rest of the room or with a custom image … Why settle for books that a publisher designed?”In Pride and Prejudice, one of Miss Bingley’s ruses for impressing Mr Darcy is to declare: “When I have a house of my own, I shall be miserable if I have not an excellent library!” If only she’d thought to expand this to “an excellent library of books jacketed in Pantone 2461 C”, the story might have ended entirely differently.In truth, none of this literary interiors business feels a million miles from those fake antique book spines that can be bought by the yard, which for decades were widely accepted to be a sign of both pretension and philistinism. It seems times have changed. Of the shelves in Gwyneth’s own LA dining room, which he curated, Thatcher says he stuck “to a more rigid colour palette of black, white and grey, since it was less of a space where one might hang out and read”. Or even eat.The occasion of this interview is that Thatcher has his first book out, entitled For the Love of Books, which its publicity blurb assures me is itself “a keepsake worthy of any bibliophile’s collection”. This keepsake-about-keepsakes precis somehow reminds me of an E Nesbit story collection I loved as a child, which had a story called The Town in the Library. It involved two children building a town out of books in their library, then stepping into it and finding that this town contained their own house, which duly contained their library, in which there was a town built of books. Into that town they then went, and so on, through all the towns in all the libraries. I can’t remember how it ended. (I’d like to find it and check, but unfortunately my husband’s system for categorising our books is so aggressively opaque that it effectively amounts to enemy code, and should by rights be a matter for Bletchley Park.)Thatcher, meanwhile, has some amusing theories about where we are going, textually. “Publishers like Taschen, Phaidon and Rizzoli are making these gorgeous oversize books on art, design and architecture,” he says. “I think people are collecting those as an alternative to looking at screens.” Maybe. For me, the apogee of this type of book was United, a 2006 coffee table book about Manchester United, which cost £3,000 and weighed 30kg (four and a half stone) – more than most coffee tables. Review copies were not available, so those who wished to cast a critical eye over the work were required to visit it at its publishers, where a chap in white gloves turned the 850 pages for them.As for Thatcher’s theories about books that don’t relate to their physical size or cover shade, he vaguely recommends classics such as Hemingway and Austen. Also, apparently, “the Stoic philosophers are having a moment now”.

Hey – as Seneca himself put it: enjoy present pleasures in such a way as not to injure future ones.With requisite ceremony, proper celebrity Elton John has swept into the row about Prince Harry and Meghan’s frequent uses of private jets this summer, in the manner of someone who believes he can only be helpful.As discussed in this column last week, these are the royal private jet flights critics seem most preoccupied with, as opposed to the private jet flights featuring Prince Andrew, currently lying low to avoid mounting questions about his longtime friendship with the recently deceased millionaire sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein, owner of a US Virgin Islands property known locally as “Paedophile Island”.Sorry, where were we? Oh yes – Meghan! Something about a long weekend away with her husband and baby? Quite the scandal. Following the welter of allegations of hypocrisy, relating to the couple’s eco campaigning, Elton this week took to Twitter to state hotly that it was he who paid for the private jet they used to reach his Nice home, in order to give them some much-needed rest from a few shifts down the royal appearances coalmine (my words, not Elton’s).Furthermore, Elton asserted: “Prince Harry’s mother, Diana Princess of Wales, was one of my dearest friends. I feel a profound sense of obligation to protect Harry and his family from the unnecessary press intrusion that contributed to Diana’s untimely death.” Well, quite. That said, in the year she died, Elton and Gianni Versace published a joint coffee-table book entitled Rock and Royalty, which featured private pictures, including one of Diana and William and Harry. She promptly froze him out for it, although the pair reconciled later that year in the wake of Versace’s death.But back to the present day, where his intervention can only be of assistance to Meghan and Harry. Let’s face it, Elton defending you against charges of excess is a huge mood, and I already tend to defend my own less justifiable purchases in the precise tone of voice he used to a court trying his former business manager, when asked about a £293,000 florist bill. As he put it: “I like flowers.”Let’s hope that “I like private jets” will prove an effective line of defence for Meghan and Harry. Andrew, perhaps, will need something more artful."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/48205f60c3e5f8224c41c6b1cab3c71725fe974e/0_300_5811_3488/master/5811.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b8de91736e2d29d6a1aa84444269a1be","title":"do not feed the pigeons and nine other unwritten rules about london","story":"London is a city with its own quirks and customs, but this Londoner’s guide will help you avoid any sticky situations when visiting the capital ...The tubeFor something that has the sole aim of getting people from A to B, the tube is fraught with potential faux pas. One main rule is that you should always stand on the right on escalators. If you dare to break this, you’ll be met with a lot of muttering and eye-rolls, although no one will dare to berate you personally. You must also never, ever make eye contact with a stranger on the tube, or, worse, smile at them. This invades the Londoner’s sense of private space, even if you’re standing in a different carriage.Pigeons come sprinkled with a touch of glamour when they’re gathered en masse in St Mark’s Square in Venice not so much when they’re in Trafalgar Square on a drizzly Tuesday. Do not feed them, do not encourage them to come near you, and do not interact with them at all. They say ‘beware the flying rats’ for a reason.London may not quite be New York – although we’re certainly trying to keep up the skyscraper count – but it still loves its bagels. A fierce rivalry exists between the city’s two classic purveyors on Brick Lane in-the-know purists head to Beigel Bake at number 159 for its hot salt beef with mustard, while its neighbour at number 155, Beigel Shop, does a mean smoked salmon with cream cheese. Beigel Shop has been here since 1855, while upstart Beigel Bake only started in 1974, but both are open 24 hours – and, boy, the service only gets better from two in the morning.Oxford StreetTo outsiders, it’s still seen as a shopping nirvana: over a mile of high-street stores and the odd independent boutique. Londoners, however, know there are better options nearby for the shopper uninterested in souvenir stores (although hats off to Selfridges, a true gem). Try Spitalfields for an East End market buzz, or Dover Street in the West End for high fashion and price tags to match.The Tower of LondonNot many Londoners have actually ever been inside this, but they do know that it’s brimming over with history, stuffed with ravens, and there are some rather nice crown jewels inside. Oh, and that there are a couple of princes still stuck in the actual tower, although we’re not exactly sure what they’re doing there.Crossing the riverOnce you are friends with a Londoner, your allegiance is not only to him or her, but to the area north or south of the river where they live. If you are loyal to someone from the north, you must never go south, and vice versa. Crossing the river is something Londoners only do in an emergency (or for work, if their job happens to be on the opposite side of the Thames from where they live), and weekends must be spent not only in one’s designated compass point, but also bad-mouthing the other.A Londoner will raise his or her head from theirs only if he or she is literally about to be run over by a bus. Otherwise, forget it. Walking down a London street is a bit like playing a game of Frogger, only you’re on a pavement, and the “cars” are phone-obsessed pedestrians. Don’t expect anyone to come and help if you’re looking lost, or start chatting if you’re in a pub everyone will be on their phone, browsing Tinder, booking an Uber, or playing whatever the modern version of Frogger is.One of London’s finest traditions is the illustrious black cab, immediately recognisable by their yellow illuminated signs, shuddering, noisy diesel engines, and adorably knowledgeable drivers, who love nothing better than to get into a debate about their favourite football team, and the performances of its starting eleven over the weekend – you can bank on the fact that each one would have played better if the driver himself was their manager, of course. It’s up to you whether you get involved in the conversation, although this may also depend on how many pints you have sampled at that other Great British institution, the pub.PubsLondon pubs tend to be full of history this also sometimes means they are full of threadbare carpet, peeling wallpaper, and musty cellars. Don’t let that stop you buying a pint of possibly overpriced lager, however, because that atmosphere does not just contain damp it also contains the breath of a thousand London icons – actors Peter O’Toole and Diana Dors, painters Francis Bacon and Lucian Freud, gangsters such as the Kray Twins, and musicians from Dizzee Rascal to David Bowie.Sometimes it’s nice to leaveAs cosmopolitan and fascinating as London is, sometimes it’s nice to explore beyond it.

A city that is unfortunately so near to Birmingham that it is often forgotten about, but also fortunately just far enough away that we don’t speak with that accent. In fact, “we speak with an accent that’s exceedingly rare!” At least that’s what the Coventry City fans sing every week, whether it’s at the Ricoh Arena or at away games up and down the country – or that season we played our home games in Northampton, but we don’t talk about that.Luckily, due to our location on one of the country’s most central rail lines, it’s incredibly easy for us to get to just about anywhere in the UK, whether it be for football, shopping, boozing, sightseeing, or … what else is there?And if you’re coming to us by rail (TIP: London Northwestern Railway has FREE wifi in every carriage), there are some unspoken things you should know about us lot, located smack bang in the middle of England.No, Coventry is not basically BirminghamThis assertion is lazy geography. We are 20 miles away from Birmingham. Sunderland is barely 15 miles away from Newcastle upon Tyne but you wouldn’t say “Newcastle is basically in Sunderland”, unless you wanted to get banished from the north-east forever. Solihull is a town that is “basically” Birmingham. We are our own city, with enough cathedrals to spare (more on that in a minute).Coventry – and its spirit – is indestructibleDue to our extremely central location – Meriden, the traditional centre of England is just 8 miles away – we’ve often found ourselves in the middle of some heated situations. The most notable of which was the Coventry blitz, which took place on the night of the 14 November 1940. It was the single most concentrated attack on a British city during the second world war. It lasted for 11 hours as the Luftwaffe essentially attempted to knock Coventry off the map, being one of the UK’s major centres for war production. The old cathedral was mostly destroyed during that raid, but its remains now serve as a phenomenal event space.We also have a rich history of cathedralsWhile the old cathedral was destroyed, as mentioned, we had an old, old cathedral that Henry VIII ordered to be destroyed during the dissolution of the monasteries in the early 16th century. What remains of it is still standing and open to the public in the Priory undercrofts, which was dug up by Tony Robinson for a Time Team special in 1999 on Channel 4. Side note: There is a Nando’s right next to the Priory gardens, so you can make a decent afternoon of history and chicken.Enjoy flying abroad? You have us to thank for thatIf we are honest, we aren’t the greatest at making a big deal about the things we’ve done in the past. For a city that was essentially the beating heart of the country’s motor industry, we should at least talk about it as much as Brummies like to talk about how they are the second city.But more impressive than that is Coventry’s very own Sir Frank Whittle. No, it’s not just the name of a school in Walsgrave – Sir Frank Whittle was the genius behind the modern jet engine, which effectively changed the world.When Sir Frank first brought forward his plans to the UK’s Air Ministry in 1929, his blueprints were called “impractical”. Just eight years later, in 1937, his Whittle Unit engine roared into life, and by 1941 jet-powered planes were heading to war. The rest, as they say, is history.If you call it the Phoenix or the Kasbah, we know you are a studentClubs change names, that’s true, but we never forget – or stop calling them by – their older names.That club on Primrose Hill Street in Hillfields is The Colly (or Colosseum for the more formal among you) not the Kasbah, despite what it says above the doors. Those who really know their history will recall a brief period in the early 90s when it was called the Tic Toc, and played host to Blur and Ocean Colour Scene amid Britpop fever. The Phoenix? That’s the Colin Campbell or the Campbell to those who grew up here. And the building with the domed roof opposite? Before it was a Cov Uni building it was an old Odeon theatre.We still really hate Aston VillaIt’s been nearly 20 years since both clubs were even in the same ision – the 200001 season of the Premier League – but we still despise the Birmingham club, with a passion.

Over time this evolved into “process of baking” to “event of baking” to “the set of things baked” and eventually to a “set of things”, ie a batch. And these bread rolls would be baked in batches too.

Triumphant, guttural and faintly unhinged, it’s the kind that suggests arena-sized excess, permed mullets and peacocking masculinity. That it is delivered by a woman, the band’s commanding and pleasingly rough-around-the-edges vocalist Tina Halladay, is the first clue that this almost comically retro mashup of hard rock and power pop may not be an entirely straightforward historical re-enactment. In fact, it soon becomes apparent that the swaggeringly macho and viscerally gleeful sonic palate is going to be taken well outside its comfort zone, because A Distant Call is an album with a sombre and timely purpose: to parse the way global-scale tragedy intersects with deeply personal pain.You can trace this intimate take on the horrors of history back to Sheer Mag’s celebrated 2017 debut, Need to Feel Your Love, on which the group noted the continued psychic imprint of 20th-century injustice – from the inhumane treatment of LGBTQ people (told via an impressionistic remembering of the Stonewall riots) to the execution of 21-year-old anti-Nazi activist Sophie Scholl. The latter seemed as much an exercise in ethics as a pop song: amid leisurely soft rock, it saw Halladay sit unflinchingly with the brutality of Scholl’s death, imagining details like the temperature of the blade that killed her, while maintaining a dogged hope that her death was not in vain.This time round, Sheer Mag are ready to look present-day societal turmoil in the eye, interweaving grand disaster with small-scale sadness. Unfound Manifest mulls over the refugee crisis, before pulling back to reveal its protagonist bedridden by a depressive episode that is partly fuelled by the untold awfulness of the news cycle. Silver Line sees her consider her own unemployment alongside teacher strikes in West Virginia, while The Right Stuff stridently denounces fat-shaming culture with a sardonic request: “If you’re worried about my health  Shut your mouth and keep it to yourself.” Yet towards the album’s end, some hope glimmers: western governments may have spent the last century conspiring to extinguish socialism in all its forms (or so says The Killer), but – according to Chopping Block – a workers’ uprising could still deliver salvation.This is an album with an earnest, intricately woven and gravely serious narrative. Yet the laboured-over lyrics are offset by tunes that have only one thing on their minds: instant gratification. Whether songs lean more towards grimy proto-metal (Chopping Block) or chiming 1970s soft rock (Silver Line), every one is underpinned by a sense of elation designed to deliver you on to the dancefloor, or into the thick of the moshpit – or at least have you foot-tapping. Halladay’s rich but slightly strained singing voice brings to mind somebody drunkenly performing their favourite song at karaoke, and it can be hard to resist joining in, especially when that sense of enthusiastic abandon extends to everything else: the parping riffs, the drum flourishes, the tongue-in-cheek backing vocals. As with School of Rock, the Richard Linklater film that celebrated bands such as ACDC, Led Zeppelin and the Who through the eyes of a group of guileless children, the fact that Sheer Mag have removed classic rock from its sometimes grotty context (groupies, drugs, male entitlement) means they are able to produce a sound that is straightforwardly jubilant – the source of a pure, almost elemental joy.Yet at times, the contrast between the grim realism of the lyrics and the euphoric rock nostalgia can tip over into incongruity. On Need to Feel Your Love, the medium isn’t entirely dissimilar – a lo-fi melange of chugging garage, funk, soul and hard rock – but it feels raw and desperate simply by dint of its lack of polish. Here, there is occasional scuzz, but the resounding impression is of a gleaming, squealing rock machine. Blood from a Stone is about the grind of food stamp-level poverty, yet the track, with its twanging, countrified guitar and soulful strut, scans as pure positivity. On Cold Sword, a particularly gruelling exploration of feelings of ambivalence in the wake of an abusive father’s death, the buoyant cheer of the music is hard to square with the story.Ultimately, Halladay and co are treading the line every modern artist must if they want to make work that is relevant and instinctively appealing: refusing to shy away from the realities of our political hellscape, but also sugar-coating that righteous indignation with something consolatory and escapist is a dichotomy that is coming to define much of present-day pop culture. A Distant Call may contain some jarring juxtapositions, but on the whole it’s a welcome opportunity for Sheer Mag to prove that serious idealism and infectious fun can – and should – harmoniously coexist.Kano ft D Double E \u0026amp Ghetts: Class of DejaThe inimitable east London MC furiously re-asserts his old-school grime credentials on this brilliantly bassy ode to pirate radio station Deja Vu FM.• This story was amended on 22 August 2019 to change the word “galling” to “gruelling”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/62052f41de01072ab003d60e57853e969dd49106/0_363_3994_2397/master/3994.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e99ed60c110d6fde8a86295687f815c2","title":"taylor swift six albums scooter braun","story":"As a swipe at Scooter Braun, the singer will recreate her first six albums from scratch. But her plan ignores one of music’s vital truthsLet’s assume it can be done, even though we don’t know. Let’s take Taylor Swift’s word for it when she says she is going to rerecord the six albums she recorded for the Big Machine label before signing to RepublicUniversal last autumn. Let’s presume her contract with Big Machine did not contain clauses preventing soundalike re-recordings, or prevent her from taking new runs at old tracks until a certain time period had elapsed.The news came in a preview for her interview on Good Morning America, scheduled to air this Sunday, in which Tracy Smith asked if she was planning to make new versions of all her masters. “Oh yeah,” Swift replied. “That’s a plan?” Smith asked. “Yeah, absolutely.” She has said that recording will commence in November 2020. “I’m going to be busy,” she told Smith.Why would she do it? It’s a response to the sale of Big Machine by her former mentor, Scott Borchetta, to Justin Bieber’s manager, Scooter Braun. Braun is also in effect Kanye West’s manager (West supposedly dislikes the term “manager”). Swift, writing about the sale on her Tumblr in late June, said Braun was responsible for “incessant, manipulative bullying”, citing an incident when West’s wife, Kim Kardashian, leaked a recording of a phone call between Swift and West, and West putting a naked likeness of Swift in a video (reappraise yourself of the whole saga, if needs be).Big Machine now owns the master recordings of Swift’s first six albums – which she has said she was never given the opportunity to own, nor to buy the label herself. This means someone Swift despises can now do exactly what he wants with her recordings: if he wanted to license them to porn films or adverts for weapons of mass destruction, he probably could. Swift’s new deal with Republic gives her ownership of her master recordings, so anything she records for them, she has ownership of (and a much greater share of the revenue from).Still, while the terms of Swift’s deal with Republic weren’t made public – Universal announced only that it was “a multi-album agreement” – it would be surprising if the label would allow its marquee artist to devote her time with them to rerecording old music rather than giving them new albums. But, still, let’s assume it’s going to happen anyway.Two years before that, Squeeze also released re-recordings of their old songs as the album Spot the Difference, hoping these new versions would be used in adverts and films, rather than the originals, which were owned by – you guessed it – Universal. “The fact we do not (and never will) own the recordings of some of our best work is simply not fair,” Glenn Tilbrook wrote at the time. At a lesser level, Greg Kihn recorded new versions of old hits in 2000, again to gain the financial benefits when they were licensed for other uses, and again to stop Universal reaping all the rewards.Swift’s case seems to be closest to that of Def Leppard. Both are superstar acts who were financial mainstays for their respective labels. And in both cases, one might detect a certain spirit of vengeance. Def Leppard’s Joe Elliott also took the view that his band had built their label in the first place, and deserved more respect. “We bought that building in the 80s, and they treat us like shit,” he said. “We’ve become irrelevant to the label, so we’re putting on the battle armour.”While Swift almost certainly does not need the money from licensing new versions of Shake It Off or I Knew You Were Trouble, her dislike of Braun appears to be so great that she would do almost anything to prevent him benefitting from the originals. And she has an unusual degree of power within the music industry.She’s also counting on her loyal fans to follow her. And, doubtless, some will. But will everyone? Because a song is more than just a collection of notes and words it is also a moment captured in time. And new versions of old songs, however perfect they might be in their re-creation, are different moments. An old song is like a favourite pair of jeans you know how the song fits you. Much as I like Def Leppard, for example, I didn’t bother going to their “forgeries” when they were the only official versions online. If I wanted to hear them on a computer, I just went over to YouTube. Swift released her debut album when she was 16, and she sounds like a 16-year-old on those songs if a 29-year-old Swift were to re-record it note-for-note, she couldn’t recapture the girlish quality that gave her debut its charm.Maybe that’s not what she’s planning. Perhaps she’s going to shun like-for-like re-creations and reinvent those old albums. That would be interesting, though likely still just a curio. But I don’t think so. It wouldn’t have any great impact on Braun for one thing. In fact, I suspect this project will never reach completion. Swift may well be driven by a supreme sense of self and desire to control her destiny, but those very characteristics will surely prevent her dedicating so much time to something that will only hold her back. Her last few years have been dedicated to progress why start moving backwards?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a1e6d885d04965486c89d5498209ee3029c0535b/0_288_4318_2591/master/4318.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d1047ba76520e33028503b2db0cac794","title":"dominic cummings should not have no 10 role suggests tory mp damian collins","story":"Damian Collins claims ‘real-world sanctions’ are needed for those found in contempt of parliamentBoris Johnson’s chief strategist Dominic Cummings should not have been allowed to take up his Downing Street post after being found in contempt of parliament, a leading Conservative MP and Johnson supporter has suggested.Cummings, who is shaping the government’s Brexit strategy in his role as the prime minister’s special adviser, repeatedly declined to appear in front of the House of Commons digital, culture, media and sport select committee select committee, chaired by Damian Collins. The committee’s long-running investigation into data misuse on social media platforms helped expose the Cambridge Analytica scandal.Collins and his fellow MPs wanted to make Cummings answer questions about the Vote Leave campaign’s use of online political advertising during the 2016 EU referendum. Collins was instead rebuffed by Cummings who told him to “get lost”, and instead offered to set his own terms of engagement.As a result Cummings earlier this year became one of the few people in recent history to be found in contempt of parliament.Asked whether Cummings should have been allowed to take up the job, Collins told an audience at the Edinburgh international television festival: “I think we have a very inadequate situation where there’s not enough real-world sanctions for those found in contempt of the house. There should be some sanction for those found in contempt of parliament, including whether they should be considered fit to hold public office.”Contempt of parliament historically resulted in potential imprisonment but Cummings’s case showed it is now a largely toothless symbolic punishment that does little more than attempt to shame an inidual into changing their ways. Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg has also been threatened with a similar punishment for refusing to appear in front of the committee.Cummings seemed nonplussed by the contempt finding, which did not affect his return to frontline politics. He is now leading policy in a government featuring politicians who have floated the idea of suspending parliament to ensure Brexit goes ahead at the end of October.Collins, the MP for Folkestone and Hythe and remain campaigner, became an unexpectedly vocal supporter of Johnson during the Tory leadership contest, leading to speculation in Westminster that he was hoping for a ministerial job in the new government.However, it later emerged that Cummings had been working behind the scenes to plan a Johnson government. He went on to become a major figure in Johnson’s Downing Street operation, seemingly killing any hope of Collins’s ministerial advancement."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6b02b72f2d6280f98318e33e7106ce8e8f550855/32_394_3414_2048/master/3414.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4a062a53060d14f7e451b08fd8d63128","title":"emmanuel macron backs month of talks to agree brexit deal","story":"French president tells Boris Johnson he must present concrete proposals for UK exitEmmanuel Macron has described the Irish backstop as “indispensable” to a Brexit deal and urged Boris Johnson to set out his proposed alternatives as soon as possible, as he met the British prime minister in Paris.The French president told Johnson on Thursday that the EU would like “visibility” on London’s concrete proposals for the UK’s withdrawal from the EU within a month, echoing language used by the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, on Wednesday. Macron said he stood united with Merkel that the clock was ticking and that it was not possible to wait until the last minute to find a solution. He said the EU’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, could be involved in finding an answer “without totally reshuffling the withdrawal agreement”.“We should all together be able to find something smart within 30 days if there is goodwill on both sides,” Macron said. “We need to try to have a useful month.” Variously described as an insurance policy or safety net, the backstop is a device in the Withdrawal Agreement intended to ensure that there will not be a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, even if no formal deal can be reached on trade and security arrangements.It would mean that if there were no workable agreement on such matters, Northern Ireland would stay in the customs union and much of the single market, guaranteeing a friction-free border with the Republic. This would keep the Good Friday agreement intact.Both the UK and EU signed up to the basic idea in December 2017 as part of the initial Brexit deal, but there have been disagreements since on how it would work.The DUP have objected to it, as it potentially treats Northern Ireland differently from the rest of the UK, creating a customs ide in the Irish sea, which is anathema to the unionist party.Hardline Tory Eurosceptics also object to it, as they perceive it to be a trap that could potentially lock the UK into the EU\u0027s customs union permanently if the UK \u0026amp EU cannot seal a free trade agreement. That would prevent the UK from doing its own free trade deals with nations outside the bloc.\u0026nbspA legal add-on to the withdrawal agreement was given to Theresa May in January 2019 to try and get her deal through the UK parliament. It gives legal force to a letter from Jean-Claude Juncker and Donald Tusk, the presidents of the commission and council. This stated the EU’s intention to negotiate an alternative to the backstop so it would not be triggered, or, if it was triggered, to get out of it as quickly as possible.Unilateral statement from the UK\u0026nbspThis set out the British position that, if the backstop was to become permanent and talks on an alternative were going nowhere, the UK believes it would be able to exit the arrangement.Additional language in political declaration\u0026nbspThis emphasises the urgency felt on both sides to negotiate an alternative to the backstop, and flesh out what a technological fix would look like. However, it failed to persuade the attorney general, Geoffrey Cox, who said that while it \u0027reduces the risk\u0027 of the UK being trapped in a backstop indefinitely, it does not remove it.Prime minister Boris Johnson\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspdeclared the Northern Ireland backstop “dead”\u0026nbspduring his leadership campaign, and promised to throw it out of any deal he re-negotiated with the EU. The EU has repeatedly stated that it will not re-open the Withdrawal Agreement for re-negotiation.\u0026nbspMerkel insisted on Thursday that she had not given the UK a strict 30-day deadline, but instead wanted to highlight how short time was before the UK’s planned exit date of 31 October.Any new proposals to deal with the issue of the Northern Ireland border should fit into the existing framework withdrawal agreement already negotiated, Macron said.Johnson has repeatedly said the backstop – an insurance plan to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland – must go in order to avoid a no-deal exit. He argues it could leave the UK tied to the EU indefinitely.But Macron said the backstop was both an indispensable guarantee for the stability of Ireland and a means of protecting the integrity of the European single market, and that any new UK ideas had to respect that.Johnson arrived at the Élysée Palace in a Range Rover decorated with UK flags. Macron is keenly aware of the prime minister’s long track record of French-bashing for a domestic audience, but both men were at pains to show their close working relationship. Johnson repeatedly called Macron “Emmanuel” and smiled at him, only shrugging and grimacing slightly and reaching into his jacket for a pen to amend his speech as he stood listening to Macron say the Irish backstop was an “essential guarantee”.An official in Macron’s office said the talks were constructive.At a joint news conference on Wednesday in Berlin with Johnson, Merkel appeared to suggest that a solution to the sticking point of the Irish backstop could be found in the next 30 days. But on Thursday she said: “It is not about 30 days. The 30 days were meant as an example to highlight the fact that we need to achieve it in a short time.”Macron was careful to say that if no concrete solution based on the current withdrawal agreement were found in the coming month, it would be the UK’s sole responsibility. “It would mean that the problem is deeper, more political – a British political problem.” At that point “there will be a political choice to be made by the prime minister, it won’t fall to us”.Macron appeared to have the upper hand as he smiled warmly while telling Johnson: “On Brexit my position is clear and I know how much that occupies your days and your nights.”This appeared to be a reference to Downing Street rushing to respond on Wednesday night to Macron’s comments to reporters in Paris that Johnson’s written request to renegotiate the UK’s exit and scrap the backstop was “not an option”.Macron was even more tactile than usual with a foreign leader, repeatedly patting Johnson on the back and shoulder.“I’ve always been portrayed as the toughest in the group,” Macron grinned. Political commentators in France suspect Johnson of wanting to frame France as the bad cop to blame for any no deal. Macron is determined to avoid taking any blame for what he calls the UK’s internal political crisis over Brexit.Macron said he believed the British people’s sovereign decision must be carried out, warning against “democracies suffering lack of efficiency and lack of clarity”.He reminded Johnson that he stood firmly together with Merkel in a united position and that it was not up to any one single EU member state to negotiate.Johnson tried to strike a positive note, saying that he admired the “can-do spirit” expressed by Merkel in Berlin on Wednesday.He said: “Let’s get Brexit done, let’s get it done sensibly and pragmatically and in the interests of both sides and let’s not wait until 31 October. Let’s get on now in deepening and intensifying the friendship and partnership between us.“When you look at the border with Northern Ireland ... under no circumstances will the UK government be instituting, imposing checks or controls of any kind at that border. We think there are ways of protecting the integrity of the single market and allowing the UK to exit from the EU, all and entire and perfect as it were.”At 11pm UK time on 31 October the UK would, by default, become a “third country” in terms of relations with the EU, with no post-Brexit plan in place, and no transition period. The UK would no longer be paying into the EU budget, nor would it hand over the £39bn orce payment.The UK would drop out of countless arrangements, pacts and treaties, covering everything from tariffs to the movement of people, foodstuffs, other goods and data, to numerous specific deals on things such as aviation, and policing and security. Without an overall withdrawal agreement each element would need to be agreed. In the immediate aftermath, without a deal the UK would trade with the EU on the default terms of the World Trade Organization (WTO), including tariffs on agricultural goods.The UK government has already indicated that it will set low or no tariffs on goods coming into the country. This would lower the price of imports – making it harder for British manufacturers to compete with foreign goods. If the UK sets the tariffs to zero on goods coming in from the EU, under WTO ‘most favoured nation’ rules it must also offer the same zero tariffs to other countries.WTO rules only cover goods – they do not apply to financial services, a significant part of the UK’s economy. Trading under WTO rules will also require border checks, which could cause delays at ports, and a severe challenge to the peace process in Ireland without alternative arrangements in place to avoid a hard border.Some no-deal supporters have claimed that the UK can use article 24 of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) to force the EU to accept a period of up to ten years where there are no tariffs while a free trade agreement (FTA) is negotiated. However, the UK cannot invoke article 24 unilaterally – the EU would have to agree to it. In previous cases where the article has been used, the two sides had a deal in place, and it has never been used to replicate something of the scale and complexity of the EU and the UK’s trading relationship.The director general of the WTO, Roberto Azevêdo, has told Prospect magazine that in simple factual terms in this scenario, you could expect to see the application of tariffs between the UK and EU where currently there are none.Until some agreements are in place, a no-deal scenario will place extra overheads on UK businesses – eg the current government advice is that all drivers, including lorries and commercial vehicles, will require extra documentation to be able to drive in Europe after 31 October if there is no deal. Those arguing for a ‘managed’ no deal envisage that a range of smaller, sector-by-sector, bilateral agreements could be quickly put into place as mutual self-interest between the UK and EU to avoid introducing or to rapidly remove this kind of bureaucracy.Johnson added that “technical solutions” were “readily available” to avoid checkpoints, but did not spell out his clear alternative to a backstop guarantee.The prime minister is due to meet the European council president, Donald Tusk, at the G7 summit this weekend, their first encounter since Johnson took over, an event that was greeted by a frosty two-line letter of congratulations from the EU leader.Tusk, who will be representing the EU at the G7, previously said there was “a special place in hell” for those who promoted Brexit “without even a sketch of a plan” – remarks seen as being aimed at Johnson, a figurehead of the leave campaign.Tusk will be “in listening mode in Biarritz” and the EU is “looking forward to new facts and new workable ideas”, a senior EU official said. But hopes of a breakthrough are low, with both sides emphasising that the bilateral meeting will also address the global economy and foreign policy questions.No deal has become the default scenario for EU officials, since Johnson wrote to Tusk on Monday calling on the EU to scrap the backstop, the insurance plan to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland.

If this did not work the party would support the no-confidence motion, but rather than installing Corbyn, the Lib Dems would seek a cross-party government led by a backbench grandee, such as Ken Clarke or Harriet Harman. It is not clear if the party would try to block a temporary Corbyn government.SNP:\u0026nbspThe Scottish National party supports a no-confidence motion. They have said they will talk to Corbyn about his plan, despite their differences over\u0026nbspBrexit. The party’s leader, Nicola Sturgeon, has criticised Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson\u0027s stance.Plaid Cymru:\u0026nbspLiz Saville Roberts, Westminster leader for the party, has indicated she could back the Corbyn plan, but would prefer an immediate second referendum rather than general election.Independent Group for ChangeIndependents: The group formerly known as the TIGers, now split and reduced in number after two joined the\u0026nbspLiberal Democrats, seem wary of the Corbyn plan, with some MPs saying they could not support him.Greens: Caroline Lucas, the Green party’s sole MP has taken a similar view to Saville Roberts, and has also appealed to Swinson to reconsider backing a temporary Corbyn-led government.Rebel Tories: Conservative party MP Guto Bebb has said that even a Corbyn government would be preferable to no deal. But it seems hard to see many other Tories following him.Former\u0026nbspLabour\u0026nbspindependents: Ian Austin, a long-time Corbyn foe, has already ruled out supporting his plan for a temporary government, and it is hard to see MPs such as Frank Field, John Woodcock, and others, doing so either.He said he would not support a vote of no confidence while the Boris Johnson government continues to pursue a Brexit deal nor support any government in which Corbyn was prime minister.Boles said he also needed guarantees from Corbyn that he would resist efforts from Downing Street to prorogue parliament and call an early general election on 1 November, in order to stop such a bill delaying the UK’s exit from receiving royal assent.He said such an approach could not succeed “if you instruct Labour MPs to frustrate it” by declining to back a vote in parliament to hold a general election.“It is therefore essential that you declare publicly that you will not facilitate an election before an extension of article 50 has been secured and a no-deal Brexit has been averted,” he wrote.“Until you do so, people will continue to doubt the sincerity of your declared opposition to a no-deal Brexit and your readiness to put the interests of the country before the interests of your party and your personal ambitions.”Soubry said she felt “very, very strongly that a vote of no confidence is a genuine distraction” and that Conservative rebels would only back one when it became clear Johnson was no longer pursuing a Brexit deal in any form.“In September we have to stop a no-deal Brexit by way of legislation,” Soubry said. “We must have in law that we could not leave the European Union without a deal and that would mean that we have an extension.”Corbyn has invited Scottish National party, Liberal Democrat, Plaid Cymru, Conservative and independent MPs to visit his office next Tuesday, urging them to talk about “all tactics available to prevent no deal”.The Conservative MP Caroline Spelman, who was invited to the meeting, has also said she will not attend.In a video message, Spelman said she would not support any efforts to remove Johnson as prime minister and backed his pursuit of a Brexit deal. “I do not support Jeremy Corbyn’s initiative and I would not support a government led by him,” she said.“The position taken by Boris Johnson – that we will be leaving the EU on 31 October but he would prefer we did so with a deal – is one I entirely support and I wish Boris Johnson every success in those negotiations.However, Corbyn’s invitation was accepted by Ian Blackford, the SNP Westminster leader. “All options must be on the table. The SNP stands ready to pursue every avenue, including passing legislation to block no deal and a vote of no confidence in the Tory government,” he said.Jo Swinson, the Lib Dem leader, also accepted the invitation but argued that Corbyn should drop the idea of trying to become a temporary caretaker prime minister.“We must focus on workable options that can actually stop no-deal Brexit, because we do not have time to waste. If Jeremy Corbyn truly wants to stop no deal, then he must be open to options other than his plan to become prime minister and I look forward to hearing about the different options he is willing to explore,” she said.Others invited to the meeting include the Conservative MP Guto Bebb, who had signalled he could be prepared to back a Corbyn government as a last resort to prevent no deal.On Thursday the shadow Scotland minister, Paul Sweeney, suggested Labour had to be prepared to back alternatives if Corbyn was unsuccessful in forming a caretaker government.“If Jeremy was unsuccessful I think we’d need to be open-minded about giving someone else the chance to do it as a neutral figure – or any figure really that could command a majority,” he told the Debated podcast. “We would have to consider it, I wouldn’t rule it out.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d19df985060b01b2aa77af69e64d0686de3432ab/0_52_5166_3100/master/5166.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c4c61a12dddafe4eb697a446fdf0307b","title":"helping nine year old eating disorder recovery podcast","story":"We hear about the importance of early intervention in rare cases of pre-teen eating disorders.

Farrell makes his first start since the Six Nations, coming in at inside-centre, and assumes the captaincy from Ford, who remains at fly-half.Ford and Farrell is a tried and tested partnership at 10-12 for Jones, who paired the two together for all but one game of the 18-match winning run to start his tenure. He largely continued with it thereafter but after England were defeated the first two matches of last summer’s tour of South Africa – extended their losing run to five Tests – Jones turned to Danny Cipriani for one match only before installing Farrell as his number one fly-half.Jones’s decision to return to the partnership during this warm-up series is no surprise however, and while it may prove to be England’s plan B at the World Cup, the rest of the side has a first-choice look about it. Jones has picked Tom Curry and Sam Underhill as his flankers with both recovering from shoulder and toe injuries respectively while Jonny May makes his first appearance of the series on the left wing. Manu Tuilagi, Ben Youngs, Joe Marler and Kyle Sinckler all start as does Billy Vunipola, for the third match running, while Mako Vunipola has been deemed fit enough for a place on the bench.Maro Itoje and George Kruis are paired together in the second row with Jame George also making his first start of the series at hooker. Elliot Daly meanwhile, continues at fullback with Joe Cokanasiga keeping his place on the wing. On the bench Mark Wilson has recovered from his rib injury and is set for his first appearance of this series.The partnership of Curry and Underhill was also expected provided both proved their fitness – Jones had wanted to play the two together in the first warm-up match against Wales but the latter was struck down by injury beforehand. Their selection, along with Ford and Farrell, also suggests England will look to unleash a more expansive game plan against what is similarly strong Ireland lineup, albeit with Johnny Sexton still absent.“The players have come back in a very good physical and mental state and we have had a good preparation this week,” said Jones. “We purposefully made the week short looking ahead to the World Cup where this might happen beyond our control.“It is the third of four games for us and come 8 September, when we get on the plane, we want to be ready to go. This is another step forward for us. This weekend we will be looking to gain more game fitness and testing different sorts of game strategies. We have a specific way of how we want to play and the focus is very much on ourselves.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8b05db2cf1f349a3b70bab49bc304027e850d1b5/196_94_3571_2142/master/3571.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d24c19ac5ca2173daf05e5865c57271e","title":"talking horses yorkshire oaks enable clipper logistics firmament york horse racing tips","story":"Emotion has taken hold of Frankie Dettori in many ways over the years, from the famous flying dismount to the fist-pumping, camera-kissing euphoria that followed his second Derby win in 2015. But rarely, if ever, has it rendered him all but speechless, as it did in the moments after Enable’s final race in Britain here on Thursday.Enable’s victory in the Group One Yorkshire Oaks was as straightforward as any in what is now a 12-race winning streak that dates back 27 months. Dettori led from the off, got the response he needed from Enable when Magical, the only serious rival for the 1-4 favourite, drew closer in the straight and crossed the line with a comfortable two-and-three-quarter-length advantage. It was not a ride to test the nerves or composure of a 30-year veteran like Dettori.Instead, a moist-eyed Dettori struggled for words afterwards because he knows that his partnership with Enable has almost reached journey’s end. Her farewell to the British turf means that her racing career now has just two and a half minutes to run, as she attempts to sign off from the track with a historic third success in the Prix de l’Arc de Triomphe at Longchamp on 6 October.It was 10 minutes before he could add much more, and start to look forward to the race in just over six weeks’ time that could confirm Enable’s status as one of the sport’s all-time greats.“I love her so much that I’m biased, but I haven’t lost with her yet and we’ve won everything. She’s an amazing horse, she does it every way and she’s uncomplicated with a big presence and a massive engine. I’ll never have a horse like her in my life, with that longevity and the amount of big races that she’s won.”Tips by Greg WoodA couple of bookmakers were still offering even money about Enable for the Arc on Thursday evening but most now make John Gosden’s mare an odds-on chance at around 4-5. Japan, who edged out Crystal Ocean in the International Stakes on Wednesday, is generally a 5-1 shot with Sottsass, the French Derby winner, and Crystal Ocean both on 9-1."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e10eb5d32fbeb854bd511236e0603a72283790d6/802_38_2028_1217/master/2028.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ea04dc594c1f2cda0e9d9f4760a7e103","title":"ashes 2019 england v australia third test day one live headingley","story":"43rd over: Australia 162-6 (Labuschagne 62, Pattinson 11) Australia have lost four wickets for 26, and Paine has only 77 runs in five innings this series.Paine’s head fell over towards the off side as he pushed around his front pad at a good delivery from Woakes, delivered from wider on the crease. I thought the angle was taking it past leg stump - or at best hitting the outside of the stump - but Root reviewed almost instantly and Hawkeye had it smacking into leg stump. That’s a fine breakthrough for England, who are having an excellent end to this peculiar day.He’s out! That’s a brilliant review from Joe Root.England review for LBW against Tim Paine. I think this will be umpire’s call at best for England.42nd over: Australia 160-5 (Labuschagne 62, Paine 11) Labuschagne, the spelling of whose surname causes me almost as much bother as haemorrhoids, pulls Stokes smoothly for two. With that, the umpires call for drinks. There’s an hour of play remaining, caveats permitting.“Hi Rob,” says Gary Naylor. “Marnus Labuschagne is not the worst advert for looking at form in county cricket is he?”Form in Division Two, too. There are, as Selve pointed out the other day, some very good attacks in that ision this year.41st over: Australia 160-5 (Labuschagne 60, Paine 11) Labuschagne is beaten, chasing a very wide tempter from Broad. He reproaches himself and, for his penance, ignores a series of similar deliveries thereafter. When Broad adjusts his line for the last ball of the over, Labuschagne thick edges for three.40th over: Australia 157-5 (Labuschagne 57, Paine 11) A brilliant delivery from Stokes turns Labuschagne round, takes the edge and flies just wide of the ing Burns at gully for four. “I agree there is no obvious new captain,” says Simon Yates. “Personal view - this is one of the few downsides of central contracts. In the old days, Test-standard players ended up skippering county sides all the time as they were typically the best at their clubs and played lots of county games. So they learnt how to do it and we all got to see who was any good. Now this never happens as contracted players are hardly ever seen in the shires. Result: hardly any international players have first-class captaincy experience. So here we are.”Yep, I completely agree with this. Unless you come into the England side fairly late in your career - like, say, Andrew Strauss, or perhaps Rory Burns - it’s almost impossible to get any useful captaincy experience beforehand. When England do change captain, be it next month or in 2023, I hope they consider appointing a specialist.39th over: Australia 149-5 (Labuschagne 52, Paine 8) Labuschagne pulls Broad round the corner for a single. These are the brighest conditions of the whole day, and batting looks a bit more comfortable as a result. Saying which, Labuschagne is flat on his back after being hit in the sweet spot by Broad. He really felt that, and there’s a break in play while he receives whatever treatment you can receive in such circumstances.38th over: Australia 145-5 (Labuschagne 51, Paine 6) Stokes replaces Archer nothing happens. The light has improved considerably inthe last 10 minutes, so play could continue until 7.30pm.“The scoreboard may be looking a lot healthier but this feels a pretty odd day given how we finished the Lord’s Test,” says Guy Hornsby. “I like Root so much, but this team feels like an endless discussion around potential, rather than delivering. Like Cook, he was next off the rank, but when does the learning excuse end? He should be freed up to pile on runs at No4, but the MorganBrearley theory aside, where does a successor come from, given we’re not even sure what our best order is? It’s like we’ve got all the right instruments but we can’t find the right tune.”No idea. Making Stokes vice-captain has complicated things as well. I suspect Buttler would be the best captain of the current team, but his place isn’t guaranteed and he will probably become ODIT20 captain in the next year. He can’t do all three.37th over: Australia 145-5 (Labuschagne 51, Paine 5) England know the light could go at any time. They’d love to take one more wicket and start afresh against the bowlers tomorrow (if Pat Cummins can be described as such). Broad bowls a maiden to Labuschagne, who had been comfortably the most, erm, comfortable of the Australian batsmen.36th over: Australia 145-5 (Labuschagne 51, Paine 5) Jofra Archer currently has a Test bowling average of 16.37. Not even he will be able to sustain that, but it would surprise nobody if he became the first England bowler since Fred Trueman when to end a long Test career with an average below 25.Paine, turned round by a good delivery earlier in the over, gets his first boundary by pinging Archer through mid-off. Good shot.35th over: Australia 141-5 (Labuschagne 51, Paine 1) A good spot from John Starbuck – Stuart Broad has now joined Lord Fred as the leading wickettaker in Tests at Headingley.34th over: Australia 139-5 (Labuschagne 50, Paine 0) Wade was even more unfortunate than I first thought. The ball hit his thigh pad, deflected onto his glove and then dribbled back onto the stumps. That’s some dumb luck.“Bit early to declare the end of the Root era – it seems harsh to blame him,” says Matt Jones. “What is he supposed to about something like the 28th over? Stokes is mature enough to know what’s required, and that simply isn’t good enough. He can hardly claim fatigue…”I don’t know, this is his third summer and there isn’t much evidence that he’s a natural captain. He certainly isn’t flattered by the comparison with Eoin Morgan. As usual, though, it’ll depend on the Ashes – if they come back to win or even draw this series, he’ll surely keep going. I just feel like the team is going nowhere.A short ball from Archer follows Labuschagne and hits him on the glove, prompting the umpires to check the light meter. It’s okay for now. A quick single later in the over takes Labuschagne to another high-class fifty, this one from 73 balls. Come back Steve, all is forgiven.Hang on, Wade has been bowled in bizarre circumstances! He was hit on the thigh pad by Archer, and the ball dribbled miserably onto the leg stump. That is so unlucky. 33rd over: Australia 138-4 (Labuschagne 49, Wade 0) Broad and Archer have combined figures of 21-5-59-4. Woakes and Stokes have combined figures of 12-1-73-0.This is so much better from England. Broad has bowled Travis Head with a stunning delivery, a full-length legcutter that slammed into the top of off stump. It was unplayable - so good, in fact, that Broad pulled a Broadface in response to his own brilliance rather than that of a teammate.Gone for all money!32nd over: Australia 137-3 (Labuschagne 48, Head 0) Imagine how good Jofra Archer will be at the age of 28. It’s not the wicket so much as the timing and the manner of it England were in all kinds of trouble, so he turned things up and sorted Warner out with the minimum of fuss. He almost makes it two in the over when Head plays and misses at another beautiful delivery. Archer is now bowling faster than at any stage today. Archer may have been overbowled but he is still producing jaffas galore. The ball after beating Warner with a spectacular legcutter, he had him caught behind off a superb fuller delivery that seamed away just enough to take the edge. Glorious bowling.Oh man, this kid is sensational.“This is highly frustrating,” says Ian Copestake. “Are ‘the guys’ just relying on conditions to do the work for them only to find a partial or complete concerted refusal to work, or retardation or obstruction of work, by persons who are or have been employed by the same employer or by different employers, for the purpose of remedying a grievance or resolving a dispute in respect of any matter of mutual interest between employer and employee in accordance with the Labour Relations Act, No 66 of 1995?”It’s a bit more complicated than that.31st over: Australia 133-2 (Warner 61, Labuschagne 45) That was an excellent, intense over from Broad. Time for drinks. Warner is not out! It was a superb delivery from Broad, full of length and seaming away from Warner, but he reviewed it straight away and there was nothing on Ultra-Edge.David Warner is given out caught behind off Broad - but he has reviewed it.30th over: Australia 131-2 (Warner 59, Labuschagne 45) Root turns to Archer of course he does. Archer’s pace has been down in the mid-80s today – we don’t know for sure whether that’s due to fatigue or because he wants to bowl a fuller length in these conditions. A short ball is slapped up and over for a couple by Warner, who is starting to dominate in familiar style, and Labuschagne cuts emphatically for four later in the over. Even Archer is leaking runs now. I’m sorry to say that England have had an absolute shocker since tea. I’m probably overreacting - I do have a bit of a humour on right now - but these are starting to feel like end times for the Root era.29th over: Australia 124-2 (Warner 57, Labuschagne 41) ‘I wouldn’t mind seeing better body language from the England players,’ says Shane Warne. This is the time they need to bring a fresh Archer into the attack to make something happen, but they’ve already overbowled him. Woakes strays onto the pads of Labuschagne, who does the necessary to pick up his seventh four. Woakes has figures of 7-1-43-0, and though eight of those came from overthrows, there has been too much loose stuff.“Root having his Nasser moment with the toss today?” says Kevin Wilson. “Warner played and missed so much he was nailed on for a ton.”I thought it was close to a 5050 call – they just haven’t bowled well. 28th over: Australia 120-2 (Warner 57, Labuschagne 37) A disgusting delivery from Stokes is slapped through point for four by Warner. That takes him to 49, and later in the over he pings a slower ball just over point for four more to reach his fifty. It’s been a seriously hard-fought innings, one that will give him so much satisfaction after his desperate start to the series. Runs are flowing at Headingley. Stokes ends the over with a swinging full toss that is steered for the third boundary of the over. He needs to be replaced, probably by Stuart Broad. There have been 73 runs in the last 11 overs! 27th over: Australia 108-2 (Warner 45, Labuschagne 37) For the second time in half an hour, one becomes five for David Warner when he takes a quick single and the throw flies to the boundary. On this occasion there was no deflection off the bat it was a loose throw from square leg. Labuschagne adds four more with a superb flick through square leg. The last 10 overs have cost 61 runs, which in such bowler-friendly conditions is a minor scandal. England look grumpy, ragged and in urgent need of a wicket. It’s no exaggeration to say that this session could cost them the Ashes.26th over: Australia 97-2 (Warner 40, Labuschagne 31) A short ball from Woakes is pulled confidently behind square for four by Labuschagne. He looks a very accomplished player, although Glamorgan fans have known this for a while. He also leaves the ball a bit like Steve Smith, with a lightsaber swish after the ball has passed the bat.25th over: Australia 93-2 (Warner 40, Labuschagne 27) Woakes is about to launch into an LBW appeal when Labuschagne gets a very late inside edge. Warner survives a biggish shout for LBW later in the over, and Woakes discourages Root from reviewing on the grounds that it might have been high. It was a lovely delivery, though, and Woakes is starting to look more dangerous.24th over: Australia 92-2 (Warner 40, Labuschagne 26) A thick edge from Labuschagne flies wide of third slip for four. England are bowling some good balls - Woakes beat Warner twice in the previous over - but they are also haemorrhaging runs. One of these years I’ll remember how to spell haemorrhaging and won’t need to check.“I can’t shake the feeling that if Jimmy Anderson had been able to bowl in these conditions, Australia wouldn’t be 70-2 after 19 overs,” says Christopher Davis. “A fair few plays and misses but also plenty of bad balls.” Agreed. England haven’t bowled well enough so far, and that’s a big problem when your pace attack is your strength.23rd over: Australia 87-2 (Warner 40, Labuschagne 21) Warner steals a quick single off Woakes - and he gets five when Denly’s throw deflects off the bat of Warner. He puts his hand up to apologise it wasn’t his fault. These two have been superb between the wickets in fact, they have scored 40 from the last six overs. These are worrying times for England. Might even be end times for Joe Root. If England lose here, that’s it, the Ashes have gone.22nd over: Australia 79-2 (Warner 33, Labuschagne 20) Labuschagne is hit on the side, offering no stroke to a length delivery from Stokes. That was an odd leave, although there was no risk of getting out. Warner then laces a drive to the right of mid-off, where Woakes saves three runs with a fine ing stop. Warner is starting to look like himself for the first time in the series, while Labuschagne is batting with authority at the other end. If Australia bat well in the next 24 hours, they could put England under intolerable pressure."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/42a4e45b4c2fe2e7e411d8cee58bf363d6650b85/143_247_2758_1655/master/2758.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f3a67f042f0fd4d343d8e75f0f965711","title":"simon munnery review edinburgh 2019","story":"The Stand, EdinburghThe big-thinking leftie is revived for the age of climate change and Corbyn – but is he still as radical as he once was?The last time Simon Munnery was doing his Alan Parker character, the issues of the day were the poll tax, the rainforests and Margaret Thatcher. Now the “bedsit anarchist” is back. The world has changed, but has he?His old jokes about the Birmingham Six, the DHSS and the Thatcher years rub shoulders with material on feminism and climate change. He’s so into Extinction Rebellion that he has a graph of CO2 emissions drawn on his bomber jacket. However, his attempts to be a good feminist only betray him as being a very bad one.Whatever the issue, his “radical solutions to radical problems” are utter nonsense, like blowing on the world to cool it down. And here lies the purpose of Parker, now as it ever was. Parker isn’t a surgical satire of the loony left. It’s too surreal, and Munnery probably shares too much of his politics. Instead, Parker has clearly been created (and revived) with affection. He’s the Watford boy who thinks big but lives small. In the fine tradition of British comedy characters, he has delusions of grandeur. If anything, Munnery seems to most enjoy lampooning the tone of protest: the voice heavy with piety, the impotent sloganeering, “ambiguity” written on his hi-vis jacket.In this era of political crisis and 140-character takedowns, Parker might lack a bit of punch – do not expect any material on veganism, trans issues or Corbyn and antisemitism (the subject flutters up but it is, well, ambiguous). Even so, there is something wonderfully appealing about a character in his 50s who still has the fire, and still wants to change the world, even if he’s the least-equipped person to do it.This is all in keeping with Munnery as a comic: absurdist and playful, if a bit noncommittal. He’s also a gagsmith, and there are a handful of terrific jokes, like his take on the evils of (Billy Bragg voice) tech-nol-ogy.Munnery doesn’t waste the opportunity to dig out his old cover of the Orb’s Little Fluffy Clouds, which is still funny 25 years later. One slightly off-colour moment is a routine that, in tone at least, is a dig about self-identification.Parker signs off with his 10 radical commandments, which are printed on a tea towel he’s flogging for a fiver. It’s a slyly funny way of saying that, for him, the struggle goes on."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/102149487f366a280914ceadccf8530774df9739/1373_1068_3394_2037/master/3394.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7c48fadbca142e500079e0d8513f205d","title":"how do i take better photos ask jack phone camera","story":"Lyndsay wants people to post better pictures on Facebook. Here’s how to get the shot right on your phone or cameraSo many people post pictures on Facebook with very advanced cameras, eg from iPhones. Alas, many do not crop their photos, the horizon is not horizontal, there are dark shadows … Some people do not even know the camera can face outwards: I notice so many selfies! I think a gentle article from Jack Schofield on how not to disappoint your friends with holiday pics would be wonderful. Lyndsay (via Facebook)There are some terrible photos on Facebook, but I think the average level is very high. Back in the dark ages BC (before computers), I edited several photographic magazines and a partwork, You and Your Camera. Then, the quality of the average enprint, as enlarged prints were called, was extremely low, and you couldn’t edit pictures unless you printed them yourself. Photos taken with small-frame film formats – like the 110 cartridges used by Kodak’s Pocket Instamatic cameras, introduced in 1972 – could be dire.Since then, cheap microchips have transformed amateur photography. Automatic exposure, automatic focusing, facesmileblink detection and other features have made it much easier to take photos that are technically if not aesthetically superior. Smartphone post-processing techniques based on taking multiple images andor multiple lenses are now making results even better. There are also possibilities that were barely dreamed of in the film era, such as softening portraits in-camera, making people look slimmer, adding kitten ears, or whatever.I don’t even mind selfies, because their aims are purely social. They aren’t supposed to be suitable for magazine covers or gallery walls, unless they’re being taken by Cindy Sherman or someone like Kim Kardashian.I’m willing to cut people a bit of slack on the editing front. If you have a personal computer with a big screen, it’s easy to crop photos and improve them in other ways. You can do some editing in the standard Photos apps in Microsoft’s Windows 10 and Apple’s MacOS, and far more with a free program such as Paint.net, or the paid-for Affinity Photo. It’s harder if you are working on a small screen, and I don’t think Snapseed has an “automated levelling” button to make horizons horizontal. Yet.The obvious solution would be for Facebook to provide a decent built-in photo editor, and I think that is long overdue. A Facebook help page claims that you can crop photos in Facebook, but I can’t see how…The key to taking better pictures has little or nothing to do with the camera. It’s about using your eyes, your brain, and usually your feet. It helps if you ask yourself: “What am I photographing, and why?” Once you know the answer, think about how you could better achieve your aim.It’s unlikely that the place where you happen to be standing is the best viewpoint, unless it has been blessed with one of those signs that says “Take your photo here”. That works for distant views, but most subjects are smaller and closer. Better still, some of them – people, pets, small objects – are movable.You can move closer to the subject so it takes up more of the frame, change the angle to eliminate confusing background objects, and change position to one where the lighting looks better. If your camera has a zoom lens, you can try using a wide-angle from close up or your longest telephoto setting from a distance. Removing distractions helps your subject to stand out.It should be easier with people because you can move them to a different position with a better background andor better lighting. It’s easier to avoid ugly facial shadows than to fix them later.Of course you have to be clear about what the subject is. Someone standing in front of the Taj Mahal probably does not want a tightly-cropped headshot.The great thing about using an ancient plate camera – which I did as a photography student in Swansea – is that it doesn’t have a viewfinder. You frame your photo by looking at the upside-down image on a ground glass screen, and throwing a cloak over your head makes it easier to see it’s not just for theatrical effect. When viewfinders arrived, people started looking at the subject, not the whole frame. That works with telescopes, not with cameras.Today, most people are looking at screens, rather than through viewfinders. It should, therefore, be easier for them to view the image as a picture, and change things to improve the composition. They should be able to see whether the subject fills the frame, and whether there are poles growing out of people’s heads, or disembodied arms and legs sprouting from the edges of the frame.At the very least, before you take a picture, look all the way around the edges of the frame to make sure you are not including anything that would be better left out.Etymologically speaking, “photography” means drawing with light, and lighting can be the most important element in a picture. Some photographers, including me, love the couple of hours (or the “golden hour”) just before sunset when the light is soft and warm. Quite ordinary subjects can glow in an almost magical fashion, and if you’re on the back of a vaporetto in Venice, it’s almost impossible to take a bad shot.Photographing someone in harsh lighting can lead to hard shadows, so see if you can change your position, or theirs, to avoid them. Light-coloured, preferably white, walls act as natural reflectors. If all else fails, either use a newspaper as a makeshift reflector, or get your subject to face the light.I once wrote that “one of the things that separates the amateurs from the pros is that amateur photos often have wonky horizons”. To get a straight horizon, the camera must be level, but that is easier said than done. My Nikon D7500 has a “virtual horizon” that also shows if the camera is pointed up or down, and I still get it wrong more often than you’d imagine.One of the problems is that camera levels are not always as accurate as the human eye, which can detect even slight slants, especially when viewing seascapes. This means you have to fix the problem in software. All the Adobe products – Lightroom, Photoshop, Photoshop Elements, Photoshop Express – have ways to fix wonky horizons, but any photo-editor that supports fine degrees of rotation will do the job. The drawback is that you have to crop the picture afterwards.Have you got a question?

It is just three miles long and two miles wide, a 490-million-year-old schist and slate rock that rises out of the North Atlantic.The island is known for its views over the mountain ranges on the mainland, stretching from the Twelves Bens and Maamturks of Connemara, north to Clare Island, Achill and the Nephins for its secluded beaches such as Tranaun and Curran and its colonies of cliff-nesting fulmars and auks, as well as choughs, wheatears, plovers, and puffins.The economy of Inishturk is based on “a bit of farming and a bit of fishing. That’s enough to get by”, according to Pete Faherty who was born on the island in 1954. There are also a number of state-funded initiatives to stimulate the rural economy, including environmental maintenance and staffing for Inishturk community club. Former island nurse Helen says: ‘‘It’s a slower pace, but it’s labour intensive so your day is filled.” Her husband Jack was born on the mainland and was rowed out to the island as a newborn 70 years ago.The island has been inhabited on and off since 4000BC, and permanently since around 1700. Local historian Paddy O’Toole recently told Roads \u0026amp Kingdoms magazine that “600 people lived here before the Great Famine but from 1841 to 1851 more than 400 died or left the island, many fleeing Ireland. The population never recovered.” Today there are 54 permanent residents. There is concern among the islanders, however, that essential services may be at risk if the population continues to decline.Eamon Heanue, a farmer, fisherman and father of three young children, says: “The kind of pattern that has been happening here is when your kids get to secondary school age they have to go across to the mainland … and they are kind of gone from you then after that age. The primary school has low numbers now. There have been three children, but I believe those three are going to be leaving after the summer. If they close the school will they reopen it again in a couple of years time? I don’t know.”In an effort to develop more opportunities and income on the island, which may encourage more families to settle, the islanders are looking to tourism. Phylomena Heaney runs one of the island’s three B\u0026ampBs, Tranaun House, as well as opening the island’s post office for two afternoons a week.James has been bringing two boat loads of people to and from the island seven days a week for the last four years. The ferry represents the only regular link to the mainland, and the crossing takes an hour. Before it started operating in 1997, people had to make the journey in fishing boats.Though they embrace tourism, the islanders are careful to protect their culture and identity. According to resident Bernard Heaney: “People come to an island to see an island. Turk is nice because not everybody is in tourism, they are in fishing and farming and doing their own thing. Some busier islands can feel like an extension of the mainland. Most people come to our island because they want to talk to the locals.”However, for one weekend of the year, the population grows fivefold, when the island throws open its doors to 200 young revellers. Turkfest, held over the second weekend in June since 2013 (but now every other year from 2017), is “an exploration of craic and island adventure” with a core aim of highlighting one of Ireland’s most resilient island communities, according to its organisers Fionn Kidney, Aoife McElwain and Conor Wilson.The island is transformed into a natural theatre that plays host to beach barbecues, lobster pot stages, and music venues. The Inishturk community club, which is the social hub of the island year round, extends its hospitality to the guests, and a “glampsite” of 12 bell tents is set up by the islanders on one of the few areas of flat land.The islanders assemble stages and catch fish and lobsters to feed the visitors, as well as helping to lay on extra ferries. “Everybody pulls together and gets it done. That exchange and the support from the islanders is integral to Turkfest,” says volunteer Daithi. Islanders and guests alike “put the headphones on and go mad”, according to islander Jack during the silent disco which forms one part of the broad musical programme.Turkfesters also learn skills, such as how to catch and prepare fish. Other events see festivalgoers making the most of the island’s dark skies with guided tours of the cosmos.Coming mostly from Dublin, Cork and London, the festivalgoers bring with them aspects of their urban lives that are otherwise not readily available on the island, such as primal scream yoga, fermentation classes and tap-dancing. “It could be a clash of cultures but it’s more a meeting of minds” says Emma, a returning guest from London. Many guests have returned every year since the first festival and have formed ongoing relationships with the islanders.A highlight of the weekend’s festivities is the GAA football match, which takes place on a pitch laid out in a natural arena of rocky hills. Islanders compete against the “blow-ins” in a game that is competitive but cordial.This year’s match was won by the blow-ins but only after the odds had been sufficiently stacked against the residents by loading the field with almost twice as many players on the visiting team. “The island lads and the Turkfest crew all mixing together and having a bit of fun – it’s great,” says Robert, who lives on the island and is responsible for purifying the drinking water.Turkfest comes to a close on the Sunday evening with the spectacle of road boules. Two teams comprised of a mix of islanders and visitors compete to see which can throw a boule around the distance of the island’s only road in the fewest possible throws. Islander Brendon O’Toole says ‘‘Turkfest is brilliant. It’s a long winter and you can see here how happy the locals are to have these people here.” Turkfester James says: ‘‘The islanders are not only hosting us, they’re also the life and soul of the party.”The festivalgoers are part a growing trend of respectful tourism that seeks to leave no trace that that they were ever on the island. This philosophy ensures there is mutual appreciation between the partygoers and the residents. Eamon says that after the guests leave, “the island is exactly as it was … as if nothing has happened.”Though the island faces difficulties in terms of sustaining its population, the islanders continue to believe that “tourism gives a chance for other people to come, as well as creating jobs to keep people here”.Stephen Young, who works remotely as a graphic designer, says of his experience moving to the island with his wife Maggie from Bath in 2015: “Inishturk is a small community with a big heart, you will find no better welcome anywhere.”With a steady flow of Woofers, foreign nationals and seasonal workers, there are reasons to believe that this beautiful island will continue to provide a home to people for generations to come. For now though, the islanders need a chance to recuperate. Mary Anne O’Toole, who hosts Turkfesters, says “after the storm, there is a calm – and a big one”.• The next Turkfest is in June 2021. Tickets cost €135 to non-islanders, which includes access to music, classes and workshops other activities cost extra.

It may not sound fun but this picturesque island makes it a memorable escape from ‘reality’There’s a thrill attached to going somewhere by boat. An expanse of open water separates “real life” from ice-cream-for-breakfast holiday mode, offering a much-needed mental and physical distance from the daily grind. Boarding a ferry from the mainland to a small island famed for its beer and beach huts makes for an even greater thrill. Our destination was Ærø, a picturesque island off the south-east coast of Denmark with a population of around 6,000. It is a popular wedding destination and, since 2015, it’s had another attraction, too.On top of the sands at Ærø’s Vesterstrand beach is the yellow beach hut from the cover of my book, The Year of Living Danishly – first spotted when friends visited years ago and sent back a slew of photos. The book was a surprise bestseller and the hut became popular – prompting the owner to get in touch and readers to start sending their own hut pics. So, we went on a family pilgrimage to it – the first time all of us had holidayed together: a ramshackle party of seven that included my in-laws, husband, our five-year-old son and toddler twins, who were only potty-trained a week before. My husband, a thrifty sort and fond of the great outdoors, had spared no expense and booked us into a two-star campsite. With toddler twins. Who were only potty trained a week before!Søby Camping (adult from £12.50 a night, under-16s £7.50) is a small site on the Baltic coast with 30 pitches, wildflowers and its own beehive. There’s also a communal barbecue, shower block and washing-up facilities. It’s now also known as the place where my father-in-law destroyed my husband’s favourite frying pan (yes, we have favourites) by over-scrubbing, cue teeth sucking all around.I’m not a natural camper and was beginning to rue the fact we hadn’t booked in to a hotel – but then I saw the view: an expanse of bleached pebbles, emerald water and cerulean sky, with scarcely a soul in sight. In a sheltered corner of the Baltic, the cape at Søby beach is littered with hulsten (hole stones) – naturally occurring “lucky” stones with holes in them made by pebbles wearing down larger stones. They’re found in spots where currents of water bash rocks about more than usual. Once we had pitched the tent and our five-year-old had overcome his outrage at not being able to watch Paw Patrol (“There’s no telly?!”) collecting hulsten became his favourite hobby.As well as the rugged coast, the island has soft, sandy beaches facing the South Funen archipelago, such as Ærøskøbing and Marstal, and naturist favourites Risemark Strand and Erikshale, where whole stretches of sand are reserved for those who like their holidays au naturel. Ever the joiners, we got on our bikes. Pedalling myself, a trailer and 30kg of toddlers proved no mean feat in the August heat but we made it to Ærøskøbing, a former market town and Denmark’s best-preserved settlement of the 18th century. Today, the 900-strong population live in yellow houses on cobbled streets lined with hollyhocks, looking and feeling very much like something out of a fairytale. My father-in-law stumbled across a willow workshop and set about creating an “abstract sculpture” of woven twigs so vast that he elected to leave most of his luggage behind so he could transport it home in his suitcase. The rest of us opted for ice-cream in the idyllic town square before we headed to Vesterstrand to see “my hut”.We met the owner and her family it was strangely moving, being there with my own brood. I wrote The Year of Living Danishly following years of failed fertility treatment and thinking I’d never have children of my own. And now, here we all were. I had “a moment” – before being snapped out of my reverie by a toddler staging a dirty protest in a sand dune. We mopped up, made our apologies and moved on.Ærø has a strong maritime history and at Marstal Søfartsmuseum we learned about the island’s shipping past via paintings, model ships and even a child-size play boat that my kids would happily live in. However, my husband had scheduled a brewery tour he selflessly insisted that it was “research”, so we tore ourselves away. Ærø’s Rise Brewery (45-minute tour £15.50) boasts speciality beers, including IPAs, stouts and a seaweed ale, with labels so decorative that my husband took to peeling them off to paste into a scrapbook. Ærø’s brewers make barley salads and biscuits out of the leftovers from the brewing process – and they were tastier than they sound.In case beer and boats aren’t your thing, Ærø also offers organised photography walks, as well as beach yoga, guitar coaching, classical music concerts, sailing, kitesurfing, fishing, golf and all manner of opportunities for eating. As well as cafes and kro – the closest thing Danes have to pubs – every second street has an honesty box selling salad leaves, potatoes or honey, and for everything else, there’s a Co-op grocery.Our evenings were spent barbecuing, a glass of wine in hand, spying on what other campers were having for supper. A pair of Germans became the envy of the campsite for their seafood platters and champagne, while we chowed down on charred sausages. Still, eating alfresco while watching Aperol spritz sunsets wasn’t too shabby.We fell into a rhythm that was relaxed and reconciled to the minor inconveniences of life under canvas: bee stings, permanent stickiness and a man in the tent next to us suffering from sleep apnoea, mostly. There’s a cadence to island life that’s largely dictated by the ferry – from the times new people arrive, to when the supermarket gets fresh deliveries.Denmark is made up of 406 islands and we have visited a few of them during six years of living Danishly. Other favourites include Fanø on the west coast, where you can drive on deserted beaches and enjoy some of the best kite flying in Europe or Bornholm, off the south coast of Sweden, where you can eat Michelin-starred food at Kadeau and lounge by the sea on sand so fine that it used to be used in egg timers.By the end of our island adventure, there was sand andor pebbles in everything we owned and our five-year-old had collected so many stones that his rucksack weighed more than he did. He was persuaded to leave some behind and we took the ferry back to “reality”. On deck, we savoured a final orange sunset and toasted the trip with one last Ærø beer.Camping with three generations, in a heatwave, was a challenging experience. But I have to admit that it was pretty special, too. Turns out Ærø is a place where memories are made. And we’re all going back again next year.Ferries sail from Fynshav (two-hour150km drive from Billund airport) and from Faaborg and Svendborg on Funen, Denmark (about a two-hour drive from Copenhagen airport). Tickets and schedules are available at aeroe-ferry.dk. Starling Air, a small airline, also flies to Ærø.Helen Russell is author of The Year of Living Danishly, which is available at the  Bookshop.

It is possible to hire a range of bicycles from Watchtree Wheelers to tour the perimeter, though cyclists aren’t permitted to disturb the peace of the wooded areas.

A great place to observe all four seasons.• sstaffs.gov.ukColin PearsonBeacon Hill national nature reserve stands above the South Downs in Hampshire. The top of the hill is coated in beech woodland, which provides shady respite from the heat of the summer sun. The chalk downlands are the real attraction though, and you have to be prepared to go slow to appreciate its delights – multitudes of plants, all in flower, just centimetres from each other. The mind boggles at how so many different things can live cheek by jowl. The cherry on the cake isn’t just the song of the skylark, but the clouds of butterflies that erupt with every step. Here I am reminded of Pig-Pen, the character in Charlie Brown, as silver-spotted skipper butterflies surround me in their hundreds.• gov.ukRobFor a slice of serenity in the heart of London, I love Millwall Dock on the Isle of Dogs. Dwarfed by the skyscrapers of Canary Wharf, this expanse of open water is the perfect contrast to fast-paced urban life. Whether it’s observing the mischievous birdlife squabbling over possession of the tern raft in the old graving dock, or partaking in a bracing open-water swim from the Docklands Sailing \u0026amp Watersports Centre, or simply watching the sun set over the City of London with an array of dinghies in the foreground, there’s always something to amuse, refresh or inspire. And for those more interested in llamas, goats and donkeys, Mudchute Farm is just a stone’s throw away.Jack StookesSandwell Valley, near West Bromwich, is a one-of-a-kind place full of hidden gems, with surviving bits of real countryside, open pastures and grass meadows. It also has a nice old farm turned into a museum and two large, well-equipped playgrounds. Or you can visit the priory ruins – said to be haunted – with its Saxon stone coffins, surrounded by old dark woods with hidden medieval ponds. More recent history lies in the second world war ack-ack gun emplacements, still in good shape, but more and more engulfed by the vegetation every year. And an old colliery site has been transformed into a wildlife haven by the RSPB on the river Tame. This is all within a 1.5-mile radius surrounded on all sides by urban sprawl. May it remain undeveloped for ever.• sandwell.gov.ukStanleyMy absolute favourite green space is the Dalston Eastern Curve Garden. This small urban community oasis is set back from the madness of busy Hackney on a disused train line. It’s a beautifully layered garden with a magical wooded area, raised beds with vegetables, and beautiful pots full of seasonal flowers. The main reason I come here is for inspiration – I love the creativity, especially across the seasons. I especially love visiting in October: despite the year growing old, it is transformed into a beautiful autumnal space, using the changing plants, hundreds of carved pumpkins, and coppery red crispy leaf garlands. Sitting in the cold, warmed by a hot chocolate, it is just perfect.• dalstongarden.orgKatherine PhippsWilliamson Park in Lancaster is a gem. Jimmy Williamson (Lord Ashton) commissioned its construction from the remains of the city quarry in the 19th century. Most people who have passed Lancaster on the M6 heading north will have seen the Ashton Memorial in the centre of the park, rising above the trees, but step inside and you find lovely walks between mature trees, a regular outdoor theatre, cafe, wildlife park, butterfly house, children’s play areas and – on a clear day – views across Morecambe Bay to the Lakeland Fells.

It managed to survive when it hired Bristol Palin in 2010. It clung on when everyone accused Carlton from The Fresh Prince of Bel Air of being a ringer in 2014. It even managed to stagger on after subjecting the world to the sight of Jerry Springer abjectly cha-cha-chaing his way through a song called Hey Daddy.But the appointment of Sean Spicer as a Dancing with the Stars contestant feels different. This is the first time that it feels like Dancing with the Stars might crash and burn, and take everyone down with it. Spicer isn’t the first Trump-affiliated figure to take part in the show – Marla Maples and Rick Perry were both contestants in 2016 – but he is one of the most notorious, and the scars from his tenure as Trump’s communications director are still fresh, and it’s fair to say that all hell is kicking off.The blowback has been instantaneous. We’ve already seen headlines like “Sean Spicer belongs on a permanent public blacklist, not in a televised waltz” and “ABC should rename its reality show Dancing With the Scumbags” and CNN has begun to navel-gaze about America’s unquestioning relationship with celebrity. The host of Dancing with the Stars, Tom Bergeron, has distanced himself from Sean Spicer with a spikily worded tweet:And, obviously, the internet is aflame. The hashtag #BoycottDWTS has taken off on Twitter, with users threatening to abandon any companies who advertise on the show during Spicer’s tenure, and people are reacting furiously to anyone else affiliated with the show who doesn’t outright condemn him. Fellow contestant Karamo Brown from Queer Eye has already endured the worst controversy of his career by calling Spicer “a good guy, a really sweet guy” in an Access Hollywood video. The other contestants, including James Van Der Beek, Christie Brinkley and Lamar Odom, will have to watch their every word if they are to escape a similar fate.This could have all been so easily avoided. Look at the other contestants taking part on Dancing with the Stars this year. Someone from The X Factor. Someone from American Idol. Someone from The Bachelorette. That’s the base level of fame required to appear on Dancing with the Stars, and there are thousands of other people who fit the bill. The series could have filled Spicer’s slot with someone from Big Brother or one of those godawful Housewives shows and nobody would have been any the wiser.But no, instead they picked the guy charged with defending Donald Trump. The man who was the mouthpiece of the most isive American leader in living memory, who lied and rationalised and deliberately spread misinformation so readily that he is the reason why the phrase “alternative facts” entered the lexicon. He banned members of the press from his briefings. He weirdly chose to defend Adolf Hitler during Passover, although he did at least apologise for this.It doesn’t make any sense. Dancing with the Stars is a big, mainstream entertainment show that exists solely to draw the largest possible audience. Sean Spicer is an alienating figure, who will actively stop people from watching. Cast your mind back to all the other times he’s tried to pal up to the mainstream, and how terribly it went then. When he made a cameo during the 2017 Emmys, popping up to reference one of his most notorious outbursts, the backlash was such that it threatened to damage the reputation of its host Stephen Colbert. That it didn’t is largely down to the photograph from the same night of Sean Spicer being kissed on the cheek by James Corden, who bore the brunt of the outrage and later had to apologise for his poor judgment.The worst thing about Spicer’s appearance is that it opens the door for all the other fame-hungry Trumpers who want an easy path to rehabilitation. Who could it be next year? Kellyanne Conway? Anthony Scaramucci? Mike Pence? Eric? By allowing Sean Spicer to take part, Dancing with the Stars has made itself an easy out for terrible people. It has opened up a terrible future for itself. Unless, of course, Sean Spicer destroys the show forever. Fingers crossed."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/651f5c418a4dd00669f0660dc679e524f7ee5794/0_0_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=64bc1cd8514e8675261b6b0d7e4ea4db","title":"eu migration uk lowest level since 2013 ons data","story":"ONS figures released after it admitted reliability of data had been downgradedImmigration to the UK from the EU remains at its lowest level since 2013, according to disputed estimates from the Office for National Statistics.The quarterly migration statistics report has been released a day after the ONS had to admit the reliability of the data set had been called into question and had been downgraded from the gold-plated “national statistic” status to “experimental”.The move came after statisticians discovered EU migration to the UK had been underestimated, while non-EU migration had been overestimated.Released under its reclassified experimental status, the data showed net migration to the UK – the difference between people leaving and arriving – was 226,000 in the year to March.As home secretary and prime minister, Theresa May had relentlessly pursued a target of reducing net migration to tens of thousands but never succeeded. Her successor as prime minister, Boris Johnson, ditched the target when he took office.The data shows the number of EU citizens arriving in the UK has continued to fall since 2016, mainly because of a decline in people coming to the country for work, the ONS said.In the year ending in March, EU immigration was estimated to be 200,000. This is the lowest since the year ending June 2013, when it was an estimated 183,000.The fall in EU immigration is the main reason for the low level of net EU migration – the difference between the number of those arriving in the UK and the number leaving, not including UK citizens – which at 59,000 is less than a third of its peak level of 219,000 in the year ending March 2015.The figures show 52,000 more UK citizens left the country than returned home.The figures have been released at a time of intense debate over freedom of movement, as the home secretary, Priti Patel, plans to bring it to an abrupt end in the event of a no-deal Brexit.Matthew Fell, the CBI’s chief UK policy director, said: “The downward trend in EU net migration in the last couple of years, combined with record low unemployment, means that skills shortages are getting worse.“Business understands that free movement is ending, but it marks a huge change in the way firms access skills and labour. They will need proper time to adapt to a new system.“The announcement that free movement will end immediately in a ‘no deal’ has left employers and their employees asking fundamental questions about what this means for them. They urgently need this clarified.”For net migration outside the EU, an estimated 219,000 more non-EU citizens moved to the UK than left in the year ending March 2019. Net migration of British citizens was 52,000"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/79a877d70a6c3110ac5456054f7a4dcd92927f9a/0_225_3730_2237/master/3730.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ed9b4e56c87d8830cb099ed6b60b12e8","title":"italian president meets party leaders to explore coalition options","story":"Five Star Movement woos Democratic party after end of alliance with far-right League The leader of Italy’s anti-establishment Five Star Movement (M5S) has said he is striving for a solid majority with the centre-left Democratic party (PD) after the collapse of its stormy alliance with the far-right League.“We won’t let the ship sink, or Italians will pay,” Luigi Di Maio said after a meeting with the country’s president, Sergio Mattarella.Mattarella met leaders of Italy’s main parties on Thursday to see if an alternative government can be formed after the outgoing prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, ended the M5S-League coalition. The alliance had been on shaky ground since it came to power in June 2018.The collapse was triggered earlier this month by the League leader Matteo Salvini’s call for fresh elections, as he sought to exploit the his party’s growing popularity.Fearing an M5S-PD alliance that would put paid to his election hopes, Salvini appeared to backtrack after his talks with Mattarella on Thursday. He said he still wanted elections, but that the League could also resume governing with M5S as long as it got things done.“There was a stalled government that stalled the country. If they want to restart the government and the country, I am here, without looking back … if there’s a different team that get things done, I won’t hold a grudge,” he said.“An M5S-PD agreement would mean returning to ‘the old politics’. My interest is that Italians have a government that does things … I’m sure Mattarella has and will have all the elements to choose in the best interests of the people and country.” Salvini said he had discovered that some within M5S backed his “brave” budget proposal.M5S and the PD are in talks to come up with a programme that could steer the government through until the end of its legislative term in 2023.The PD leader, Nicola Zingaretti, who until Wednesday had resisted talk of an alliance with M5S, has outlined five key conditions. They include a change in policy on the management of migrants, a commitment to remaining in the EU, more investment, changes to social and economic policy and a focus on sustainable development.Zingaretti told reporters after meeting Mattarella on Thursday that he was willing to explore a government with M5S but not at any cost.“We need a turning-point government, alternative to the rightist parties, with a new, solid programme, an ample parliamentary base, which will restore hope to Italians,” he said. “If these conditions do not exist, the natural outcome of the crisis is an early election for which the PD is ready.”Mattarella could give the parties a few more days to negotiate if he is convinced they can form a strong government. They would need to nominate a prime minister by Monday.Italian media reported on Thursday that Mattarella would probably opt for early elections if M5S and the PD failed to come to an agreement.

Or rather, he couldn’t.“Because of the communications lockdown, I couldn’t call her for the prayer. Like everyone else, she is caged inside her home. I don’t even know if my family has enough food and medicines,” said Hammad.Inside the dressing room, the mood was jubilant. Amid loud music and high-fiving, the players congratulated themselves after a 0-0 draw on a pitch made swampy by torrential monsoon rains. The result took the team to the semi-finals of the Durand Cup, India’s oldest football tournament, where they would eventually lose to Mohun Bagan in a tight game a few days later.Kashmir’s first professional football club had already been stunning crowds by defeating more experienced clubs to make it to the I League, one of Indian football’s premier competitions, but unlike other teams, the players have had a lot on their minds.Ever since they flew out of Kashmir on 5 August, they have had almost no contact with their families. That was the day a communications crackdown was imposed on landlines, mobiles and the internet shortly before New Delhi revoked Kashmir’s special status, stripping away its autonomy.For Khalid Qayoom, the lockdown meant his parents hadn’t even watched the matches. “It would have meant travelling to someone else’s home and my father was scared he might break the curfew. None of us likes what is happening there. It’s inhuman. But we are professionals and didn’t let it affect our concentration,” said Qayoom.The rise of Real Kashmir is a fairytale. For the past three decades, few happy stories, let alone fairytales, have come out of the troubled region, scarred by an armed insurgency and a heavy Indian troop presence that has brought Kashmiri youths out on the streets hurling stones at the soldiers while demanding “azadi” or freedom from India.Three years ago, Sandeep Chattoo, a Kashmiri Hindu, was talking to his Kashmiri Muslim friend Shamim Mehraj, about the endless violence and sense of hopelessness. They decided to buy 100 footballs and hand them out to the neighbourhood boys.“We knew they had to find an outlet for their energy. We wanted them to play football instead of throwing stones, to find a new direction. We wanted to inspire them to build a better life for themselves,” said Chattoo who is co-owner of the club with Mehraj.Soon, a team was born. The name is meant to show the ‘real’ face of Kashmir with boys playing football and families cheering them on instead of the usual images of violence in this conflict zone over which India and Pakistan have fought two wars.About the only thing supporting this grand ambition of creating Kashmir’s first professional football club was the passion for football. In most of India, cricket is the religion but not in Kashmir. All the other odds, however, were stacked against them. Thirty years of civil strife had left no football infrastructure. There was no ground. The team had to train at the grounds of a tourist centre which was an open field with fencing and not even a wash room.There were days when the players had to work around shutdown, curfews, and grenade attacks to reach the centre. Their determination was intensified when Chattoo brought in Scottish player and coach David Robertson, after much persuasion.He declined offers from China and Uganda to end up in a place where the harsh winters, with no central speaking, have been a trial. For days on end, there would be no internet, even before the current shutdown. “Now the team is my family. It’s been a fantastic journey. I am building something special here,” said Robertson.The club has transformed life in the Valley. “Real Kashmir is more than football. It’s an act of hope,” said Chattoo. Over 20,000 people regularly fill the 15,000-capacity stadium in downtown Srinagar. Thousands stand outside. Protest marches have been called off for a match.For 90 minutes, Kashmiris experience what it is to feel happy and normal. When the roars from the stadium during a game reverberate across the snow-topped Zabarwan mountains encircling Srinagar, it is clear people have momentarily forgotten their troubles.For player Danish Farooq, the support of the local people has been uplifting. “In the winters, with sub-zero temperatures, they come and watch us, with no cover, nothing. I guess people need something to look forward to and football gives them that,” said Farooq.The team almost didn’t make it to Kalyani stadium for the Saturday fixture. It was only because Chattoo has developed almost extra-sensory perceptions having lived in Kashmir for so long that it managed to fly out of Srinagar in the nick of time.In the days before the August 5 communications lockdown, Chattoo had been watching tens of thousands of extra troops being deployed. Tourists were being evacuated en masse from Kashmir. He sensed something was up. He told the players to leave their homes and reach a hotel near the airport.That way, even if a curfew or travel restrictions were suddenly imposed in downtown Srinagar, the team would be close to the airport and could catch their flight out of Kashmir. Without his quick thinking, Real Kashmir would have missed the tournament.The club’s story is getting attention. Adidas India announced a partnership with the club – the first with any club in India. BBC Scotland and Al Jazeera have made documentaries. Netflix is working on a film and so is Bollywood.The accolades are merely spurring Chattoo on to push for greater things. “I want football to change life in Kashmir. Football makes people happy and Kashmir needs happiness.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/139c969fcf8fe62de6c484cdaf0d5d076683eecf/0_184_2592_1555/master/2592.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a8a975cd41709b584d53a36e0d3d4a2f","title":"town near barcelona uses wolf urine to keep wild boar away","story":"Lack of rain may be forcing animals to seek food from rubbish bins in AiguafredaA small town outside Barcelona is using wolf urine to deter wild boar that have been coming in from the surrounding countryside.After trying a variety of deterrents, the town council of Aiguafreda has agreed, in association with the local hunters’ association, to see if the smell of the pheromones of the wild pigs’ principal predator will keep them at bay.At least 10 boars have been sighted in the town recently. “There’s not much food in the woods because it hasn’t rained, so they come into town looking for food,” Albert Alexandre Temprado, a local hunter, told El País.While boar numbers in the countryside can be controlled by hunters, this isn’t a viable option in populated areas. Earlier this year the town tried using polyurethane to deter them, but the effect wore off within a few days.The council has created a perimeter of powdered wolf urine around the town, a method it insists is environmentally friendly and has no effect on domestic dogs. Temprado admitted that it remained to be seen whether it was effective.Meanwhile, local authorities have warned people not to approach the boars, as they can become aggressive, or to leave food out for them. They also advise that they should keep rubbish containers closed to stop the animals from foraging.The boar are an invasive species and extremely adaptable. They have increasingly encroached on urban areas, much as foxes have in British cities.Research by the University of Barcelona suggests that some wild boar are even passing up on natural sources of food found in the woods in favour of foraging among rubbish.In recent years, groups of the animals have regularly been sighted in Barcelona, especially in neighbourhoods close to their natural habitat in the wooded Collserola hills to the west of the city. They have also been spotted close to the city centre.The boars carry disease and also cause numerous road accidents. Barcelona has employed a variety of methods to control numbers, among them targeting females of breeding age.In 2017 the city launched an experimental campaign of sterilisation using a vaccine. The technique has already been used in Britain and the United States. Early reports suggested that the vaccine had reduced the local Barcelona population by around 400."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Naval service detained boat south of Fastnet Rock for alleged fishing regulation breachTwo appear in court in connection with theft of statue heads at museumPlan \u0026lsquoomits roads policing as one of the four key focus areas\u0026rsquo at operational levelCassidys return to Rotunda Hospital to share birthday celebrations with staff who cared for them following their birthMore than 33,000 products were prevented from entering the Irish market last yearChild was due to start at primary school close to father\u0026rsquos homePSNI chief constable says Border checkpoints would be targets for dissident republicansDocument warns Ireland will be legally obliged to apply border controls to food entering from United KingdomCouple give undertaking to meet their monthly mortgage repaymentsData Protection Commissioner found data unlawfully held on 3.2m peopleSystem is \u0026lsquodesigned and operated in such a way it prevents people from integrating\u0026rsquoAidan Magennis, who has two broken legs, appears in court charged with assaultPlaintiffs claim departure without agreement would breach Belfast AgreementGarda Commissioner says until there is a deal between UK and EU \u0026lsquoit\u0026rsquos not going to be the same\u0026rsquoDrew Harris rejects claims that rural locations will lose out under the new structureMet \u0026Eacuteireann says heatwave in UK and UK driven by high pressure is unlikely to reach IrelandA* grades drop by 2.2 percentage points from 9.9 per cent last year to 7.7 per centJackpot was close to being shared after a player in Co Laois fell one number shortMallard hopes more employers would follow his lead in making workplaces child-friendly"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3993815.1566488097!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"north food businesses could go under in three days in no deal brexit","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tSome food businesses in North ‘could go out of businesses within three days’ under no-deal BrexitSome food businesses in the North have warned they could go out of business “within three days” under a no-deal Brexit. Ireland will also be legally obliged to apply border controls to food entering the country from the United Kingdom in the event of a no-deal Brexit, the Food Research Collaboration (FRC) has warned in a paper. In a briefing document published on Thursday, the body – which comprises academics and food-related organisations in the UK – also said it was “hard to exaggerate the disruption” this scenario would cause. “It has been suggested by some food businesses in Northern Ireland that in these circumstances they could go out of businesses within three days,” the FRC said. It also warned “criminals will be waiting to exploit any weaknesses in food safety systems or EU perimeter controls that emerge as a result of Brexit”, and that raised prices and restricted supply were most likely to impact fruit and vegetables.The warning is contained in the Food, No Deal and the Irish Border paper, which is the latest in a series by the FRC that explores the implications of Brexit for the food industry. Dr Rosalind Sharpe, from the FRC, said food sectors on both sides of the Border have “quietly integrated” since the Belfast Agreement. “Farms and food businesses, from the giant to the micro, depend on being able to ship goods easily across the Border. “A no deal Brexit pulls the rug from under them. Some could go out of business within days,” she said. The paper highlights the logistical impossibility of fulfilling the physicalveterinary, documentary and identification that which would be required by the EU in the event of a no-deal Brexit. In such a scenario, every food consignment crossing from Northern Ireland into the Republic would have to be accompanied by an Export Health Certificate, which is required by the EU for all products of animal origin that are being imported to the EU from a third country. “Given the number of businesses involved, the frequency and volume of documentation required, and the current resources available to carry out the work, servicing the anticipated demand is not feasible, and certainly not by 31 October,” the FRC stated. “There are insufficient qualified professionals, and insufficient time and resources to recruit and train new ones. “In these circumstances, food consumers in NI will experience disruption, public authorities will be severely tested, and food enterprises will face potentially insurmountable challenges.” The paper makes a number of recommendations, including avoiding a no-deal Brexit and ensuring Northern Ireland has “effective government and governance” in place, “preferably through the restoration of the NI institutions but if not through a form of direct rule.“These arrangements are necessary to safeguard public health and avoid threats to food security,” it warned.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Photograph: Robbie ReynoldsIreland’s only set of quintuplets have turned 18 years of age.In August 2001 they arrived into the world weighing between 1lb 6oz and 1lb 11oz.After weeks in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) of Dublin’s Rotunda Hospital following their birth on August 16th that year Conor, Cian, Rory, Amy and Derbhail Cassidy were eventually discharged home to mum and dad Veronica and Kevin Cassidy in Bridgetown, Co Wexford in November and December that year.Their family have marked many milestones since then from first steps to their first day at school and another one was marked this week when they returned to the Rotunda to visit staff who spent months caring for them following their birth and share a birthday cake with them.The quintuplets were born at just over 25 weeks gestation and their mum Veronica Cassidy says she was “quite worried” at the time.“We didn’t think back 18 years ago that we would see this day but we have”.“The girls didn’t come out until December 6th, they were there for quite a while so it was hard to juggle it all then but we did the best we could,” she recalled.But she says every time she went into the neonatal intensive care unit she felt happy. “Every time I went in I was quite content”.Professor Fergal Malone, master of the Rotunda Hospital, says for all five to survive in a healthy manner is extremely unusual.Multiple births, he said, have become increasingly common in the last 10 years, “with about three in every 1,000 pregnancies being a twin, triplet or higher order multiple gestation”.“There has been a 30 per cent increase in the number of successful twin births in the last two decades, which is due to wider availability of assisted reproductive technologies and older maternal ages at conception,” he said.“However, the number of triplet, quadruplet and quintuplet births has halved, due to more effective controls on assisted reproductive technologies. With multiple births, there is a 95 per cent survival rate for twins, 70 per cent triplets and 50 per cent for quadruplets.“It is clear however that quintuplets are very rare today, with the Cassidy quintuplets being the only set in Ireland, and the healthy survival rate of all five babies in a quintuplet pregnancy is quite exceptional.”Ms Cassidy, who went from thinking at one scan that she was expecting twins to actually having the famous five, said the family went out to a local restaurant on Friday last to celebrate the siblings birthday and on Saturday night they threw a barbeque for family and friends.“They definitely have a great connection, but like siblings they fight and they fall out and they’ll fall back in again. They’re quiet 18-year-olds really. They’ve always had each other so they don’t depend really on other people, more so on each other,” Ms Cassidy added.“When they were smaller we tried to get them into sport and that and as they got older they found their own way and found what they liked. They’re totally different, real iniduals.”As the five now head into their Leaving Cert year they will have no shortage of support, as all attend the same school."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3993897.1566469575!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"winning 11 2m lotto ticket was sold in co wicklow","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe jackpot of €11,225,280 - the highest in more than two years - had been rolling since June 12th.Someone who bought a lottery ticket in Co Wicklow in the last few days is €11.2 million richer this morning.

The bonus number was 12.A National Lottery spokesman said: “With a jackpot win of this amount, it is important that we take some time to inform the winning retailer and of course to give the winning ticketholder the time and space they need to let this truly life-changing win to sink in.“If you are the lucky ticketholder please be sure to sign the back of the ticket, keep it safe and contact the National Lottery prize claims team on (01) 836 4444 and we will make arrangements for you to collect your prize”.The jackpot was close to being shared as another Laois player fell one number short, matching five numbers and the bonus ball. This player has won €134,412 and they bought their ticket at Dunnes Stores at the Kyle Shopping Centre in Portlaoise.The spokesman also confirmed the Good Causes Fund was perhaps the biggest winner with funds raised in the most recent jackpot roll: “This jackpot has been rolling since Wednesday 12th June and since then Lotto sales alone have raised approximately €18.6 million for good causes all over Ireland.” The highest Lotto jackpot was €18.9 million in Hegarty’s, Staplestown, Co. Carlow, in June 2008.So far this year, more than €82.3 million has been won in prizes in the Lotto, creating 13 new millionaires.The last Lotto jackpot was won by a Galway man who won the €4,051,610 on offer on June 8th."},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons august 2019","story":"To continue reading this articleAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per weekRegister for freeRegister or subscribe to continue readingAlready a subscriber?Newsletters and daily briefings30 days free, then £2 per weekUnlimited access to Premium articlesExclusive subscriber events and rewardsThe daily newspaper on your smartphone or tabletAlready a subscriber?Order The Best of Matt 2018 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514. To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to telegraphmattprints or call 0191 603 0178.Comment: Macho Macron tried to boss Boris Johnson... but the bumbling bulldog fought backFrench mayor on trial for banning pesticide use around village homesFrench absinthe receives Brussels \u0026#39green\u0026#39 light for protected status Woman, 93, who had her house burgled by three men posing as police officers dies of \u0026#39broken heart syndrome\u0026#39Miriam Margolyes accuses West End producers of \u0026#39overt appropriation\u0026#39 for not casting Jewish actorsThe eagles have landed: after being hunted to extinction these spectacular birds are back BBC Today programme accused of making light of domestic violence over John Humphrys and David Davis jokesBrexit Backstop: what are the options Boris Johnson can turn to for the Irish border?UK weather: Record heatwave forecast for bank holiday weekendDublin and Brussels \u0026#39in secret talks about new customs checks and controls at ports and factories\u0026#39 as no-deal likelihood growsIrish backstop explained: what does it mean for Brexit, and why is the Irish border so important?How could a no-deal Brexit affect the UK?Britain\u0026#39s strictest school\u0026#39s first GCSE results are four times better than national averageGCSE results day 2019: Top grades on the rise despite new tougher examsBritain\u0026#39s highest paying degrees, according to UK graduate salariesComment: How can anyone place their faith in a migration system that is orced from reality?\tBrown bear that is killing livestock and startling hikers in Italy\u0026#39s Dolomites is wanted, dead or alive Giraffes protected from being slaughtered for their body parts for first timeCoroner urges Home Secretary to review domestic abuse laws after man bludgeons wife to deathComment: Britain has a troubled history with the railways.

We expect every pupil to greet teachers and guests with eye contact and a polite, cheerful, ‘morning, sir!’ ‘afternoon, miss!’If a school is too permissive, allowing too many exceptions, it risks creating helplessness, selfishness or dependence in its pupils rather than responsibility, consideration and agency. If a school reduces its standards for poorer pupils because of their poverty or difficult home life, it does them a disservice frankly, it doesn’t believe in them enough. Children get their results at Michaela Community School Ms Birbalsingh named the school after her former colleague Michaela Emanus, who died of cancer in 2011.She said after getting her school\u0027s first set of results: Michaela was my old-school colleague for many years. She believed in rigour, old-fashioned values, in kids being allowed to be kids abd in adults leading the way.Sadly she died of cancer in 2011. She would have been so proud of our school and what we have achieved.She posted a video on Twitter of herself celebrating with parents, writing: Nothing nicer than parents saying, ‘We trusted you and we you did it!’ ‘TOGETHER! I say! We did it TOGETHER!’ Parents matter!!Suella Braverman MP said: Huge congratulations to all staff \u0026amp pupils for AMAZING GCSE results today. We need more schools like Michaela Community School \u0026amp more teachers like Ms Birbalsingh. Very proud of all you today. We can create more free schools.The teenagers were pleased with their resultsTom Bennett, the founder of researchED, added: I’ve been to this school several times and I’m not surprised by this. It’s a beacon of routine, consistency and professionalism- but what many people don’t see is its commitment to kindness, manners and altruism. There’s a lot to be gained by reflecting on their exampleDaniel Hannan MEP, who has supported her free school since its inception, said: Take a moment to think of what Katharine Birbalsingh  has achieved.She fought the bureaucracy to establish a free school. Many of her intake came from disadvantaged backgrounds. She put her trust in old-fashioned teaching methods. Now, five years on, this is the result.The headteacher had previously vowed never to teach in the state sector again and said at the Conservative Party Conference in 2010 that working in the state sector had turned her into a conservative.She said at the time: In schools and in society, we need high expectations, of everyone, even if you\u0027re black, or live on a council estate – Why can\u0027t they sit exams at the end of the year?We need to rid the classrooms of chaos by unshackling heads and setting our schools free.The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

On a per capita basis, that was more than the US. Well she might crow.\u0026nbspThat’s indeed impressive.\u0026nbspBut those figures require a bit of context because while tech might be attracting foreign cash, overseas investors have been turning\u0026nbsptheir backs on the rest of UK plc.\u0026nbspMore than half of women working in tech told they’re ‘too pretty’Trump ‘tells UK US trade deal relies on dropping tax on tech giants’ Ocado’s tech gobbledygook has investors in a tizzy Figures from the Department for International Trade, published in June, show a 14 per cent slump in foreign direct investment (FDI)\u0026nbspover the 201819 financial year\u0026nbspcompared with the previous 12 months. The number of new jobs created fell at an even faster rate: they were down by 24 per cent.An analysis by the Financial Times also found that in the three years to June, the number of jobs created through UK FDI in new production facilities, or extensions of existing ones, had dropped by nearly a fifth (19 per cent) to 183,000 compared with the same period before the EU referendum.\u0026nbspThe Conservative Party used to hail Britain’s record as a hub of overseas investment and a European leader. That’s\u0026nbspbecause it was. It has systematically trashed that.\u0026nbspThere are a few reasons why tech may be bucking the marked downward trend, or rather, there are a few reasons why tech may currently be bucking the marked downward trend.For a start, the Brexit induced slump in the pound makes buying into clever UK tech projects very cheap right now. Foreign investors are, in effect, shopping for whizzy new gizmos in the bargain bin where you might normally find previous generations of mobile phones and tablets shortly after a new model’s launch.It also comes at a time when the UK (and Europe) might provide a handy hedge for Asian investors\u0026nbspwith the US and China knocking trade lumps out of each other. Asian investors like Japan’s Softbank or Singapore’s Clermont Group have been active investors in the UK tech scene.\u0026nbspTech isn’t likely to be affected by the no deal Morgan will play a role in kicking the country with as much as, say, the motor industry, with its requirement for just-in-time delivery of parts up the supply chain, or agriculture, which faces a series of ruinous new tariffs.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

She was 19, a self-described “sneakerhead” with a part-time job in Footlocker and an obsession with matching her outfit with her trainers. She was also a big fan of working out at the gym, where she would do strength training and resistance, partly to prove to her brother that she could do press-ups. Wearing the hijab provided a new challenge: “I didn’t know how to do my headscarves in general, let alone at the gym!”\u0026nbspA lack of choice online led Hossen to start her own clothing brand called SH Athletics in October 2015, making modest, comfortable clothing for workouts that didn’t look completely shapeless. But it was only when she started seeing articles referring to her as an entrepreneur that Hossen realised she was one. “I thought, ‘oh, that’s what I am!’” she says. “I was just doing what needed to be done, but I think that’s how a lot of businesses start out.”\u0026nbspSince 2017, Hossen has also been Nike’s first hijab ambassador in the UK, a post invented to promote the brand’s\u0026nbspPro Hijab. This October, Hossen will take part in the Red Bull ​Amaphiko UK Academy to work with other social entrepreneurs who want to make a difference within their communities.Hossen’s\u0026nbspwork – from her day job as a personal trainer\u0026nbspto her business manufacturing sports clothes – is united by a common theme of helping others to feel confident in their pursuits. “The most common thing I hear from women is that they are afraid of being stared at,” she says. She says women too often feel like they don’t belong in a gym. “All it takes is for someone to say how long have you got left, and often, even if they’re not finished they will give it over rather than say, ‘no,’\u0026nbspbecause they feel like it’s not their piece of equipment.”When\u0026nbspHossen\u0026nbspfirst meets a client, often after they have approached her on Instagram, she starts with exercises that build their confidence and assert their right to train. She bases her lifting workshop in a “proper bodybuilder gym with proper rusty weights”. “I tell them if you can train in this gym you can train in any gym,” she says.Hossen starts by reassuring clients that most people in the gym are minding their own business, but she also helps them find words to stand up to people who interfere: “For people who put their nose in, it’s about developing the confidence to stand up to them and say, ‘I do know what I am doing,’ and leave it at that.”But she knows from personal experience that developing that confidence takes time.\u0026nbspHossen\u0026nbspstarted training at 15 as a way to blow off steam from secondary school. “It helps me to have an outlet, to have that scheduled time to move,” she says. The gym that\u0026nbspHossen\u0026nbspbegan training at was in a leisure centre in north London that charged the tiny concession price of £1.60 to train.

Just like her clients before her, she decided not to go inside, choosing the resistance machines instead. “There wasn’t a thought process, but there were all the men in there, and little old me, and I’m still quite small.”Going to the gym was always about improving her strength, rather than her appearance. “I was a teenager and I wanted to get strong,” she remembers. “I didn’t realise that it wasn’t normal. I thought, if I can’t do a push-up, I can train to do a push-up – as opposed to let me grow my bum.”Even now, she rails against the idea that women should stay away from weight training because it’s not attractive to men. “There’s this whole stigma that we shouldn’t be weight training or strength training because it’s not attractive to men,” she says. “I was just doing what I wanted.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But with what I wanted, it had to be designed from scratch.”Hossen had a few hundred pounds saved from her part-time job.\u0026nbspWith help from a friend who had trained as a designer, she created some drawings that she paid to have made into her first line of clothes. These included training dresses, cut long in the body and with a flattering bias hem, high-waisted jogging bottoms and long-sleeved T-shirts. When the website launched in October 2015, Hossen watched excitedly as the first order came through from the US a few minutes later. “That was so cool!” she remembers.Why the makers of Wallace and Gromit decided to become employee-ownedThe communities taking on harbours, libraries, sports grounds and pubsHow a Google millionaire is creating an offline future for communitiesSH Athletics\u0026nbspis now in a research phase. Hossen plans to relaunch the brand in 2020 with new lines and fabrics. She is still self-funding the business, but thinking about crowdfunding to raise investment to take it to the next level.\u0026nbspOne of the biggest challenges of being a young designer with a low budget, she says, is finding manufacturers willing to make clothes in small batches. “The quantities I’m after are not industrial,” she says.\u0026nbsp“Because my designs are so unique, I need someone I can work with who understands. I really want a manufacturer that I can grow a relationship with and who understands my brand.”In October, Hossen will run fitness classes at the first Red Bull Amaphiko Academy in the UK, an event for aspiring entrepreneurs. Her best advice for entrepreneurs is something that could just as easily be applied in a workout: “Start where you are with what you have,” she says. “A lot of the time a lot of what stops us from starting is thinking that we have to\u0026nbsphave everything now, instead of making baby steps. Then reach out to see if other people can help.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Minds Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Minds.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

They found that up until those born in the 1970s, each has generation tended to be better-off than people born a decade earlier were at the same age.“Stagnating income for more recent generations compared with their older counterparts is likely to be influenced by several factors. For instance, over recent years, wages and salaries have fared worse than their historical trends,” the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said on Wednesday.In the 10 years since 2004, pay per head fell by on average 0.1 per cent each year, whereas in the preceding decade it rose by 3.9 per cent every year, the ONS noted.The release uses inflation-adjusted data on household incomes after taxes, including private pensions and cash benefits provided by the state.Created with Sketch.Sixties pop and films  Show all 7Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.17 Sixties pop and film27 Sixties pop and film37 Sixties pop and film47 Sixties pop and film57 Sixties pop and filmJohn Lennon appeared in How I Won The War67 Sixties pop and filmTony Garnett\u0027s post-Kes permissive documentary The Body, which featured background music from members of Pink Floyd77 Sixties pop and film17 Sixties pop and film27 Sixties pop and film37 Sixties pop and film47 Sixties pop and film57 Sixties pop and filmJohn Lennon appeared in How I Won The War67 Sixties pop and filmTony Garnett\u0027s post-Kes permissive documentary The Body, which featured background music from members of Pink Floyd77 Sixties pop and filmThe results are not uniform. For example, people born in the 1990s had a higher household income at the age of 27 than those born in the 1980s did at the same point in their lives, but the reverse was true at the age of 23.But, overall, the figures point to a broader trend and confirm an observation made in the House of Lords report.“Pay progression has slowed for younger generations. They are unlikely to enjoy the same generation-on-generation income gains that their predecessors received,” it said.The ONS data also shows that tax and benefit reforms over the years have tended to benefit later generations.On average, people of all generations pay more in taxes than they receive in benefits throughout most of their working lives. Their net contribution peaks in their mid-50s when they are less likely to have school-age children and therefore use education services.But, within that overall pattern, the ONS has spotted some changes. For example, those born in the 1950s paid on average £3,000 per year more in tax than they received in benefits when they were between 25 and 34 years old. Meanwhile, those born in the 1980s paid only £1,100 per year more in taxes than they received in benefits at the same age.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

That amounts to\u0026nbsparound 1 per cent of Britain’s total trade, and 2 per cent of that with the EU.The UK has signed 12 other such continuity free trade agreements, aimed at replicating as far as possible the preferential access it has to non-EU countries via its membership of the bloc. Switzerland accounts for Britain’s biggest continuity agreement so far, with trade between the two standing at £32.1bn in 2017.Including the deal with South Korea, the 13 accords protect trade totalling £89bn, the government said. That is a fraction of the £634bn in export and import flows between Britain and its largest trading partner, the EU.Yoo Myung-Hee, the Korean trade minister, said the latest agreement will “remove much Brexit uncertainty” from her country’s relationship with the UK.South Korea is a world leader in electronics, steel and cars, and its exports to the UK reached £5.2bn last year. The country exports mostly cars and ships to Britain, while it imports crude oil, cars, ceramics and whisky.While Britain is still part of the EU, it is not able to negotiate its own trade deals, relying on the EU’s agreements instead. But once it leaves the bloc, it will be able to do so.\u0026nbspA trade deal with the US is likely to be high on the agenda. As a single country, it is the top buyer of UK goods and services, taking in almost a fifth of British exports, even though the EU doesn’t have a trade agreement with Washington. \u0026nbspBut the EU buys more than twice that amount from Britain, and a trade deal will be required to come close to the current frictionless trade.\u0026nbspBritain is working on continuity agreements with a host of other countries ahead of the 31 October Brexit deadline. But many discussions have stalled over the uncertainty about if and when Brexit will happen. For example, the government has already said the deal with Turkey, which accounts for 1.4 per cent of total UK trade, will not be signed in time.\u0026nbspAdditional reporting by ReutersOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

That is the lowest reading in three months and the joint-lowest since February 2016.The index is based on surveys of service and manufacturing firms, with each sector given its own index. The reading for services was 50.9, also the lowest in three months. For factories, the index stood at 49.9, indicating the first contraction since September 2009.“August’s survey data provides a clear signal that economic growth has continued to soften in the third quarter,” said Tim Moore, economics associate director at IHS Markit which compiles the data.“The PMIs for manufacturing and services remain much weaker than at the beginning of 2019 and collectively point to annualised GDP growth of around 1.5 per cent.”The poor manufacturing measure was mainly a result of a fall in new orders, while output continued growing, IHS Markit said. The data also showed the fastest drop in factories’ export sales in 10 years, with firms often citing the weakening in the global economy. \u0026nbspThe surveys are likely to fuel fears that the trade war with China instigated by Donald Trump is starting to hurt US factories.Mr Moore added: “Business expectations for the year ahead became more gloomy in August and remain the lowest since comparable data were first available in 2012.”\u0026nbspMost US business economists expect a recession in the US by the end of 2021, according to a survey by the National Association for Business Economics released on Monday.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

As such, discovering eight more repeating bursts could provide huge value to the researchers who are attempting to find where the bursts are coming from.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Best NASA pictures of the month - July 2019 Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A total solar eclipse as seen from the US National Science Federation observatory in the Chilean Andes on 2 JulyA composite image of the Cygnus OB2 star cluster composed of pictures taken by the Isaac Newton Telescope and Spitzer Space Telescope on July 24The spacecraft Soyuz MS-13 is launched at the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on July 20A copy of LIFE magazine from July 4 1969 signed by Michael Collins is seen onboard the Soyuz spacecraftThe galaxy NGC 1156 which is said to resemble a cherry blossom tree.

The researchers suggest that one of the bursts could be coming from a galaxy that neighbours own Milky Way – though caution that further work will need to be done to discover more about the bursts.Are aliens sending us messages from light years away?The new data comes from the\u0026nbspCanadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment, a telescope that scientists had hoped would shed new light on FRBs. Now it has done so, with the discovery of eight more that have been described in a new paper published on Arxiv.Nobody knows where the FRBs are coming from, or what they might be. The profound intensity of the blasts suggests that they are being sent by some extreme event – but that could be anything from a star falling into a black hole to a message being sent through the cosmos by aliens.To try and understand their source, scientists have searched for more bursts and looked to understand them in better detail when they come. Repeating bursts are likely to be key to that, since they can be examined with so much more clarity.In addition to the two confirmed bursts, other researchers have reported two more that are yet to have been published in peer-reviewed journals. The new discovery therefore triples the number that have been found and could lead to much more detailed research on where they are coming from.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Apple\u0027s launch event is most likely to fall on 10 September, according to a range of previous leaks.The same report also revealed a whole host of other new products, to be launched alongside the iPhone or shortly after it. They include an upgraded iPad Pro and a new entry-level iPad, updates to the Apple Watch, and a re-designed, larger MacBook – accessories including the AirPods and the HomePod will also get updates, according to the report.Perhaps the most surprising changes to the new handsets will be the branding. The iPhone XS and XS Max will become known as iPhone 11 Pro – marking the first time that the pro moniker so popular on other Apple devices comes to the iPhone – and the current XR will simply be known as the iPhone 11.Despite the changes on the inside and to the branding, however, the new handsets are rumoured to look largely identical to the existing line-up. The majority of the changes will be internal.One obvious change to the external design of the device will be a revamped – and much bigger – camera system on the back. It will include a third sensor that will allow for improved performance, according to various reports.Created with Sketch.Gadgets and tech news in pictures Show all 25Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Chief engineer of LIFT aircraft Balazs Kerulo demonstrates the company\u0027s Hexa personal drone craft in Lago Vista, Texas on June 3 2019225 Project Scarlett to succeed Xbox OneMicrosoft announced Project Scarlett, the successor to the Xbox One, at E3 2019.

It will use artificial intelligence that will allow the phone to use that wider angle and incorporate someone into a photo if they had been cut off, for instance, according to the Bloomberg report.The extra lens has been long-rumoured to be coming to the new handsets. But its function has been largely mysterious, with speculation that it could be used simply for better photographs or entirely new kinds of images, such as 3D scanning.Apple Watch accessories sell out ahead of iPhone launchThat camera could make its way only into the Pro phones, Bloomberg reported. In the current line-up, the iPhone XR only has one lens in its camera, as opposed to the two in the iPhone XS, but the normal version of the iPhone 11 will get an extra one to take it to two.Apart from the additional lenses, the new phones will be able to take even higher resolution photos and improve their performance in low light, according to the same report. They will also have better video capabilities and the option to add effects or edit videos as they are recorded.As well as the camera features, the iPhone will include a reverse wireless charging system that allows the phone to charge other devices up as well as to be charged. That will let it power up the AirPods, for instance, though it might also be limited to the Pro version of the phones.The Face ID facial recognition technology, the water resistance, screen and processor will all be improved in the new phones.On the outside, the phones will look mostly the same: they will be no different when seen from the front, and will be the same size. But at least some of them will get a matte finish on the back, according to the report.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

There probably hasn\u0027t been.The Conformist(1970) is often cited as an inspiration, as it was for Francis Ford Coppola in shooting The Godfather (1972).As it stands, it’s a perfect joke that succinctly gets across Junior’s love of 1960s Hollywood (lest we forget he was a big fan of Martin’s Rio Bravo co-star Angie Dickinson).Gandolfini’s son, Michael, will play a young version of Tony in new prequel film The Many Saints of Newark.

They found that up until those born in the 1970s, each has generation tended to be better-off than people born a decade earlier were at the same age.“Stagnating income for more recent generations compared with their older counterparts is likely to be influenced by several factors. For instance, over recent years, wages and salaries have fared worse than their historical trends,” the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said on Wednesday.In the 10 years since 2004, pay per head fell by on average 0.1 per cent each year, whereas in the preceding decade it rose by 3.9 per cent every year, the ONS noted.The release uses inflation-adjusted data on household incomes after taxes, including private pensions and cash benefits provided by the state.Created with Sketch.Sixties pop and films  Show all 7Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.17 Sixties pop and film27 Sixties pop and film37 Sixties pop and film47 Sixties pop and film57 Sixties pop and filmJohn Lennon appeared in How I Won The War67 Sixties pop and filmTony Garnett\u0027s post-Kes permissive documentary The Body, which featured background music from members of Pink Floyd77 Sixties pop and film17 Sixties pop and film27 Sixties pop and film37 Sixties pop and film47 Sixties pop and film57 Sixties pop and filmJohn Lennon appeared in How I Won The War67 Sixties pop and filmTony Garnett\u0027s post-Kes permissive documentary The Body, which featured background music from members of Pink Floyd77 Sixties pop and filmThe results are not uniform. For example, people born in the 1990s had a higher household income at the age of 27 than those born in the 1980s did at the same point in their lives, but the reverse was true at the age of 23.But, overall, the figures point to a broader trend and confirm an observation made in the House of Lords report.“Pay progression has slowed for younger generations. They are unlikely to enjoy the same generation-on-generation income gains that their predecessors received,” it said.The ONS data also shows that tax and benefit reforms over the years have tended to benefit later generations.On average, people of all generations pay more in taxes than they receive in benefits throughout most of their working lives. Their net contribution peaks in their mid-50s when they are less likely to have school-age children and therefore use education services.But, within that overall pattern, the ONS has spotted some changes. For example, those born in the 1950s paid on average £3,000 per year more in tax than they received in benefits when they were between 25 and 34 years old. Meanwhile, those born in the 1980s paid only £1,100 per year more in taxes than they received in benefits at the same age.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

That amounts to\u0026nbsparound 1 per cent of Britain’s total trade, and 2 per cent of that with the EU.The UK has signed 12 other such continuity free trade agreements, aimed at replicating as far as possible the preferential access it has to non-EU countries via its membership of the bloc. Switzerland accounts for Britain’s biggest continuity agreement so far, with trade between the two standing at £32.1bn in 2017.Including the deal with South Korea, the 13 accords protect trade totalling £89bn, the government said. That is a fraction of the £634bn in export and import flows between Britain and its largest trading partner, the EU.Yoo Myung-Hee, the Korean trade minister, said the latest agreement will “remove much Brexit uncertainty” from her country’s relationship with the UK.South Korea is a world leader in electronics, steel and cars, and its exports to the UK reached £5.2bn last year. The country exports mostly cars and ships to Britain, while it imports crude oil, cars, ceramics and whisky.While Britain is still part of the EU, it is not able to negotiate its own trade deals, relying on the EU’s agreements instead. But once it leaves the bloc, it will be able to do so.\u0026nbspA trade deal with the US is likely to be high on the agenda. As a single country, it is the top buyer of UK goods and services, taking in almost a fifth of British exports, even though the EU doesn’t have a trade agreement with Washington. \u0026nbspBut the EU buys more than twice that amount from Britain, and a trade deal will be required to come close to the current frictionless trade.\u0026nbspBritain is working on continuity agreements with a host of other countries ahead of the 31 October Brexit deadline. But many discussions have stalled over the uncertainty about if and when Brexit will happen. For example, the government has already said the deal with Turkey, which accounts for 1.4 per cent of total UK trade, will not be signed in time.\u0026nbspAdditional reporting by ReutersOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

That is the lowest reading in three months and the joint-lowest since February 2016.The index is based on surveys of service and manufacturing firms, with each sector given its own index. The reading for services was 50.9, also the lowest in three months. For factories, the index stood at 49.9, indicating the first contraction since September 2009.“August’s survey data provides a clear signal that economic growth has continued to soften in the third quarter,” said Tim Moore, economics associate director at IHS Markit which compiles the data.“The PMIs for manufacturing and services remain much weaker than at the beginning of 2019 and collectively point to annualised GDP growth of around 1.5 per cent.”The poor manufacturing measure was mainly a result of a fall in new orders, while output continued growing, IHS Markit said. The data also showed the fastest drop in factories’ export sales in 10 years, with firms often citing the weakening in the global economy. \u0026nbspThe surveys are likely to fuel fears that the trade war with China instigated by Donald Trump is starting to hurt US factories.Mr Moore added: “Business expectations for the year ahead became more gloomy in August and remain the lowest since comparable data were first available in 2012.”\u0026nbspMost US business economists expect a recession in the US by the end of 2021, according to a survey by the National Association for Business Economics released on Monday.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The Pink Meanie was discovered during a nightlight jellyfish e by the collections team in the waters around Robben Island and in Cape Town Harbour. Pink Meanies are jellyvorous, meaning they feed on other jelly species by reeling them in with their long tentacles. Discovering the Pink Meanie in its early ephyra stage meant the team could study its growth rate which turned out to be very quick as it grew to the metaephyra stage in about a week and a half. The Mexican pink meanie (Drymonema larsoni) was only discovered in the year 2000. A Mediterranean relative, known as the Big Pink Jellyfish (Drymonema dalmatinum) has been known to science since the 1800s but when spotted in 2014 it had been almost 70 years since the last sighting.

He attended a funeral on Monday and did not check his account properly again until later that afternoon. When he did so, he was astonished by what he saw.Created with Sketch.

Sponsors are already committing, he says. As per his original post, he wants it to be a truly continental affair: French wine, German beer, and lots of British food.“I’m thinking fish and chips, pies, that sort of thing,” he says. “Then, when the sun sets, there’ll be fireworks so maybe they can be seen over in England.”When we speak, he is in the middle of creating a website and exploring ticketing options: a figure of 2,000 has roughly been settled on. “It may be free or there may be a small price,” he says. “But it’s not about making money, it’s about making sure we know how many people to expect.”It won’t be easy to organise for 31 October, he admits – “but, then, neither will Brexit itself”.

But the UK is a friend and it should have a leaving party. You have made a decision which perhaps we would not have made ourselves – perhaps we cannot understand this decision – but it is your right to make it and, now, as a friend, we wish you well.”It is not the only Brexit Day party planned on the continent as it happens. Such events have started to crop up in various places. “There’s one in Luxembourg,” says Ron. “But I think we have the ideal location. What are they going to wave to in Luxembourg? The Belgian border?”As for Ron himself, how does he think Brexit will turn out?There is a pause of apparent Dutch politeness. “I think we can call this a… brave decision,” he says. “In the Netherlands, we love British culture. We grow up with your music, your TV, your football. So it hurts that you are leaving.”He considers this diplomatically. “But possibly not as much as it will end up hurting you,” he says.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Minds Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Minds.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

The PD also says it cannot back outgoing prime minister Giuseppe Conte, an independent politician who is close to the M5S, for another term.Does Italy’s coalition collapose spell political suicide for Salvini?Refugees leap from rescue boat and try to swim to ItalyA half-naked Salvini is going up against Italy\u0027s timid professorItaly\u0027s government has been criticised internationally for its approach to migration since the outgoing government took office.

The Pink Meanie was discovered during a nightlight jellyfish e by the collections team in the waters around Robben Island and in Cape Town Harbour. Pink Meanies are jellyvorous, meaning they feed on other jelly species by reeling them in with their long tentacles. Discovering the Pink Meanie in its early ephyra stage meant the team could study its growth rate which turned out to be very quick as it grew to the metaephyra stage in about a week and a half. The Mexican pink meanie (Drymonema larsoni) was only discovered in the year 2000. A Mediterranean relative, known as the Big Pink Jellyfish (Drymonema dalmatinum) has been known to science since the 1800s but when spotted in 2014 it had been almost 70 years since the last sighting.

But there is now no prospect of Yellowhammer’s national emergency. By Halloween, we will be ready to go.There will be no public demand for bird-spotter Ken Clarke to volunteer as caretaker PM “once I find out what the Devil’s going on”.We now have TWO Magic Grandpas! One, an endearingly dotty optimist who has lost count of the times he’s run for PM, the other a maling Marxist misfit.Andthese two old geezers need help, political harpy Hattie Harman is ready for her comeback as unwanted baggage.We must be in desperate timesthis trio, accompanied by Green MP Caroline Lucas and her All-White Women’s Unity Band, think they can stop us honouring the  referendum.As a sideshow, Oliver Letwin, who once invited burglars into his home at am, came close to a repeat offence last week by offering to help Jezza into Number .Jeremy Corbyn, for all his slippery twists and turns, is a lelong EU-hater.He worshipped at the feet of Tony Benn who fought Brussels until his dying day. Corbyn will do nothing, either as Labour leader or — heaven forbid! — as PM to stop us leaving.By contrast, Speaker John Bercow will “fight with every breath in my body” to stop Parliament being shut down so Britain can slip across the Halloween deadline and out of the EU.This egomaniac, known as The Poison Dwarf, is the most powerful figure in Westminster — and the most dangerous.His ambition is to go down as the most famous Speaker in House of Commons history.His hero is said to be illustrious predecessor William Lenthall, who four centuries ago backed Parliament against King Charles I, triggering the Civil War which cost Charles his head.This time, though, it will not be Parliament against the Crown. It will be rebel MPs versus the democratically expressed wishes of their own voters.Boris Johnson will not resignhe loses a confidence vote. He will call a general election immediately after Britain has left the EU on October .There is talk about a challenge to the Supreme Court but judges are unlikely to intervene against a PM executing the will of the people. Only the Queen could stop him — and there’s no chance of that.Would Bercow take this clash to the bitter end, sending in troops to drag Boris out of Number Ten — and providing a springboard for a Tory election landslide It is hard to know what goes on in the heads of fanatical Remainers.Whatthey get their own way, delay Brexit and leave a humiliated UK swinging half-in, half-out of the EU, coughing up a £billion lump sum and paying £bn a year for the privilege Imagine the bomb-site political landscape after a Parliamentary lynch mob sabotages the wishes of .m voters.We would be looking at another civil war, Mr Speaker.Brussels and Remain diehards need to wake up. Britain WILL leave the EU as promised. And Boris WILL win the election immediately afterwards, almost certainly by a wide margin.They will look back from the ashes of their political careers to a Britain which has cut free and prospered in open trading waters.And they will see arrogant EU leaders steering their vaunted Grand Projet on to the rocks of broken dreams.We are bleakly accustomed to a day-by-day massacre of young lives. Knives, machetes and now motor vehicles are the murder weapons of choice. Newlywed PC Harper is simply the latest tragic victim of a fast-accelerating assault on The Thin Blue Line.I have criticised police in the past for abusing their power against politicians, journalists and celebrities. I was talking about senior officers blinded by political correctness and TV headlines.The bobby on the beat risks his or her le every day in the line of duty. They are lions.

In the meantime . . .It’s series one of Gemma Collins: Diva Forever, an off-shoot of public service broadcasting I like to call National Service broadcasting, on account of the fact I find it impossible to watch without longing for theof conscription.It’d be hard, in fact, for me to think of anyone who could possibly have less fun watching “The GC” in full flight.Fair play to ITVBe, however. They’ve not just thought of him, they’ve got the poor sod doing the voiceover.It’s only Angus Deayton, whose every word has to be extracted here with forceps and retractors, even though, truth be told, on a purely technical level it’s probably the easiest buck he’s ever earned.Cos it’s not that Diva Forever lacks a narrative, it’s just that it’s got exactly the same one every week.MOST READ IN OPINION\" data-srcset\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   tp-composite-rod-liddle.jpg stripallwhcrop\" srcSet\"\" sizes\" px, px\"  px, px\" CommentROD LIDDLE Public is tiring of Meghan, Harry, Andrew and Williams whining and hypocrisy \" data-srcset\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   tp-composite-jane-moore.jpg stripallwhcrop\" srcSet\"\" sizes\" px, px\"  px, px\" CommentJANE MOORE Harry  Meghan, we dont all have mega-rich pals to offset our carbon footprints \" data-srcset\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT.jpg stripallwhcrop\" srcSet\"\" sizes\" px, px\"  px, px\" CommentTHE SUN SAYS Were not negotiating with the EU over Brexit, were talking to a brick wall \" data-srcset\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-COMPOSITE-TREVOR-KAV.jpg stripallwhcrop\" srcSet\"\" sizes\" px, px\"  px, px\" CommentTREVOR KAVANAGH Wake up, Remainers - Brexit IS happening  Boris WILL win election \" data-srcset\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-comp-rod-liddle-v.jpg stripallwhcrop\" srcSet\"\" sizes\" px, px\"  px, px\" Commentrod liddle Councils yet again see Asian rapists as the victims — not girls they groomed Gemma turns up horrendously late for an appointment. Gemma treats ious assistants like absolute dirt.Then Gemma dissolves in floods of self-pitying tears when on off boyfriend Arg does exactly the same to her.There’s a lot of eating going on here as well. And I mean A LOT.They’re like Mr and Mrs Creosote at the local curry house, which definitely isn’t a spectator sport.But it still comes as a relative relief because it means Gemma isn’t bellowing orders, over-sharing details about her nether regionsand generally carrying on in that adorably emphatic and boastful way of hers.“I’m going to sack my manager, he should pick up the phone.” “You work for one of the most famous reality stars in Britain.” “People normally pay to get this close to me.” “I wish I could clone me. Could you get DNA and make another me ”What  Like Dolly the Orca  On supply and demand grounds alone, it seems a long shot, Gemma luv.Occasionally, there are moments of high comedy as well. One arrived minutes into the first episode when she asked her musical collaboratorNaughty Boyher new single could be “heard in space”.Pause . . .“Space  Everything you say can be heard in space, Gemma.”Why’d you think the Martians never land in Brentwood High Street The rest of the time, Diva Forever is the most depressing thing on television right now. A show that offers no hope of redemption. Just more of the same.The truly crushing irony, of course, is that it’s going head-to-head with Channel ’s Jade: The Reality Star Who Changed Britain, which is the network’s attempt to apologise for exploiting an ill-prepared and out-of-her-depth girl without any of the contributors ever coming close to apologising.They can spare us their faux regret and sly buck-passing, though.Jade Goody didn’t change Britain, she just changed television, paving the way for Charlotte Crosby, Jodie Marsh, Nikki Grahame, Gemma and a format that continues next week with “The GC” on the blower to a well-known tourist attraction.“Can you kindly tell me how I’d go about getting a waxwork of myself in Madame Tussauds ”Is it too much to expect you start with just a hint of talent Tipping Point, Ben Shephard: “KP Equestrian is a clothing range by which celebrity and former glamour model ”Helen: “Kevin Pietersen.”Bradley Walsh: “How many minutes after a quarter past eight is a quarter to nine ”Kwame: “.”And Ben Shephard: “On what date is Christmas Day traditionally celebrated each year ”Tom: “Wednesday.”Not  minutes into ITV’s big new “emotional thriller” and Anna Friel’s already lost her pants in a rich neighbour’s bathroom.She’s looked in the laundry basket, under the sink and round the back of the toilet cistern, but you know how it is . . .You have sex with Adam the plastic surgeon and, next thing you know, no pants.I’m pretty sure, though, we haven’t seen the last of Anna’s undercrackers on Deep Water, a six- parter which has been sold to us as “female led” for the very obvious and woke reason ITV couldn’t possibly sell it to us as “good”, or even a “give-a-toss drama”.Cos it isn’t either of those two things.You’ll already know from that description, however, the blokes are all a bunch of weak, hopeless EastEnders cliches.

In exchange, he performed  royal engagements in .He tried to get his daughters Beatrice and Eugenie full-time royal status — with the money too — but his brother Charles said no.He is attracted to shady dictators and the worst detritus of the international rich.Several times he met the son of former Libyan tyrant Colonel Gaddafi, Sa al-Islam — wanted by the International Criminal Court for crimes against humanity.Andrew had to step down from his envoy role in  over his friendship with Ilham Aliyev, the president of Azerbaijan who has been criticised by Amnesty International.Again, Andrew loyally continued to visit his pal.He was also close to Goga Ashkenazi, a Kazahk socialite. So much so, Goga’s ex Timur Kulibayev — who controls much of Kazakhstan’s oil and is now married to the former Kazakh president’s daughter — paid £million for Sunninghill Park , the house Andrew shared with ex-we Sarah Ferguson.That was £million over the asking price.I have visited Sunninghill. It was ugly and peeling. Buying it was the act of a person buying access to the Royal Family.But Andrew doesn’t think about such things. He took Goga racing at Ascot and introduced her to the Queen.He is profligate, entitled and foolish. He has lived too long in a fetid world of the shady super-rich.What did he think would happen  He has the entitlement of a Royal but none of the responsibility.With vile Epstein now dead, Andrew issued a statement: “His Royal Highness deplores the exploitation of any human being and the suggestion he would condone, participate in or encourage any such behaviour is abhorrent.”This is an awful piece of PR guff, which implies that HE is the victim. How dare people think such things about him It is not good enough when the issue is child trafficking.Andrew must say what he knew and did not know. People will believe he is stupid. That is a defence of sorts. He must apologise for his poor judgement then go somewhere very quiet.I am not a monarchist. But being Duke of York and a Knight of the Order of the Garter should mean something.If Andrew were heir to the throne, the monarchy would fall over this.

Or perhaps it’s gingerism Either way, it’s smoke-and-mirrors nonsense designed to deflect from the reality that the public is wearied and irritated by the constant proselytising of a young couple who don’t appear to practise what they preach.This is the problem when Royal Family members abandon the monarchy’s long-held tenet of “never complain, never explain” and start making political statements about how the proles should live their lives.It’s an obvious side-effect that, emboldened by the proleration of social media, one’s once loyal subjects might rise up and have a few strident opinions of their own.Particularly when they’ve just contributed £.million for your “cottage” to be done up.Sir Elton John — with whom they have been staying on their most recent holiday to Nice — appears to blame the media for what he claims was a “distorted and malicious” account of the trip, adding for good measure that he wanted to protect the young couple from the “unnecessary press intrusion that contributed to Diana’s untimely death”.MOST READ IN OPINION\" data-srcset\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   tp-composite-rod-liddle.jpg stripallwhcrop\" srcSet\"\" sizes\" px, px\"  px, px\" CommentROD LIDDLE Public is tiring of Meghan, Harry, Andrew and Williams whining and hypocrisy \" data-srcset\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT.jpg stripallwhcrop\" srcSet\"\" sizes\" px, px\"  px, px\" CommentTHE SUN SAYS Were not negotiating with the EU over Brexit, were talking to a brick wall \" data-srcset\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-COMPOSITE-ALLY-ROSS.jpg stripallwhcrop\" srcSet\"\" sizes\" px, px\"  px, px\" CommentALLY ROSS Gemma Collins show is the same every week - she stuffs her face  shouts orders \" data-srcset\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-COMPOSITE-TREVOR-KAV.jpg stripallwhcrop\" srcSet\"\" sizes\" px, px\"  px, px\" CommentTREVOR KAVANAGH Wake up, Remainers - Brexit IS happening  Boris WILL win election \" data-srcset\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-comp-rod-liddle-v.jpg stripallwhcrop\" srcSet\"\" sizes\" px, px\"  px, px\" Commentrod liddle Councils yet again see Asian rapists as the victims — not girls they groomed Hmmm. Putting aside the observation thatyou want to avoid press coverage then boarding a private plane to stay with an A-lister is perhaps ill-advised, it’s widely acknowledged that Princess Diana was safely ensconced inside the Paris Ritz when she and Dodi took the fateful decision to leave their suite at midnight and get in a car that, unbeknown to them, was being driven by someone . times over the limit and speeding.A French judicial investigation concluded that the photographers were not near the Mercedes when it crashed.But eventhey had been, just like the detracting cry of “racism”, Harry’s tragic loss of his mother shouldn’t be used to try to shut down valid criticism about him and Meghan virtue-signalling their “woke” credentials then hopping on four flights that emit an estimated seven tonnes of CO.Judging by online message boards, the Diana-loving public certainly aren’t buying it.I’ve been a journalist for a long time and know that, whatever I choose to write, people make up their own mind about the issues of the day.And the majority view on the royal couple’s gas-guzzling transportation is that it’s hypocritical.Equally, climate change activists say the same. Or are they being misquoted by the evil media Harry’s impeccably dutul grandmother the Queen understands that the role of the Royal Family is to turn up to a community centre on a wet and windy day and shake the hands of those in society who put in real graft on behalf of others — therefore highlighting a good cause and hopefully encouraging others to do their bit.In other words, leading by example rather than constantly telling everyone how they should be thinking and feeling.Particularly when the Smiths of Acacia Avenue are being made to feel guilty for boarding a budget airline on their one week’s holiday a year and don’t have multi-millionaire friends to offset their carbon foot-print with an “appropriate contribution” to a climate change initiative.It’s a simple truth that, were the Sussexes buckling down and just quietly getting on with their royal duties like Princess Anne et al, they could visit Beyonce George Elton whoever on privately-funded luxury flights and few would question it.But entitled “do as we say, not as we do” hypocrisy should always be called out.IT was perhaps inevitable that the marriage of Strictly pro dancers Neil and Katya Jones would hit the rocks after that kiss.After all, the encounter between Katya and her Strictly  partner Seann Walsh wasn’t just any old snog, it was a Marks  Spencer’s chocolate pudding snog – all dark and mysterious with an explosive centre.It was furtive, hurried, messy and forbidden – everything that a kiss within the confines of a long-term relationship rarely is.However drunk you are, you only kiss someone like that when you’re a a teenager at the local disco or b looking for something, or someone, that’s missing from what you already have.And that’s a tough reality to move on from.Bruised by the humiliation of glaring headlines and the unremitting scrutiny of the public gaze, it’s understandable that they deployed “nothing to see here” mode – swearing undying love for each other and clamping on fixed smiles for any photographer within a -yard radius.But behind closed doors, the recriminations clearly began and, ten months on, their -year relationship is over.The end of a marriage is always sad but, all credit to them, they have vowed to remain friends and professional dancing partners.Now they can both kiss who they want.THE new leader of Ukip is a Richard Braine – a name that has led to plenty of “Dick Braine” ­joshing and articles about other people with ­unfortunate monikers.One of them being my nemesis on a charity edition of The Chase. “Which of these is a Dutch politician ” Bradley Walsh asked me . . . for £,.Ruud Bum, Luuk Bonkers or Tiny Kox were the options and I went for Ruud on the basis footballer Ruud Gullit was from the Netherlands and no one who spoke English as well as the Dutch do would call their son Tiny Kox.But, as this photo shows, I was shocked to learn it was Tiny Kox, a Dutch senator and Socialist Party­ member.He’ll fit right in should he choose to pay a visit to Corbyn and his comrades.FORMER Page  favourite Linda Lusardi is now  and has posed in the same gold bikini she wore in her modelling heyday.If anything, she looks better in it now.She credits her youthful look to good genes and not eating unless she’s hungry, but there’s another crucial factor too – happiness.Linda has been married to actor Sam Kane for  years and a more easy-going, devoted couple you could not wish to find.She says: “I’m in a good place. I have a very happy le, happy marriage and two great kids who are doing what they want to do. That’s all I need.”Indeed.

The two men were seen walking together a year after Epstein had been convicted.There are allegations — strongly denied by Buckingham Palace — that Andrew was more directly involved in Epstein’s sordid shenanigans.most read in opinion\" data-srcset\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   tp-composite-jane-moore.jpg stripallwhcrop\" srcSet\"\" sizes\" px, px\"  px, px\" CommentJANE MOORE Harry  Meghan, we dont all have mega-rich pals to offset our carbon footprints \" data-srcset\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT.jpg stripallwhcrop\" srcSet\"\" sizes\" px, px\"  px, px\" CommentTHE SUN SAYS Were not negotiating with the EU over Brexit, were talking to a brick wall \" data-srcset\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-COMPOSITE-ALLY-ROSS.jpg stripallwhcrop\" srcSet\"\" sizes\" px, px\"  px, px\" CommentALLY ROSS Gemma Collins show is the same every week - she stuffs her face  shouts orders \" data-srcset\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   CM-COMPOSITE-TREVOR-KAV.jpg stripallwhcrop\" srcSet\"\" sizes\" px, px\"  px, px\" CommentTREVOR KAVANAGH Wake up, Remainers - Brexit IS happening  Boris WILL win election \" data-srcset\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-comp-rod-liddle-v.jpg stripallwhcrop\" srcSet\"\" sizes\" px, px\"  px, px\" Commentrod liddle Councils yet again see Asian rapists as the victims — not girls they groomed What cannot be denied is Andrew’s close friendship with the vile but powerful man.Remaining Epstein’s bosom buddy after he had been convicted certainly shows bad judgment.But then parts of Andy’s career as a royal have involved bad judgment.He apparently enjoys the retinue of rich and famous tossers who gather around him, no doubt anxious to be associated with the British crown.And he doesn’t seem to care very much how awful some of them are.This is shaping up to be a bad year for the Royal Family.Prince Andrew, never hugely adored by the public, could be a source of grave embarrassment to them.The public is also tiring of Harry and Meghan’s relentless political preaching, whining and hypocrisy. The private jets to climate change summits. The gobsmackingly expensive renovations to their house with wallpaper made of organic kale and goji berries, or something.It was reported this week that the Royal Family’s bill for travel and security has almost doubled since . Much of that is probably Meghan.But I think people are also weary of William seemingly talking about depression every time he opens his mouth.Hell, you’re depressed, Wills  Howja think the rest of us feel I’ve always been marginally in favour of having a royal family.But that’s contingent upon who that royal family actually is. And how they behave.The Queen and Prince Philhave been models of decency and duty. They keep a certain distance from the public and that is perhaps why they are so adored.To her immense credit, Princess Anne has followed that blueprint. She doesn’t emote for the media and lecture us.My worry is that the newer generation of royals will turn the British public against the Windsors. In Andrew’s case, befriending a scumbag has brought disgrace upon him and the family firm.With Harry and Meghan and William, it’s a case of trying to be too modern and thus losing sight of what it means to be a member of the Royal Family.Keep on this track and we won’t have a royal family for very much longer.A FADING reality star called Aisleyne Horgan-Wallace has had a mega boob implant. She went for the maximum allowed in the UK – ml.As you can imagine, they look pretty ridiculous. She has a way to go, though, to beat doolally German model Martina Big whose baps check in at  litres.And indeed Lacey Wildd, whose  breasts weigh more than lbs each and actually glow in the dark.Maybe Aisleyne could next buy some jubblies that do magic tricks or something.IT’S not often this column comes to the defence of Gary Lineker.Truth be told, I’m a little bit weary of the jug-eared, virtue-signalling, overpaid, crisp-flogging dimbo.But he’s in trouble for having made a joke – not a funny joke, obvs – about his co-presenters being bald. That’s Alan Shearer and Danny Murphy.Cue outrage from the follically challenged members of the public.It is now almost impossible to make a joke about anything without someone wetting the bed and writing a letter of ­complaint.How did we get so thin-skinned in this country Lower the tone  Always happy to oblige.Stop bullying people, you third world dog-munching commies.THE Queen’s pharmacist, Ainsworths, is selling homeopathic remedies.These are remedies which do not work.Homeopathy is a charlatan movement in denial of science.One of the remedies sold is “Berlin Wall”. This claims to have the spirit of the Berlin Wall in it.And the homeopaths suggest it might be good for healing relationships.I used to think homeopathy should be banned outright.But now I think – hell,you’re dumb enough to believe that rubbish, good luck to you.BORIS Johnson is stamping around Europe demanding the EU scrap the ridiculous Northern Ireland backstop.He’s absolutely right to do so.If only this had been done three years ago, we’d have a decent deal and be free of the EU by now.But time is short. And the EU knows that Boris still doesn’t have a majority in parliament to push No Deal through, no matter what he says.So they will be less likely to agree to concessions.It just makes you weep at three wasted years.When we were led by a Prime Minister who didn’t think we SHOULD leave the EU.And caved in on every issue.Just two thirds  What kind of drugs are the other third on  Horse tranquillisers and crack Jeremy Corbyn wouldn’t make a very good caretaker of a carpet warehouse, never mind PM.THEY’RE trying to improve the look of Sunderland. No easy task, you might think.And so the city’s Business Improvement District has put out a notice politely asking residents to stop pooing in the streets.Apparently it’s all the rage up there.The BID people said: “Disappointingly we’ve seen an increase in people thinking it is absolutely acceptable to defecate or urinate in public in our city centre. This will not be tolerated.”I think they’re being a bit heavy-handed. Maybe as a compromise measure they should just hand out little black poo bags to everybody.Then the locals can go about their business in front of, say, Greggs, and scoop it up immediately and put it in a bin.You Mackems, huh.

It’s the Brexiteer-loathed backstop — which PM Boris Johnson has demanded is scrapped from the Withdrawal Agreement — that is the main stumbling block to the UK leaving with a deal.Former Ulster Unionist Partycouncillor Bertie Kerr, , who farms cattle at Ballinamallard, Co Fermanagh, said: “The backstop is treasonable. It’s that bad.”The troubled history here — and the snaking border — reveal why the backstop was cooked up in the first place.The polyp, also known as The Connons or Coleman Island, is a four-square mile sliver of Ireland almost totally surrounded by the UK.most read in brexit\" data-srcset\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   RR-COMP-boris-tim.jpg stripallwhcrop\" srcSet\"\" sizes\" px, px\"  px, px\" ExclusiveCHEERS!

It would kick inthe UK and EU failed to negotiate a trade deal that kept the border open.But, crucially, under the deal the UK could only leave the backstop with EU approval.Local businessman Irwin Armstrong, , a former chair of the Conservatives in Northern Ireland, said: “The backstop is like Hotel Calornia, where you can check out but never leave. That’s not acceptable.”It is this EU veto that saw Theresa May’s deal defeated heavily in the Commons.PM Johnson’s government is propped up by ten Democratic UnionistMPs who are pro-Brexit but say the backstop in its current form is “a huge fundamental flaw”.Sinn Fein — which doesn’t take its seats in the Commons — says a No Deal Brexit would wreck the peace process and should trigger a referendum on uniting Ireland.Northern Ireland — population .million — voted Remain in the EU referendum by a majority of  to  per cent. Large quantities of beef, lamb and milk cross the Irish border every day.Farmers in Northern Ireland sell roughly , lambs and million litres of milk to the Republic every year.But former UUP MP Tom Elliott, who farms in Ballinamallard, insists the border issues can be worked out without the backstop.The -year-old Brexiteer said: “Cattle and lambs are all ear-tagged and identied. Nearly all produce can be electronically followed.”Back at the polyp, Catholic Eugene is confident the PM will broker a deal to keep the border open.“I didn’t fall out with my Protestant neighbours during the Troubles,” he said. “And I certainly won’t over Brexit.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Some of it was literal. Whether Everton or ­Liverpool would win the old First Division. Some of it was actual. Mum was Evertonian and dad Liverpudlian – a “mixed marriage”, as my grandad would say. I remember thinking, “I hate you, mum” because her team had beaten mine in the FA Cup in . This was when I used to stand alongside dad on the Kop. Before Everton signed me up and showed me the light. Obviously, I didn’t really hate my mum. I just felt like she had got it wrong. I had a similar feeling recently when she said: “Pete, I voted Leave.”  I replied: “Mum, Leave is Boris. Leave is Rees-Mogg. Leave is Michael Gove and David Davis.” She nodded and said she had changed her mind. I didn’t make some lofty economic argument full of big numbers and lost jobs, although I could have, as the North will be beaten up by a No Deal. I just reminded her of the people she was aligning with. People who do not represent us. People who do not share the same values. People who do not speak for us. In Liverpool, you see a dference every time a team gets to a final and flags hang from windows, or when you get in a taxi and are asked, “You a red or a blue ”, or when you get your first kit and kick a battered “casey”around on the “Georgies”as I did in my day.  But whether you are a red or a blue, you know what it means to come from Liverpool. You share working-class values and there is a sense that what brings us together is way bigger than our dferences . It’s why there are moments when our city’s red and blue are so close it’s almost purple. Like after Hillsborough, when the Kop was covered in red and blue scarves, by red and blue shirts, shedding red and blue tears. Contrast this with what populists like US President Donald Trump or Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage would do. They point out dference. They would say: “If you are a blue, hate red because they are the enemy. If you are a blue, hate red because they are trying to change Liverpool. If you are a blue, hate red because they are not like you.    “If you are a blue, hate red because it is their fault. Hate the media too, because they are red. “And the politicians are red through-and-through. But you can trust us. We are blue. Like you.” It’s how Remainers became unpatriotic Remoaners, who hated Britain even though it is Brexiteers putting the union at risk. It’s how calling for a second referendum was twisted to become undemocratic. How can giving people a say based on what we know now, based on a clear understanding of Brexit, be undemocratic  It’s how the Second World War has been unforgivably recast, not as Europeansstanding alongside each other, dying alongside each other, in the fight against fascism, but as soldiers fighting to keep England separate, an island alone.  Or contrast Liverpool’s unity and sense of togetherness with the isive words published by former editor of The Spectator and our new Prime Minister, Boris Johnson: “They see themselves whenever possible as victims and resent their victim status, yet at the same time, they wallow in it. “Part of this flawed psychological state is that they cannot accept that they might have made any contribution to their misfortunes, but seek rather to blame someone , thereby deepening their sense of shared tribal grievance against the rest of society.” It goes on to talk of the “deaths of more than ” supporters and “the part played in the Hillsborough disaster by drunken fans at the back who mindlessly tried to fight their way into the ground that Saturday afternoon. “The police became a convenient scapegoat, and the Sun newspaper a whipping-boy for daring, albeit in a tasteless fashion, to hint at wider causes of the incident.” It’s why Liverpool must never forgive Boris Johnson. I am not saying everyone from Liverpool is perfect. Esther McVey. Enough said.

Her membership will be suspended pending a disciplinary procedure.”But a senior SNP source said the comment was serious enough to merit Lax’s expulsion from the party.“This is an appalling tweet, and Ms Lax should be utterly ashamed of what she has said,” said the insider. “She should apologise unreservedly – but that shouldn’t be the end of the matter. “Ms Lax should be expelled from the Scottish Tories – andaction isn’t taken against her, given the vile nature of her comment, it will allow everyone to see what kind of party they are. “Ruth Davidson has been keen to highlight social media abuse butshe fails to condemn this it will expose her hypocrisy for all to see.” The comment was made a day after the First Minister revealed the “filthy” abuse she gets on social media. Sturgeon, speaking at an Edinburgh festival event on Tuesday, condemned aggressive posts which she said are often aimed at women across all parties.    She was responding to criticism of so-called cybernats, who post abusive messages anonymously. But the nasty attacks are also obvious on hardline Unionist social media accounts. Sturgeon, who is married to SNP chief executive Peter Murrell, said: “I try not to look at it but some of the abuse I get on Twitter would make your hair curl. “It’s horrible, misogynist, really filthy stuff. And women across all parties get that, so we should always call that out. “I don’t spend any time looking at that stuff. “Occasionally, I’ll see things and say that’s a bit much but it would drive you bonkers, particularly in a position like mine where there’s just so much. If I was to stop and go into some of that, it would drive you crazy.” Lax is listed on the Moray Conservative and Unionists website as honorary treasurer. But she has a history of abusive postings on social media.

His father, Gary Hughes, , spotted his sonaposs penchant for numbers when they started preparing for exams to help year six pupil get into St Margaretaposs Secondary School in Liverpool this September.

Karen Wadrop moved from Middlesbrough to Costa Blanca in  and had always wanted to run her own bar so she was delighted when an opportunity came up to run a pub from the beginning of June. But after spending thousands on refurbishments and buying stock, Karen has been locked out after the real owner changed the locks.The -year-old told Teesside Live that after agreeing to take over running the bar, the landlord told her he would hand it over to her once she had the place up and running.He told meI made the bar a success in  months he would sign it over to me at no cost, she said. I asked why he would do this and he said he liked to help people. Admittedly, alarm bells rang when the breweries didnapost want to deal with him so all facturas [invoices] were in my name and I paid on delivery.    A builder helped her draw up the plans and she spent up to  hours a day, six days a week, managing the renovations. When the refurbishment was complete, she held a grand opening day for Jakeaposs Sports Bar with local radio broadcasting live. It was named after her grandson Jake who lives in Middlesbrough and he was buzzing that his gran had fulfilled her dream. Mum-of-two Karen had moved from the Tollesby area of Middlesbrough to the Costa Blanca in  and had always wanted to take on her own bar. But a visit from the owner of the bar brought the news which would shatter her dream into pieces. She was told the landlord owed rent money and papers had been served to force him to leave. Had she taken on the lease, Karen believes she would have also been liable for any debt.    He also informed me the premises were rented as a shop, licensed and insured as a shop and not a bar, she said. He shook my hand and apologised for what situation I was in and advised me to leave and then once the issue was resolved I could rent the premises direct from him. I left Sunday evening late taking the money with me and paid up all my staff to date. But when she ed on the Monday morning, the locks had been changed. And Karen has been unable to get her personal possessions or the stock she bought with her own money. Fortunately, Karen learned of the reported debt before it was too late. But she has been left counting the financial cost. I have over , euros of stock including barrels etc in the bar, she said.

Fracking, or hydraulically fracturing, involves extracting gas from rocks by breaking them up with water and chemicals at high pressure. Following last yearaposs stop-start operations Cuadrilla said it is using a thicker fracking liquid this time round, which it hoped would lead to fewer seismic events. The government last week signalled support for the industry and is keen to cut the countryaposs reliance on imports of natural gas, which is used to heat around % of Britainaposs homes.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailTo a kid in the Swinging Sixties it seemed the most thrilling and romantic journey on earth. Travelling on a ferry, made world-famous by Gerry Marsden, from Liverpool’s Pier Head down the Mersey to the point where it meets the Irish Sea, then jumping off at New Brighton. For a day of pure bliss. Swimming in the open-air baths, playing football on the beach, searching for crabs, riding the waltzers in the fun-fair, eating chips as you battled away crazed seagulls, the vinegar smell mingling with the salt from the sea as you watch the big boats head into port. Then taking the evening ferry home, knackered and burnt.    Back then, New Brightonwas still a vibrant resort but one that was heading for the rocks. In the s, my mum’s family would spend summer holidays there. A huge marquee would be pitched to sleep up to a dozen children and my grandad would go to work on the Liverpool docks by day, ing at night. In the s, my dad and his brothers would take the ferry every summer weekend to show off in front of the local girls by ing off the high boards in the lido, then the UK’s biggest open-air pool. Parents who fondly looked on New Brighton as part of their heritage would take their kids for days out in the s, but come the s, with Pontins and Butlin’s taking off at home and package holidays abroad, as well as biting economic times, New Brighton fell into decline.  The ferry stopped sailing there, the famous Tower Ballroom was destroyed by fire and the lido closed. New Brighton, like many other historic British seaside towns, became dilapidated and unloved. In fact, it came close to extinction. But in , Wirral council, and a Labour government, recognised the potential of a regeneration plan centred on a £million leisure and retail development, Marine Point, and le was breathed back into the old place. It now gets a million visitors a year and on summer weekends the pavements are bustling and the beach is buzzing. When I ed there for the first time in many years, I was genuinely surprised at how handsome it’s looking.  For a start, it’s hard to imagine a Blue Flag beach in swimming distance of Liverpool’s docks, but the sand and the water measure up to that gold standard. I cast my crab line out in the clear rock pools, but, now veggie, I refused to put bacon on the hook, and the little nippers turned their claws up at the tofu. I cooled my tootsies with a paddle in the sea, which was as freezing as I remembered it, but looked nothing like the murky brown colour of old. I larked around on the Black Pearl pirate shipuntil it was clear I was shivering the timbers of approaching teachers shepherding primary schoolkids. I took a long, bracing walk along the three-quarters-of-a-mile of sand and bumped into Peter and Alison Greene, from Chester, and their four-year-old granddaughter Alice. What brought them to New Brighton, I asked   “It’s just a great, cheap and cheerful day out. Alice loves to play on the pirate ship and make sandcastles, then get an ice cream,” said Alison, a retired carer. “I stopped coming here for years, but I look forward to our days out now. It feels like a proper seaside resort again.” Peter, also retired, said: “I had days out here as a boy, when it was in its heyday. It’s moved with the times, but I love how you can still feel the history of the place.” New Brighton oozes history. From the th to the th century, it had a reputation for smuggling and wrecking, with secret underground cellars and tunnels rumoured to still be in existence. Fort Perch Rock was built in the Napoleonic Wars to protect the port of Liverpool from the French. Disputes over who should pay meant it wasn’t finished until , when Boney was well gone.  The building now houses an Aviation and Archaeology Museum, with a section on the Luftwaffe’s blitzing of Merseyside. At the start of the last century, the resort had the tallest building in Britain, the ft, all-steel New Brighton Tower, which was neglected during the First World War and dismantled shortly after. Walking around, you can take a nostalgia trip while enjoying what the resort offers current and future visitors. There are watersports on the marine lake and regular open-air events on seafront stretches they call The Dips. The revamped Floral Pavilion is flourishing and I never thought I’d see Bella Italia, Prezzo, Starbucks and Travelodge investing here, and making profits. Hundreds of children will enjoy their first-ever seaside break thanks to Mirror readers. You’ve donated thousands to our Give Kids a Seaside Smile appeal for the Family Holiday Association, a charity which arranges breaks for those who can’t afford it.

He left with an impressive  GCSEs.    He stayed at the school to study for his A-levels, getting an A in geography, an A in history of art and a C in biology.

During her high school years, The Duchess of Sussex performed in theatrical productions at both Immaculate Heart and Loyola High School. Her former drama teacher, Gigi Perreau, who directed Meghan in seven plays, remembered that her former student sparkled. She said: You see someone nice to the other kids, who gets good grades, doesnapost say anything bad about anybody.    America does not test students using GCSEs or A Levels, and it has not been reported what Meghan got on her SATsbut it is known that she got the grades she needed to get into university. She went on gain a double major in Theatre and International Relations at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois in . During her time at university, The Duchess completed an internship at the US Embassy in Buenos Aires, Argentina, where she learned to speak Spanish. She also studied French for six years.

Daisy, , from Exeter, who works for the NHS, said: Last night I was walking back to my boyfriendaposs house up through The Triangle car park when I saw some angry seagulls fighting over something and acting suspiciously.    When I got closer I was shocked to see it was a paw and thought aposoh my godapos - it looks like either a dog or a cat, definitely not a rabbitaposs foot, it was a dferent shape. This was definitely not a rabbit - it was a totally dferent shape to a rabbitaposs foot. It was either a puppy or a cat. The news comes after a chihuahua dog called Gizmo was reportedly taken away by hungry seagulls. Rebecca Hill, , said her boyfriend was hanging out the washing in the garden when he saw the seagull snatch the dog and carry him away in his beak.The incident, along with other reported seagull attacks on human beings, sparked a debate over what to do with the birds, which have quadrupled in the first fteen years of this century. Independent MP John Woodcock made headlines when he suggested feeding seagulls contraceptives. The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, however, stated that all seven breeds of gull in the UK are subject to aposconservative concernapos despite an increase in population.

The -year-old, from Manchester, has made £, in lavish gts and cash from her sugar daddies in just six months. Keely, who works for Adidas, decided to try dating older men when her relationship with someone younger broke down. But instead of opting for traditional dating apps, like Tinder, she joined a sugar baby site. These match stunning young women with with affluent older men, who spoil them with shopping sprees, extravagant holidays and cash.\u2028\u2028    But Keely insists dating sugar daddies is nothing like being an escort. She said: People always assume you must be doing something to get the gts and money, but I am absolutely not.\u2028\u2028 I have only met one man off the site in person – whoaposs only about  years older than me - the rest have just decided to give me gts anyway.\u2028\u2028 I never ask for money and wouldn’t accept itit felt like there was a catch, as that way, you could end up feeling pressured.\u2028\u2028 To anyone being critical, I’d say to learn more about being a sugar baby before judging, as it’s not what everybody assumes.    After hearing about SeekingArrangement, a matchmaking website that partners attractive singles to wealthy benefactors, through a friend, Keeley signed up earlier this year. Less than an hour later she had already started getting messages. Keely said: I started speaking to a few of them, and some fizzled out – but with others, there was a spark.\u2028\u2028 I exchanged numbers with two, who were both around  years older than me.\u2028\u2028 That isn’t actually as old as I thought men on the site would be, but I don’t discriminate, so I wouldn’t have a set cut-off date with how old I’d go.\u2028\u2028    For me, it is all about connection. There are some really attractive men on the site, butthere isn’t that spark and conversation doesn’t flow, then I’m not interested. Since joining, Keeley has found two sugar daddies – one who she speaks to on the phone every day and the other who she has been out with.\u2028\u2028 She said: We went on a shopping spree and for coffee, then out for dinner before he dropped me home. It was all very casual. As well as her two main sugar daddies, Keeley also receives anonymous gts from other interested suitors from the site.\u2028\u2028 She said: I mostly get cash gts via PayPal. I’ll get them first thing in the morning, with messages like, ‘Have a good day, beautulapos.    I’ll also get themI’ve been chatting to someone and mention I’ve had a bad day, to cheer me up, or that I am going out with the girls at the weekend, so I can get some drinks on them.\u2028\u2028“ If they don’t want to send cash, I have an Amazon wishlist, so they can get me something from there instead. As well as money, Keeley has received lavish gts like a Gucci scarf, designer trainers and top-of-the-range hair straighteners.\u2028\u2028 Admitting that she is constantly breaking her phones, she has also been gted new mobiles and a Macbook laptop.\u2028\u2028 All in, she estimates she has made around £, in just six months and has spoken to sugar daddies aged from  to .\u2028\u2028    Always falling for younger men in the past, her experience has opened her eyes to the benefits of older suitors.\u2028\u2028 Keely said: The appealing thing about older men is that they are more established and mature and know themselves better.\u2028\u2028 I want a man who can look after me, but that I can look after, too. It’s a two-way street.\u2028\u2028 Like any dating site, SeekingArrangement will have men who just want to hook up, but I ignore them. I don’t want to speak to somebody who isn’t going to be respectful.” While Keeley, who loves being on the sugar daddiesapos site, wants people to see that she is at most enjoying innocent dates with the men she is in touch with, she has warned people wanting to join that online safety is paramount.\u2028\u2028 She said: “In the long run, I would like to find somebody to settle down with, and there’s no reason I couldn’t find them on SeekingArrangement.\u2028\u2028 "},{"url":null,"title":"uk weather bank holiday 33c","story":"NewsUK weather: Bank holiday to hit C but heres how hot it will get in your areaThe Met Office and Public Health England health alerts for the south and south east of England where heatwave conditions are expectedShareCommentsByAbigail OLeary:,  AUG Updated:,  AUG Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news uk-news video met-office-issue-forecast-bank-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true\"\"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribe We will use your email address only for the purpose of sending you newsletters.

This was followed by Mondays and Wednesdays. Not only were the most productive days all found to be at the beginning of the week, but workers also confessed they were more productive earlier in the day too. On average, one in fiverespondents said they were most productive between am and am, with just two percent claiming they work best between pm and pm. Workthere’s research also revealed an insight into UK office worker’s sleeping patterns in order to draw a potential link to sleep and productivity and found that out of those who responded, the average worker goes to sleep at .pm and wakes up at .am.Respondents who sleep or wake up any later than this tend to experience a drop in productivity levels, as only two percent of respondents who wake up between  and  am, and seven percent who go to sleep later than  am, said they feel productive all day. In addition, the study delved into participants’ motivations for getting up in the morning and going to work and found that money is naturally the main motivator.   Commenting on the research findings, Cal Lee, global head of Workthere, said: Whilst overall productivity levels for UK office workers will inevitably y from day to day it is interesting to see the average optimum times for productivity, particularly in terms of time and a specic day. It’s important to remember that each person works dferently, and while some may prefer to work a -, others like to work around their lives and schedule. One potential benefit of flexible working is the possibility for workers to manage their day around when their productivity levels may be at their highest, therefore helping to manage their time more efficiently. By their nature, flexible and serviced office spaces complement flexible working arrangements perfectly and allow employees to work at a time or location where they’ll be the most productive.

Also it’s a bloody great poem and it’s rare to get such a perfect opportunity to loudly speak it through a loo door and over the sound of the weeing and weeping of a sad stranger.   Her thread of tweets quickly went viral, with over , likes and , retweets.One person commented: You did a good thing. Another replied: That is just lovely. Grief is a b****** whether it’s brand new or years old. This made it slightly less s*** for a while. A third called it a beautul act of kindness.

The totaposs mother, , and father, , broke down in tears as they appeared in court to be sentenced for severely neglecting her. The malnourished -month-old weighed just over  pounds, had no teeth and was also suffering from rickets. The couple, from Sydney, Australia, were charged after their daughter had a seizure and was admitted to hospital in March last year. She was found to have blue lips, cold hands and feet, low blood sugar and little muscle tone, according to reports. She also appeared floppy.    ABC News reported that for the first  months of the childaposs le, she was fed a conservative vegan diet and missed key developmental milestones, the judge said. The parents, who have two other children, told a dietitian they fed their daughter cups of oats with olive oil, rice milk, vegetables, rice, potatoes and tofu. As a snack they would give her a mouthful of fruit or two sultanas. Medical examinations showed that she had several severe deficiencies as well as osteopenia - thinning of the bones, which had not developed since birth. The mother had no photographs of her daughter, the court also heard.    The judge slammed the parents as “reckless” and questioned their “untruthful” statements to authorities about their daughter’s health. She said “the abandonment of parental responsibility cannot be excused”. The youngster had also not received any medical check-ups or immunisations since birth. According to News, the mum told a doctor: I was just too exhausted. Just the thought of putting them in the car and driving them. I was thinking aposhow do mothers do that  Iaposm so tired. The parents, who cannot be named for legal reasons, pleaded guilty in December to failing to provide for a child, causing danger or serious injury. District judge Sarah Huggett described the babyaposs condition as a result of her completely inadequate diet.    She said: It is the responsibility of every parent to ensure the diet they choose to provide to their children.. is one that is balanced and contains sufficient essential nutrients for optimal growth. “This was not an isolated act or a momentary decision that caused danger to the child. The child was seriously underweight, underdeveloped and undernourished. That would have taken time to occur.” The mother had become “increasingly fixated” in her beliefs including in their vegan diet, Judge Huggett said. The pair were sentenced this week to an -month intensive corrections order and  hours of community service. The couple collapsed in each otheraposs arms crying as they found out their sentence. Meanwhile, a psychiatrist refuted claims the mumaposs lack of care for the child was due to postnatal depression. However a doctor believed she showed other symptoms consistent with major depression. Judge Huggett accepted the woman was suffering from depression. The girl, now aged three, is now being cared for by other family members.

Research showed between eight and  per cent of dogs sold for human consumption are infected with rabies in markets located throughout the province.    The Indonesian Government issued a directive in September  to ban the cat and dog meat trade, but Governor Dondokambey continues to defy this despite warnings about the health and safety risk. They pledged the sale of dogs and cat meat would be banned as would the sale of live cats and dogs to be slaughtered.  Peter Egan said he was shocked and saddened to see DMFIaposs latest evidence of horric dog and cat abuse in Tomohon the very same abuse that Mr Lolowang of the city mayoraposs office assured me personaly would no longer be taking place. He added: Itaposs devastating to know that its business as usual for the dog and cat meat traders in Tomohon. He urged the authorities to stop it immediately.   Change For Animals Foundation co-founder Lola Webber said: Given the extremely grave nature of the animal cruelty we have filmed over a long period, including clear evidence of dogs and cats being routinely bludgeoned and blowtorched alive at markets, we are appalled that the North Sulawesi Governor refuses to acknowledge the shocking animal sufering.

However, that’s where the problems began for the manager in terms of his subs.Left on the bench was centre-back and club captain Josh Meekings alongside youngsters Callum Moore, Max Anderson and Michael Cunningham.Unless you’re changing a centre-back in the closing stages, that’s slim pickings for a game that size against a good outfit in Aberdeen.And that’s not me saying the kids at Dens aren’t good enough for the first team, don’t go doubting yourselves yet, lads.In a situation like that, however, with a few minutes to go and a goal up, experience is absolutely vital.With four minutes of the  left, winger Josh Todd ‘blew up’, in the manager’s words, and forced a decision on the gaffer. Put on a young player in Todd’s position to run about or opt for the experienced man, club captain no less, but change the set-up on the pitch that had coped so well with the Aberdeen attack.Meekings was the man chosen to see the game out but that allowed the Dons space up the field to start launching balls into the box and pile the pressure on the home side.Sadly that told and Dundee miss out on a trip to Tynecastle in the quarters.What it did show is this Dark Blues side will take some beating this season. It is clear more bodies are needed, though."},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/08/5d56cea005fae3.34061587.jpg ","title":"dundee united bosses spend 250k over summer to bring tannadice up to scratch","story":"Dundee United’s American owners have forked out a quarter of a million pounds over the summer to make sure Tannadice is up to scratch.And the spending to make it one of the best grounds in the country will continue over the next few years.Tangerines managing director Mal Brannigan, while stressing no criticism was being aimed at previous regimes, has revealed the one surprise millionaire Mark Ogren and his son Scott got after buying United was the extent of work needed to the stadium.However, he was delighted with their belief it should be undertaken as a matter of urgency.Since the end of last season, that’s seen almost £, spent on the Eddie Thompson Stand and an ongoing refurbishment of the Executive Lounge and Captain’s Suite underneath the Jerry Kerr Stand.Other improvements sanctioned by the owners include the new ticketing system that’s now in operation and the installation of a fibre optic ring covering the entire stadium.“The one thing that did catch us a little bit by surprise when we came in was probably the amount of investment we needed to put into Tannadice to bring her back up to speed and to better the facilities the fans were experiencing,” explained Brannigan.“It was not necessarily an enormous surprise but, at the same time, we were probably a little bit behind where we thought we would be and we have addressed a lot of that stuff during the summer, so, when we go forward, we have good foundations in place.“We’ve done a lot of infrastructure work. Fans will be able to look up in the Eddie Thompson and look up to the rafters and see there’s a lot of paint work that’s gone on there.“We’ve re-netted the steelwork underneath that as well. That was something that would have had to have been done for a number of years, wasn’t done, and was something that needed addressing.”As an experienced football administrator working in senior positions at clubs like Derby County, Sheffield United and Coventry down south, as well as Dundalk in Ireland, he understood why such work was not being done by previous regimes.“Money goes to the team or somewhere where there’s a commercial . It’s always worth investing,money is tight, in somewhere where you can create actual additional working capital for the business and I have done it working in other football clubs.“I completely understand the position the club was in. It was disappointing for ourselves in the fact it was something we’ve had to pay for but it was a reflection in the price paid.”Brannigan believes a pleasant offshoot of the work that’s been going on and will continue is it’s been the best way of the Americans showing fans they’re at United for the long haul.It’s also further proof Tannadice will remain United’s home.“There’s been no commercial benefit from the work on the Eddie Thompson Stand, it was about making sure that the stadium looks in the right light again going forward.“And Tannadice is our home and there have been no conversations or chat around the boardroom table about moving anywhere . It’s all about improving here.”More work is planned and a lot of that will be undertaken over the next few summers.“I think it took us a few months to look at the football club and to see where’s good, where we would need to improve, where we would need to go in a dferent direction,” added Brannigan. “I think that’s probably going to be ongoing for the next couple of years.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/08/2.44775439-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/08/2.44775439-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/08/2.44775439-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/08/2.44775439-240x180.jpg 300w ","title":"international beach volleyball tournament to be held in perth next month","story":"Landlocked Perth is to get a permanent beach volleyball court.The sport’s stars from Europe’s smallest nations will flock to the city next month for the finals of an international championship.The Scottish Volleyball Association is bringing the Small Countries Association Beach Volleyball Finals  to Perth thanks to a partnership with the local authority.Not only does this mean four days of international-level beach volleyball for the people of Perth but it also allows for the creation of a permanent inland beach volleyball centre for members of the public.The court will be handed over to Perth Volleyball Club, currently based at Bell’s Sports Centre, after the competition, with organisers looking to pour in the sand before the first weekend in September.The bowling green at Darnhall Tennis Club in the city’s Craigie area is being replaced by  tonnes of sand in order to create the facility.The Small Countries Association brings together  of the smallest volleyball-playing nations in Europe, from Greenland to Cyprus and Liechtenstein to the Faroe Islands, to create a more level playing field.The  countries also include Scotland, Northern Ireland, Wales and Ireland."},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/05/5cee68ff034d24.02416017.jpg ","title":"mcpake wants 100 from players in league after dundees dons cup disappointment","story":"James McPake has backed his players to repeat the amount of effort put in against Aberdeen as theyto league duties this weekend.The Dark Blues face Inverness Caley Thistle at Dens Park this Saturday aiming to continue their unbeaten start in the Championship.They did suffer their first defeat of the campaign on Sunday as the Dons came away with a - extra-time victory in the Betfred Cup.McPake’s side, though, took plenty of plaudits for their performance in the  minutes with their one-goal lead only equalled in stoppage time by the Premiership outfit.The Dens boss might have been frustrated with the result but not the application from his men – something they’ll need to show again in the tough league games coming up.McPake said: “We’ll analyse it and see where we can be better but I thought my players were excellent in terms of everything and I think a second goal would have been enough because I think we were that dominant in the game.“That would have allowed us to control the game a bit better by keeping the ball a bit better.“We were a little more direct than what we have been but it worked.”The Dens gaffer revealed some of his players were running on empty as the clock ticked down, forcing him into substitutions late in the game.“There were crucial parts in the game,” he added.“Having to take Jamie Ness off because he just blew up – credit to him, he’s just come back and you could see why I was so desperate to sign him.

I’m not a professional artist, I’m just an amateur.“I’ve been painting for about  years.“I go to a le drawing class once a week and my tutor said he thought I should take them along to the library, so I did.”Although she has been interested in art for a number of years, Judith said she took it up more regularly after her husband Thomas died.Some of the pieces included in the exhibition show Nigg Bay, the construction work in progress and a view of Aberdeen from the harbour.She said: “I take my sketchbook everywhere I’ve been. I’m just recently back from the Isle of Wight.“I’ve only lived in Scotland for the past four or five years. I hope my paintings prove just how wonderful Aberdeen really is. People who perhaps don’t know the city always say Aberdeen is grey or the weather isn’t great. I see beauty everywhere I look.”The exhibition will be in place until September  in Aberdeen Central Library.Aberdeen Harbour was first established as a business back in  and construction on the new Aberdeen South Harbour began in .The expansion of facilities will accommodate larger vessels and hopes to upscale opportunities for existing customers, while opening the door to new markets.It has been described as a “game changer” for the cruise market, as it will allow larger ships to enter the port.Part of its quay opened in July this year for construction traffic.It is made up of , tonnes of infill material behind the caissons, watertight retaining structures on Dunnottar Quay.

It will make sure we have expertise there – staff with a wealth of knowledge who can make a huge dference to the people they support.”She added: “It is amazing when the service has success stories and gets positive feedback. It’s what motivates us and gets us out of bed in the morning to help people.”Aberdeen Street Pastors director Adrian Rowett said: “We’re out on the streets on Fridays and Saturdays and this funding will help us buy and distribute blankets, ponchos and sleeping bags.“We spend about £, a year on this type of equipment so it is about a year’s worth of kit. Hopefully it will be enough, maybe we’ll need more.“It is critical to get this kind of support. The only reason we’re able to do what we do is because we receive this support. It’s very helpful to us. It’s rather nice that both organisations are getting a share of this funding. We try to relay a lot with Cyrenians and one of our volunteers is a Cyrenians worker.”Besides assisting people out on the streets, street pastors also help vulnerable revellers from their Safe Space bus in the city centre, whether it is by offering a bottle of water or help calling a taxi home.The bus is in Belmont Street from .pm to .am on Fridays and Saturdays.Mr Rowett added: “We’ve also been able to help with annual shows out in Aberdeeshire.“Halloween will be a busy night for us in the city and it will be busy once the university freshers are back.“We will try to be there for everyone. It ranges from those who are very vulnerable, homeless or without support all the way up to those who need to know where the nearest bus or taxi is.Aberdeen Inspired chief executive Adrian Watson said: “We get a lot of feedback from businesses saying that people being out on the streets is a key issue for them.“But they are not being cold or cynical towards people on the streets and begging – it’s quite the reverse. There is a lot of empathy there so it was very easy for us to reflect that and go for this funding to bring it to these two wonderful organisations.“They deal with challenging issues in the here and now at all hours.”"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures week 25","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowFiona McCuish of Ardrishaig captured the VIC puffer wending its way up the Crinan Canal.Fiona used her camera phone as the vessel passed through West Bank, Ardrishaig."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column june 28 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWhat is it with recruiting #professionals# to Argyll We seem to be a distinctly unattractive prospect, as witnessed by the problems with recruiting a dentist in Lochgilphead.What people fail to appreciate is that they stand to gain so much more than they would lose by coming to Argyll.The scenery is unrivalled the pace of le is civilised we are not that far from the central belt and a sense of community remains.Just turn to our front page story for proof.Disappointment at losing out on council grant funding has turned into joy in Tarbert.But only because the people of the village have such big hearts, as they have demonstrated in the past.The council may argue that this vindicates its decision to refuse funding.

They also make for an excellently contrasting pair.From Mendelssohn’s exuberant opening bars, we are swept through music that is complex yet captivatingly, joyously melodic throughout, while Enescu’s is moody, breathlessly dramatic and, in parts, simply volcanic.Guest directed by Marianne Thorsen, SE will explore the specic charm of seeing a small group of musicians performing live. With fewer instruments, the fabric of the music becomes more tangible, subtle shts in mood may have a new-found presence, and pieces you think you know well might offer surprising new colours when heard live. With fewer musicians on stage, it is easier to follow each inidual path and witness the beautul alchemy of eight artists creating something together.Thorsen is an acclaimed soloist and passionate chamber musician. Former leader of the Nash Ensemble, she regularly performs with Norway’s Trondheim Soloists, one of the founding ensembles of The Bridge network and festival.The first half of the tour, which is called Chamber Notes, will call at Crear Studio, Kilberry, on August , followed by a performance at Mull Theatre, Tobermory, on August  before moving on to Inverness and Dundee.Other Scottish dates, including Edinburgh and Glasgow, are programmed for February .PIC:Marianne Thorsen. no_aMarianne Thorsen"},{"url":null,"title":"kilberry sportive well supported in sunshine","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe Kilberry Loop Sportive saw around  cyclists take on a -mile route starting and finishing in Tarbert.All eyes were on the forecast for the non-competitive cycling event on Saturday August .

We do at the moment have a dentist and fully qualied staff and are happy with their work.Rumour has it that the aforementioned dentist and staff will be taking on patients from Mid Argyll Hospital, which I presume they tend to already.But the practice is to lose its local NHS patients, so they will deal solely with patients who require dental treatment from the hospital. I think this situation leaves the NHS patients in limbo.I am sure we would rather that the current dentist and all of her staff be given a chance to voice their opinions on this matter as much and as well as the local populace.Yes, it will be brilliant to have both dentists in the town. There is the possibility that those on the local list who are currently treated well by the dental department at the hospital maybe still seen by the dentist and her staff, but I would like this to be confirmed by the local NHS trust.Brian MacDonald, CrinanSir,Hundreds of people across Scotland have been helped through their exam results by a local group of Skills Development Scotlandcareers advisers.Based across the north of Scotland, the advisers were part of a team taking calls at the SDS Exam Results Helpline from am on results day.The helpline is a vital service, supporting young people and their families at what can be one of the most stressful times of their lives.Expert advice and guidance is available all year round, not just on results day.Our professionally qualied careers advisers are working in every state secondary school in Scotland and from our network of high street centres across the country.In schools, careers services are delivered one-to-one, in classrooms and at school events across all year groups, supporting young people to develop the skills to make informed career decisions throughout their lives.

Levenseat will consider dferent routes at dferent times of the day, depending on circumstances such as traffic.... We anticipate Levenseat will determine the best routes over the coming weeks.An SBC spokesperson added: ldquoThe number of trips to the waste transfer station is largely in line with trips to the previous landfill site, and signicantly less than could have been generated by an integrated waste management facility at Easter Langlee.ldquoAs part of the planning application which was approved in November , the council committed to improving the road network through additional street-lighting, better signage, localised road widening and removal of trees and vegetation, all of which have taken place.ldquoThe council was not able to define a route during the planning process as the procurement exercise had not been completed and therefore SBC did not know the end destination or the preferred route.ldquoThe new residual waste contract will see the majority of the waste treated to produce a refuse derived fuel ndash to generate heat and electricity ndash as well as recover materials which can be recycled.ldquoThe closure of the landfill site and opening of waste transfer station will also see a reduction in harmful greenhouse gases from landfilling the waste and we believe it will also result in an improved recycling performance."},{"url":null,"title":"innerleithen-set-17th-annual-music-festival","story":"INNERLEITHEN is ready to rock this weekend as it welcomes musicians, dancers and performers to the towns th annual music festival.The StRonans Hotel and Live  Local at the Vale Club have put together a jam-packed programme of bands overthree days.And the Church of Scotland, Tweedside Hotel, Masons Club and the Union Club are all set to host a number of events.The music kicks off on Friday at pm in the St Ronanrsquos Hotel with the Redwood Rejects, at pm with Fin Price at lsquoLive  Localrsquo and at pm with Sparky  The Choirboys at the Tweedside Hotel.On Saturday, alongside the full programmes of bands around Innerleithen, the town is packed with events, starting with the St Ronanrsquos Silver Band coffee morning.Afterwards, the band will be continuing their eight-hour sponsored play out and about in the town.At the Church of Scotland therersquos concerts galore with The Taylor Family  Friends, Borders piper Matt Seattle accompanied by guitarist Donald Knox, and superb Innerleithen-born singer-songwriter Tommy Ashby.Over at the Masons, the regions favourite cover band The Derivatives are appearing, while Rory Speirs is at the Tweedside.There will be something for all the family to enjoy, with a wide selection of workshops, including beginnerrsquos ballet and line dance with the Fiona Henderson School of Dance, as well as singing, belly-dancing and an introduction to ukelele.There will also be an opportunity to learn more about the town on a historical walk with local experts from the Innerleithen Community Trust.Sunday sees the music continue over at the Church of Scotland, with a concert by leading Scots folk singer Christine Kydd, supported by the Borders Gaelic singing group lsquoTurasrsquo and Folksters.And to round off the weekend, therersquos informal music sessions at the Gordon Arms and the Corner House hotels.One of the festivals organisers, Robin Dempsey said: ldquoWe are really excited that we have possibly our biggest ever line up, with around  performances and events on the programme, spread over eight venues.ldquoThe music festival is truly encouraging local talent in the community and it is great to see so many locals and visitors coming together to share their love of music.ldquoWhat has really helped this year is support from our new sponsor, private development group, Whiteburn, who are currently regenerating the former Caerlee Mill site in the town.

In my opinion, the answers to some of the points raised were not clear or consistent with the planning documents submitted.ldquoThe consensus was that this development is not suitable for a site situated close to residential areas, schools and busy roads.Derek Harris, business operations manager at Skyrora, said: ldquoSuch is our commitment to keeping the local community up to speed on plans and taking their views into account, this was our fourth meeting in the town.ldquoThe test site offers East Lothian the opportunity to play an invaluable role in the infrastructure to support Scotlandrsquos existing space ambitions and inspire the next generation in the town to a career in STEM [science, technology, engineering, mathematics] while bringing a raft of economic opportunities to the town.Skyrora recently successfully tested their first D-printed commercial rocket engine at Newquay airport in Cornwall."},{"url":null,"title":"lunch-club-39-s-work-makes-national-television-news","story":"The Pennypit-based Preston Seton Gosford Lunchclub were featured on the news to showcase the important work that groups like this do when dealing with holiday hunger for young children.Lorna Bellany, who has been manager of the lunch club for the past year, said: ldquoIt all happened very quickly, charity Children in Scotland organised it the night before, so it was a rush to get things ready.ldquoThe kids loved it.

And Scotland is leading the way, with the Scottish government aiming for renewable sources to generate the equivalent of  per cent of Scotlandrsquos gross annual electricity consumption by .To allow us to use more renewable energy we need to upgrade our current system to a smarter energy network.This will ensure we make the most of the greener energy available and open the door to a more sustainable future.With the uptake of smart meters in homes around Great Britain will come a new, smarter system, which is a more flexible and decarbonised. Whatrsquos more, this system is central to the country reducing its CO emissions, whilst being more reliable, sustainable and cost-effective.The increased complexity of the system and the need to be able to flexibly match supply and demand means that digitalisation is an important part of the transition. Central to digitalisation is the accurate measurement of customer energy demands so the system can provide energy in the most efficient and costeffective way, and customers can accurately understand how they use energy. And that is where smart meters ndash available from your energy supplier at no extra cost - come in.Simply put, smart meters will make Britainrsquos energy grid, and energy system, smarter. This is because the data that they are able to generate allows our energy network to understand how much energy is being used, when and where across Great Britain. The system will also be able to draw on more local and renewable sources of energy.Our electricity needs are predicted to double by , so we have to upgrade our outdated energy grid.

I think for many parents who have childcare challenges,there can be a real sense of relief as the summer holidays end, and to some extent I feel that myself.The pressure to fill six weeks with entertainment and activities, and go on holiday, can be immense, especially on a tight budget. For some children too, the holidays can be a dficult time and school can offer them ato some familiar routine.However, I remember the impending dread I felt when I was a child in the final days of the summer holidays. I hated the back to school adverts on TV as they heralded the end of free days playing on the rocks at the Pans shore, and of loosely defined bedtimes.So I was glad that our youngest daughter Skye was looking forward to school as she enters P. She met friends she hadnrsquot seen in weeks this morning and smiled as she said hello to George the lollipop man.She seemed slightly anxious as she waited in line in a new place, but the friendly manner of her new teacher visibly lted her mood and she went in with a smile, unknowingly tracing my childhood footsteps and those of her big sister.But then as I walked home, I was suddenly overwhelmed with anxieties: money worries, work worries, deadlines, bills etc. It seemed asduring the holiday period I had consciously decided to put such thoughts aside, to just enjoy the family time. Now was the pay back, we had ed to lsquorealityrsquo.But then I suddenly remembered a tale a fellow storyteller had told me many years ago. It just popped into my head and it spoke to me as I wandered back. And the truth in the story was the antidote I needed in that moment. And so I will share it with you in case you may one day find you need it:There was once a weaver who was weighed down with worries. He had so many things to do, so many responsibilities he looked into the future with dread. His worries kept him awake at night, which of course made his worrying worse during the next day. It was a vicious cycle.Then one day, he was sitting at his loom working and his worries got in the way. He couldnrsquot concentrate and he made mistake after mistake. He cursed and this was heard by an auld guidewe who happened to be passing by his window.ldquoFir whit reason dae ye curse at yer loom son, is there nae joy in yer work  she asked.The weaver looked up, feeling ashamed: ldquoIrsquom sair sorry fir ma words. Itrsquos just that as I work I think aboot orsquo ma troubles.The old woman nodded in understanding. She knew about troubles herself.ldquoAye, she said with an understanding nod, ldquotroubles can fair get ye doon.Then she paused and thought for a moment. She could see in the weaverrsquos face that he was riddled with anxieties.ldquoCan I show ye something that will tak ye awa frae yer work fir only a few minutes The weaver was happy to have a break so he left his loom and came outside.ldquoDae ye hae a bucket  asked the guidewe.ldquoA bucket ldquoAye a bucket, tae put some water in, she explained.The weaver fetched his bucket, wondering what the old woman was going to do with it.She took it to the well and filled it with a little water.ldquoNoo son, I dinnae kenthis will be tae heavy fir ye tae hold up.The weaver laughed: ldquoOrsquo course itrsquos no too heavy, fir ye only put a wee drop orsquo water in it.So the woman asked him to prove this by holding up the bucket with arms outstretched. The weaver had strong arms because of his work and held the bucket before him without any effort.ldquoAh, said the guidewe, ldquosae itrsquos nae tae heavy.ldquoIt isnae heavy at arsquo, replied the weaver.The old woman smiled: ldquoIn that case, keep haudin it afore ye like that fir  minutes. He wondered why she was asking him to do this, andshe was just trying to make a fool of him. But he was also intrigued and knew her to be an honest old soul, and so he did as she asked.After a few minutes of holding the bucket in front of him, it began to feel much heavier. After five minutes, his arms began to ache and soon they began to shake. The pain began to spread to his back as he desperately tried to keep the bucket in position.ldquoIs  minutes no over yet  asked the weaver desperately.ldquoIf the bucket is now tae heavy fir ye, put it doon son.He was reluctant to admit that the bucket was now too heavy to hold and so put it down.ldquoThe water got heavier son, didnrsquot it ldquoThe water wasnae heavier, protested the weaver, ldquoye just made me hold the bucket for tae lang.ldquoSae the water did get heavier, no in itself, but for you!The weaver looked confused and the guidewe continued.ldquoWater can get heavierye haud it ower lang afore ye, evenitrsquos just a wee drop. Yer worries are like that water, son. I am sure that they are many but ye mak them much heavierye try tae haud them in yer thochts arsquo the time.She smiled at him: ldquoTry an put the bucket doon as often as ye can,ye ken whit I mean. Dinnae mak it heavier than needs be. When ye need tae, haud it, but no arsquo the time.ldquoIn fact, she added while raising a pointed finger, ldquohauding it arsquo the time gies ye pain and paralyses ye. Yersquoll hae nae ability left tae empty the bucket.And so the old woman wandered off, leaving her words with the weaver. He looked down at the bucket. He lted it again and held it in front of him. It wasnrsquot as heavy now as before, but still had the same amount of water in it. She was right, water can get heavieryou hold it for longer, even though itrsquos the same weight.He chuckled to himself and watched the woman as she waddled down the street.ldquoThank ye! he called out.He ed to his loom. This time he whistled and sang as he worked. He enjoyed his creation and made no mistakes, for he had put his bucket of worries down for a while.Later they would still be there, but they might seem lighter and easier to manage now that they had stopped paralysing him with anxiety.And so that was the story. And as I arrived home, I realised that although I needed to deal with lots of things, I wasnrsquot going to give my worries more weight by holding them constantly in my thoughts.Itrsquos really

years. While the name of these types of promotions seems to imply that players will be on the receiving end of totally free spins, during which anything won can be kept and withdrawn, the truth is often a bit murkier than that.The UK Gambling Commission has played no small role in attempting to clear up the matter. According to them, to use the term ldquofree spins casinos must genuinely offer free games with no strings attached, such as wagering requirements. The old, standard spins are to be referred to as ldquobonus spins instead.When Free Spins Are Not Truly Free SpinsThere are several occasions when free spinsarenrsquot free. Any spins which come with wagering requirements, for instance, breach the concept of being truly free. Wagering requirements, also known as playthrough rates, denote that a player must wager whatever they win a specic number of times before they can withdraw those funds.Wagering requirements are common in deposit bonusesbut shouldnrsquot be included in any offer which proclaims itself to be free.Free Spins With No Wagering RequirementsFortunately, the new regulation issued by the UK Gambling Commission, Swedish Gaming Authority and others are aiming to fix this issue. True free spin deals should come with no hidden terms and no strings attached. They should be offered to players with a genuine chance to win real money for free, money which can ndasha player desires ndash be withdrawn from the start. This doesnrsquot mean to say that there arenrsquot other terms and conditions.Many top free spin bonuses tend to come with dates attached, only being valid during a predetermined period. Moreover, they may only be valid on select slot machines and could be limited to players in a specic region.Only a Handful of Chances to WinThere is a downside to the new ldquofree spins offers at casinos. They generally tend to provide a limited number of spins, far fewer than the old no deposit bonuses with wagering requirements, and deposit offers. Moreover, they are often only valid on slot games which do not offer substantial cash prizes, including many simple - line games from NetEnt and others.Promos Which Are Ideal for Test Driving CasinosSuch free spin bonuses which come with no wagering requirements at all are hardly going to be appealing for players who fancy landing big wins. As mentioned, they tend to be valid on slots which donrsquot offer such epic wins. However, these promos and deals may make the ideal introduction to slot gaming for new players, or those who wish to test-drive a slot before deciding to wager real money on it.The East Lothian Courierencourages readers to gamble responsibly.

The procedure for iding matrimonial property, which is any money and other assets owned jointly or inidually is that it is to be ided fairly, which may not simply mean equally. If the situation has to be resolved in court that can result in a decision that is far from satisfactory to one ndashor both ndashof the partners.ldquoItrsquos important that we advise clients about the fact that Alternative Dispute Resolution is available. These situations emphatically donrsquot involve an inevitable progress to court ndashwhich should be regarded as very much the last resort, he says.In fact, some % or more of cases are now dealt with through negotiation rather than a court order that determines the ision of assets. People who proceed to court, says Ferry almost inevitably have an urgent issue such as suffering from a serious shortage of money or protection issues resulting from circumstances of domestic abuse.The alternative routes principally involve collaboration or mediation. Mediation, involves an independent mediator guiding the parties toward a solution. The mediator does not usually give them legal advice as to their entitlements though in assisted mediation both parties have their solicitors in the background .ldquoThat is an option that sometimes works out well ndash but many people are looking for veriable answers, and this can be achieved through the collaborative approach which I find is generally a better way to resolve disagreements.Ferry, a trained collaborative lawyer, believes this route is best to minimise conflict and secure financial choices ndashwhile also, importantly, ensuring the best future for the children. He explains that collaborative law involves the parties and their advisers in four-way meetings with discussions around the table, in private and without the delay of correspondence and court proceedings. And this, he says helps to avoid subsequent, and potentially costly, misunderstandings.The problem with pensionsPensions, for example, can become very contentious. ldquoIn our experience pensions are frequently overlooked by clients when considering orce settlements. However, the value of the pensions built up during the marriage or civil partnership is taken into account and can be substantial. Our clientsrsquo settlements often involve pension sharing agreements.ldquoHowever, pensions can be extremely complicated ndashnot only in terms of valuing them and iding them but itrsquos also important to get the best advice on which pensions should be shared and which should not. Some have more benefits attached to them than others. For example, there may be spousersquos benefits attached to them which may be very valuable.In addition, he adds, there are ious types of pensions such as Self Invested Personal Pensionswhich can be convoluted when dealing with them in orce cases as sometimes these can involve multiple underlying property and other assets contained in the pension which may need to be valued too.ldquoYou need to take advice not only about its value at the date of separation but also its type of pension and current value. A failure to identy pension interests or to correctly apportion the value of a pension may have dramatic long-term implications for either spouse and there is a strict timescale involved after orce for implementing the pension share.Business assetsFerry says that clients also need advice about business assets and shareholdings, as to what constitutes matrimonial property as these can, inadvertently, be converted into matrimonial property in the course of, for example, restructuring a company that was founded or bought before marriage.ldquoShareholdings that may be worth several millions can be transferred into the joint matrimonial pot and that possibility is not often considered by the accountant or tax advisor involved, he says.These are just a few of the issues to be considered but despite the obvious vexations that separation and orce involve, Ferry believes in confronting them in a positive, proactive way. The Family LawAct of  was well thought out and is quite flexible, providing for the needs of inidual cases, he says.Divorce, he adds, need not end up in long, drawn out court proceedings. ldquoWhether via a pre-nuptial agreement or a collaborative resolution, with good legal advice parties can deal with separation and orce in way that achieves the solution that works best for them both.Noel specialises in all areas of family law but is particularly noted for acting in high value cases for high net worth iniduals, for example, celebrities, sports personalities, entrepreneurs, business owners, directors, professionals and executives.

The world is a much better place as a result but, unlike with family, the bonds and obligations of friendship are less clear-cut. Sometimes ties wither naturally, at others, rash or destructive relationships have actively to be severed. This is an unpleasant fact of le and one that Prince Andrew is discovering belatedly to his cost.For some time now, speculation has been mounting after the publication of a photo showing the Prince walking in a New York park with his friend, the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, who was recently found dead in a prison cell, where he awaited trial on charges of sex trafficking and conspiracy to engage in sex-trafficking.The headlines must have made the Palace shudder, their insinuations all too clear. After details of a US lawsuit mentioning him were released, a terse statement was issued distancing the Prince from historic accusations made against Epstein, and claiming that ldquoAny suggestion of impropriety with underage minors is categorically untrue.:Prince Andrew hosted Jeffrey Epstein at BalmoralClose observers of Buckingham Palace might have noticed a cloud of dust around the flagpole as the house was shaken to its foundations. When the Daily Mail published footage recently showing the Duke of York ushering a young woman out of Epsteinrsquos Manhattan apartment in , a further statement was issued. The Duke, it said, ldquodeplores the exploitation of any human being and the suggestion he would condone, participate in or encourage any such behaviour is abhorrent.Poor Prince Andrew. He is discovering what every child in the playground knows: that you are tarred and feathered with the same brush as those with whom you mix. If one of your gang throws a brick through a window, you are deemed guilty too, evenyou did nothing wrong.In the case of His Royal Highness, letrsquos put aside for a moment the suspicions his closeness to Epstein, following his release from prison, arouse. Bad enough that Andrewrsquos personal contacts are so dodgy they raise serious questions about his judgement, let alone his behaviour.If nothing , these images suggest one of two things: that the Prince was a loyal chum who stuck by Epstein, despite his ruined reputation and the risk it posed to his own. Or that, living as he did in a gilded cage, removed from real le and the consequences of any stupid decisions he made, he was utterly unconcerned about the effect their friendship might have on his prospects. When you are cocooned from birth in a cradle of privilege when you are feted, indulged, and pandered to by sycophants and liggers from the minute you can shake a rattle, it must be easy to believe you are above the normal rules and standards by which society works.Meeting in the park with Epstein was, at best, decidedly odd for someone in Prince Andrewrsquos position. Going to his apartment, however, where a stone satyr presides over the front door, was simply crazy. According to police who raided the property, they seized photos of underage girls. These and the fetishist decor would have led most ordinary visitors to make a swt exit.These images of the Duke of York date from the period when he was acting as British ldquoSpecial Representative for Trade and Investment. A bespoke role for an aimless aristocrat, it gave him licence to roam the globe, meeting fat cats in rich countries and opportunistic states in the hope that some of their wealth would find its way into Britainrsquos Treasury.:In Pictures: Commonwealth leaders gather for state dinnerDuring his deployment as an envoy, Prince Andrew made ious embarrassing ldquomissteps, among them some politically unwise associations. Nothing, however, could compare with being identied as one of Epsteinrsquos cronies, after which revelation he relinquished the post.As the grapevine quivers with anticipation over other high-profile names likely to be found in Epsteinrsquos fat address book, the Dukersquos predicament is increasingly grave. He can hide behind the Palace gates and hope the storm will pass, but this is a story that has been brewing for years. Until certain questions are satisfactorily answered, as far as hersquos concerned it is far from over.Doubtless, it will go against every royal instinct, but would he not be wiser to face the cameras, do an in-depth interview, and silence ndash perhaps even charm ndash his critics  In a situation like this, where unfettered gossip is fuelling supposition, Prince Andrew surely needs to explain his connection with Epstein and help suffocate the scandal. It would, of course, be a historic move. No member of the royal dynasty has ever voluntarily gone on record to put their side of a wildfire story, with the exception of Princess Diana. In her unforgettable, kohl-eyed interview with Martin Bashir, she was more focused on scoring points against Prince Charles than in illuminating her own often dubious actions.Sticklers for Palace protocol might feel sick at the thought of Prince Andrew going public. Even in the hands of the most measured journalist ndash Kirsty Wark, say, or Fiona Bruce ndash it would be viewed as stepping into the lionrsquos den, a suicidally reckless act. Added to which, the Windsors do not explain. They take a long view, recognising that the passage of time usually allows even the most unsavoury episodes to fade into oblivion.In this instance, however, that seems unlikely. So what is worse  Staying schtum, and waiting for more seedy revelations to be added to the blaze, or allowing the Duke to get ahead of the story, and give his version of events By remaining aloof, the Palacersquos response suggests it hopes to avoid further fallout.

After three years trying to explain to bemused voters why Labour is backing Brexittheyrsquore now free to say what they always wanted: Labour is the party of Remain. Itrsquos out of the closet.Twitter trolls have been sent packing. The high priestess of Remain, the rsquos Polly Toynbee, has given her blessing. The hyperactive Labour peer, Lord Adonis, and the #FBPE philosopher, SC Grayling, are singing a duet of ldquoOh! Jeremy Corbyn. Tony Blair has been stunned into silence.However, long-standing Labour Remainers are just a little cautious about this conversion on the road to departure. And with cause. Mr Corbyn remains enigmatic, as always. It is not at all clear the Labour leader is personally planning to back Remain.:Bill for Citizens Assembly consultants nears pound,Moreover, Labour Party policy is still pro-Brexit. Its manesto commits a Labour government to accepting the results of the  referendum and leaving the European Union, ending free movement along the way. A General Election is possibly weeks away, yet an incoming Labour government is committed to negotiating a ldquobetter Brexit deal with Brussels.The new twist is that this new deal would be put to the voters of Britain in a ldquoconfirmatory referendum. But there is no presumption that Labour would campaign in favour of it. Indeed, leading figures like Ms Abbott and Mr McDonnell would clearly call for voters to reject Labourrsquos new deal.Letrsquos work this through: Prime Minister Corbynrsquos first act would be to approach Brussels for renegotiation of the Withdrawal Agreement. This would presumably include the things they wanted to tag on to Theresa Mayrsquos deal: Customs Union, regulatory alignment with the single market, job and environmental protections and so on.Now, there is every reason to suppose that Brussels would accept this new deal with alacrity, since it is very largely the arrangement it has with countries like Norway and Switzerland. Michel Barnier, or his successor, would welcome a prodigal Britain back into the fold. There would no longer be an Irish backstop because there would be no hard border.

And wersquore not giving the referendum question because that would be ldquospeculative.Some in the Labour Party still believe that the ldquoconfirmatory ballot could be Deal versus Remain, excluding any No Deal Brexit. But this would surely be a non-starter. The Electoral Commission would say that such gerrymandering of the franchise excludes too many voters. According to YouGov, more voters are in favour of No Deal Brexit than are in favour of Mr Corbyn becoming Prime Minister.The last time Labour got into a mess like this was over the Scottish referendum back in . Tony Blair did a U-turn on devolution announcing that,the Scottish Parliament was really the ldquosettled will of the Scottish people, as the late John Smith believed, then it should be tested in a referendum. The wrangling went on for months. The hapless Shadow Scottish Secretary, George Robertson, was left trying to explain why there would be one, two or possibly three referendums before the settled will could be determined.:Irsquom a Yes voter, but Irsquom now sick and tired of my own sideHowever, that constitutional imbroglio was nothing compared to Brexit. Scottish home rule was never going to determine the outcome of the  General Election because it was of marginal interest to the vast majority of UK voters. Brexit is the central question that will dominate the coming General Election, and probably the ones after it. Parliament has proved unable to address the question properly, let alone find a satisfactory resolution.If Labour had really intended to pivot to Remain it should have done it two years ago when Parliament debated Article . That legislation made Brexit legally binding, and a No Deal Brexit the default. It was the height of irresponsibility for MPs, led by Mr Corbyn, to vote by a massive  majority to authorise Brexit, on a hard timetable, irrespective of the terms of departure. It was, as the SNP argued, a Brexit blank cheque.Mr Corbyn now says he will do ldquowhatever it takes to stop No Deal Brexit. But this is like waiting till the bus is tipping over the clf before trying to do a handbrake turn. Labour could belatedly have prevented a deal-less departure from the EU by supporting Mrs Mayrsquos Withdrawal Agreement, most of which Labour actually agreed with. It chose instead to walk through the ision lobbies with the far-right European Research Group of Tory MPs.Indeed, Labour could have halted hard Brexit on a number of occasions. It refused to endorse a Norway option, Mrs Mayrsquos deal, or a compromise in the last-minute negotiations with the Government. Mr Corbyn chose to dance around the question, seeking a narrow party advantage. It was all tactics and no strategy and played into the hands of one Boris Johnson.My own view is that Mr Corbyn would be rather content now to see a hard Brexit. This is partly because he has always been a Eurosceptic, but mainly because he thinks Labour could capitalise on the chaos thereafter. When your opponents are making a mess of things, donrsquot get in the way.Itrsquos an electoral gambit, but a cynical one and voters may not go along with it.

The tale of Birmingham gangsters is the show so cool it has viewers, particularly - year olds, the holy grail of broadcast audiences, watching old school style. And they havenrsquot even been told to do so by order of the Peaky Blinders.It is a smart move on the viewers part, and not just because the crime drama created by Steven Knight is riveting television. Anyone who wants a better understanding of how we arrived at this point in political history could do worse than catch up with this Bafta winner. In doing so they will see it is not that far a distance from the dramarsquos central character, the fictional Tommy Shelby, to the decidedly factual Boris Johnson with a stop along the way for Donald Trump.All three, the crime boss, the President and the Prime Minister, show the allure of the charismatic but questionable strongman is one that endures, in some quarters at least.: Labours twists wont halt no deal BrexitIf Mr Shelby is not your era, choose from a list of others, stretching back centuries and across art forms.

At the end of the last series, Tommy Shelby had been elected an MP and was a very rich man to boot. He had come a very long way from the razor blade-wielding, eyeball-slashing hard man who arrived on screen in .: Nicola Sturgeon slated for GERS no showWhile the backgrounds of Mr Trump and Mr Johnson do not compare, it can at least be conceded that they have histories that are not those of your average teacher or accountant.They have edited and enhanced their CVs to achieve the desired result, leaving willing sections of the media to do the rest. Thus has Donald Trump been able to present himself as the great deal maker and businessman despite filing for bankruptcy between four and six times, and how Boris Johnson, sacked journalist and quiz show host, was able to became Prime Minister.Next, each man puts the times in which they live to their advantage. Tommy Shelby has gone from strike-breaker in the Birmingham of the s to Labour MP after the Great Crash. Could Mr Johnson or Mr Trump have come to power at any time other than after the second global economic crisis  Each manrsquos political career has coincided with the rise of the right. Tommy Shelby has played sides off each other , changed his political colours .: Johnson told EU is united in Brexit stanceThey like to have enemies to exploit. Tommy Shelby has had ious, though he tends toevery series to hating an amorphous Establishment. Trump has had Mexicans, the media, and pretty much everyone who crosses him, including, most recently, Mette Frederiksen, the Danish prime minister, who mocked him for wanting to buy Greenland. Johnson has Brussels, elites, collaborators and saboteurs.Third, the presence of charisma. Though we may think each man and his deeds appalling, there are positives to balance the negatives ndash sometimes. All three have a long and eventful histories with women, including multiple wives, and they are fathers. Tommy Shelby does have a wicked sense of humour, though it shows itself only rarely. A certain type of voter might warm to Mr Johnsonrsquos end of the pier Wodehouse act, while Mr Trump has been the source of many a laugh, all strictly unintentional on his part. If you didnrsquot laugh, etc.All suffer from galloping narcissism and normalise behaviour that would previously have been unthinkable among those in positions of power. The words ldquoextraordinary and ldquounprecedented follow them wherever they have gone.Fourth, our gang of three are lucky in their enemies. Mr Trump ran against the deeply isive Hillary Clinton for the presidency, andhe faces Joe Biden or Elizabeth Warren in  his chances of a second term are higher than his Fth Avenue Tower. The only things standing in the way of Mr Johnson achieving a no deal Brexit on October  are political opponents who cannot agree how to take him on, or who should lead the effort.The EU, as his visits to Chancellor Merkel and President Macron will show, is not for budging, thus sealing the UKrsquos fate.Tommy Shelby has had some towering foes who at times have looked like they will get the better of him, but courtesy of Knight, who as writer has the power of le and death over characters, the odds are always beaten.Fth, each has an unshakable confidence in himself. Strategically, they are several steps ahead of their rivals, and their patience is legendary. Above all, they have the ability to convince people to follow them. They do so in the main by reducing everything to basics. Nothing is too complicated. There are no problems that cannot be solved with enough application of Johnsonian ldquooomph, Trumpian stubbornness, or, in Tommy Shelbyrsquos case, sheer brute forcecharm or money cannot do the trick. Politics, le, becomes binary. Out of the EU by October , do or die. Build a wall. Tommy Shelbyrsquos way or the highway.It is here the similarities come to an end. There are too many dferences between Tommy Shelby and his real le political counterparts to make any comparison ultimately fruitless.

While itrsquos unlikely that the worldrsquos men will come to the same sticky end, the female insectsrsquo sht away from having sex to becoming asexual has intrigued researchers who are now trying to figure out how itrsquos happened so rapidly.Read more:Muirfield golf club invites females to become members for first timeThe stick insects originally hitched a lt from New Zealandrsquos north island to the UK on plants being brought to the subtropical Tresco Abbey Garden more than  years ago. They set up colonies on ious sites on the Isle of Scilly off the coast of Cornwall.While it was widely known that the species can be both sexual and asexual ndash with the females producing ready-made fertilised eggs ndash biologists from Massey University in New Zealand found the colony had originated from a sexual group, but they had apparently evolved to no longer requiring to have sex in order to reproduce. As a result, the local population of Scilly Isles stick insects is now entirely female, yet still reproducing.Dr Mary Morgan-Richards, from New Zealandrsquos Massey University, told the BBC: ldquoWe were able to identy a population that had moved from New Zealand to the UK, left behind males, and in just  generations had evolved barriers to sexual reproduction. ldquoJust one or two eggs couldrsquove resulted in the whole population thatrsquos surviving there now.Read more:Drones to count the number of seals living on island of MingulayThe scientists traced the colonyrsquos origins to a specic location and found that despite living in a similar habitat with similar food, their Kiwi cousins continued having sex and reproducing equal numbers of male and females. And, even when reintroduced to their New Zealand counterparts, the UK stick insects retained their ldquono sex, wersquore British patterns of behaviour. ldquoIn just  generations the females had not just become asexual but they actually had a barrier to fertilisation.So even when we brought them back to New Zealand and gave them males to mate with, they still didnrsquot use the sperm. ldquoWe think very rapid switches in reproductive strategy within a single species will help us to understand the advantages to sexual reproduction and why itrsquos so prevalent, she added.The research is said to have presented scientists with several routes for further study, among them whether sex was even a useful process for the species at all when it was clear that the females were perfectly efficient at reproducing alone.But while that would appear to sound the death knell for the male of the species, the news was not entirely bleak. For the team also found evidence of New Zealand populations reverting from being asexual to using sexual reproduction.Dr Morgan-Richards added: ldquoThere are quite a few species that are asexual, we see species of stick insects in northern America and Europe where they are completely asexual. ldquoStick insects tend to be very flexible. Asexuality is rare in multiple cellular organisms, we donrsquot understand why that could be. But there are still lots of examples in nature where you find exceptions to that rule.She added: ldquoThere is huge ersity out there so all sorts of things are possible, there are examples of asexuality in mammals. Anything is possible so humans could become asexual. Itrsquos much more likely that people will clone themselves and mutations could happen that way.

According to the latest figures, , hectares of planting has been undertaken in Scotland in the past year, comfortably beating the current ,-hectare annual target. Last year, , hectares of new trees were planted.The Scottish forestry industry is far outstripping the rest of the UK, with  per cent of all new planting taking place in Scotland. Forest coverage is between  and  per cent, compared with a UK average of  per cent .There are several reasons why Scottish forestry is doing so well.The processes are simpler. The collaborative work between industry bodies like Confor and the Government, streamlining grant support and changing the mind-set of the regulatory system that approves forestry planting, and with downstream industries, have borne fruit. The new woodland creation application process, launched in Scotland in April  following the Mackinnon review, was designed jointly with industry and consultees and aims to help speed things up even further.The policy drivers are there, from climate change to housebuilding and timber security. In Scotland alone, around . million tonnes of CO each year are removed from the atmosphere by our forests, but we are constantly reminded by experts in the field that tree planting alone is not enough to reverse climate change. Our construction and manufacturing industries need to become more sustainable, making more use of timber to sequester carbon through housebuilding, furniture and other projects. At the same time, we have to dramatically increase the availability of local timber, reducing the amount we import to bring down emissions.Read more:Lumberjacks invite audience for Scottish tree-felling expo this summerThere is a sense that, in Scotland, forestry is a priority for politicians, quite dferent to other parts of the UK, with a determination to see it grow and succeed.Political cross-party support gives forestry in Scotland security beyond short electoral cycles, as does the amount being invested in timber markets by sawmills, power boards and energy producers.And the current price you get for forestry and for timber is very good, making it an attractive proposition for investors.A recent amendment of the Climate Change Act  puts the UK on a path to become the first major nation to eradicate its net contribution to climate change by .Itrsquos been said that Scotlandrsquos exceptional potential for planting trees, carbon capture and storage will allow us the possibility of being carbon-neutral by .

Itrsquos also ubiquitous ndash just search social media to see it dealt out in droves to red-faced reactionaries, who in England would be called lsquoa gammonrsquo.But there was always an itch in the back of my mind when I heard the put-down, that I was laughing at a joke which wasnrsquot quite right ndash which was more damaging than it was constructive.The central problem with the jibe lsquoyer darsquo is that itrsquos using something which should be seen as a force for good ndash fatherhood ndash as a vehicle for attacking something thatrsquos bad: the angry, controlling, illogical and domineering voice of a male authority which is presumed not earned. The joke essentially equates fatherhood with Trumpianism.Fatherhood may have been about control and domination throughout much of human history, but for decades most decent men have been trying to change the definition and the image to one thatrsquos about caring, nurturing, love and kindness. Many, many men are uncomfortable with the stereotype that masculinity is about stf upper lips, and not showing your feelings, and endless Darwinian competition, or that fatherhood is only about discipline, that lsquowait till your father gets homersquo nonsense. Certainly, Irsquove been deeply opposed to those phoney and damaging tropes my entire le.Being a father has been the most important part of my existence. Both my children were unplanned ndash happy accidents ndash and fatherhood took me by surprise, but the change it wrought on me was immense. I suddenly found myself transformed through the experience of having children. My bad edges were knocked off and there was no time for selfishness or laziness. A side of me I had always wanted to blossom, blossomed. I found meaning in feeding and singing to a baby, in changing nappies and wiping up puke. I felt more of my real humanity emerge while reading bedtime stories, giving baths, and drying tears than I had at any other moment Irsquod experienced.You could pile up my so-called achievements in le ndash awards, books, degrees, whatever signs of professional success people use to judge themselves by ndash and burn them in my garden and I wouldnrsquot care, so long as you allowed me to say that Irsquod been the best father I could to my two daughters.Not long ago, a male friend, whorsquos also a journalist, wrote a piece which was seen as a little populist. On social media, he started to be referred to as lsquoyer darsquo. Irsquove known this man many years and the one thing I can say for sure about him is that hersquos a great father. He loves his children, and has given them all the emotional support and guidance he had to give. Thatrsquos enough to make him a good man in my eyes, regardless of what he may or may not believe politically.So here was a good and decent father being insulted and the insult used to hurt him was fatherhood itself. Wersquod never do this with motherhood.If we want men ndash all men ndash to changewe want to purge toxic masculinity, eliminate all those hangovers from the Bronze Age to the Victorian era and the swe just want men to be better, then for the love of God, I thought to myself, stop denigrating fatherhood. Fatherhood is the route to a man being a better man.This summer I found myself thinking long and hard about my role as a father. My two daughters both graduated from university in July, and I spent a lot of time with their two boyfriends over the summer months ndash two fine young men who it looks likely my daughters may one day settle down with, and forge families of their own.Their graduations marked the end of one part of fatherhood and the beginning of another. The so-called hard work was done. My we and I had got our children to adulthood, seen them educated, and hopefully raised them as happy young women ready to go off into the world on their own. Part of me felt elated that wersquod succeeded. Part of me felt bereft, as I know this leads to the moment when my daughters leave the family home, and I will be very sad without them every day.Their boyfriends, the young men they will likely move into new houses with soon, also represent a change for me, a time for me to step back a little. Once again, Irsquom one part joyful, one part tearful. If yoursquove defined yourself by your love of fatherhood, an empty nest can be a frightening thing to contemplate.So, the idea of fatherhood being used as a weapon to insult, saddens me. We should be celebrating the gt of fatherhood, not laughing at it. When I was a teenager growing up in Ireland in the s, the insult lsquoyer marsquo was common. It came as an implicit sexualised slur. No-one uses that expression anymore. Itrsquos base, pathetic, sexist. No-one uses the word lsquogayrsquo as a insult anymore, thank God. Motherhood and an inidualrsquos sexuality are things to celebrate, not denounce. But still ndash fathers are fair game.Irsquom not saying donrsquot use the expression lsquoyer darsquo ndash feel free. Do what you like. There will be no demands of the patriarchy from me. But I would say thatyou wish to make the world a better place, and men better people, then be careful of the words you use and the ideas you deploy when you want to take a pop at some idiot guy who deserves it.Now, of course, the irony for me writing this column is that in the era of offence, someone will not like what I am saying, and given my age and my race, though not my political inclination, I am surely ripe for the lsquoyer darsquo treatment.

Now we want to reach out to the public and local organisations theand breadth of Scotland to get their feedback.“I would encourage everyone with an interest to consider the new strategy and to join the conversation. “The consultation is available online but we will also be going out to communities across rural, island and urban locations in the next  weeks where it would be great to hear as many views as possible.”data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"The exhibition-on-wheels is travelling around Scotland highlighting the importance of remembrance.\"  Poppyscotland’s ‘Bud’ hits the road to tell the poppy’s storyviewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\" data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"The review aims to ensure the police service continues to grow and develop.\"  Your views could shape the future of policing in Scotland viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"The strategy aims to protect our climate as well as meeting the needs of its people and businesses.It’s a fine balancing act but the government believes the strategy will tackle climate change, help the economy prosper and improve our health and well-being. There will also be more accountability with proposals for citizens’  and a delivery board.However, the strategy only provides a broad overview of the direction the government is taking, rather than a detailed action plan.Michael explained: “It sets out the direction we will be travelling in for the next  years, with the clear intention that this will not sit on a shelf gathering dust.“The delivery plan, which will be released when the strategy is finalised, will be updated every year to see how much progress has been made on the objectives.“That plan will contain far more detail on what we, as a government, plan to do to meet our targets.”While the government will, of course, lead the way, every Scot has a part to play in the strategy – particularly when it comes to our climate.Michael said: “Scotland has the most ambitious targets for tackling climate change in the world.“The Climate Change Bill, currently before the Scottish Parliament, includes an increased ambition to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, with a net-zero emissions target by .“Transport is currently the largest contributor to Scottish emissions.“This will be tackled through a range of actions including an ambition to phase out the need for new petrol and diesel cars and vans by .“We will promote and design our transport system so that walking, cycling, public and shared transport are promoted ahead of private car use.“However, we also need to help people make the transition to lower carbon travel – to walk or cycle for short journeys,they are able to, or use public transport ahead of single driver car journeys.“That will not only help to reduce car emissions, which are currently responsible for the most greenhouse gas emissions, but will also help people become more active, improving their health and well-being.“There is no doubt in my mind that our climate is changing. The Beast from the East ably proved that.“It cost the UK economy at least £ billion per day as gridlocked roads and no trains or buses meant many workers were unable to get into work.“We are experiencing more severe winter weather, coupled with summers which are hotter and wetter.“That should serve as a real wake up call to us all that we need to change our behaviours now.“Government has a major part to play but we each also have a personal, inidual responsibility to take action to ensure we minimise the impact that we’re having on the environment.“We have to get this right for future generations, given the impact it could have on their lives.”Michael admits that it may be a struggle to wean people away from their cars.For the car remains the dominant mode of transport in Scotland. In ,  per cent of all journeys were made either as drivers or passengers in a car or a van. This was up from  per cent in  and  per cent in .The proportion of single occupancy car trips also shows an increasing trend. The figure of  per cent in  compares with  per cent in  and  per cent in .But with  per cent of Scotland’s greenhouse gas emissions caused by transport, and cars being responsible for the lion’s share, our love affair with the car has to change.It’s for that reason the Scottish Government is moving fast to rid our streets of petrol and diesel cars.The move to electric cars by  – the most ambitious target in the UK – should help meet the emissions target.It has also recently introduced low emission zones in Glasgow city centre, with Edinburgh, Dundee and Aberdeen set to follow.However, with bus trips also in decline, the government has a major job to do in persuading people to change their habits.Michael said: “We need to encourage people to make greater use of public transport.“That, in turn, will help reduce congestion in our cities and towns – as well as reducing emssions.“A double decker bus can take up to  passengers while occupying little more road space than a single car.“Bus use generally has been in decline since the s for a number of reasons, one being longer journey times caused by congestion on the network.“If we can tackle that, people will be more inclined to travel by bus once again.”Technology, both existing and yet to be dreamed up, will also have a role to play.Michael added: “The rail electrication project proves what we can do – we need to be ready and able to introduce new technologies.“However, what people want today and in  years is the same– linking people and places in ways that are reliable, affordable and safe.“Our strategy will be a catalyst for change. “By focusing on our priorities and delivering the outcomes, Scotland will have a transport system that demonstrates to the world that it is open for business.”The strategy opened for public consultation on Wednesday, July , and will close on Wednesday, October .The consultation team will be going out to train and bus stations across the country in the coming weeks to guage public opinion.Members of the public are also being encouraged to have their say online.Visit consult.gov.scot transport-scotland national-transport-strategy to have your say.

Free parking of up to one hour will apply as usual in metered car parks over the winter period.Tankerness Lane will be closed to vehicles throughout the works, with one-way systems in place at ious times on Broad Street and Palace Road — with Victoria Street closed to vehicles for approximately five weeks from  January . Pedestrian access will be maintained throughout.The council has said the key aspects of the Place and Spaces project are to improve the area at the bottom of the Strynd and top of Castle Street, provide a new path to the war memorial to enhance it as a place to stop and reflect on the signicance of the monument and improve the head of Victoria Street to encourage more people into this part of the town.Depute council leader, councillor Leslie Manson, said: “The works carried out in Kirkwall’s town centre through our Townscape Heritage Initiative Scheme have given our streets and buildings a much-needed new lease of le, whether that be improvements to the shop fronts or the attractive new paving at the head of Broad Street.“This latest phase is aimed at improving the entrance to Victoria Street to encourage more shoppers and visitors to take a wander down this street — a long-held aspiration of the businesses that are situated there.“There will, of course, be some inevitable disruption, but we’ve worked hard to ensure that this is kept to a minimum, including suspending works for the Christmas period.

A refurbished and extended museum is expected to re-open during the summer of .Council leader James Stockan said: “This is a project of tremendous signicance for Hoy and for Orkney as a whole.“It has taken longer than we first hoped to get to this stage and it will be excellent for all involved to see work getting underway soon.“I am delighted that, like the council, the project’s external funders remain fully committed to the scheme.“When complete, the restored and extended museum will for the first time in many years open all year round, encouraging more people to visit Hoy and boosting tourism throughout the island.”The museum’s role is to chart Orkney’s military involvement in the First and Second World Wars and provide a safe home for a major collection of wartime artefacts, many of national and international importance.After a competitive tendering exercise, the contract for the work has been awarded to Orkney BuildersLtd.A temporary exhibition on the wartime history of Scapa Flow is on show at the Hoy Hotel while the museum is closed.

The disease can lead to early loss of le, cause preventable sight loss in working age people, and is a major contributor to kidney failure, heart attack, stroke and even amputation, yet the illness is often preventable by adopting healthier lestyle changes.The new Diabetes Prevention Programme is aimed at people who have been identied as pre-diabetic – those who have been tested and have a blood sugar level slightly above the normal range – by their nurse, pharmacist or doctor.Cullybackey patient Thelma Shanks from Cullybackey was referred onto the programme this year. She said: “There is a history of hypertension and diabetes in my family. “Several of my paternal aunts sadly passed away due to complications that came with the disease, and my mum was found to be diabetic following admission to hospital for routine tests. “I was born in London, but grew up in my parent country, Jamaica. I ed to the UK for good in , and my husband and I moved to Northern Ireland, where all my children were born, in . “As a nation, we from the Caribbean tend to be a bit more susceptible to diabetes than others, so it wasn’t a complete surprise to be told I was at risk of developing the disease. “I am also a trained doctor so despite having given up my profession when I had children, I have knowledge of the medical risk.“I have a wonderful busy family le. I have four children, all of which I home schooled, and of course, their needs always came before mine. “When you’re running a busy house and looking after everyone  it’s easy to forget to look after yourself. However, in  when I heard that a health fair was coming to the area I decided to go along. For a small fee they carried out multiple tests which showed I had hypertension or high blood pressure. “I decided to make an appointment with my GP who put me on a number of drugs, first Irbesartan, then Amlodipine and finally a diuretic to bring my blood pressure under control.“I realised I needed to be more careful with my diet and tried to be a bit healthier but I admit it was a bit half-hearted. TESTS“My blood sugar levels were border-line they weren’t going down but they weren’t going up either, so I thought everything was all right. I was having routine check-ups with my nurse at this stage so I was on her radar and having blood tests taken intermittently. In April  I had my regular tests done and then hopped on a plane to London. “It was my daughter’s birthday and I had decided to treat her by going away for the week. We had just made it to the hotel when I received a phone call from my nurse. “She said tests showed my sugar levels were up and I was actually diabetic, which was the wake-up call I needed. Let’s just say it wasn’t quite the luxury week that I had planned! My daughter certainly ate well, but no sugar passed my lips that trip. “Needless to say, I had the blood tests repeated soon after our , and was delighted to learn that due to my dietary sacrices, my blood sugar levels had again receded into the ‘pre-diabetic’ band.“Prior to our trip away, my doctor had called me. She said there was a new Diabetes Prevention Programme starting soon in my area being run by the Public Health Agency. She askedI would be interested and of course I agreed.“The class has  others in it and we meet on Wednesday afternoons. There are eight women and two men, and together we re-learn what we should be eating, what to avoid, and how to step up our exercise routines. “I’ve found it really helpful because everyone is in the same boat and we can share our experiences and encourage one another. “Each week we build on the goals of the previous weeks, paying attention to diet and exercise and gaining strength from each other.“I used to believe that running after a busy family was exercise enough but now I’m walking every other day, trying to increase my pace and my distance. My daughter and I often walk together and I try to keep up with her. LONG TERM“One day I managed , steps in one walk and  of those miles were uphill. I’m trying to make long term changes and make sure these become habits I’ll stick to for the rest of my le. So far I’ve lost  kg, and my exercise levels have increased signicantly too. My blood sugar levels have decreased, but more importantly I feel better physically and psychologically. “The Diabetes Prevention Programme and the team who deliver it have been amazing. I’m looking forward to seeing a new me at the end of the nine and a half month course.”Thelma was referred onto the Diabetes Prevention Programme by her GP Dr Jean McCaughern, Maine Medical Practice, CullybackeyThe practice serves around , patients that live within a six mile radius of the surgery. Dr Jean McCaughern joined the surgery around  years ago and was placed in charge of the practice’s diabetes clinic.At first she managed this alone, today she heads up this specialist clinic with the help of two practice nurses. She does this alongside her normal GP responsibilities.She said: “When I first started the clinic around % of our patients were diabetic and that included those who had both type  and type  diabetes. Today that figure has more than doubled. In  we have a prevalence rate of .%. That’s how quickly the disease is on the rise. “Often patients don’t realise just how serious the illness is. I have overheard patients saying ‘I just have a touch of diabetes’ or ‘I only have diabetes’, but it’s a serious illness which can cause deterioration of vision, contribute to heart disease, kidney disease, stroke, and vascular problems which at their worst can lead to amputation.“Patients of mine have had all these problems and more. The reality is dferent to the perception and it’s only when dficulties start that people begin to understand what living with diabetes can mean. The longer you have the disease, the more likely you are to have any one of those complications.“Having diabetes presents practical problems too. In some cases the DVLA can revoke people’s drivers licensestheythey believe there is poor management of diabetes. This can include raised sugars, but more importantly sugar levels dropping and causing confusion in patients as is would be unsafe to drive.“For some people having diabetes is out of their control. Those with Type  diabetes have no choice but to manage it using medication. “For others who spot heightened blood sugar levels early, termed pre-diabetic, they have a window of opportunity to reverse or delay a diagnosis of Type  diabetes through healthy eating and exercise. That’s who the Diabetes Prevention Programme is aimed at and who it can help.“Once higher sugar levels are discovered, the earlier people can make changes and the higher the chance they have of reversing the outcome. Sometimes, it’s not about changing the diagnosis but delaying it by a decade or so. “The longer you can hold it off the longer you can hold off the complications that come with it. “It’s not all bad news though, having diabetes, whether Type  or Type , is largely manageable either by medication, treatment or diet. “Insulin, used primarily for treating type  diabetes, lowers blood sugar levels when diet and exercise alone aren’t sufficient, but the effectiveness of these medications depends on how early the disease is diagnosed and the size of the dose.“I was happy to get involved in the Programme. Having an interest in diabetes I was approached by the Public Health Agency at the operational stage to look at the programme’s viability in my area. I’m a big supporter. “So far I’ve referred around  people from the practice onto the programme which educates and empowers people of the contents of foods, the need to exercise and develop better eating patterns. “Often I’ve heard people say once they have to go on a special diabetes diet but that’s not the case, it’s just healthy eating, it’s the way we should all be eating.“As far as the success of the programme goes, it’s a little early to tell. The first cohort of people started on the programme in May and early results are positive. Certainly weight loss as a group has occurred and people have more knowledge of food, portion control and exercise.“So, there are benefits for all and for some the course is working really well. When you join the programme as a group you bond as a group, you encourage each other, you don’t want to let your group members down. “That shared experience and cohesiveness is a real motivator and works across all ages and all groups. For many the programme offers them a chance to turn a future diagnosis around and gives them the tools to change their future. “That can be le changing and what the programme is designed to do”.KEY FACTSThe Diabetes Prevention Programme is run by the Public Health Agency.It is aimed at people who have been identied as pre-diabetic – those who have been tested and have a blood sugar level slightly above the normal range – by their nurse, pharmacist or doctor.The Diabetes Prevention Programme is delivered over a nine month period and is free of charge.It is facilitated by health coaches who offer help and assistance to participants, helping them change their lestyle, diet and physical activity with the aim of postponing and even preventing type  diabetes.For more information on the ‘Diabetes Prevention Programmeemail your local Health Trustdiabetespreventionni@northerntrust.hscni.netst  "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_2094373.jpg--.jpg?1566376242000\n","title":"talent galore at music mania event","story":"Broughshane was alive with the sound of music last weekend when the Music Mania event rolled into the village.Local people were given the chance to take to the stage and show off their musical abilities and talents, both with instruments and voice.Many turned out to not only take part, but also to watch on and support those on stage.Bob Esler was the compare for the evening where there was live music on stage from pm with an open mic session and a BBQ proving popular with everyone.

Neils grandmother is in the centre of the centre row.He said: “A good friend of mine owned a bar in Dromore, she gave me an old bottle that said ‘ginger beer’ on it. It was meant as a joke because I’m ginger, but it ended up starting a fascination with bottles.“I started looking into where the bottles were made and background to them.“My original intent was to collect a bottle from every county, but soon I found out there are a lot of bottles out there, probably  known bottles. They are very dficult to find. I would hunt through antique shops, flea markets, auctions and that type of thing. You also pick some up by word of mouth or even dig them up from an old dump site.“My collection ranges from Coleraine to Cork, but a number of local bottles have eluded me. I am aware of bottles from Lurgan, Portadown and Banbridge but am yet to locate these. In particular, the Crystal Mineral Water company in Banbridge produced some fantastic stoneware bottles and it would be the pinnacle of my collection to add one of these.” The bottle from the Crystal Mineral Company in Banbridge that Neil would love to add to his collectionExplaining the history of stoneware bottles, he said: “They were produced during the Victorian era, late s, early s, and were all hand made. No two bottles are the same due to the processes involved, but the minor flaws are what add to their charm. “Historically stone bottles were gradually replaced by mass produced glass bottles, the result of which is that many of these were buried in landfill sites or dumped in rivers and canals and can be dficult to locate.”Neil added: “I’ve always had a big interest in local social history, these stoneware bottles are part of it. I have been working hard in documenting the past so that it can be preserved for future generations. “I have amassed a collection of local items, everything from clocks to water pumps, but there are a few items that I have struggled to find. I am keen to locate any stoneware bottles from Banbridge and anything relating to the Dunbar McMaster spinning mill in Gilford.”He said: “I was born in Gilford into one of the mill workers houses owned by the Dunbar McMaster company and my family were historically mill workers there. I have a fantastic photo of my grandmother working in the mill taken during the Coronation in . I am seeking anything relating to the mill and its history such as receipts, packaging or advertising or even furniture.”Neil commented: “I am part of a local history group, who meet regularly to discuss past events and places and we regularly showcase items so that they can be shared by all.“I would really love to put on an exhibition in Banbridge and that’s probably where this is going.”Open Day raises over £, Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Sadly Neil’s we Kate doesn’t share his enthusiasm for artefacts from the past: “She thinks it’s a load of junk, she’s a minimalist.”If you can help Neil add to his collection email him at neilreid@gmail"},{"url":null,"title":"property magnificent family home on a prime site","story":"Situated on a prime elevated siteoverlooking Coleraine town this superior detached residence, built in , has been finished to the highest of standards.

Whether it’s further education or the world of employment, the important thing is not to panic. There are loads of options available and, as McDonald’s Westwood’s Business Manager Katie McManus can attest, an unexpected road can often be the best one.The -year-old began working in McDonald’s in Glengormley while studying for her A-levels. Aged , Katie had plans of going to University and becoming a Mental Health Nurse, but completely changed direction following her time at the fast food restaurant. “I decided not to go to university and to take a gap year after my exams,” she explained.“I went Crew Member to Sht Manager and then realised that’s what I wanted to do. I got promoted the whole way through to Business Manager. “Personally, I wouldn’t advise anyone to go to university until they know what they want to do. There’s no point wasting the time and money doing it. I would encourage people who are maybe panicking about grades not to worry. There are dferent things out there, and you’re not always taught that in school or given all the options. I never thought I would be working in McDonald’s but the option found me.”She continued: “It’s not what people would assume – it’s very business orientated for me. You’re very driven to work towards targets and it’s competitive. The teamwork and morale is amazing too, you literally feel like you’re with your family away from home.”As well as offering a career, McDonald’s also offers a range of educational and professional development courses to help employees attain everything from GCSE’s to university degree.“There are so many opportunities,” Katie said. “You can constantly get promoted towards Business Manager and then after that you have options to become a franchiser one day, which is a big opportunity butyou really want it you can push for it. “We have people at the minute studying for the GCSEs through our apprenticeship programmes, so they’re getting their Maths and English qualications, which will help them in the future le. Because I didn’t go to university, the option is there for me to do a business degree, which I’m planning on doing next year, so I didn’t miss out on that.”She continued: “I was quite anxious and nervous about making the decision not to go to university. It’s hard to knowyou’re making the right decision at that age. “Looking back, I’m glad it turned out that way. I would say to some of the young ones in here not to panic. Everything happens for a reason and you don’t know what path you’re going to go down until you go down it. GCSE’s and other exams are important, but there are other avenues that you can go down to get dferent jobs.”She added: “McDonald’s don’t really on experience and what you have in your qualications – it’s all about your attitude, your attitude to doing well and how hard you work. “If you are hard working and they really want to make something ofyourself then you should come here.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"glasmullin green standoff continues into second day","story":"PROTESTORS have ed to Glassmullin Green amid a stand off over plans by De La Salle College to build a new sports facility on the site.Work was due to begin the £.million project yesterday, but campaigners moved on to the green in a bid to block the development.Contractors Haffey Sports Grounds left the site yesterday following an intervention from the Friends of Glassmullin Open Green , who have campaigned to protect the space since .Residents resumed their protest this morning.Aithne Kerrigan from FOGOG has accused De La Salle College of acting “in bad faith from the outset”.“They have said that they have tried to engage with residents – they haven’t,” she said.“They held an open night at the start of April and they only managed to get seven people across their doors, four of which were definitely objectors. They told us at a meeting in April that they would keep us informed by email, but we have yet to receive an email from De La Salle to inform us that the work was going to start. They basically think we’re going to go away, but you know what  – we live here, we’re not going to go anywhere.”A spokesperson for De La Salle said the school had engaged in“considerable consultation” and modied plans three time to benefit its pupils and “the whole community”.“The school has kept the community in touch with developments as the contract process drew to a conclusion including leaflet drops and an open evening in April to present and view final design plans. A meeting with residents followed shortly after the open viewing evening. The school also indicated that with tendering administration nearly complete the work would start by the summer. Following notication from the successful contractor the school provided details to residents immediately about the contract start arrangements. We also advised local political representatives.”The spokesperson added: “The school has already invited residents to participate in a Management Committee to minimise the impact of any potential disruption to residents during the construction phase and to oversee the usage of the new facilities which will be available to the whole community next year. During the open viewing evening, at subsequent meetings and in written communications residents have been encouraged to join the Committee.“We remain committed to working with the local residents during the construction phase and thereafter.”FOGOG maintain that the pitch will be detrimental for the people of the area.“There’s going to be a major loss access to open green space,” Ms Kerrigan said.“There’s a covenant on this green. It should be protected for everybody. It shouldn’t be fenced off for exclusive use, not to mention noise pollution, lighting pollution, the additional traffic to this area, but fundamentally the loss of open green space. Glassmullin green is precious to the residents, it’s precious to the community.“We don’t have access to open green space in West Belfast. This is the last open green space in West Belfast and it should be protected for this generation and the next. We lost it before when it was Silver City, and we’re not prepared to lose it again.”She added: “We’ll do what needs to be done to protect Glassmullin Green. We’ve campaigned since  and we’re not going to stop now.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"portrait honour for campaigner raymond","story":"A PORTRAIT of a local victims campaigner has gone on display as part of an exhibition by an artist who believes he embodies the true spirit of the north.The painting of Raymond McCord is among  by artist Shauna Fox that have gone on display at the exhibition in the Sea Holly Gallery in Hill Street.Shaunawas born in Bangor but is now based in London, where she is studying fine art painting at Camberwell College of Arts.

His answer was Newtownabbey man Raymond, who became well-known for his work as a victims campaigner after his son, Raymond Jnr, was murdered by the UVF in .Shauna explained: “Raymond McCord is a victims’ campaigner and he’s a man I’ve always admired – an archetypal Ulster man, brave, unrelenting and he believes that the only way we can deal with the past and move forward isboth communities deal with it together.“My work focuses a lot on ethical issues and human rights. I have explored the destruction of Aleppo by barrel bombs, the oppression of women in relation to honour and sacrice and the Troubles in Belfast.“I studied Ethics at school and from there I became interested in humanitarian and ethical issues. I knew my peers knew little of the atrocities, injustices and inhumanity being carried out at home and abroad on a daily basis and so I based my artwork around these issues in an attempt to raise awareness and present my thoughts, views and responses to them in an innovative and stimulating way.“This body of work is mainly based on my experience of living in Northern Ireland for  years, moving to London and then looking at it from afar. Moving away has made me interested in finding out more about where I’m from, but the more I discover about where I’m from, the more I question whether it’s somewhere I can be proud of and want to live in again.”Raymond said he was “honoured” to be featured in the exhibition.“It is an honour to have a portrait done. I never ever dreamt something like this would happen to me. Unbelievable. I can#t thank the artist enough.“The portrait itself will be dedicated to my son young Raymond and the rest of the innocent victims and in particular to the many from North Belfast. This is for all of us in both communities.”Shauna’s exhibition runs until August  at the Sea Holly Gallery in Hill Street."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"youve got to love lunch at the lansdowne","story":"IN recent weeks, the North Belfast News has covered much that the brand new Lansdowne Hotel on the Antrim Road has to offer.Back in the day, the establishment was the place to go and thanks to a recent refurbishment, its new owners are hoping to restore its glory days. From  stylish bedrooms, a stunning bar with an extensive drinks and cocktails menu and even an eye-catching garden and bridal suite, the Lansdowne has it all.As for grub, the Lansdowne caters for diners from AM to PM and a recent Thursday lunchtime visit for myself and two colleagues offered us the chance to sample some dishes from their lunch menu.The menu is made up of light bites, small plates and main plates so your choice depends on just how hungry you are and how much time you have. We were greeted and shown to our table by their new yet welcoming staff and joined for lunch on this occasion by co-owner Jim McLaughlin who took little time in doing the work for us by selecting some of his favourite and most popular dishes from across the lunch menu. Jim’s background is in food, so we had no hesitation he would deliver the right goods to the table.It wasn’t long before our huge selection of grub arrived in front of us and left us with the question, where to begin We were served three main plates – the larger courses on the Lansdowne lunch menu. First up was the simple yet classic Chicken Caesar salad – a generous portion of sliced chargrilled chicken mixed in with maple-cured bacon lardons, baby gem lettuce, garlic focaccia croutons and lashed with parmesan shavings drizzled in Caesar dressing. Often known as the not so healthy salad option for dieters, it would have been rude not to try this classic and spoonful after spoonful, the smorgasbord of flavours really came out. The next main plate was the duck confit, served on a bed of sweet potato mash, green beans with a dash of herb butter and red wine jus. For me, it was quite the standout dish and as a duck lover, it hit all the right spots from the crispiness on the outside to the easily torn-off meat on the inside, all brought to le by the sweet potato mash and red wine jus.The last of the main plates was my colleague’s definition of heaven – a huge pot of steamed mussels in garlic and white wine cream and served with rosemary and red onion focaccia bread. A massive lover of all things fish, the silence at the table was noticeable as she made her way through the portion, which, priced at just £, could easily be shared amongst two.Also served up on this lunchtime occasion was a selection of small plates which are proving the most popular choice od customers, according to Jim. Small plates are exactly what they say on the tin and take a form similar to Spanish tapas, meaning they are ideal to share. Customers can choose  for £,  for £ or  for £ so whether you want a nibble over a drink or simply can’t choose and need to try a few, the world is your oyster at the Lansdowne.For me, the stand-out small plate was the crispy pork belly with a layer of caramel apple sauce. Pork belly is one of my favourite things and, having previously worked in a Chinese restaurant, I am all too familiar with it and this did not disappoint.Another triumph was the firecracker chicken wings, served with a blue cheese dip. The wings were a perfect combination of a fiery wsoon overtaken by the wonderful dip – I would highly recommend.The brie also deserves a paragraph to itself because it was simply mouth-watering. A crispy shell was soon followed by the delicious melted delight that is brie but the dish was really taken to the next level by the homemade blackcurrant gel and it is not dficult to see why it is the most popular side dish order, according to Jim.Also served to us on small plates was the crispy beef: large chunks of beef brisket which were cooked to perfection and beautully seasoned with pickled carrot and a tastebud tingling Asian dressing which ensured the beef inside the crispiness was moist and melting.The deep fried salt and chilli squid was equally as good and something I also adore – well, anything salt and chilli really. The squid was fresh, fried expertly and served with a napa salad, harissa mayo, coriander and sesame seeds, it would put some Chinese restaurants’ attempt at the dish to shame.The small plates were a huge success on our visit and enjoyed in the impressive surroundings of the stylish bar, for me it was exactly how ‘bar food’ should be – in fact, it was on another level. I cannot wait to try some of the other small plates which include spicy Italian meatballs, crab bruscietta and sweet potato bhajis. The main plates were mighty fine too and maybe with a cocktail or two the next time. I am already looking forward to planning my next lunchtime visit to the Antrim Road’s famous stalwart.

idea that more people here would rather remain closely aligned with the EU than the UK is in no way reflective of the community he represents.The survey carried out by Belfast-based polling and market research company LucidTalk asked people how they would vote in a referendum proposing that Northern Irelandremained aligned to the European Union, \"perhaps staying in the single market and the customs union\".Read MoreDire Brexit warnings of no-deal listed in leaked document dismissed by DUPAlex Kane: Boris Johnson could be tempted by Brexit backstop only for Northern IrelandCorbyn: Brexit

the idea.However, Sir Jeffrey questioned the level of support for staying aligned with the EU indicated by the LucidTalk poll, saying it contrasts with the views of his constituents in Lagan Valley.\"These polls by LucidTalk I dont think accurately reflect opinion,\" he told the Belfast .\"Their polling methods are not reflective of the wider community, especially on the unionist

position of opposing the backstop and protecting links with the United Kingdom. data-dfpadtargetingMartina Anderson\"We believe that it is not in Northern Irelands best interests, economically or in

world, including the EU combined, so I dont think it is a credible or rational approach that we should create barriers between ourselves and what is by far our biggest market.\" However, nationalist politicians said the poll is an accurate reflection of public opinion in Northern Ireland and comes as no surprise.An overwhelming number of nationalists opted for closer alignment with the EU, with % of Sinn Fein and SDLP voters who responded to the poll backing the Northern Ireland only backstop.Sinn Fein MEP Martina Anderson said the survey reinforces her view that more people would prefer a united Ireland as a means to staying within the EU than a potentially catastrophic crash-out.\"Opinion poll after opinion poll has shown that the majority are in support of a pathway back into the EU,\" she said.\"I think we need to acknowledge that the vast majority of people in the north voted against Brexit.\"If faced with the choice, they would prefer an enhanced border in the Irish Sea.\"Ms Anderson added: \"If unionists are surprised, they dont have their finger on the pulse of the people that they represent,\" she said.\"The majority of the people quite clearly dont want to

A number of options for mitigating the impact of this are on the table but its \"not going to be pretty\", a source said. Checks will be at the \"point of origin or destination, so the factories or ports\" a European Commission source said, adding there would be \"leeway\" in the days after the UK crashes out.Relations between the UK and Ireland were further strained yesterday by an extraordinary pre-planned attack by Mr Hogan on Prime Minister Boris Johnson whom he said was \"unelected\" and \"gambling\" with the Good Friday Agreement. Tanaiste Simon Coveney ruled out bilateral talks with the UK, accusing Mr Johnson of trying to \"steamroll\" Ireland with \"new red lines\".Mr Hogans speaking points for an event near the border contained strident criticism of Mr Johnson. Although he did not utter them at the event in Louth, they were circulated with the tacit support of the EU leadership. \"The UK Government needs to take responsibility for its choices before it is too late. Prime Minister Johnsons hero is Winston Churchill and he seems to view himself as a modern day Churchill,\" Mr Hogan stated. \"However, in the event of a no-deal Brexit, the UK Governments only Churchillian legacy will be: Never have so few done so much damage to so many.\"The growing expectation that a no-deal Brexit is on the cards was underlined by Mr Coveney, who said it was now \"far more likely\". He said \"limited checks\" would take place away from the border. Mr Hogan said checks \"could be at point of origin or at point of destination\". He said % of exports from the UK to Northern Ireland come through Dublin Port and are already automatically checked, but he raised issues around what would happen in Belfast, Larne and Warrenpoint ports. \"Its about the controls and checks to reassure the consumer that the quality of the product, whether its product safety or food safety or whatever, they have to get reassurance in mainland of Ireland or the mainland in Europe and in mainland of the United Kingdom, whatever,\" Mr Hogan said.Without any deal there will be an onus on the Republic to protect the integrity of the single market. An all-island regime for sanitary and phytosanitary checkson animals would help to do this, commission sources said, but such an agreement may not be possible in a crashout scenario. Agri-business, including many beef farmers, will be devastated by the reversion to WTO tarfs once the UK becomes a third country. But Mr Hogan insisted there would be up to €bn in financial support for the EU agriculture sector. \"Theres ongoing negotiations and discussions about all scenarios and were ready. We have  pieces of legislation approved in the European Union and we have  pieces of legislation that are approved by the UK,\" he said. \"We have to work together to ensure that we have a seamless transition towards ensuring that theres not major disruption for peoples lives.\"Officially, the European Commission has refused to sayDublins plans to carry out checks away from the border would satisfy its EU obligations. \"Only the regulatory and customs alignment provided for under the backstop allows for maintaining the status quo on the island of Ireland,\" a spokesman warned."},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article38421911.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/2008192-_Read-Only_.jpg","title":"1000 children on waiting list yet trust returns half its funds for","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The British government’s own analysis has predicted signicant disruption to integrated supply chains across this island rendering cross-border trade in our agri-food sector virtually impossible for many operators. It has also warned that the open border that has underpinned our political settlement would be unsustainable within months.It is our view that the progress made in developing integrated and enduring relationships on this island, politically, economically and socially, over the last  years is far too important to abandon. Particularly at a moment when those relationships are being tested.With that in mind, and with no ing Executive or Assembly currently in place in Northern Ireland to give expression to the democratic wishes of people here, we write to you to confirm our support for the backstop contained within the Withdrawal Agreement and Political Declaration. It is our view that a legally operable guarantee to protect the Good Friday Agreement, maintain north-south co-operation and preserve the all-island economy and to prevent ato physical infrastructure on our border or physical checks at or near the border is necessary to preserve the progress that we have made.We trust that the approach adopted by the European Institutions to defend all that we have achieved will continue in the weeks ahead.The letter was signed by:Colum Eastwood MLA, Leader of the Social Democratic and Labour PartyMichelle O’Neill MLA, Assembly Leader and Vice President of Sinn FeinNaomi Long MEP, Leader of the Alliance PartyClare Bailey MLA, Leader of the Green PartyChris Lyttle MLA               Mairtin O Muilleoir MLA            John Dallat MLAMaire Hendron MLA       Orlaithi Flynn MLA                           Sean Lynch MLAGerry Kelly MLA                Alex Maskey MLA                           Jemma Dolan MLANichola Mallon MLA       Fra McCann MLA                             Colm Gildernew MLACaral Ni Chuilin MLA       Pat Sheehan MLA                            Mark H Durkan MLAPaula Bradshaw MLA     Stewart Dickson MLA                     Raymond McCartney MLAClaire Hanna MLA            Caoimhe Archibald MLA                Karen Mullan MLAPat Catney MLA                Conor Murphy MLA                        Emma Rogan MLA          Trevor Lunn MLA             Philip McGuigan MLA                     Colin McGrath MLALinda Dillon MLA              Steven Agnew MLA                         Kellie Armstrong MLAEmma Sheerin MLA        Stephen Farry MLA                         Dolores Kelly MLAPatsy McGlone MLA       John Blair MLA                                  John O’Dowd MLACathal Boylan MLA          Declan Kearney MLA                      Maoliosa McHugh MLAMegan Fearon MLA        Sinead Bradley MLA                        Catherine Kelly MLAJustin McNulty MLA        Sinead Ennis MLA                            Declan McAleer MLADaniel McCrossan MLA"},{"url":null,"title":"psni boss wants hundreds of new officers no return to","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

They also claimed that the deceased Creggan man suffered further injuries as he fell to the ground on a laneway outside St Marys Church in the estate.However, Seamus Bradleys family repeatedly maintained that he died later having been taken away from the scene in an army saracen and sustained fatal injuries whilst being subjected to torture during interrogation.The Coroner, Judge Patrick Kinney, however ruled out both versions of the events at Laganside Court in Belfast last Thursday . The judge said he was satisfied that Seamus Bradley was killed by a soldier who got out of a Saracen, fell to one knee and opened fire, but added that he had been unable to identy the soldier responsible for the shooting.“He was running across an open area of ground, he had no weapon and he was clearly visible,” Mr Kinney said.The Coroner also concluded that the deceased man could not have reasonably been percieved as posing a threat of death or serious injury to the soldiers in the Army vehicle nor to anyone  and that the use of force by the soldier was “entirely disproportionate to any threat that could have been perceived.”Furthermore, Mr Kinney said, there was no first aid or medical assistance provided by the soldiers, butit had been there was a “reasonable prospect” that Seamus Bradley would have survived. The judge also concluded the victim was not mistreated by British Army personnel in the Saracen either by physical assault, torture or shooting.Seamus Bradleys brother Danny who has pursued the case for decades told the Derry News: “First of all I would like to make a statement referring to my brothers first inquest in . The prosecution showed a black and white picture to the jury and then turned to my father and called him a liar and said your son was not tortured.“This same man was aware that there were coloured pictures showing that Seamus neck was badly marked and which the black and white images failed to show.“Seamus was stripped naked and badly beaten about the face and shot three times at close range. At the original inquest one soldier claimed that Seamus fell out of the Saracen onto his face, but the army medical officer said that never happened.“Sadly, the police at the time did not show the Bradley family any of the pictures and it took to  for the police to show nine black and white pictures. Then in  the Coroners office showed us  coloured pictures. It can be safely be said that both the black and white and coloured pictures went missing to save the security forces embarrassment.”Danny Bradley also told the Derry News: “I have mixed emotions but I achieved what I set out to do. That was to clear Seamus name and thats what matters. Its not about me.”“I also intend to send the Inquest report to the Irish Government as well as the independent ballistics report because this was a war crime. My brother was a soldier, a volunteer in the Provisional IRA. His papers were logged under war file by the British Government and they have broken the Geneva Convention becuase they had declared war on the IRA.“By doing so they must take responsibility for and due care of their prisoners and I will be asking for a proper investigation-something which the state failed to deliver in .”In  the former Historical Enquiries Team in their examination of the Bradley case concluded that the British Army,they were telling the truth, had acted lawfully with respect to his killing, but added that the death had never been “effectively investigated.”Sinn Féin MLA Raymond McCartney Justice Spokesman welcomed the Coroners Court decision and said: “The Bradley family have been campaigning for the truth about what happened to Seamus for many years.

Half-a-century on, this week has also seen contention and disturbances surrounding the Apprentice Boys of Derry annual parade in Derry-the very same demonstration that was the focal point for the beginning of serious violence exactly  years ago.But, whilst the events of August  in Derry without doubt played a pivotal role in shaping the following decades, in a wider context it was just one episode amongst many more fraught historical events of the last  years.The decade between - was undoubtedly one of the most consistently eventful in Ireland throughout the twentieth century.Within those ten years the country went through the campaign for Home Rule, World War One, the Easter Rising, the Irish War of Independence, partition, the Irish Civil War and the foundation of the Irish Free State and Northern Ireland. Added to that were campaigns for social change exemplied by the  Lockout and the suffrage movement.In combined effect, each of these hugely momentous events left no strata of Irish society untouched or unscathed by the violence that emanated from them. And, the historical shockwaves of some of these events, most particularly partition, also shaped future events in Northern Ireland that literally exploded onto the streets in the late s.In the Republic of Ireland concerted efforts have been made in recent years to make this decade of centenaries more inclusive and tolerant and respectful. The civic remembrance of those Irish men who fought and died on the British side in WWI has grown for example and the previously unthinkable visit to Dublin by an English monarch has taken place.Republican leaders once sworn to end Queen Elizabeth II’s reign in Northern Ireland by any means necessary have greeted her with handshakes and smiles. Uncomfortable conversations around these events have also taken place.In the North, still three years away from the conclusion of this decade of th anniversaries, there is the looming prospect of how the creation of Northern Ireland will be dealt with by nationalists and republicans.The outward signs at least are of course currently not good, encapsulated as they are by the ongoing absence of Stormont. Overlapping it all is the fact that in the North the events of  years ago are beginning to come full circle into the realm of major time passed milestones.So, half-a-century after the Civil Rights movement rocked the foundations of the Northern state to their core, how have we dealt to date with the commemoration of seminal historical events north of the border Professor Peter Shirlow is Director at the Institute of Irish Studies at University of Liverpool and was formerly Deputy Director of the Institute of Conflict Transformation and Social Justice at Queen’s University. He has undertaken conflict transformation work in Northern Ireland and has used his knowledge to work with former combatants and non-governmental organisations in Yugoslavia, Moldova, Bahrain and Iraq.“I think we have dealt with these issues in ways that have shown a lot of maturity, especially when it came to commemorating .“There was a lot of stretching beyond previously comfortable positions and remembering for example the children and the Royal Irish Constabulary who were killed and a realisation that conflict is just not about the commemoration of those who were on ‘your’ side. We are also beginning to look at women in this period who were made invisible.“There are many ways in which to understand what happened and they are a lot more erse than we have been told, but we haven’t yet built this into ways of how to deal with our past,” Peter Shirlow said.The insistence within each community that their version of the stories of the past are the ‘righteous’ versions has been at the root of inter-communal stre even decades after actual conflict has ceased. Heroic versions of the past are something that Peter Shirlow says that as a society we need to look beyond. He added that his research has indicated that Northern Ireland’s dferent cultures are not necessarily converging on that issue as yet.Professor Shirlow is also the Independent Chair of the Office of the First and Deputy First Minister Employers’ Guidance on Recruiting People with Conflict Related Convictions working Group.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshHe told the Derry News: “I have found a very strong sense in the Protestant Unionist Loyalistcommunity that the conflict is finished and there’s a need to move on. They don’t want to engage because there’s a sense it’s in the past, that it’s over.“More people in the PUL community seem to have drawn a line under it-that it was  years ago, so there’s a reluctance to engage. A lot of loyalist prisoners came out and went back to work and don’t appear to have the same fascination with the Troubles.“The republican view of that is they believe loyalists do not want to engage because they are ashamed. It’s not a practical or a sensible view.“I’ve done a lot of research within Protestant working-class communities and there’s some acknowledgement of history, some reverence for Edward Carson and a degree of asking where we are going, but not a lot of interest in looking back at what happened during the Troubles.”The academic also said that he senses with the nationalist and republican community a need that their narrative of events “must be proven right.”So, the Derry News asked Peter Shirlow about how things will pan out when the centenary of the creation of Northern Ireland arrives It’s an issue he believes which still very much reverberates within the political sphere today.“The issue of partition is part of the inter-party talks at the minute. We will have to decide whether Northern Ireland is a ‘good place’ or a ‘bad place’.“We tend not to concentrate on what we have done well. Culturally we are globally renowned-from Van Morrison right through to Snow Patrol’s Crashing Cars being the most listened to song of the st century so far. In terms of sport we recently hosted The Open and we have names such as Rory McIlroy, Graeme McDowell and Darren Clarke, but we don’t use what should symbolise the positive aspects but concentrate on the fractious issue of conflict. It makes us forget how globally regarded we are,” he said.Professor Shirlow also contends that the all invasive aspects of one-sided commemoration also often obscure the stories of human bravery and kindness that took place during the conflict.“There are stories of the Troubles where many people put their own lives in danger to save others. I know someone in Ardoyne who took a policeman into their home and him to stop him being killed. It stops the appreciation of victims being someone’s mother or father, son or daughter. And, I’m sure it’s the same in Derry.“Commemoration doesn’t look at a lot of le experiences or the fact that people on both sides took risks to help protect each other. Commemoration can largely be about the self.”The Derry News also asked Peter Shirlowhe thinks that at specic times, political parties push their ideas of commemoration onto their prospective voters to purposefully polarise communities “There is part of it that is a response to ‘your’ community and that symbolises that these events have power and politicians are sometimes trapped in that. But, of course parties will use that for their own ends.“If we united on issues like the health service, education, employment and the environment perhaps there wouldn’t be such a focus on identity. However, there are signs that people are exploring other ways to move forward,” he said.CAPTION: Professor Peter Shirlow, Director of the Institute of Irish Studies at the University of Liverpool."},{"url":null,"title":"special creggan performance dedicated lyra mckee","story":"A special all-female performance of a play written by esteemed Irish dramatist Brian Friel took place in Creggan yesterday in memory of Lyra McKee.Art Over Borders’ th Lughnasa FrielFest paid tribute to the young writer and journalist who was killed in the city with a free performance of Brian Friel’s  play The Enemy Within.Two performances had been scheduled to take place in two churches, St. Columba’s Church of Ireland in Omagh, Friel’s birthplace, and All Saints Church of Ireland in the Waterside Derry on Saturday.However, festival organiser Arts Over Borders unexpectedly announced the additional free performance in Creggan.The Enemy Within is centred around Columbas room or cell in the Autumn of , on the island of Iona, off the West coast of Scotland.The entire play centres around issues such as ‘Who am I’ and ‘To whom am I connected ’Published in , Friel wrote the play connecting it to the social troubles at the time.Columbas enemies were not only limited to his inner self, but also to his own family. Even though he had left Ireland, presumably for good, his family held an immovable grip which crippled Columba in his work on Iona.This pressure contributes to the inner struggles Columba is forced through in several parts of the play.Yesterdays performance on the last day of the four-week festival was dedicated to the memory of Lyra McKee who was shot dead during rioting in the Creggan area on April  of this year.Her partner Sara Canning was invited along by the organisers. Derry born festival co-curators Sean Doran and Liam Browne felt it was appropriate and timely to honour the memory of Lyra McKee with this all-female world premiere presentation.Speaking to the Derry News, Mr Doran said: “Our international Brian Friel Festival is jointly held in Donegal and Derry, with the Derry location now celebrating the playwright’s more socio-political plays and themes of justice, gender and ethnicity.“To complement the Lughnasa FrielFest Donegal, Here I Come! we have given the title of OVERCOME to Derry’s Lughnasa FrielFest in recognition of Derry’s ability to continually overcome its challenges and to resonate  years on from the Civil Rights marches of  that were directly inspired by the Black American Civil Rights movement.“The Black spiritual singers Ruby Philogene MBE and Tayo Aluko will join the casts of Brian Friel’s The Enemy Within and The Freedom of the City offering sung preludes and interludes to the Omagh and Derry performances.”Mr Browne added: “We had the pleasure of working with Lyra previously when she kindly agreed to be part of a discussion  in our Home of St. Patrick Festival in Armagh in . On that occasion she explored the particular challenges that face young women today, the pressures to reveal, issues around identity, privacy and such.“The subjects which Friel explored throughout his work of gender, poverty, ethnicity, isolation and spirituality mirror the themes which also concerned Lyra and about which she wrote.”googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh"},{"url":null,"title":"llandrindod man mike complete last ever six marathons birthday","story":"Mike Hodges with one of previous marathon medals.

Then I got a local engineer to sandblast it and paint it so that is was like new and that cost another few thousand.ldquoThe rest of the cost will be spent on the build and the fit out inside. I reckon that even after we live in it for a while, it would still retain some valuewe wanted to sell itwe decide to travel again or rent it out. I see the cost as the equivalent to three yearsrsquo rent and itrsquos money not wasted as we still have something at the end of it.The tiny home concept mdashnormally one bed studio-style homes mdash has become popular for people looking for a simpler way of living in locations that they can change and without tying themselves down to massive mortgage.Michael, who is from Whiterock, and Alex, who is from Saintfield, discovered the concept while travelling and living in a small van in New Zealand for a year.ldquoI had been aware of tiny houses before we went to New Zealand and over there it is really popular, explained Michael. ldquoThey really are everywhere. Seeing how people live in these tiny houses inspired me that it could be done here too.ldquoWe lived in one of them during our time in New Zealand and loved it. It did simply our lives and it was a bit more sustainable which is a big thing is for us.ldquoWe donrsquot like the idea of renting for the next few years or being tied down to a mortgage and this allows us to be flexible, plus it is a bit adventurous.The couple, who first began to date after getting together at their leaving formal at Down High School, have designed their home with a galley kitchen with sitting area, a small shower room and loft bedroom in a building that is six metres long by . metres wide and . metres high.The house should be finished in time for Christmas and is kept near Lisbane where the couple try to work on it every day.Michael, a design engineer graduate, and Alex, who graduated in textile and design, are both working part-time jobs at the moment in order to devote themselves to the build.Michael said: ldquoWersquove done all the work ourselves in order to save money and to gain more skills. The exterior is nearly finished so we will be moving on to the interior soon.ldquoRegarding installing the utilities, some have pretty easy solutions and some are more dficult. As we would like some flexibility as to where we can park it, we donrsquot want to plug into mains electricity or the sewerage system, so the shower will be a standard shower with an instant water heater. Any grey water from the sink or shower will be probably be handled by some kind of natural filtration.Michael and Alex donrsquot yet know where they will site their home when it is finished but hope to place it on land owned by friends, or to rent out a field.They say that part of the reason to build their tiny home is financial, but also down to the way of le that living in such a small space brings with it.Michael said: ldquoWe like to do something more meaningful with our money and prefer travel experiences. We would rather not spend loads of money on a sofa mdash we would prefer to go travelling.He added: ldquoI would love to convert a camper van and go around Europe. I really donrsquot see the sense of buying up stuff and would rather have experiences that I would remember more.The couple want to have a cosy feeling to their home but not something too modern.Like caravans or boats, space is at a premium in a tiny house and Michael has designed stairs up to their loft bed so that extra storage can be built in.ldquoWe donrsquot have that much stuff which is good. Often when people do move into these small houses they find it dficult to get rid of a lot of stuff, he added..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Call for play park upgrade  ","story":"MOTHERS in Ballynahinch are demanding that immediate improvements are made to the play park in Hillfoot Crescent.The women claim that due to vandalism and a lack of maintenance, the play facility is in dire need of an upgrade and is not fit for purpose to serve the needs of local children.The members of Hillfoot Crescent and Windmill Residents Association also say that the play facility is long overdue for some general weed tidying up by Newry, Mourne and Down Council which is responsible for it.A large group of women and children held an open meeting at the park last Thursday and invited local councillors to attend to see at first hand the poor state the park has declined into.Rowallane councillor Terry Andrews told the mothers, grandmothers and children that Hillfoot Crescent was one of three local parks due to be upgraded by the council within the next two years.However, while Ursula Jess, secretary of Hillfoot Crescent and Windmill Residents Association, welcomed the news, she said that the association would still be pressing for some interim improvements.ldquoItrsquos good to hear that a new play facility upgrade is supposed to be in the pipeline but we need something done between now and then, she said.ldquoWe urgently need it upgraded as therersquos no summer seats and parents and minders either have to stand or sit on the grass to keep an eye on the children and itrsquos not good enough. The seats were burnt one by one years ago and never replaced sowe were to get summer seats between now and the upgrade, it would be helpful.Mrs Jess said that Hillfoot Crescent got a Lottery grant in the late s to install the park and over the years broken equipment has not been replaced.She added: ldquoItrsquos a massive park with a lot of potential. We still have some tyre swings, a climbing frame, a slide and baby swings. There used to be a basket ball hoop but that is away now.ldquoItrsquos all been down to vandalism and general wear and tear. When the little elephant rockers were broken, the council just came and took them away but they werenrsquot replaced.She said that the play arearsquos summer seats were only replaced on one occasion after local vandals burnt them and had have not been replaced for years.Mrs Jess said that the community has done its best to keep the play park safe by sweeping away any broken glass and rubbish and have raised money for equipment in the past.The play facility caters for a large numbers of families at Millbank Grove Windmill Gardens, Windmill Drive, Windmill View, Carlisle Park and further afield, added Mrs Jess.Cllr Andrews said that he welcomed the residentsrsquo invitation to come along and to find out about the play facility.He said: ldquoThe play facility at Hillfoot Crescent serves a big catchment area with new developments being built in recent years.ldquoI was very impressed by the excellent turnout of parents, neighbours and children to convey their frustrations, worries and concerns about the condition of the existing playground here and the sense of being forgotten about.ldquoThey are calling for an upgrade to state of the art play parks that others in the Rowallane District Electoral Areahave been supplied with in recent times.ldquoI was able to tell them that Hillfoot Crescent is included in the line-up for an upgrade to new state of the art equipment.ldquoI will be lobbying and supporting this call at council level for this much-needed new play park to go ahead speedily along with those for Darragh Cross and Kilmore.The councillor said the council will encourage local residents and children to have their say and input into the new playground.He was presented with a heart-felt plea from the children for their park to be improved which was written as a poem and presented to him.It read: ldquoOur park is dying, itrsquos so sad, No one cares that it looks so bad.A lick of paint a bench or two, A modern slide area all overdue, So come on Council what do you say  Help us out and let us play..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Call to clean up Mary Street area of Crossgar  ","story":"CALLS have been issued for a clean-up of the Mary Street area in Crossgar.South Down MLA Colin McGrath and Rowallane councillor Terry Andrews have highlighted the need for the work to be carried out following a recent visit to the village.Mr McGrath mdash who was in Crossgar along with Cllr Andrews to listen to residentsrsquo concerns mdash is keen to see a resolution to the issues in Mary Street.ldquoPaths at this part of the village have become very poorly neglected and a dumping ground for some, the MLA explained.ldquoThis is totally unacceptable at a location adjacent to residentsrsquo garages and homes and the issue needs to be addressed as soon as possible.Mr McGrath suggested that the Mary Street problems are indicative of a wider issue people and groups across the country are going to have to get to grips with mdash determining who is responsible for certain pockets of land.He continued: ldquoBy the time it takes to actually determine ownership of areas, the issue could have been sorted multiple times over.

The remaining minutes of the half were played at a hectic pace with some tremendous play on show.Sheila McGrath and Greville handed Westmeath a three-point lead before Mallon and Dowdall swapped points as the game entered added time.However, Down had the bit between their teeth and three inspirational scores from Finnuala Carr, Aoe Keown and Mallon brought the sides level at - to - with time practically up.Westmeath were not to be denied a first half lead and a converted Greville free sent her side in at the break with a hard-earned - to - lead.The second half was every bit as competitive with Down again dominating the share of possession, but they continued to struggle to put that advantage to good use.Frees from Greville and Mairead McCormick and a magical strike from McGrath suddenly had Westmeath - to - ahead after  minutes.Down went for broke and minutes after Mallon and McCormick exchanged points, the predatory Saoirse Sands struck with venom when she netted after taking control of a Fionnuala Carr free.Paula Gribben reduced the deficit to two points before Greville and Mallon again exchanged scores. Mallon was unerring in front of the posts and with four minutes remaining she left a point in it after scoring from play.Unfortunately, McCrossan took advantage of two more Down wides from frees when she gave her side a - to - lead with two minutes of added time played.Sara Louise Carr kept the pot boiling with a th point for Down, but this was the last score of the game as the referee blew the final whistle on the resumption of play.Down: M McNally, N Kelly, A Savage, C McGilligan, C Rocks, D Magee, K McMullan, A Keown , P Gribben , S L Carr , D Savage, S McCartan, N Mallon , C McGourty, F Carr .

Within hours, the three Belfast brothers were back in Newcastle harbour where anxious relatives awaited news of their ordeal.Philip Sharp and his brothers Johnand Markhad left Minerstown Park Caravan Site wearing only trousers, pullovers and with only two lejackets between them. They started to fish about  yards offshore, but it was when they decided tohome that they hit trouble.They struggled to make any headway against the strong outgoing tide. ldquoWe just drted further and further away until the shore was just a haze, Philip said.They did not realise, as they drted six miles out to sea, that the alarm had been raised and the Newcastle leboat was on its way to their rescue, along with the helicopter..ldquoThe helicopter circled over us until the leboat came, Philip continued. ldquoThey took us on board and gave us hot soup and a tot of rum.ldquoI donrsquot think we have ever been so glad to see anyone in our lives.

He fired one shot straight at the lsquokeeper, one went wide and a cross which narrowly evaded everyone in the box.Killyleagh did prove menacing and in the th minute nice link up play between Charlie Holland and Darren McConnell allowed him to release Jamie Sharvin, but he hot straight at lsquokeeper, Mark Hynes.Thomas Healy was next up for the Whites in the th minute. John Murray won possession on the half way line and drove through midfield, linking with Neale, who released Healy on a one-on-one with Hynes, but the stopper stayed upright to deny him.Rosario were happy to let the YC play in front of them and hit on the counter and their best chance in the first half fell to Conor Murray after some clever link up play with Michael Johnson. However, his driven shot ended safely in the arms of YC goalkeeper Aaron Carberry.The visitors then had their best chance of the half in the th minute. Neale did well to hold off a defender and release Healy on the edge of the box, but his shot was fired just over.Both teams changed formations in the second half and Rosario really started to create some great opportunities.The game sprang into le when Johnson was put through one-on-one with Carberry, but once again the lsquokeeper stood up and made a smart save, with Murray missing the rebound.In the th minute Rosario were awarded a penalty.

Earlier this year, a planning application was submitted to formally designate the area as a car park for council vehicles and staff cars as well.Concerned residents who live nearby and Downpatrick councillor Dermot Curran expressed opposition to the move, describing the unofficial parking area in front of the remains of the townrsquos former workhouse as an ldquoeyesore, highlighting the noise created by heavy refuse vehicles starting up in the morning.Council officials say they have sold part of the existing Strangford Road site to the Education Authority to pave the way for the development of Down Highrsquos new multi-million pound campus.They explained that part of the land which has been sold to provide a new main entrance to the school includes an area which is currently used for council staff parking.The local authority is seeking planning approval to develop remaining land at the front and side of the old workhouse to provide parking for staff and its fleet of vehicles.In papers submitted ahead of todayrsquos planning meeting, it is confirmed that  homeowners who live close to the Strangford Road site were informed about the car park proposal, with some expressing concern about the impact it will have on property values.Concern was also raised about vehicle engines starting as early as .am, particularly at weekends, with those opposed to the planning application insisting that commercial vehicles should not be parked close to residential properties.Outlining their reasons for recommending that the planning application should be approved, planners admit that the car park plan will impact on the remains of the former workhouse which is of special architectural and historic importance.However, they confirm that the Department of Communities Historic Environment Division accept the parking plan in principle, provided the scheme respects the character of the area, suggesting that ldquosoft landscaping between banks of spaces with a low wall constructed to the western boundary.ldquoThe site is well established as the former Down Council offices, with a refuse depot to the rear, the planning papers continue.ldquoThe area has been used for staff parking with this application to formalise the arrangement with staff parking to the front and small vans to be parked at the side. The works proposed will aim to upgrade the existing frontage and use hardstanding to provide a more formalised parking arrangement.Planners say the existing land is to be regraded and resurfaced with low walls and have confirmed that external lighting also forms part of the proposal, with the current entrance set to be widened and new gates installed. Hedge planting is also proposed to help screen some of the activities to the rear of the site.Signicantly, the planning papers spell out clearly that the new parking at the front of the site will be laid out for vans and staff vehicles, not refuse vehicles. Planners also insist the application does not represent a change of use to the site.The papers continue: ldquoThe application proposes to relocate staff parking to the site of the formerly demolished council administrative building and use the other side of the car park for some additional fleet vehicle parking, with designated parking spaces marked and circulation routes displayed through the site.ldquoThe proposal will not impact any more signicantly in terms of residential amenity as to what is already there at present.Planning Committee members will also be told today that as part of the sale of council land at the Strangford Road to the Education Authority that there will be a two-hour daily traffic restriction over the use of the existing main fleet access to the site for local authority vehicles.Council vehicles will not be permitted to use the entrance between .am and .am and between .pm and .pm, with planners explaining this clause was ed into the contract of sale with the Education Authority on the grounds of child safety to ensure students could not be injured by council vehicles.In addition, planners say it is anticipated that most council HGVs and bin lorries will be off site by .am, but that a few may not be, requiring the need for an access through the site to the Strangford Road.

The current problems should not have come as a surprise to anyone, especially international observers.John Cushnahan, a former Alliance Party leader and Fine Gael MEP, who was European Parliament Rapporteur on Hong Kong -, after Hong Kong was handed back to ChinaThe Sino-British Joint Declaration of , under which Hong Kong was handed back to China in , guaranteed the autonomy of Hong Kong in all areas apart from defence and foreign policy.It also guaranteed that its ‘common law’ legal system would remain in place as would the independence of its courts..ev-modals .modal.in .modal-dialog .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget .photo-article-notier-default .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p @media.photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p #jp .main-content .ev-widget#sticky-footer .sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner p @media@media#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_text,#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_button #sticky-footer .fluid-container #sticky-footer .mobile-sticky-footer_button However over the last  years China has been consistently undermining these rights. Regrettably too few international voices were raised in opposition to China’s blatant breach of its obligations under the ‘one country, two systems’ concept. It would seem they preferred to remain silent lest it jeopardise their lucrative trade deals with China.In marked contrast however, the citizens of Hong Kong did not remain silent. The latest demonstration is but one in a series of protests that challenged the actions of the Beijing controlled Hong Kong government . There were two major protests before the current one over the proposed extradition bill.In  , when the Hong Kong government introduced an anti-subversion bill, it was regarded as a step too far by its critics who perceived it to be an attempt to suppress political freedoms and human rights and make Hong Kong more like mainland China.Over , people demonstrated its opposition.

This, coupled with the feedback from the schoolchildren we work with through our community outreach programme, was enough for us to want to do something about it.ldquoWhatrsquos a girl to do follows Ellie as she sets out on her quest to be an engineer ndash but the road isnrsquot easy. Her classmates think shersquos odd, her best friend, Flo, doesnrsquot understand, her brother says she canrsquot, and her grandad is behaving strangely. Ellie doesnrsquot want to give up on her dream and the book seesshe can make it in a world that can be so negative.Penarth author Alison Powell has been involved from the projectrsquos beginning and helped bring Ellie and her family and friends to le.Ms Powell said: ldquoWhen I was approached I was delighted ndash as a mother of two children, I know how important it is to re-enforce positivity through all aspects of le, to challenge stereotypes and ensure they know they can strive for any career they choose, regardless of gender, race or orientation.Evan, a year two Rhws Primary pupil, said: ldquoI loved the bit in the story where Ellie got a job. People didnrsquot think she could be an engineer, but she proved them wrong. We can do what we want when we work hard.Whatrsquos a girl to do  will be distributed to schools across the area and copies from the initial print run, funded by Tarmac Cement and Lime, can be requested by emailing kara.bennett@tarmac article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Ms Parker and Mr Glover met several years ago when he trained her at their local gym. They then ended up unexpectedly working together later in le when Mr Glover changed jobs.Mr Glover said: ldquoIt was very tough for Julie before the transplant as she suffered with a genetic lung disease and her lungs slowly stopped working over a few years.\"It got to the point where she required an oxygen tank to be strapped to her back so that she could breathe. She never gave up and still worked and tried to do as much as she could and always kept a smile on her face.Ms Parker has a rare condition called Alpha--antitrypsin deficiency which means she lacks a protective enzyme inhibitor which makes her more vulnerable to smoke, dust and other toxic materials and increases the risk of lung disease. Because of the deficiency, Ms Parker was required to have a double lung transplant. Shortly after the transplant Ms Parker went to lunch with Mr Glover and he was amazed at how well she looked.He said: ldquoBecause I was seeing her every day, I knew her health was declining as a result of the lung disease. But I donrsquot think I was so aware of the extent until I saw her after the operation, and how healthy she looked.This isnrsquot the first challenge Mr Glover has taken on.In the past he has carried lbs up and down the highest mountain in Southern Britain, completed car dead lts and successfully performed  pull ups.The pair now plan to walk Pen-Y-Fan, the highest mountain in South Wales, together to raise money in the future once Ms Parker is well enough.Mr Glover set out to raise pound, and has now raised pound.Officially, Mr Glover had only  days to train for this challenge, enlisting friends to help him by sitting in the car and steering as he tows.ldquoI was getting up at :am to run around car parks towing the car with a harness before work,\" he said. \"I love setting myself challenges but donrsquot tend to do what everyone  does. So I will look for something a bit far out or invent my own and usually try and document them on video.All the proceeds from the day will go towards the charityrsquos Harefield Transplant Appeal, to raise funds for organ care systems to allow more patients to receive le-saving transplants.If yoursquod like to support Mr Glover in his marathon challenge his Justgiving page is: https:www.justgiving fundraising muscleworld article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Two-year-old Matilda Philpott who has Stickler Syndrome was joined by her two brothers, Oliva and Alfie, four-year-old Alice Haswell who has Goldenhar Syndrome camped out with her sister Scarlet, and -year-old Daisy Stacey who has Vacterl Association attended with her sister Molly.The weekend saw the families take part in a range of activities from archery, crafts and pop rockets to laser shooting, fire lighting, bush craft and raft making.The camp was the first time the referred children have been on a Scout Camp, something leaders have been hoping to achieve since the start of the group.Ruth Weltch, Group Scout Leader said: ldquoThe opportunity to regularly set up camp in the great outdoors is one of the main reasons young people enjoy Scouting so much and we wanted to give our children, who would not normally have the opportunity, the chance to take part in a weekend of outdoor activities and to sleep under canvas with their families.ldquoWe have been overwhelmed and humbled by the amount of help offered by leaders, not just from Cardf and Vale Scouts but from other scouting areas in Wales.This reflects the scope of the hospice itself which is open to all children with le limiting illnesses throughout Wales.ldquoWe have been able to give these children the opportunity to take part in activities not usually accessible to them and that we take for granted. It was an absolute joy to see them and their families take part in the weekendrsquos activities, seeing them smile and forget about their worries for a while was heart-warming.Lynne Phelps, from Ty Hafan, said: ldquoThe hard work, time and effort put in by the Scout Group since its inception has been truly amazing. The group has brought so much happiness to the hospice and given the children referred to us an opportunity to take part in activities with their families that they wouldnrsquot have had access toit wasnrsquot for Scouts.ldquoThe group has had a really positive impact not just on the children in our care, but also their families and our staff. We really canrsquot thank the Ty Hafan Scout Group enough.The Ty Hafan Scout Group was set up on the Scouting Centenary in  for any child referred to the hospice along with their siblings, parents and family, to spend time together having fun and making memories.A growing need for sibling involvement was soon recognised and so the group began to run regular sibling camps.The sibling camps have given the young people who have brothers and sisters in the care of the hospice the opportunity to attend events such as Scarefest and the Jurassic International Jamboree, as well as the chance to spend quality family time with their loved ones.ScoutsCymru gives over , young people in Wales the opportunity to enjoy fun and adventure while developing the skills they need to succeed, now and in the future.Open to all young people in Wales regardless of faith, gender, sexual orientation, race or social background, the movement encourages its members to do more, learn more and be more. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

has joined forces with Councils in Northern Ireland in a bid to prevent dogs dying in hot cars this summer and to raise awareness on summer safety for our canine friends.Just a few minutes in a hot car can prove fatal for dogs and yet every year animal welfare charities and the police receive thousands of reports of animals being left alone in cars on warm days.That’s why together with Dogs Trust, Councils across Northern Ireland are running ‘Summer Fun for Cool Canines’ events as part of the Dogs Die in Hot Cars campaign, to raise awareness about the dangers of leaving dogs in hot cars and to provide dog owners with practical tips to keep their dog cool and safe this summer.Laura McAnea, Campaigns Manager at Dogs Trust, said: “Many people still believe that it’s OK to leave a dog in a car on a warm daythe windows are left open or they’re parked in the shade, but the truth is, it’s not.“A car can become as hot as an oven very quickly, even when it doesn’t feel that warm and a dog can die in a hot car in  minutes. When it’s  degrees outside, in a car it can reach an unbearable  degrees within the hour.“We are delighted to be working with Local Authorities to raise awareness of the dangers of this and to try and prevent the heartbreak and distress caused when a much-loved family pet suffers, or dies, because they have been left in a car on a summer’s day.”Dogs Trust advise thatyou see a dog in distress in a hot car, call your local Animal Welfare Officer who will liaise with the PSNI to organise the rescue of the dog. This will help ensure the dogs can be removed from the car as quickly as possible, in a safe and legal manner.Signs of heat stroke in dogs include heavy panting, excessive drooling, vomiting, being drowsy and uncoordinated and collapsing. Dogs Trust advise that to help a dog in this condition, place them in the shade, pour small amounts of tepid, not cold, water onto their body, help them to drink small amounts of tepid water and once their breathing has settled, call the nearest vet.You can find out more about caring for dogs in the hot weather on the Dogs Trust website at https:www.dogstrust.org.uk news-events issues-campaigns
