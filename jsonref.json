He added: \u0027The backstop in its current form will not prevent a hard border. It will create it.\u0027  ALEX BRUMMER: Why the EU always haggles like an aggressive market trader… then CAVES IN  Long before the British people voted to leave the EU in the referendum, before the term Brexit had even been coined, it was Grexit that was preoccupying the minds of Eurocrats.Greece came close to crashing out of the single currency on at least four occasions after a vast black hole opened up in the country’s accounts in 2009.At one stage, in 2012, the British banknote printers De La Rue was asked by the government in Athens to make contingency plans to print new drachma notes (Greece’s pre-euro currency) in preparation for what many called the ‘Double D’ solution to Greek economic problems – default on the country’s debt and devaluation with the return of the drachma.Today, Greece remains one of the 17 members of the eurozone – and that fact alone should lift Theresa May’s spirits as, armed with her newly acquired parliamentary majority, she returns to Brussels seeking at the very least to put a time limit on the backstop deal she signed up to for the Irish border.Each time a Greek default loomed into view, threatening the stability of the eurozone and raising the possibility that Italy or one of the other member countries might also head for the exit, the main protagonists – the hard-line German-dominated European Central Bank (ECB) in Frankfurt and the European Commission in Brussels – caved in and authorised a bailout.    President of the European Commission Jean-Claude Juncker (left) and the European Chief Negotiator for the United Kingdom Exiting the European Union Michel Barnier (right)Last-ditch negotiations, usually conducted over a weekend when the financial markets were closed, would typically stretch into the early hours.Late-night deals were hatched against a backdrop of TV screens showing central Athens on fire and anti-austerity protesters ripping up flagstones in the capital’s Syntagma Square.The first £38billion bailout was agreed in the dead of night on April 23, 2010, by the troika of the ECB, the European Commission and the International Monetary Fund. It was one of several rescue packages for Greece, some of which required a change of government to get them over the line.What happened to Greece is typical of the Eurocrat tendency to fudge, to muddy the waters and eventually to seek compromise in a crisis situation.Indeed, the history of the EU is littered with examples of Britain locked into eleventh-hour talks with eurocrats as the UK has sought changes in our terms of membership.John Major worked through the night in 1991 to secure Britain’s opt-out from the social chapter of the Maastricht Treaty which would have dictated working conditions in Britain and could have undermined the labour market reforms pioneered by his predecessor Margaret Thatcher. Indeed, she was a fierce negotiator in organising rebates from Brussels from the UK’s oversized contributions to the EU budget.In 1984, in the imperial grandeur at the historic palace of Fontainebleau in France, European leaders painfully conceded the famous British EU budget contribution rebate – or, as the French sarcastically called it, ‘le chèque Britannique’.          A new poll reveals voters support May going for talks with the EU but only one in three believe she will be successfulAnd let’s not forget that in the teeth of his promise to hold an inout referendum, David Cameron returned from Brussels in the early hours one day in February 2016 with draft reform proposals agreed by European Council President Donald Tusk which he claimed would give Britain ‘special status’.In the event, the pledges made by Brussels were so anaemic that they failed to convince British voters that sovereignty could be maintained by voting Remain – a huge mistake by the eurocrats who failed to recognise the strength of anti-EU feeling among large swathes of the UK population.Both in national negotiations and in commercial transactions, reaching an accord more often or not comes down to the wire. Today, with the clock ticking inexorably to March 29, the desperation of the leaders of the other 27 EU countries to avoid an economic and financial crisis at the very moment that Germany and the eurozone are facing the bleak prospect of recession may be Theresa May’s best hope.This is regardless of how unyielding Brussels negotiators have been to date and their willingness to play havoc with business confidence and financial stability by its brinkmanship.The potential loss to Brussels of a £39billion one-off payment to a Commission cash-starved following years of economic slowdown, could potentially be a bargaining chip for the Prime Minister in the last-chance saloon.In the final analysis, as veteran witnesses of the late-night sessions in Brussels, Nice, Maastricht and other destinations tell me, it’s mainly Germany and, to a lesser extent, France which decide.Besieged by increasingly hostile populist movements, neither Berlin or Paris will want to make political life tougher than it already is.The politics of the EU, at their most raw, are little different to those of the bazaar. The natural tendency is to relish an aggressive haggle but then to compromise – eventually.   "},{"url":null,"title":"Ups downs life bookshop Chinese store leaves customers stairway literary heaven","story":"    The mirrored ceilings give the illusion of the room never ending much to the amusement of the many hundreds of visitors every day          The stairways which travel up and down, across the rooms, are as attractive to visitors as the thousands of books on the walls          The modern library now attracts as many visitors hoping to photograph it as it does book lovers hoping to find a new read          Photographers stop in the centre to attempt a perfect shot at the bookstore which is packed with optical illusions and even an enchanted mushroom forest for children           Mirrored ceilings give the impression of the book shelves being double the height.

Marine litter can have a devastating effect on our wildlife with animals, birds and fish feeding on it or getting trapped in it.‘We have already eliminated plastic from our disposable cups and cutlery, but we know we all need to do more, so we are working to phase out single-use plastics at our places by 2022.‘Our regular beach cleans with visitors and volunteers do help significantly, but we need everyone to take responsibility and take their litter home.‘We find particularly high levels of littering around car parks and main roads, and on our tenant farms too.‘Anything we can do to encourage people to act responsibly and take their litter home is a very positive thing.’Greenpeace UK added its support to the campaign. Paul Morozzo, political campaigner at the organisation, said: ‘The Great British Spring Clean is a fantastic initiative and demonstrates the huge public enthusiasm to stop the flow of plastic pollution into our oceans.          ‘But the Government must do more to pull its weight. Setting clear reduction targets for single-use plastics and introducing a plastic bottle return scheme would cut the amount of plastics being used in the first place, and result in less waste polluting our streets, rivers and beaches.’The charity urged Environment Secretary Michael Gove to stop ‘dragging his feet’ and to introduce clear targets for reducing plastic waste.Further support came from politicians across the country yesterday.John Grogan, the Labour MP for Ilkley in West Yorkshire, said he will write to schools and community groups in his constituency to take part.He said: ‘I am regularly contacted by Ilkley residents for whom littering is a concern. The Great British Spring Clean offers the community an opportunity to tackle littering head on while also bringing people together from across the town.’Nigel Huddleston, the Conservative MP for Mid Worcestershire, tweeted that he ‘hoped to see lots of #litterheroes out and about in Worcestershire when the campaign kicks off on March 22’.The Daily Mail has long campaigned against the scourge of plastic in the environment. We helped put pressure on politicians and businesses which led to the introduction of charges on single-use plastic bags and the ban on toxic plastic microbeads in cosmetics.Last year we helped to organise the Great Plastic Pick Up, in which more than 20,000 volunteers cleared litter over a single weekend.To sign up to the Daily Mail\u0027s Great British Spring Clean campaign, visit gbspringclean.org "},{"url":null,"title":"Government vows ban children young 12 social media caught knives","story":"    Home Secretary Sajid Javid on the Tulse Hill Estate, in south London, after he unveiled new Asbo-style orders designed to tackle spiralling knife violenceThe face of bloodbath London: Agonising moment parents try...Teenager arrested in hunt for knife killers of boy, 14,...Share this article    Nedin Bilgin, 17, has become the eighth person to be killed in London this year.

Paul Morozzo, political campaigner at the organisation, said: ‘The Great British Spring Clean is a fantastic initiative and demonstrates the huge public enthusiasm to stop the flow of plastic pollution into our oceans.‘But the Government must do more to pull its weight. Setting clear reduction targets for single-use plastics and introducing a plastic bottle return scheme would cut the amount of plastics being used in the first place, and result in less waste polluting our streets, rivers and beaches.’The charity urged Environment Secretary Michael Gove to stop ‘dragging his feet’ and to introduce clear targets for reducing plastic waste.Further support came from politicians across the country yesterday.John Grogan, the Labour MP for Ilkley in West Yorkshire, said he will write to schools and community groups in his constituency to take part.He said: ‘I am regularly contacted by Ilkley residents for whom littering is a concern. The Great British Spring Clean offers the community an opportunity to tackle littering head on while also bringing people together from across the town.’                                                                                        To sign up to the Daily Mail\u0027s Great British Spring Clean campaign, visit gbspringclean.org                                                      Nigel Huddleston, the Conservative MP for Mid Worcestershire, tweeted that he ‘hoped to see lots of #litterheroes out and about in Worcestershire when the campaign kicks off on March 22’.The Daily Mail has long campaigned against the scourge of plastic in the environment. We helped put pressure on politicians and businesses which led to the introduction of charges on single-use plastic bags and the ban on toxic plastic microbeads in cosmetics.Last year we helped to organise the Great Plastic Pick Up, in which more than 20,000 volunteers cleared litter over a single weekend.

Here, Beth Hale reveals the stories behind some of the iconic frocks on show.The creation fit for a princess   She called it her ‘favourite dress of all’.And in the flesh, the fabulous fairytale gown Princess Margaret wore to mark her 21st birthday — both her birthday party in August 1951 and portraits — is indeed a dress of dreams.While the diaphanous skirt is not quite as voluminous as photographs suggest and the colour an off-white rather than the lighter, brighter colour of the famous Cecil Beaton photographs, the dress is the kind of flouncing, bare-shouldered perfection that little girls imagine when they dream of princesses (although Margaret’s father George VI was rumoured to have disapproved of it).          Royal Portrait of Princess Margaret on her 21st birthday by Cecil Beaton in a dress designed by Christian Dior, part of the Christian Dior: Designer of Dreams exhibition at the London attraction which runs from February 2 to 14 JulyThe differences are not due to any deterioration in fabric, but rather that the colour version of the portrait was actually painted.Even in the Fifties photographers were not averse to a little creative license.With a waist of miniature proportions (no measurement is provided, but it has to be less than 20 inches), the gown shows quite how petite the princess was.Dr Luke says Lady Gaga accused him of rape to win an Oscar...JANET STREET-PORTER: Sorry, Piers but I\u0027m with Will Young -...Could the queen of clean turn me into a domestic god?: MARK...Share this articleMargaret’s son, Lord Snowdon, was at the V\u0026ampA gala dinner to celebrate the exhibition and gave a toast, recalling how surprised he was to find his mother’s dress in the show. He said: ‘I had never seen it before and couldn’t believe that it has survived all these years and been conserved.‘Interestingly, the Cecil Beaton photograph of her shows the dress looking white when in reality it is between cream and beige. It was moving to see the dress that she wore all those years ago with its tiny waist and extraordinary lines, typical of Dior who made such a genius contribution to fashion.’          Princess Diana arrives at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City. Diana was attending the Museum\u0027s 1996 Costume Insitute gala, a tribute to the achievements of designer Christian DiorLord Snowdon, whose wife Serena was dressed in Dior, added: ‘This is an important exhibition for Britain, with an Anglophile designer who showed such elegance and eloquence in fashion design.’Dior admired Princess Margaret’s style, describing her as ‘so very charming’.‘She was a real fairy princess, delicate, graceful, exquisite,’ he would later write. In 1957, Dior presented the princess with a signed silk scarf in appreciation of her support, while she was a loyal customer for years.Gown almost too daring for Diana It was 1996 and Princess Diana walked into the biggest event on the fashion industry calendar in a dress that was at once ravishing and racy.So racy, in fact, Diana very nearly didn’t wear the dress to New York’s Met Gala for fear Prince William, then 14, wouldn’t like it being so revealing.Brit John Galliano had just been appointed creative director at the fashion house, and designed the dress for Diana before turning his mind to his first collection.A navy silk slip dress, with lace straps and edging, it had more than a hint of the boudoir about it and was a bold choice from Diana, who was then 35.She stopped the fashion crowd dead in their tracks, Liz Tilberis, editor of Harper’s Bazaar, would later write.A statement look for every star  From Margot Fonteyn to Jennifer Lawrence and Emma Watson, the house of Dior has dressed stars in abundance.At the start they were drawn to the designer’s famed Bar suit — part of his 1947 ‘Corolle’ collection. Crafted from shantung silk, crepe wool and taffeta, it has become one of the brand’s most iconic pieces.  Dior’s successors have continued to dress the brightest stars, including Natalie Portman in Hollywood last year (left) and Nicole Kidman in a beaded gown at Cannes (right)Ballet dancer Dame Margot Fonteyn was one of Christian Dior’s early muses and the exhibition features two dresses she wore, including a 1950 evening gown named ‘Debussy’, made of silk satin with hundreds of dragonfly sequins.Dior’s successors have continued to dress the brightest stars, including Natalie Portman in Hollywood last year.           Naomi Campbell pictured in Dior in 1997There’s also the silk confection Jennifer Lawrence wore to a film premiere in September 2017, a beaded gown worn by Nicole Kidman in Cannes  — and many more.Fashion firebrands who kept his name alive   A string of illustrious names followed in Dior’s footsteps.First came a 21-year-old Yves Saint Laurent, whose early designs were so strikingly similar to his illustrious predecessor that when he sent them to French Elle magazine, the then editor thought it was Dior playing tricks.Next came Marc Bohan — he assumed the helm until 1989.Italian Gianfranco Ferré became the first non-French artistic director, until 1996 when controversial Brit John Galliano took over — supermodel Naomi Campbell is pictured in one of his typically flamboyant designs in 1997.His reign came to a rather ignominious end when he was sacked in 2011, paving the way for Raf Simons and finally Maria Grazia Chiuri, the second Italian and first woman, appointed in July 2016.Anglophile and his blue-blooded fans   Christian Dior first visited the UK in 1926 and was something of an Anglophile. He admired the grandeur of Britain’s great stately homes and gardens, as well as British-designed ocean liners, roast beef and Savile Row suits.Dior’s chic little black suits of the 1940s and 1950s were beloved by the British aristocracy, and muses Nancy Mitford and Margot Fonteyn both ordered his 1947 ‘Daisy’ suit.Mitford wrote to her sister Diana Mosley later that year, of Dior’s second collection: ‘Now I’m nearly 50 I’ve decided to choose a style and stick to it and I choose Dior’s present collection. Simply, to my mind, perfect.’          Christian Dior (left) became an Anglophile after visiting Britain in 1926 and his suits were beloved by the British aristocracy           Charlize Theron has been the face of J\u0027Adore by Dior since 2004‘I adore the English,’ Dior wrote in his memoir.‘I love English traditions, English politeness, English architecture, I even love English cooking!\u0027I dote on Yorkshire pudding, mince pies, stuffed chicken, and above all I worship the English breakfast of tea, porridge, eggs and bacon.’Sweet smell of success    A clever marketer, Christian Dior was a fashion pioneer in more than one respect: he launched a perfume line in 1947, the very same year of his first collection.He very quickly created lipsticks, introduced hats, shoes and even stockings — wanting to provide a ‘one-stop’ service for his well-heeled clients.Latterly, Dior’s perfumes have had a gold theme.In 1999, the fashion house launched J’Adore, a perfume celebrating Christian Dior’s love of glimmering gold.Since 2004, the face of J’Adore has been actress Charlize Theron.The Hollywood beauty has appeared on screen and in print in a series of ever-more dazzling gold gowns, several of which are on display at the V\u0026ampA.They include fashion designer John Galliano’s J’Adore dress from 2008, which was adorned with sequins and Swarovski crystals.Dove - the most bought soap brand in the United KingdomLittle ladies and gents who attend etiquette lessons graduateWoman shows how to fold clothes using the KonMari methodMeghan is pretty in peach as she visits the National TheatreMeghan Markle arrives at the National Theatre for royal patron debutDuchess of Sussex leaves National Theatre after official engagementDuke and Duchess of Cambridge arrive in Dundee to open V\u0026ampA MuseumKate Middleton makes a speech and officially opens V\u0026ampA Dundee museumQuecha\u0027s parka is designed to keep you warm in any weather conditionAdorable girl can’t resist touching Kate’s locks in DundeeJess Phillips: \u0027I thought I\u0027d met posh people before I came here\u0027Father-to-be discovers he has lymphoma by googling symptoms"},{"url":null,"title":"How litter pick swimsuit","story":"Ghirardelli changes its popular Chocolate Squares packaging...Share this article  TRAVELLING BAGS FROM FIRE HOSES In 2005, Kresse Wesling was at an environmental meeting with the London Fire Brigade when they told her that all their old hoses, which are made of nylon, went to landfill.

President of the European Commission Jean-Claude Juncker (left) and the European Chief Negotiator for the United Kingdom Exiting the European Union Michel Barnier (right)Last-ditch negotiations, usually conducted over a weekend when the financial markets were closed, would typically stretch into the early hours.Late-night deals were hatched against a backdrop of TV screens showing central Athens on fire and anti-austerity protesters ripping up flagstones in the capital’s Syntagma Square.The first £38billion bailout was agreed in the dead of night on April 23, 2010, by the troika of the ECB, the European Commission and the International Monetary Fund. It was one of several rescue packages for Greece, some of which required a change of government to get them over the line.What happened to Greece is typical of the Eurocrat tendency to fudge, to muddy the waters and eventually to seek compromise in a crisis situation.Indeed, the history of the EU is littered with examples of Britain locked into eleventh-hour talks with eurocrats as the UK has sought changes in our terms of membership.John Major worked through the night in 1991 to secure Britain’s opt-out from the social chapter of the Maastricht Treaty which would have dictated working conditions in Britain and could have undermined the labour market reforms pioneered by his predecessor Margaret Thatcher. Indeed, she was a fierce negotiator in organising rebates from Brussels from the UK’s oversized contributions to the EU budget.In 1984, in the imperial grandeur at the historic palace of Fontainebleau in France, European leaders painfully conceded the famous British EU budget contribution rebate – or, as the French sarcastically called it, ‘le chèque Britannique’.          A new poll reveals voters support May going for talks with the EU but only one in three believe she will be successfulAnd let’s not forget that in the teeth of his promise to hold an inout referendum, David Cameron returned from Brussels in the early hours one day in February 2016 with draft reform proposals agreed by European Council President Donald Tusk which he claimed would give Britain ‘special status’.In the event, the pledges made by Brussels were so anaemic that they failed to convince British voters that sovereignty could be maintained by voting Remain – a huge mistake by the eurocrats who failed to recognise the strength of anti-EU feeling among large swathes of the UK population.Both in national negotiations and in commercial transactions, reaching an accord more often or not comes down to the wire. Today, with the clock ticking inexorably to March 29, the desperation of the leaders of the other 27 EU countries to avoid an economic and financial crisis at the very moment that Germany and the eurozone are facing the bleak prospect of recession may be Theresa May’s best hope.This is regardless of how unyielding Brussels negotiators have been to date and their willingness to play havoc with business confidence and financial stability by its brinkmanship.The potential loss to Brussels of a £39billion one-off payment to a Commission cash-starved following years of economic slowdown, could potentially be a bargaining chip for the Prime Minister in the last-chance saloon.In the final analysis, as veteran witnesses of the late-night sessions in Brussels, Nice, Maastricht and other destinations tell me, it’s mainly Germany and, to a lesser extent, France which decide.Besieged by increasingly hostile populist movements, neither Berlin or Paris will want to make political life tougher than it already is.The politics of the EU, at their most raw, are little different to those of the bazaar. The natural tendency is to relish an aggressive haggle but then to compromise – eventually.   "},{"url":null,"title":"Ups downs life bookshop Chinese store leaves customers stairway literary heaven","story":"    The mirrored ceilings give the illusion of the room never ending much to the amusement of the many hundreds of visitors every day          The stairways which travel up and down, across the rooms, are as attractive to visitors as the thousands of books on the walls          The modern library now attracts as many visitors hoping to photograph it as it does book lovers hoping to find a new read          Photographers stop in the centre to attempt a perfect shot at the bookstore which is packed with optical illusions and even an enchanted mushroom forest for children           Mirrored ceilings give the impression of the book shelves being double the height.

There is no other choice.‘If you want to be a shining star at the BBC, you are going to have to follow this course of action.’Asked whether he accepted this, Lord Hall said: ‘Yes I acknowledge that. People were pushed into these things. We’re saying that we’ve accepted responsibility. That’s full responsibility.’The BBC previously stood by a 2012 report published by Deloitte, which found ‘no evidence of any pressure to move staff to the PSC arrangements’.But yesterday Lord Hall and his deputy director-general, Anne Bulford, accepted that there was pressure regardless.Lord Hall said: ‘Going back and trying to find records of how these PSCs were set up and people’s correspondence with the BBC about them - we can’t find any record which point to one way or the other.‘But the evidence from people I’ve talked to is... that they were asked to take up PSCs’."},{"url":null,"title":"Dirty Duchess Argyll subject TV drama","story":"    Margaret Campbell, the Duchess of Argyll, is pictured outside the law courts in London in 1960 during what became a famous orce caseA British aristocrat known as the \u0027Dirty Duchess\u0027 of Argyll - whose husband accused her of sleeping with up to 88 men including government ministers and royals - will be the subject of a TV drama. The mini-series about Margaret Campbell, whose sex scandal made headlines in 1963, will be a spin-off of the BBC\u0027s award-winning A Very English Scandal. The Duchess\u0027s orce ignited public speculation when a list emerged of more than 80 men she had reportedly slept with, said to include two ministers and three members of the royal family. Executive producer Dominic Treadwell-Collins said the scandal made her the first woman to be publicly \u0027slut shamed\u0027.  Granting the orce, presiding judge Lord Wheatley said she \u0027was a completely promiscuous woman whose sexual appetite could only be satisfied with a number of men\u0027.The Duchess was the third wife of Ian Campbell, the 11th Duke of Argyll, whose family owned Inveraray Castle in western Scotland. Born Margaret Whigham, she married wealthy American golfer Charles Sweeny in 1933, having three children with him. Sorry ladies, the nation has voted for its greatest icons of...Great British Bake Off star Nadiya opens up about her...Share this articleAfter orcing him in 1947 she married the Duke in 1951 but the marriage fell apart after her suspicious husband hired a locksmith to break open a cupboard at her house in Mayfair. The search allegedly uncovered love letters and polaroid photos of her engaging in sexual acts with her various partners.           First marriage: The Duchess of Argyll on her wedding day after marrying wealthy American golfer Charles Sweeny in 1933           Second marriage: Margaret on the day she became Duchess of Argyll, after marrying Ian Campbell, the 11th Duke of Argyll, at Caxton Hall in London in March 1951  Margaret Campbell is pictured left at Inveraray Castle in Scotland in 1953 and right at a party in 1961.

They had been chatting for two weeks when he sent her pictures of himself, but she tells him she does not recognise him.\u0027Days later the defendant sent a picture of his bare bottom and penis to the victim.

He pointedly refused to sack shadow ministers who defied orders and helped the government during crunch Commons votes on Tuesday. Labour MP Lisa Nandy, whose Wigan constituency voted 64 per cent to Leave in 2016, insisted her party now had to \u0027make real choices\u0027 and \u0027respect the result of the referendum\u0027.                                                      Mrs May is due to report back to Parliament on her negotiations with the EU on February 13, with a further series of votes by MPs expected the following day. But the prospects of there being enough time to pass key legislation to implement a Brexit date have been dwindling.  Mr Hunt told Radio 4\u0027s Today programme: \u0027I think it is true that if we ended up approving a deal in the days before 29 March then we might need some extra time to pass critical legislation, but if we are able to make progress sooner then that might not be necessary.\u0027We can\u0027t know at this stage exactly which of those scenarios would happen.\u0027Underlining the time pressure, Mrs Leadsom confirmed that the 10-day recess due in mid-February was being dropped. \u0027I am very sorry for the inconvenience this will cause to colleagues, House staff and their families,\u0027 she said. \u0027Where House staff are concerned, conversations are underway to ensure that disruption is limited and no one is out of pocket. And where members have family, ministerial or constituency commitments, the usual channels (party whips) will work hard with members to limit the inconvenience.\u0027Mrs May\u0027s strategy secured a rare show of unity from the warring wings of the Conservative Party - as well as her allies in the DUP - in the Commons on Tuesday.However, Mr Clark suggested she needed to find an agreement that could command broader support across the House if it was to survive.\u0027Not only do I think it is necessary for people to come together across partisan lines, if we are properly to move forward I don\u0027t think we should aim for this deal to pass by a majority of one or two. I would like to a substantial majority for a deal,\u0027 he told ITV\u0027s Peston programme.While the Government remained committed to securing an independent trade policy, he said it was right to listen to other views - including calls for a customs union.\u0027I think it is reasonable going into discussions to listen to people\u0027s views and to see where the majority is in the House of Commons - and for a substantial majority.\u0027I would want to see what proposals are there.

This is more than double the estimated £2.25m previous sponsor Superdrug paid for the record-setting last series.Superdrug found the proposed £3.5m opening price set by ITV of sponsoring a fourth series of the Mallorca-set reality TV show too much but serious bids from nine advertisers keen to take it on drove the value to £5m.Love Island airs on ITV2 and this is the most money paid for a TV sponsorship for a single programme not run on a flagship channel such as the main ITV and Channel 4 stations.ITV has secured the same sum Channel 4 squeezed out of Amazon UK to sponsor The Great British Bake Off, its biggest ratings winner, poached from the BBC for £75m over three years and aired on its flagship channel.Since launching in 2016, Uber Eats has become a popular food delivery service among the millennial generation attracted to smartphone-led services such as Uber and its British delivery rival Deliveroo.The last series of Love Island was the biggest hit of the year among hard-to-reach 16- to 34-year-olds – with the exception of England’s World Cup football matches – a huge draw for advertisers.The series, won by Dani Dyer and Jack Fincham, proved to be TV gold, smashing viewing records and providing the nation’s watercooler moments over the summer.It was the most popular series ever aired on ITV2 – viewing figures at times topped 5 million – and showed that Britain’s TV industry can still make programmes that appeal to younger audiences amid the streaming revolution.Uber Eats’ deal marks an escalation of the delivery wars with Deliveroo and Just Eat.In 2017, Just Eat struck a £10m-a-year deal to sponsor The X Factor, the biggest sponsorship deal for a weekly show on British TV, after TalkTalk ended its 10-year association with the reality talent show.Earlier this month Starbucks announced a deal with Uber Eats to pilot coffee-to-your-door in London following successful trials in the US.Uber is driving forward after almost being banned by Transport for London after being told it was not “fit and proper” to hold a private hire vehicle operator licence. In June last year Uber won a 15-month probationary licence to work in London after making sweeping changes to its practices.Love Island has proved to be a huge money-spinner for ITV, with 11 commercial partners involved in the last series ning product placement, brand licensing, podcast sponsors, in-store branding and exclusive product lines and merchandise.The reality show has managed to pull off the increasingly difficult trick of getting young audiences more used to an on-demand world to tune in to a show at a set time each night. It has also become a creature of social media, with an enormous following on Instagram and more than 3 million people downloading the programme’s app for updates.Love Island’s success also led to public screening parties around the UK, with hundreds of people heading to Boxpark Croydon in south London to watch the programme, and also the sale of 260,000 branded water bottles at £15 each."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1ec5eaf887a7d313e2714f6da0ea6f8bd9a1bf6e/0_286_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b28f46bf61e8b0c26c4f7cf9f6611a10","title":"uk house prices brexit eurozone gdp italy business live","story":"Rolling coverage of the latest economic and financial news, as Italy stumbles back into recession Italy’s prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, seems to have blamed the recession on the US-China trade war.... Andrea Iannelli, investment director at Fidelity International, says Italy was dragged into recession by problems at home, and abroad: “The latest Italian GDP numbers may come as no surprise to investors, but it does highlight the challenges that still lie ahead for the country and the coalition government.The slowdown in the country’s major trading partners are partly to blame. However, the standoff between the government and the European authorities over the budget in the summer of 2018 has exacerbated the country’s weaknesses. One of the leaders of Italy’s coalition partners has blamed his predecessors, and European austerity, for the country’s economic mess.Deputy PM Luigi Di Maio, head of Movement Five Star, says the recession is proof that Europe’s budget rules should be relaxed - to allow Italy to stimulate its economy back to growth. Di Maio said the previous centre-left government - ousted this spring - was to blame for the recession.He added that this year’s EU parliamentary elections will effectively be a referendum on eurozone fiscal policy, saying:“I believe this referendum will have a positive outcome for those who are against austerity.” (thanks to Reuters for the quotes)If you’re just tuning in, here’s Associated Press’s take on Italy’s fall back into recession.The Italian economy slipped into recession in the final three months of the year, weighing on the wider eurozone’s growth, official figures showed Thursday. The Italian economy has been hobbled by a lack of confidence and waning business activity following the new populist government’s spat with the European Union’s executive Commission over its budget plans. The eurozone has also been hobbled by an unexpected slowdown in Germany, Europe’s biggest economy, which suffered an unexpected contraction in the third quarter largely due to changes in emissions standards that snarled auto sales. And uncertainty over Britain’s exit from the EU has weighed on sentiment. This slide into recession is a blow for Italy’s coalition government, and caps a turbulent year.It means Italy’s economy has been shrinking steadily since the right wing League Party formed a coalition with the anti-establishment Movement Five Star.That coalition spent months battling with Brussels over their plans to cut taxes and boost spending - arguing that Italy’s economy needed a stimulus.However, the resulting political crisis appears to have hurt economic confidence, as well as driving up Italy’s borrowing costs.Now that Italy is in recession, the growth targets which underpin Rome’s 2019 budget now look very unrealistic. That means its government may have to choose between dropping spending plans, raising taxes, or blowing through its deficit targets.AsJames Athey of Aberdeen Standard Investments puts it (via Bloomberg):“The growth forecasts on which the budget was based have already been blown out of the water and euro-zone growth continues to weaken.Italy is going to have to face up to some real problems.”2018 was not a vintage year for the euro area.Analysts are pointing out that Italy’s long-term economic performance is pretty dire.Here’s Arne Petimezas, analyst at AFS Group:Fred Ducrozet of Pictet Asset Management flags up that Italy is, by some distance, the worst-performing Big Four eurozone member.Indeed, Italy has only managed meagre growth since the financial crisis:Sky’s News’s Ed Conway points out that Italy is the first G7 economy to plunge into recession in over three years:You can see the Italian GDP report online, here.Italy has plunged back into recession!The quarter on quarter change is the result of a decrease of value added in agriculture, forestry and fishing as well as in industry and a substantial stability in services.From the demand side, there is a negative contribution by the domestic component (gross of change in inventories) and a positive one by the net export component.More to follow....It’s not just houses that are catching a Brexit chill.Overnight, we’re learned that British car production fell to a five-year low in 2018.

Neither of them is a natural negotiator or conciliator. These gifts are not part of their skill sets. Of the friendship that can sometimes exist between rival leaders there is no sign. Corbyn’s public sanctimony towards May can make Victor Hugo’s Inspector Javert look like a libertine. May’s default mode towards Corbyn, on show again at question time this week, is to give him her full Lady Disdain.What is more, even if the two leaders wanted to patch something together, their respective Brexit positions do not allow for much common ground anyway. May’s red lines on leaving the single market and the customs union, ending free movement and escaping the jurisdiction of the European court are mostly mirror images of Corbyn’s. He wants a close relationship with the EU market and on customs, and supports his own version of free movement. The only thing that would seem to unite them is that both want Brexit to happen, preferably under a Conservative government.Tuesday’s Commons votes, where Tory MPs rallied around a policy very close to the one they demolished two weeks ago, seem to separate the two leaders still further. Having claimed hers was the only possible deal, May has now pledged to try to change the Northern Ireland backstop arrangement in order to keep her right wing on board. Corbyn, meanwhile, wants her to adopt a soft Brexit approach that would, if she embraced it, trigger a full-scale revolt from her own side and from the Democratic Unionists.For all those reasons and more, the May-Corbyn negotiations seem a sideshow. May has less need of them now. She has regained a bit of control. Her hardliners kept their swords sheathed. The chief whip and the chairman of the Tory backbenchers both played skilful hands, while pro-remain MPs overplayed theirs this time. A second referendum now looks a more distant prospect. All this has won May a reprieve. Given the stunning 230-vote defeat she suffered on 15 January, that is quite a turnaround.But it will not last long. It is not the end of the Brexit battle, and it may not even be the beginning of its end either. May’s characterisation of her majority as “substantial and sustainable” is pure wishful thinking. That is because, as others have argued since Tuesday evening, the vote for the Brady amendment was a vote for something that is both vague and unlikely to happen. The European Union has little incentive to agree to it. And, assuming that it will not happen, certainly not in the small window of time now available, it seems odds-on that May will soon be struggling to find a majority once more.May’s position is neither substantial nor sustainable. It is disjointed and delicate. It bears repeating, after Tuesday’s volte-face, that it was May herself, not the EU, who created the all-UK backstop that she is now seeking to unpick. But the deeper truth, which she must have known when she originally agreed to it in 2017, is that the backstop was an attempt to reconcile three promises that are almost impossible to fit together in one consistent policy.The first of these is May’s promise to leave the customs union, which she made because she knows that the Thatcherite right of her party, including some of the most fanatical long-term advocates of Brexit, attaches immense importance – though it was barely mentioned in 2016 – to an autonomous trade policy. The second is her promise to Ireland, which in law and by treaty she is duty bound to make, that a new trade regime would not cause the creation of a hard border of any kind. And the third is the promise she made to the DUP after the 2017 election that she would not permit customs and regulatory ergence between Britain and Northern Ireland.These three promises are mutually contradictory. That was the case before Tuesday and it is still true now. You can’t have an autonomous trade policy and an open border. That is why the backstop exists at all. It is there to ensure that the open border in Ireland remains in force in the face of May’s commitment, driven by her right wing, to a sovereign trade policy. These unavoidable truths are not going to go away just because May and Graham Brady managed to find a form of words about “alternative arrangements” that pulled the Tory party back from an outright split after the 15 January vote against the deal.This brings us back to the role that Corbyn may yet play. For most of the parliamentary Brexit process, Corbyn has been a large but inert presence. Brexit politics has happened around him, not with or through him. He remains content, it seems, to go through the motions but not to get his hands dirty. Up to a point, it has been a coherent strategy if your three priorities, like Corbyn’s, are for Brexit to happen, for the Tories to own it, and for your own pristine politics to remain unsullied by the most important argument facing the country.In the end, though, events may be propelling Corbyn to mix with the sweatier end of politics. One pressure is that backbenchers in his party – such as Yvette Cooper and Hilary Benn – have emerged as de facto Labour figureheads. Another is that May has begun to engage with workplace and environmental regulatory issues that Labour cares about. Crucially, May’s defeat two weeks ago and her current turn to the Tory right are highlighting the harsh reality of the Brexiter trade autonomy dream that she has now empowered. A more adept Labour leader would have been reaching out relentlessly to Tory moderates over recent months on the customs elements of the eventual UK-EU trade deal, searching for common ground and looking for ways to ensnare them in a shared commitment to the open borders and regulatory alignment that the hard Brexiters so loathe.Such a thing may yet happen anyway. If May fails to get the changes from the EU that she seeks, and if this week’s Tory party unity comes under strain, as it may, then a space could open up for a softer Brexit deal. Such a deal has always been the least worst viable outcome to Brexit. This week’s events have underscored more than ever why May’s deal and no deal need not be the only options. Even Corbyn must see what is now at stake, and why engaging seriously with May is overwhelmingly in the country’s interest."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5638a7d49bbd951e9b7e1b3fcea3ea5272ae643f/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2ad64b956064afdae2b5249c3153f081","title":"ireland hard border brexit backstop good friday agreement","story":"The Good Friday agreement allows people to identify as Irish, British or both. We’re being forced, once again, to choose sidesOne of my earliest childhood memories is of a circling red light motioning cars to stop near the border, silencing all who encountered its fiery glare. That red light filled my young heart with fear. I didn’t know if the gloved hand holding the torch was that of the RUC, the British army, the IRA or the UVF.I grew up during the Troubles in the shadow of Cloghogue, one of the largest British army bases in Northern Ireland. Having to make detours to avoid customs and security checks along “bomb alley” – an atrocity-laden eight-mile stretch of road between Newry and Dundalk – was as frightening as it was familiar.It still is: to this day there are some back roads in South Armagh that I will not drive on alone after dark. It’s hard to explain to those who have not lived through a conflict that claimed more than 3,500 lives, in a region with a smaller population than most large UK cities, how the border permeated every aspect of our lives.It’s also hard to explain why the Brexit backstop – an insurance policy proposed between the EU and the UK to avoid a hard border, and extended to the whole of the UK at the latter’s insistence – is so critical. As the business editor of the largest media group in Ireland, I can give you chapter and verse about the economic threats a hard or no-deal Brexit poses for the Irish, Northern Irish and British economies. But you know about those already.The reality is that no amount of economic modelling can capture the unquantifiable human and psychological costs of the return of a hard border. Many argue that technological solutions – drones and suchlike – will do the trick. This is farcical: you only eliminate physical checks between two territories separated by a border when they share a customs union and have broad regulatory alignment. Everything else is infrastructure.As a journalist, I have been staggered by the scale and speed at which dangerous stereotypes and vituperative tropes – in some cases barely concealed racism – surrounding Ireland’s supposed intransigence have resurfaced in the UK’s political and media discourse. This process has been accompanied by astonishment in some quarters that Ireland, arguably England’s oldest colony, is a saboteur, reprobate or badly behaved underling for refusing to fall into line with the UK’s demands, if we knew what they were. When the BBC’s John Humphrys, one of the most prominent public broadcasters in Britain, asked Ireland’s Europe minister, Helen McEntee, why “Dublin” didn’t just leave the EU and “throw in their lot with this country”, Ireland uttered a collective gasp of incredulity verging on despair. What’s more alarming is that Anglo-Irish political relations, having warmed to a zenith of sorts in recent years, have plunged into a rapid freeze in a matter of months.Those who want to tear up the backstop, or feel gleeful at the prospect of no deal, should recall that the first shots of the Troubles were fired at customs posts such as Newry, requiring the RUC, and later the British army, to protect officials, civilians and military alike. These incidents paved the way for the installation of those mammoth watchtowers, helicopter bases and checkpoints – the hard border – that blighted our landscape. Just as the first shots were fired over customs posts, it was our membership of the customs union and the single market – the free movement of goods and people – that allowed us to tear down the physical borders and begin the task of demolishing the walls in our hearts and minds.Is a return to violence – the recent car bomb in Derry felt like a terrifying foreshock – inevitable? Not necessarily. But the return of a border, even one that starts out as soft and virtual, will – like the customs posts of old – invite a regulatory and security mission creep that will disrupt lives and livelihoods and prove tempting for some who are intent on taking us back to darker times.It’s a gamble we can’t afford to take. The Brexit backstop – this fundamental need to avoid a border, rightly articulatedin stark, if belated and obvious terms at Davos by the taoiseach, Leo Varadkar – is about so much more than tariffs and trade. It is about our identity. Brexit tears at the heart of the Good Friday agreement, which allows people like me, a Catholic who grew up in Newry, or a loyalist from east Belfast, to identify as British, Irish or both – and to celebrate our different allegiances.I can say, as an Irish woman from Northern Ireland, that I am Irish-British: in another time, I would have been tarred and feathered for saying so. Brexit strips away at those coveted birthrights. A border will force us, once again, to choose sides. As we stare down the barrel of Brexit, Theresa May has opened another front, securing parliamentary support to reopen the withdrawal agreement and demand significant and legally binding changes to the backstop that she vigorously defended for months.The prime minister may have scored a short-term pyrrhic victory in the internecine wars that have ided her party and the UK parliament. But backtracking on the backstop is a mistake, and a dangerous one at that. Placing party politics and political survival above the peace process is a risk we cannot afford to take."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/995f96531b3bdce6dde033471b264e6cf040543b/0_398_8688_5213/master/8688.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5db37466b5762bbff528ce66c04a366c","title":"the guy who valentines day perfect 14 february","story":"I’m the guy you meet right after you come out of a long-term relationship, and here’s how to have the perfect 14 FebruaryValentine’s Day. 14 February.

I’ve been woke ever since the day I was first breastfed by an almond. That day was yesterday.Speaking as a man, it’s not natural for me to keep all my wisdom to myself. That’s just not how it works – and by “it” I mean my johnson. Perhaps I could offer tips on how to make that special someone you are planning on casually stifling feel like a million bitcoins?

It feels so triggering, just like the words “Roger”, “Lloyd” and “Pack”.Over the many Valentine’s I’ve spent patrolling various branches of the aptly named All Bar One, making moves so slow you’ll swear you’ve just been touched by a tectonic plate, I’ve learned that emotionally manipulated relationships are all about giving people space. And that is something I will constantly keep telling you as I encroach. So here are my nine easy hints on how to engage with your Valentine from across a booth lit by a fading electronic candle in a tumbler.Most of all, good luck and good love.

They cut out paper starfish – more formally known as sea stars – and put them up for “adoption” for a $1 donation. They assigned them names and personality traits, such as Cherry Bomb, who “loves hanging out on her phone”, “rocks the legging style” and “is really smart but isn’t a nerd”. They sold T-shirts that read: “Save the Starfish.”“We don’t have an ocean anywhere close by,” their now retired teacher Vickie Bailey said. “The students knew that they would never go to the coast, they would probably never get to see this type of starfish, but they were so passionate about what was happening.”When Drew Harvell, a marine ecology professor and researcher at Cornell University, received the $400 or so that Carl Stuart middle school in Conway collected, she knew the money should go to something important.“I almost cried, I was so touched. So I matched it with $400 of my own and then one of our donors here put in a bigger amount of money and that’s basically the funding that allowed us to do the initial survey,” Harvell said.Flash forward to today: Harvell and her co-authors are releasing their study inspired by the seed money from the kids. Cornell and the University of California, Davis, are publishing their work in the journal Science Advances.The campaign didn’t exactly save the starfish. The findings are dire. But researchers now know much more about the scope of the die-off after analyzing data from trained recreational and professional ers and deep offshore trawls.Sea star wasting disease has affected more than 20 species from Mexico to Alaska. Some species resisted the disease better and others have evolved to survive.At the time of the outbreak, videos showed beaches littered with the arms of dead starfish, internal organs spilling out through lesions, Harvell recalled.The effect has been particularly bad for the sunflower star, a 3-4ft-wide creature that can have as many as two dozen arms. The sunflower star “crawls over the seafloor like a robotic vacuum cleaner, munching on everything in its path”, as described by Cornell’s media team.Sunflower sea stars, which live only on the west coast of North America, are now virtually gone from the waters off California, Oregon and Washington.Previous research has suggested that with warmer temperatures linked to climate change, the wasting disease has a higher risk of infection and kills sea stars faster. The new study finds that outbreaks of the virus among sunflower sea stars coincided with anomalously warm waters.And the disappearance of the species is having cascading effects on the ecosystem.Sunflower sea stars once kept the sea urchin population under control, but now urchin numbers are exploding, leading to barrens where they have devoured kelp habitats down to the pink sea floor beneath them.While the species is imperiled in the lower 48, they’re doing a little better in British Columbia and in some places in Alaska, Harvell said. Researchers will need to understand whether the sunflower sea star can be repatriated if the disease ever leaves west coast waters.“It’s really vital that something be done,” Harvell said. “It’s not an issue that we’ve dealt with before so I don’t have an immediate suggestion of what we would do. I think that we definitely need to convene a group of scientists and really talk about the issue and what are the highest priority items.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/525ccf9d1db70b0b288bc4d9e201b7929fa9e546/0_395_3637_2182/master/3637.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=34a06b6a49de11f8cc20f59059723031","title":"industrial fishing ushers albatross closer to extinction say researchers","story":"Satellite data suggests protection measures are being ignored as huge fishing lines snare endangered seabirdsIndustrial fishing vessels that accidentally kill tens of thousands of albatrosses each year routinely ignore regulations designed to save the birds from extinction, according to research.Using satellite data, investigators found that vessels employing longline fishing techniques showed a “low level of compliance” with measures to reduce albatross deaths.Longliners target tuna and other species, but their fishing lines – which can be up to 80 miles long – also unintentionally trap, drown and harm seabirds, as well as turtles, dolphins and other marine life, a process known as “bycatch”.Modern fishing methods have been identified as a major danger to plummeting albatross populations, threatening to drive almost three-quarters of all species to extinction, said Birdlife International, who undertook the research in conjunction with Global Fishing Watch.Under a red list compiled by the International Union for Conservation of Nature, 15 out of 22 albatross species are considered endangered.“The results are very disappointing,” said Stephanie Winnard, a biologist with the albatross task force, a specialist unit set up by Birdlife International and the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds. “By this stage you would expect a lot more vessels to be using night setting.”The aim of the research was to encourage best practice, to which end the results will be shared with the countries whose vessels were studied.Albatrosses, petrels and other seabirds are “irresistibly drawn” to the trailing, baited longlines, said Winnard. Each year, an estimated 100,000 birds are hooked and drowned by longline and trawl fisheries.“This level of bycatch in the fishing industry is hugely unsustainable for birds that can take up to 10 years to start breeding,” said Winnard, who added that the findings were “truly powerful” for the way the data shed light into the “opaque world” of global fisheries and their impact on ocean bioersity.“No one is going to report they are not sticking to the rules or they are killing seabirds, so we now have this independent way of measuring compliance,” said Winnard. “This information has never before been public. It is usually kept behind closed doors. It will promote transparency and hold countries to account. It is the first time we’ve been able to see what is happening on inidual fishing boats.”The researchers used vessels’ satellite data to examine the way 201 ships were moving, as well as the speed and direction of travel, in order to determine when fishing lines would be put down.Regulations laid down by the five Regional Fisheries Management Organisations that regulate tuna fisheries where albatross are found generally stipulate that two out of three mitigation measures must be used. The other methods include weighting lines to ensure they sink faster and using streamer lines to scare seabirds away. The regulations have been in place for between five and 10 years, depending on the region, but the RFMO rely on self-reporting by the ships. However, the international Agreement on the Conservation of Albatrosses and Petrels, introduced in 2004, suggests all three mitigation methods should be used.A study published in 2011 estimated the bycatch of seabirds of longline fisheries to be between 160,000 and 320,000 annually."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/031079c32ab0548656496a7cb65037c19723ab28/502_108_3158_1896/master/3158.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=349101966560281ca2411ef639af24d2","title":"black sheep guardian film nominated for best short documentary oscar","story":"Ed Perkins’ film about a young black boy’s response to a racist gang after he moves out of London is up for an Academy awardBlack Sheep, a film commissioned by the , has been nominated for best short documentary at the 2019 Oscars.Directed by Ed Perkins, Black Sheep tells the story of Cornelius Walker, a black 11-year-old from London who moves with his family to a housing estate in Essex after the murder of schoolboy Damilola Taylor in 2000. Walker, the same age as Taylor and of similar background, found himself confronting a gang of local racists and, after first fighting back, went to extraordinary lengths to fit in and gain their friendship.The film features interviews with Walker looking back 15 years on from the events he describes, which are re-enacted in the locations where they took place, with Kai Francis Lewis playing Walker.Responding to the nomination, Walker said that he was, “humbled and proud.

Many more people are thought to have taken part in the event without signing the official pledge.At the same time, Britain’s supermarkets are reporting a surge in sales of vegan food and drink, which they expect to continue throughout the year. They are tapping into not only the burgeoning vegan market but also the UK’s estimated 22 million “flexitarians”, who enjoy meat but want to reduce their meat consumption.The number of Veganuary pledges for 2019 exceeded those in the previous four years combined, suggesting that veganism is becoming a mainstream movement. The organisers of Veganuary say six in 10 who take the “Veganuary pledge” say they plan to stay vegan.Thirteen new overseas partnerships increased Veganuary’s presence elsewhere in the world – in India, Sweden, Brazil, Argentina, Chile, Peru, Singapore, Malaysia, Australia, South Africa, Japan, Iceland and Russia.“With a quarter of a million participants this year, Veganuary is finishing on an all-time high,” said Rich Hardy, head of campaigns at Veganuary. “I think Veganuary has reached critical mass now – vegan living is growing it’s here to stay, it’s part of the national conversation and it has credibility. That’s great news for people, animals and the planet.”Support for the campaign has also led to a vegan boost among food producers, with supermarkets, manufacturers and high street restaurant and pub chains also bolstering their plant-based ranges to meet demand.The Papa John’s takeaway chain this week ran into trouble with vegans who claimed they were sent real cheese pizzas after dairy-free alternatives ran out.On supermarket wine aisles, sales of Co-op’s own-label vegan varieties have doubled since it rolled out front-of-pack labelling last year. A new organic and vegan white wine has also had a fivefold increase in sales.Sainsbury’s has recently started selling fake meat next to the real thing, after a successful trial last year when it launched a new range of plant-based burgers and mince.Rather than being displayed in a dedicated vegan section, meat and fish alternatives such as jackfruit burgers and mushroom “shroomdogs” are being stocked alongside their meat counterparts in 20 branches of Sainsbury’s."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d5706538cc04ab35c8418456183b59bc722f28f2/0_0_3200_1920/master/3200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6574506f0d9decc1f1768adedd24f00f","title":"nine apps to help simplify adult life","story":"It can be difficult to cope with modern living without some support.

But in an age of predatory capitalism and rampant inequality, can one man’s modest suggestions really make much difference? By  Daniel CohenEvery Tuesday night, an email newsletter goes out to 13 million subscribers. It’s far more popular than Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop newsletter, which has 8 million, and the New York Times Morning Briefing, with 1.7 million. Its name, Money Saving Expert’s Money Tips, barely hints at the astounding range of tricks and deals contained within. Recent emails have featured “hacks” for cheaper meals at Nando’s and McDonald’s, deals on broadband and savings accounts, codes giving discounted access to airport lounges and an offer for free radiator heat-reflector pads.The newsletter looks like a relic from an earlier age of the internet: thousands of words, with no ads and few images. It began as an email that Martin Lewis – the personal finance journalist now better known as the Money Saving Expert – wrote for his friends. Today, it is the work of dozens of people at MoneySavingExpert, the website Lewis founded in 2003, which has become one of the 100 most popular sites in the UK, with 16 million visitors a month.The business of saving money has made Lewis extremely wealthy. After he sold the site in 2012 to the price-comparison firm MoneySupermarket for £87m, the Financial Times called him “the most successful journalist in the world, ever”. A year later, he was the seventh most Googled celebrity in the UK, nestled between Taylor Swift and Beyoncé.Lewis still worries over every line in the email each week. When I went to meet him on a Tuesday afternoon last July, he was studying the draft of that night’s newsletter, pondering aloud the merits of competing broadband deals. There was a gold piggy bank on his desk. It was the height of the heatwave, and Lewis, who is lean and often tanned, was dressed in the uniform of a sensible dad doing his best to enjoy a long-awaited summer holiday: a short-sleeved, stripy white shirt with a denim collar, denim shorts and the navy Skechers that he wore almost every time I met him.In our age of insecurity, Lewis stands out as a reassuring source of authority. Addressing a country that has never been comfortable talking about money, Lewis takes us by the hand and guides us through the bewildering world of finance. He comes across as a kind of double agent, who goes undercover among the powerful then reports back to the rest of society. It may feel as though banks, corporations and energy companies are lined up against the inidual, with few politicians willing to intervene, but Lewis’s work offers the alluring promise that in the battle between business and consumer, you can, with the right information, emerge the victor.Today, at 46, Lewis is a TV personality as much as anything. He appears weekly on Good Morning Britain and This Morning, while his primetime ITV programme, The Martin Lewis Money Show, regularly attracts around 4 million viewers.Lewis’s success depends on the trust he has built with the public, and he tends to this like an anxious parent. Everything featured on Money Saving Expert has been chosen by its editorial team, but once those recommendations have been decided on, the commercial team then tries to arrange deals with the companies offering the products. The site makes a commission when readers click on affiliated links for such products, which are marked with an asterisk. Still, when I joined Lewis for his meeting about the email, he was cautious. He worried that one description was too “selly”. “We don’t want people to think we’re advertising,” he said. A fidgety presence, he took great care with the recommendations, mindful of the impact they can have: Tesco Bank’s website once crashed when one of its savings accounts appeared in the email.With his fiery rhetoric, his efforts to defend the little guy against vested interests, Lewis may look like a populist. But, at heart, he has a technocratic temperament: he identifies specific problems, and tries to solve them with tweaks. On the rare occasions when he does speak out, it’s because he has decided the system has stopped working properly.Lewis is, in short, a centrist – perhaps the only truly popular centrist in Britain. Instead of seeking structural change, his formula combines educating the public with campaigning for small adjustments to the system. But at a time of growing inequality, with politicians unwilling or unable to hold corporations to account, is this enough? What is needed, the economist John Kay told me, “is not more information from the financial services industry, but actually an industry that is trustworthy and reliable”. The question remains whether Lewis’s approach is the best we can hope for, or a distraction from real change.There’s nothing new about wanting to save money. But now, a decade after the financial crisis, it feels particularly urgent. It’s clear that things will never go back to normal: the days of a secure job for life, with a steadily rising salary and a generous pension pot, are over. You won’t be able to support yourself through old age on your pension alone you might never make enough to afford your own home.You need to be prudent, but how? Since the deregulation and privatisations of the 1980s, we have had to make more and more financial decisions, and they have become dizzyingly complex. There are so many options: Britain has more than 300 banks, dozens of energy companies. Then there are all the credit cards, broadband providers, mobile networks. You know that if make the wrong choice you will get ripped off. It’s easy to panic or to bury your head in the sand.What has made Lewis so popular is that he offers a concrete response to this uncertainty. His work holds out the hope that you can take control of your finances and your life. This isn’t a question of stopping spending. “I don’t think being tight is a particularly sensible thing with money,” he told me. He wants to help people get more from the money they have, and reduce the stress that money can cause. The trick is to “play the system, understand how it works, get the best products” – to turn modern finance’s ersity to your own advantage, rather than being overwhelmed and exploited by it.In this respect, Lewis is less like a doctor, doling out pills for the patient to swallow, than a personal trainer: he promises to make you stronger through your own hard work. And no matter how little you understand at first, you can still judge his advice for yourself by its effect on your bank balance. This is what has saved Lewis from the fate of so many experts, who incur resentment by appearing to lord their expertise over everyone else. Instead of just telling you what to do, Lewis makes you feel as if you, too, can become a money-saving expert.When Lewis was in charge of Money Saving Expert, he worked up to 90 hours a week. Since selling the company, he has continued to play an important role, as executive chairman, and pictures of him wearing a confident expression appear all over the website like a talisman against profligacy. But even though he has cut down, to 50 or 60 hours, his schedule still appears exhausting in its variety and intensity. Rather than prioritising a particular audience, he addresses whoever he can, modulating his message each time like a shrewd ambassador for financial prudence. What matters to him is getting the word out. On a Monday morning last summer, I accompanied Lewis to ITV’s studios in west London for his appearance on This Morning. As he waited to go on set, he asked a member of the crew if she watched Love Island. She didn’t. “I’m thinking of doing Love Island this year,” he said. When his turn on This Morning came, he took questions about student finance from callers, staring intensely at the camera as he listened. As usual, he spoke in rapidfire bursts, slowing down theatrically for emphasis.After that, he got a motorbike taxi to Broadcasting House, the BBC headquarters, for his weekly Radio 5 Live phone-in. The segment was introduced with the song Bills, by the American singer LunchMoney Lewis, and as it played Lewis air drummed, bobbing his head. It was a longer slot than This Morning, with a more leisurely pace the callers seemed canny, and Lewis responded with a level of detail he tends to avoid on TV. That afternoon, he attended a meeting at the Money and Mental Health Policy Institute, a charity that he founded in 2016, to carry out research and campaigns on the connection between mental illness and financial problems.The next day, Lewis met with Matt Hancock, who was then the culture secretary. It was a few weeks after Lewis had announced that he was suing Facebook for defamation, over fake adverts that featured his name and image, and the pair discussed online ads and scams. That evening, Lewis started tweeting about Love Island. “I’ve never watched before – I’m trying it this time – and yes I am intrigued,” he told his 566,000 followers. On Good Morning Britain that week, he referred to a Love Island contestant’s “semi-permanent Russian lashes”. When a presenter asked what made the lashes Russian, Lewis responded, “maybe they need to get them on quickly”. (He was once a finalist in a competition for young Jewish stand-up comedians.) He made a “ba-dum-tish” sound, with a drumming gesture, and walked off the set. Two days later, he wrote a comment piece for the Financial Times, proposing reforms to student finance.Lewis, who has a knack for remembering numbers, is happy to play the role of a financial savant in his TV appearances. “Is there something you don’t know? Anything you don’t know?” Angellica Bell, his co-host on The Martin Lewis Money Show, asked in a recent live special. But his displays of knowledge are mostly for show: their purpose is not so much to convey information as to demonstrate his mastery of the material, his fitness to instruct. His actual advice, on the other hand, is often surprisingly simple.Consider the “Money Mantras”, the cornerstone of the Money Saving Expert philosophy. Before buying anything, you ask yourself two questions. If you’re broke: “Do I need it? Can I afford it?” If you can afford the item: “Will I use it? Is it worth it?” If the answer to any of the questions is “No”, then it’s clear: don’t buy it.If that seems obvious, then Lewis’s prescription for budgeting is a little more technical. You do an audit of your outgoings, to establish how much you can actually afford to spend. Then you single out a few main categories: these might be bills, holidays, Christmas, savings and big purchases. You open a dedicated bank account for each of them, and use standing orders from your main account to ensure you’re setting aside what you need for every category. It’s fairly straightforward, but takes a lot of effort to set up – a day’s work, in Lewis’s estimation. He calls this technique “piggybanking”, with each account a different piggybank.Money Saving Expert has proved to be very effective at making money, yet Lewis considers it a public service above all. “This is a mission,” he says. “It’s a consumer website, but it’s not there to be all wonderful and give people what they want. All they would want is £10-off shopping vouchers, because they’re fun and most people don’t want to deal with their finances. And we have a job to twist their nipples in any way we can.”Lewis was born in Manchester in 1973 and spent most of his childhood in Delamere Forest in Cheshire, where his father ran a Jewish boarding school for pupils with special needs. Three days before Lewis’s 12th birthday, his mother was killed in a road accident. Losing a parent at a young age “gives you a drive,” he said in a talk in 2014. “Nothing is going to be quite as bad as it’s already been, so you can go for it.”After studying at the London School of Economics, Lewis spent two years working in financial PR, then moved into journalism. He got his first job on air when a cable channel devoted to finance, Simply Money, launched in 2000. Angela Rippon, the TV presenter who fronted the channel, told me that it was Lewis’s sketches that made him distinctive. Alongside his regular reporting, he dressed up as different characters – Dracula, a card dealer – in order to illustrate his points. One of Lewis’s strengths as a broadcaster is that he is not afraid to be naff – in fact, he revels in the naff. “It engaged the viewers in a way that financial reporting had never done before,” Rippon said. He has never been bothered by accusations that he is dumbing down. “I know I’m good at what I do,” he said. “For me, the passion is about reaching real people and getting them to be better on their finances.”In his first year at Simply Money, Lewis asked to be known on-screen as “the Money Saving Expert”. After the channel shut down, he kept the name, paid £100 to a web designer in Uzbekistan – his sole capital outlay in the decade that he owned Money Saving Expert – and launched the site in 2003.Back then, Lewis told me, media coverage of personal finance was limited to “investment, protection, and maybe mortgages if you want to be radical”. What he had in mind was something different: a one-stop shop that covered money as it works in everyday life. That meant advice on supermarkets (“eye-level products are where the profit is”) and where to get the cheapest DVD rentals and perfume. “He has taken it into getting a good deal in every single aspect of your life,” says Anne Ashworth, who edits the Times’s Money section. By moving beyond the constraints of traditional personal finance journalism, he became, more and more, a life coach.What was particularly striking about Lewis’s approach was how confrontational it was. Money Saving Expert’s home page used to have a promise for readers: “Companies try to screw us for profits. Money-saving shows you how to screw them back.” Journalists had long singled out firms that shortchanged their customers, but this was undiscriminating – it suggested that consumers couldn’t trust anyone. In The Money Diet, his 2004 guide to saving money, which doubles as a kind of early manifesto, Lewis argued that it was the job of businesses to make money – “nowt wrong with that”. But for that very reason, he wrote, “all companies are the enemy”.The tools offered by the site don’t always match up to this rhetoric. The Money Mantras alone won’t help you screw companies back. It takes real effort you have to exploit the loopholes identified by Money Saving Expert, and mop up one introductory offer after another. In the argot of the website, people who keep doing this by switching banks are approvingly referred to as “tarts”.Money Saving Expert quickly took off: by 2006, it was getting 1m visitors a month. As it expanded, Lewis’s profile grew. He got an ITV series another series, It Pays to Watch!, aired on Five in 2008, the year the global financial crisis inaugurated an era of perpetual insecurity. In 2012, when ITV launched The Martin Lewis Money Show, he finally got what he had spent years working towards: a programme at primetime. It airs on Mondays at 8pm, between episodes of Coronation Street. The show is centred on questions that Lewis takes from members of the public, at roadshows around the country. It’s slicker than his earlier programmes, but features the kind of sketches that he first tried out on Simply Money, giving it something of a variety-show feel.In June, Lewis recorded a live special of the show at Warwick Castle. A Martin Lewis Money Show flag, featuring coins, notes, credit cards and a piggy bank, flew from the tower. Lewis wandered around beforehand, looking a little nervous. He was more smartly dressed than usual, and boasted to the audience that he had bought his blazer in a sale. “We’re going to save millions of people lots of money,” he told them, “which is why I get out of bed in the morning.” During the show, Lewis reminded everyone going away that summer to pack their European Health Insurance Card by the end of the episode, the EHIC website had crashed.Lewis is fond of saying that he has never been interested in money he’s more interested in what having money allows you to do, and the problems that stem from not having it. He considers himself “a politician with a small p”, whose goal is to achieve “financial justice”. He has tried his best to do this while keeping out of the political fray. But over the past few years, that balancing act has become impossible. Reluctantly, Lewis has found himself dragged into politics.Lewis’s first campaign, in 2005, was against bank charges: the fees levied on customers who go beyond their overdraft limit. At the time, even if someone was just a penny over the limit, they usually had to pay their bank about £35. Since Lewis started campaigning against the charges, 7m template letters – which people fill in and send to their bank, in order to request that the charges be repaid – have been downloaded from Money Saving Expert and £1bn reclaimed. The campaign inspired a song, I Fought the Lloyds by Oystar, a comedy-rock band whose singer had used Money Saving Expert to challenge the charges. It charted at #No 25 and Lewis made a cameo in the video.Not long after that campaign, Lewis deployed similar tactics against banks that had missold payment protection insurance (PPI) to customers. This time, Money Saving Expert’s template letters resulted in as much as £5bn in compensation. More recently, Lewis has taken a different approach, by challenging the government itself. In 2011, soon after it was announced that university tuition fees would rise from £3,290 a year to a maximum of £9,000, Lewis was appointed head of the Independent Taskforce on Student Finance Information, which sought to explain what the new fees would involve. At the time, Lewis said he was “no fan of the changes”, but his priority was ensuring that everyone was properly informed about them. “There were people he could communicate with who wouldn’t have trusted politicians,” says David Willetts, the universities minister at the time.Lewis turned on the government when it froze the repayment threshold – the amount graduates need to earn before they start paying off their loans. Having been set at £21,000, this was meant to eventually increase every year, but in 2015 George Osborne backtracked. Lewis was appalled. In articles and TV appearances, he kept making his case he met with Jo Johnson, who was then the universities minister. In 2017, Theresa May finally relented: she announced the threshold would go up after all, to £25,000, and increase thereafter.Lewis’s journalism offers lessons in self-reliance, ways for iniduals to protect themselves. But he acknowledges that this isn’t always enough. “There are people out there who have less income than the basic minimum they need to subsist,” he says. As part of his efforts towards “financial justice”, he has pledged around £20m to charity.Perhaps Lewis’s most high-profile public intervention came last year, when he learned that his image was being used on targeted Facebook adverts without his consent. Many of them claimed he was endorsing bitcoin schemes that were actually fronts for ultra-high-risk investments one woman lost £100,000 as a result. Lewis approached Facebook about the ads but it failed to take any serious action, so he decided to sue.When he announced the lawsuit in April, it struck a nerve. The story made the front pages. Lewis was all over television, but he looked rattled. Unlike his previous campaigns, this one was personal and he didn’t enjoy the attention. “I do not handle stress particularly well. I am a very shy person,” he told me. Lewis is very protective of his privacy. He is married to Lara Lewington, a BBC presenter, with whom he has a six-year-old daughter. When I joined him on his walk to work, we didn’t meet at his home instead, I waited at a hotel nearby. When he eventually called me to arrange a meeting point, his number showed up as “No caller ID”.It’s tempting to see the Facebook lawsuit as a dramatic battle: Lewis, the people’s champion, taking on an unaccountable Silicon Valley behemoth. Even politicians unwilling to challenge the firm wanted him to play that role. “I have had, let’s say, very senior members of government who have pressured me and said: ‘Please don’t settle. Take it to court, set a precedent’,” Lewis said. Yet his aim was, as ever, more modest. “This is not an anti-Facebook campaign,” he told me, when we discussed the lawsuit last year. “This is an anti-scam ads campaign.” Last week, he announced that he was dropping the case because Facebook had agreed to introduce new measures tackling scam ads.There was a time when Lewis wanted to go into politics. At the LSE, he was elected head of the student union. He ran as an independent the union had previously been dominated by the far left, and Lewis promised to deliver “a student union for all”. Outside the LSE, Lewis was affiliated with the Lib Dems, and led the party in the National Union of Students. “I had no doubt he would go on to be a Lib Dem MP,” said Raj Jethwa, who ran against Lewis in the student union elections.It’s easy to imagine Lewis as an MP: he has the verbal tics of a modern politician, often starting his sentences with a “look” or “listen”. Even after setting up Money Saving Expert, Lewis still imagined he would eventually run for parliament. But when he hit his mid-30s, he decided he wasn’t suited to a career in politics. “I know I couldn’t cope with it,” he told me. “I’m nowhere near as a robust as I was when I was younger.”A few years ago, Lewis applied to be a cross-bench member of the House of Lords – a process open to anyone – and was rejected. He is keen to stress that he doesn’t identify as party political, though he has been approached by numerous parties, including United for Change, the new centrist party. He sees himself “somewhere from a wet Tory, a right Labour or a Lib Dem”. That outlook doesn’t always square with his more incendiary rhetoric. Throughout his career, Lewis has railed against the excesses of business, and seen first-hand how they can affect people he has attacked banks and energy companies. But while he seeks to empower inidual consumers, he stops short of calling for radical solutions that might level the playing field altogether: drastic regulation, or even nationalisation. His work seems to add up to a damning critique of the status quo, without seeking to fundamentally change it.Money Saving Expert operates according to the optimistic principle that if someone knows enough, they should be able to make the right decisions. When I went to events where Lewis was filming and spoke to the people in attendance, I was struck by how clued up they were. They had saved thousands through cashback services, or switching between credit cards – tricks they had learned from Lewis. But in their commitment to saving money, they were willing to put in the kind of time that most people just don’t have.Yet there is more to Lewis’s ambitions than simply educating people about money. He wants to change the way they think and talk about it. “If we take the American look at money, which is where money is just something open that you communicate about, I actually think that is healthier than our more British poe-facedness,” he told me.That reticence can have dire consequences. “I think some of the gender pay gap is because we don’t talk about salaries in this country,” Lewis says. Not discussing money also affects how much we spend on things. “If I don’t know how much you paid for your plumber, how do I know what I’m supposed to pay for my plumber?” Through his work, Lewis meets people with crippling debts, and sees the psychological toll that money can take. He can be emotional on screen, and open about his own vulnerabilities. When people are unable to talk about their finances, he says, it means they are unable to talk about the problems that stem from them. “That’s not good for our society.”That may be slowly changing. McFall notes that many younger people are open about the financial difficulties they face: their high student loan debt, the obstacles to buying a first property. “All of those things mean that financial details about how people live are in the public sphere in a way that they weren’t, historically,” she says. But Lewis thinks there is a long way to go. “We have got rid of the taboo of talking about sex and religion. And thankfully, we’re starting to get rid of the taboo of talking about your mental health. But money’s still there.”Lewis is constantly reminded that his work is incomplete. When I joined him on his walk to work, he told me about something he had recently overheard in a restaurant. A group of young professionals had been sitting near him, discussing which cards they use when they go overseas. “They were all getting it so wrong,” he said, as we walked down Oxford Street. “I found them painful.” He sounded personally affronted. I wondered why he cared so much about what other people did with their money. What was it about the conversation that he had found so painful? “Because it’s fact!” he said, his voice rising in exasperation. “It’s not opinion. It’s just a simple fact.” Like many experts, he seemed to feel that if people just listened to him, it would make everyone’s lives so much easier.This is the territory in which Lewis is still most comfortable: the realm of the indisputable, where one figure is higher than another, where there is no politics or emotion to complicate and corrupt. With money, countless things will always remain uncertain: which stocks will go up, say, or when to buy euros for your holiday. That’s not what Lewis is about. “People want to know what to invest in I don’t know,” he said. “But I do know what the best card to spend abroad is. Manifestly, directly, on a spreadsheet, no question. I know the answer.”• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, or sign up to the long read weekly email here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b485343d1a5f56ed68d74ec33f417971676721fc/0_0_2607_1564/master/2607.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9357ca5aa5c47a2c45cec800cd6a0cce","title":"celine dion biopic power of love valerie lemercier","story":"The singer has granted the rights for her songs to be used in the film, which will star and be directed by French actor Valérie LemercierCéline Dion is the subject of a forthcoming biopic, The Power of Love, slated for release in 2020. French star Valérie Lemercier will direct the film and play the singer. Dion, 50, has authorised the project and granted the rights to her songs, Variety reports.The Power of Love will follow Dion from her childhood in Quebec in the 1960s, where she was the youngest of 14 children in what she has described as a poor but happy family, to her teenage rise to fame.Dion made her first recording, Ce n’était qu’un rêve, aged 12. She wrote the song with her mother Thérèse and brother Jacques. Another brother, Michael, sent the song to manager René Angélil, who remortgaged his home to fund her first album. Angélil and Dion married in December 1994 and remained together until his death in January 2016.Lemercier said she was touched by Dion’s grief following Angélil’s death, and began learning about Dion, her husband and mother . “I discovered the strength of their love story and their great humour, and I better understood how the alchemy of their three inidual ambitions made an unwanted little girl the greatest star on the planet,” Lemercier said.Lemercier has directed a number of domestic hits, including Palais Royal! and 50 Is the New 30, and has a background as a chanteuse, herself performing one-woman shows in Paris.The Power of Love joins a recent glut of music biopics and musician-endorsed movies. Bruce Springsteen has endorsed and lent 16 of his songs to the soundtrack of Gurinder Chadha’s Blinded by the Light, an adaptation of Sarfraz Manzoor’s memoir about discovering Springsteen as a Muslim teenager growing up in 80s Britain.

The heavy metal band have recorded four new songs for the film’s soundtrack, which also features 14 of their hits.Dion will play her only European date of 2019 at London’s Hyde Park this summer, headlining the British Summer Time festival. It will be her first performance in the UK since summer 2017. The concert will come shortly after she completes her Las Vegas concert residency, which began in 2011 and will close on 8 June.She recently removed her 1998 duet with R Kelly, I’m Your Angel, from streaming services, following the broadcast of the Lifetime documentary series, Surviving R Kelly."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f2e0ce66c3e52aae516aea7f57236e85c4aea771/0_106_3146_1888/master/3146.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2bca6e3e69f342b59774be86eee3610b","title":"the specials encore review a chequered mix","story":"Amid disputes over the group’s authenticity, Terry Hall, Lynval Golding and Horace Panter are best when sounding both anthemic and doom-ladenAn interesting question hangs over the first album by the Specials since their reunion in 2008: is it actually an album by the Specials? Singer Neville Staple and guitarist Roddy Byers have left, and drummer John Bradbury died as sessions for the album began in 2015. There are fewer members of the band’s classic lineup on Encore than there were in the version of the Specials that sporadically toured and cobbled together albums of ska covers in the 90s. Still, there are more members of the classic lineup here than on In the Studio, the 1984 Special AKA album commonly regarded as canonical.But then, In the Studio was helmed by Jerry Dammers, the architect of the Specials and the 2-Tone movement. According to a recent feature in Mojo magazine, he attempted to legally prevent the current incarnation of the band from releasing new music, believing that it would besmirch the legacy of arguably the most influential British band of their era. What you think of Encore’s very existence depends on whether you believe the soul and spirit of the Specials rests with Dammers, or with Terry Hall, the lead vocalist on virtually every one of their hits: a parlour game that can keep ageing rude boys and girls arguing for hours, never getting any less depressing.Under the circumstances, the obvious thing for Hall, guitarist Lynval Golding and bassist Horace Panter to do would be to release an album in the image of the music that made the Specials’ famous: see, it wasn’t all Jerry, we can do it without him. If Encore scrupulously avoids the frantic ska-punk sound of their 1979 debut, there are certainly moments that feel like deliberate evocations of the band’s past. With its mournful trombone solo and tension-ratcheting pile-up of queasy jazz chords, single Vote for Me is hardly coy in its attempts to get the listener to think of Ghost Town. A version of the Valentines’ 1967 single Blam Blam Fever – already covered by the ersatz Specials on the largely forgotten 2000 album Skinhead Girl – is the kind of e into the ska archives that formed the basis of the band’s early repertoire. You can understand the logic behind adding The Lunatics Have Taken Over the Asylum (the debut single by Hall and Golding’s post-Specials band the Fun Boy Three) to their repertoire, but it feels strangely restrained and polite recast as a kind of dub tango. And particularly when compared with the original: the early Fun Boy Three’s bleak, experimental sound still stands as a stark reminder of how weird the charts once were.Encore is at its best when it leaves the Specials’ past behind and faces forward. A cover of the Equals’ Black Skin Blue Eyed Boys is a tip of the hat to Eddie Grant’s pioneering multiracial band, and unlike anything the Specials have released before, offering impressively taut funk in the place of Jamaican rhythms. There’s something appealingly odd about the music that supports Hall’s examination of his struggles with mental health on The Life and Times. Featuring a vocal from Saffiyah Khan – the woman photographed facing down a member of the EDL at a Birmingham demonstration, wearing both a pitying smile and a Specials T-shirt – a dubby version of Prince Buster’s 10 Commandments also puts some distance between the 2019 Specials and their past.Held up as paragons of virtue thanks to their staunch anti-racism, the original Specials were a trickier prospect than their canonisation suggests. Perhaps the kindest thing you can say about their attitude to women – as expressed on Little Bitch, Too Much Too Young or Hey Little Rich Girl – was that it tells you a lot about men of their era, including the ostensibly right-on ones. Whether you view Khan’s evisceration of Prince Buster’s original lyrics to 10 Commandments – which make Little Bitch look like something by Andrea Dworkin – as atonement or not, it’s hard not to be moved both by its righteous fury and the dubby backing track. The same is true of BLM, on which Lynval Golding offers a potent, unflinching portrayal of racism across the decades, over more muscular funk-rock.The final track, We Sell Hope, manages to hit what you might call the classic Specials’ emotional sweet-spot – sounding simultaneously anthemic and doom-laden was always among their neatest tricks – with an impressive effortlessness. A solemn reggae ballad, decorated by vibraphone, it never feels like it’s trying too hard to recapture old glories. It’s an unequivocal triumph on an album that mixes the great and the so-so, the former outweighing the latter enough to appease fans, if not, one suspects, ex-bandmates. And We Sell Hope’s title fits: while it plays, the Specials sound like a band with a future, not just an illustrious past.Working Men’s Club: Bad BloodThere’s a real alchemy to how this Yorkshire trio take well-worn ingredients – the Fall, Gang of Four, NY punk-funk – and it turn it into something more than the sum of its parts. An effervescent debut single."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6f391f450483f7dc35ad4da1496aa7e0d94d5393/0_0_7360_4417/master/7360.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1bfcc01a5b6906ad9026dddf9e6d6378","title":"two thirds of british children make music study finds","story":"Youth Music poll shows a massive rise in music-making among young people – especially among those from lower-income backgroundsNew research has found that more than two-thirds of young people are active musicians.The report’s authors argue it is vital “to make music an indispensable part of school life”.

And if we’re at school, it’s getting increasingly more difficult to access music in the curriculum where its importance is in many cases being downgraded.”The report’s authors recommend that “public music education funds should be targeted towards those who face greatest barriers to access”, and “those involved in supporting young people’s wellbeing should give greater consideration to the role that music can play, and how young people’s passion for listening to music and their everyday creative lives can be interwoven with wider strategies to support good mental health.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e438fd3a9e2a7f0009581f1713fab34a06e6c096/0_89_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f58bf6fb7d61fa6722235cfd4cc88eb8","title":"could speaker john bercow block brexit podcast","story":"Today is the day that backbench MPs in parliament could wrestle control of the Brexit process away from the government.

The PM flies to Brussels on a completely pointless trip, to speak to people who do not want to talk to her, because she has to be seen to be doing something. The government uses dubious tactics to fend off legitimate challenges, the Labour opposition proves once again just how impotent it is, and the Tory press tout it as a triumph for the government.

LastNameOnTheShelfSo parla-la-la-iament has voted for the latest fantasy to avoid the Tory Party from splitting. May has another two weeks being PM. Jacob Rees Mogg is another two weeks nearer his dream of a no-deal Brexit so he and his other hedge fund friends can make themselves richer unfettered by any EU directives. And vote-leavers can live happily ever after, even if they are poorer. Us remainers have been ignored again and if, as expected, the EU refuse to reopen negotiations then the blue press will have the headline they always wanted - that it is all the EU’s fault. It looks like we will be forced to go it alone before we can see who is right or wrong. TheDudleyOmmerPlease - going back to Brussels is nonsense. Labour in opposition totally outmanoeuvred in the political playground by the current prime minister. Corbyn is dust, Labour finished. Theresa May won’t stand for re-election and so it will go on post no-deal Brexit. Spencer Leonard WainThe Tories only squeaked a very narrow majority for a switch to the right by imposing a three-line whip on the party, meaning that any minister or junior minister who voted for Cooper-Bowles or against Brady would lose their government job - and any backbench Tory MP who did so would leave themselves open to deselection by their constituency party, egged on by Tory Central Office. The real battle will be when May comes back to the House on 14 February with whatever limp ‘alternative arrangements’, if any, she has been able to cobble together. If the nutters in the European Research Group won’t buy it, the Tory Remainers may have one last chance to demonstrate that they do actually have a backbone - if indeed they do. cripes2How is it possible that Corbyn comes out the bigger loser from last night’s latest episode of the Brexit farce? It surely requires a leader of exceptional ineffectiveness to have presided over last night’s debacle. The Labour party’s role has been absolutely woeful throughout Brexit, right from its failure to campaign strongly for remain in 2016. NowThatYouAskThe serious miscalculation here is that Britain hasn’t recognised the cost to the EU of the single market losing its integrity. In the eyes of the EU, having a blurry border in Ireland sets a precedent that makes their other external borders impossible to defend. This poses a greater cost and a greater risk to the whole of the EU than does a no-deal Brexit and for this reason they will not move. London has miscalculated. stuart255The UK signed up to the Good Friday Agreement after years of hard work to bring about and sustain peace in Northern Ireland and Ireland. Yesterday we saw parliament vote to refuse to accept May’s deal with the EU if we don’t have the right to renege on the GFA, which apparently parliament wishes to do, otherwise why kick up such a monster fuss over something we don’t want to do. So, parliament wants to scrap the GFA so we can make some trade deals. Can we sink any lower?

A party spokesman said they would be “spoken to by the whips’ office in the next few days”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/49de613280a178903c29454856c406b2c8cb0ba2/0_59_2936_1762/master/2936.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e769f2dfa9c1eb2ae768290a5a127c48","title":"jeremy hunt admits brexit may have to be delayed to avoid no deal","story":"Foreign secretary says article 50 extension may be necessary if deal agreed close to deadlineThe foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, has admitted article 50 may have to be extended to avoid the UK crashing out of the EU without a deal on 29 March.The government had consistently ruled out seeking an extension and on Tuesday whipped its MPs to vote down an amendment to ask for a delay. But, speaking to BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, Hunt conceded a delay might be necessary if an agreement with the EU was reached with only days to spare before the March deadline.Asked if a technical delay would be necessary, Hunt said: “That depends on how long this process takes. It is true that if we ended up approving a deal in the days before the 29 March, then we might need some extra time to pass critical legislation. But if we are able to make progress sooner then that might not be necessary.”Speaking ahead of an informal summit with his EU27 counterparts in Romania, Hunt described the Brexit impasse as “a very challenging situation”.He claimed changes to the withdrawal agreement could be made if the UK could allay Irish fears concerns about a possible hard border and those of the wider EU about the integrity of the single market. He said: “Provided we can meet these very reasonable concerns from our friends in Ireland about not having a hard border and concerns in the EU about access to the single market – provided we can do that, which I think we can, then I think there is a way through.”He played down the insistence in Dublin and Brussels that negotiations on the withdrawal agreement would not be reopened.Hunt said: “These are negotiations. People’s first reaction when you make some new proposal to break a deadlock is to say ‘no, no, no that’s completely impossible’, but in reality the EU said to us: tell us what parliament can unite behind – we’ve done that. Secondly we will now put together some proposal that makes sure we don’t breach these two very important principles for the EU.”He said Crawford Falconer, the chief trade negotiator at the Department for International Trade, would not be added to the team leading the negotiations with Brussels, despite assurances given to Brexiter MPs.Hunt said: “To my knowledge there has not been a change in the team.” But he added: “I’m sure we are going to tap into his brilliance. He’s an extraordinary man and a very, very experienced trade negotiator … I would be very surprised if he wasn’t feeding into the process.”He also admitted that the business secretary, Greg Clark, was wary of technical alternatives to the Irish backstop put forward in the so-called Malthouse compromise.Pressed on what alternative arrangements the government would be proposing to the EU, Hunt said: “We have put these proposals together, we have to work them up, we have to go through them in detail with our partners in the EU … It is going to take a few days to do that, but we are not going to spell those out on air.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e71a4b9cc0b37d9495492df43a5215086fc265a0/0_39_3024_1814/master/3024.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1d461076352bfced251c3cc2a533772c","title":"brexit latest news developments uk may have to delay leaving eu jeremy hunt admits politics live","story":"Rolling coverage of the day’s political developments as they happen, including the latest on the Brexit deadlockAt the lobby briefing this morning the prime minister’s spokesman also dismissed Jeremy Hunt’s suggestion that article 50 may be delayed. (See 8.57am.) Asked about Hunt’s comment, the spokesman said the government was “determined” to ensure all arrangements were in place for the UK to leave on time. He went on: The prime minister’s position on this is unchanged. We are leaving on March 29.This morning the Times splashed with a story (paywall) saying the government is exploring the idea of promising to spend money on leave-voting former mining communities in the hope of getting some of the Labour MPs who represent those areas to back Theresa May’s Brexit deal. The paper reports:The prime minister’s allies believe that she needs the backing of about 20 Labour MPs for a modified agreement to offset the number of Tory rebels, even if she wins the support of the DUP.Potential Labour backers are now being wooed with the promise of local investment as Downing Street increases efforts to build a parliamentary majority before a second vote.“There’s a willingness to look again at coalfield communities and make good the promises that former Labour governments failed to deliver,” a well-placed government source said. “It’s about allowing Labour MPs representing Brexit communities to show that they have extracted something tangible in return for their vote. And, frankly, it’s not an unreasonable ask.”One of those involved in the negotiations said that Downing Street was pressing for details of potential investments. “We are being asked to get all our demands in as soon as possible. There is a real urgency about this all of a sudden.”At the Downing Street lobby briefing this morning the prime minister’s spokesman rejected the idea that this amounted to “cash for votes”. When this was put to him, he replied: “I absolutely wouldn’t characterise it like that.” But otherwise he was happy to confirm that the government was considering pumping money into these areas. The spokesman said:The prime minister has a long-standing commitment to tackling inequality between communities.We are determined to lead a programme of national renewal post-Brexit by rebuilding and reconnecting communities, driving prosperity and unleashing the potential and creativity of hard-working people in every part of our country. No community should feel that they are left behind.The Sun’s Steve Hawkes says government MPs may be on a one-line whip during the February recess. A one-line whip means MPs don’t have to turn up. Like me (see 11.15am), he suspects this may just be about ensuring that the government does not get criticised for letting MPs take a holiday at a time of crisis.This is what Andrea Leadsom, the leader of the Commons, told MPs about the prospect of the February recess being cancelled. She said:The House will know that recess dates are always announced subject to the progress of business. In this unique session of parliament, and in light of the significant decisions taken by the House this week, it is only right that I give the House notice that there are currently no plans to bring forward a motion to agree dates for the February recess, and that the House may therefore need to continue to sit to make progress on the key business before the House.I realise that this is short notice for colleagues for House staff, but I do think our constituents will expect that the House is able to continue to make progress at this important time. I will endeavour to provide confirmation of the sitting arrangements and business for February as soon as possible.MPs were expecting the government to cancel the February recess because there is a backlog of legislation that needs to be passed before Brexit, and it is hard to see how there will be time for it all to go through without MPs having to sit longer hours.But what is curious is that, at the moment, most of this legislation cannot be passed because the government does not have a Brexit deal. Today, as she does every Thursday, Leadsom announced the Commons business for next week and, as you can see, it is remarkably light. There is no Brexit legislation on the agenda, and the motions that are being debated certainly don’t need a full four days.Ministers want to keep open the option of cancelling the February recess, just in case there is a deal before 14 February. But, based on what Jeremy Hunt was saying this morning (see 9.44am), that seems highly unlikely.But Leadsom seemed to imply that the recess would be abandoned, regardless of whether or not there was a deal. Why? She may have given it away when she said: “Our constituents will expect that the House is able to continue to make progress at this important time.” Even if there is no Brexit legislation ready to pass in the February half-term, MPs are like to be sitting in the chamber anyway to convey the impression they are taking the crisis seriously.Andrea Leadsom, the leader of the Commons, has just announced in business questions that the government may have to cancel the February recess. She said it was important for parliament to be able to make progress at this time.She apologised for the inconvenience to MPs, and to staff who work in the Commons.MPs were due to start their half-term recess after Thursday 14 February, and return to the Commons on Monday 25 February.One of the great unknowns in British politics at the moment is whether or not the EU would be willing to re-open the Brexit deal. Amongst Brexiters it is axiomatic that, whatever EU leaders are saying now in public, in practice, when faced with the prospect of a no-deal Brexit, at the last minute Brussels would back down. Pro-Europeans seem inclined to take what EU leaders say at face value, not least because during the Brexit process EU statements have turned out to be a more reliable guide to eventual outcomes than UK government ones. As far as anyone can tell, the Downing Street view seems to be somewhere in the middle that some “give” will be possible, but only up to a point.On the Today programme this morning Sir Martin Donnelly, a former permanent secretary at the Department for International Trade, was asked for his opinion. Did he think that, when EU leaders rule out renegotiating the withdrawal agreement, we should take them at face value? Yes, he said. He explained:This agreement took 18 months of tough, detailed negotiation. It’s over 500 pages of legal text. And that’s really important in the Brussels setting. And now the concrete has set very hard around it. It’s just not possible for any negotiators, however brilliant, to go back and say: ‘We want to re-open a fundamental part of this deal. We’re not quite sure how exactly we’re going to do that, but it’s very important we do it in a couple of weeks.’ People in Brussels just don’t that that seriously, I’m afraid.Donnelly also said that there would be a “serious paralysis” of parts of the British economy in the event of a no-deal Brexit. He said:There is so much just-in-time trade, there is millions of lorries and containers crossing the border, particularly in the Dover choke point every year, it’s just not possible to put in extra controls and expect that system to continue working. Sooner or later, probably in a matter of weeks, there would be serious paralysis of significant parts of the UK economy.There are 10,000 containers a day just for the motor industry, components for example. Then there is all the fresh food. Then there is the fact that, if lorries get stuck in Dover or Calais, then they can’t be moving between Leeds and Manchester. And our transport system is very integrated. So the whole thing just isn’t going to work.When it was put to Donnelly that other ports could take some of the traffic currently going through Dover and Calais, he replied:You have to look at the reality here. I think, if you talk to the Freight Association, if you look at the space in ports, there just isn’t room. There isn’t space in, say, Holyhead for all the traffic that now goes smoothly to Ireland and back ... You can’t just say we will just fix up a few car parks and it will all work. All the evidence is, it won’t.While Brexit machinations continue at Westminster, Thursday at Holyrood sees the first parliamentary vote on the SNP’s budget, with cross-party negotiations ongoing to muster enough support to pass the SNP minority government’s plans. While the SNP have previously relied upon the Scottish Greens, this year a row over council funding means their support is still wavering.Indeed, the Scotsman is reporting this morning that Nicola Sturgeon has warned her party to prepare for a possible Scottish election if the Holyrood government fails to pass its budget today. According to the Scotsman, during a meeting of the SNP group at Westminster attended by Sturgeon on Monday, she warned her MPs that they should prepare for a snap Holyrood election if the SNP government fails to get its budget through. This adds to speculation that Sturgeon may seek a fresh mandate from the electorate to secure another referendum on independence, as she prepares to reveal her plans in the coming weeks.The Scottish Green’s Andy Wightman was on BBC Radio Scotland this morning insisting that his party were not being “obstructive”. Although they have the promise of legislation by the end of this parliament and a green light for a local tourist tax, the sticking point remains their call for a hefty increase in spending on local government this year. It’s going to be a long day at Holyrood. Here is a full summary of what Jeremy Hunt, the foreign secretary, said in his Today programme interview about Brexit.The first thing we have to do is demonstrate that our commitment to the Belfast agreement, the Good Friday agreement, is absolute. And we will do that.Secondly, we have to show that any solution that changes the backstop won’t lead to us trying to access the single market by the back door. And we recognise that the way that we access the single market, because we are not going to be embracing free movement, will change.If we can overcome those two issues, which I think we can, then I think we will be able to have substantive discussions.But this is not going to happen in the next few days. We have to put these proposals together, we have to work them up, we have to go through them in detail with our partners in the EU.This is significant because Theresa May has already said that, if no deal is reached by Wednesday 13 February, she will make a statement to MPs, and table an amendable motion to be debated the following day (ie, a fortnight today). Hunt’s comments implied that he does not expected a deal before then, and that the debate will go ahead. The EU has already made it clear, from its reaction to the Commons votes on Tuesday, that it is not about to offer a compromise and today’s Times even says that “Angela Merkel will ‘go to the edge of the precipice’ with Theresa May as the European Union prepares to reject any change to the withdrawal agreement in time for a crucial vote in two weeks.” Bruno Waterfield’s story (paywall) goes on: “Diplomatic sources said the German chancellor believed that people needed ‘to look into the abyss before a deal is done at five to midnight — that is how she works’.”When Hunt was asked if he agreed, he refused to endorse what Clark said. Instead he said:We have to show the EU, and show Ireland, that our commitment to the Belfast, Good Friday agreement, is absolutely unconditional. In fact, it is quite distressing for people like me and you, who grew up in the 1980s with bombs going off in Harrods or in Hyde Park and all over the country - any suggestion that we would ever waver in our support for the peace process, which was the greatest achievement of both John Major and Tony Blair, is absolute nonsense.Hunt was responding to Ian Blackford, the SNP’s leader at Westminster, saying on Tuesday night that the vote calling for an alternative to the backstop showed that the Conservative party had “effectively ripped apart the Good Friday agreement”. This claim has clearly infuriated Tory MPs, who repeatedly raised it in the Commons chamber yesterday.Brexit may have to be delayed, a senior member of the government has now admitted. This is not, of itself, a startling observation - in Brussels this has been the working assumption for some time - but it is not something that anyone at the top of government has ever said this bluntly before. Whenever Theresa May gets asked about the prospect of article 50 being delayed, she either says the UK is leaving on 29 March, period, or, in her more candid moments, says that this is not an option being considered. But on the Today programme this morning Jeremy Hunt, the foreign secretary, was much more direct. When it was put to him that it was “likely” that Brexit would have to be delayed, he did not challenge the premise of the question. Instead he replied:I think that depends on how long this process takes. I think it is true that if we ended up approving a deal in the days before the 29th March, then we might need some extra time to pass critical legislation. But if we are able to make progress sooner then, that might not be necessary. We can’t know at this stage exactly which of those scenarios would happen.I will post more from his interview soon.Here is the agenda for the day.9.30am: Annual figures on rough sleeping are published.10.10m: Geoffrey Cox, the attorney general, takes questions in the Commons.10.15am: Jeremy Corbyn holds a meeting in Ilkeston focusing on bus services.After 10.30am: Andrea Leadsom, the leader of the Commons, takes business questions in the Commons.11.30am: Jeremy Wright, the culture secretary, speaks at the doteveryone conference.2.30pm: MSPs start debating the Scottish government’s budget.

Inside, Patricia Angol is playing the xylophone, Mui Tang is touching a Kaoss Pad – an audio effects unit – and Fathima Maharali is singing into a microphone. When they finish, their session leader, Jack Daley, fiddles on a computer, overlaying each musical section before playing it back. There are smiles and high-fives all round.Daley is a music producer who works at the Daylight centre for adults with learning disabilities, which is run by Islington council. He started private and group sessions composing and producing electronic music with service users two years ago. Since then, countless song lyrics have been written, an EP has been released (with another on the way), and there’s an animated music video to go with the title track, Watermelon Fantasy. Everything has been produced by the people who attend the centre with the help of creative professionals.One service user who features on Watermelon Fantasy is 36-year-old Tina Bruins. She’s always loved listening to music so jumped at the chance to record her own. “I like doing this because I get frustrated and bored at home,” she says. Bruins, who has behavioural difficulties, also benefits from the sessions because they are an outlet for her anger: “It’s a release for me and it stops me winding myself up and kicking out.” Daley adds: “Having an hour focusing on Tina’s life helps her concentrate and get out of her head. She’s got a lot of energy and doesn’t have the resources to use it in a positive way when she’s out of the centre.”Daley fell into this line of work after finishing an MA in music production four years ago. He had experience in care and came to the centre originally as a stopgap until he found a job in music. He spotted a room that was being used for storage and asked if he could turn it into a studio. The centre has a fund for activities, which allowed him to spend around £3,000 on recording equipment, and he hasn’t looked back since. “There’s an equality through doing creative and artistic work with these guys because they interact so emotionally,” he says. “They’re free and open to explore the instruments. It feels so genuine, even if the music ends up sounding really weird.”Olly Price, a professional songwriter who runs a label and also leads sessions at the centre, has worked with Daley and the service users on some of the music. He says: “Some of the tracks are unique and amazing. They’re a challenging listen and I hope people will like them on that basis. There are also a few tracks that have crossover appeal. They’re universally catchy, and weird and wonderful.”Both Price and Daley see this as more than just making music. The sessions act as a way of empowering people, encouraging them to talk about their lives, build confidence and form bonds with others.Bruins and the others at the centre are lucky that this type of activity is on offer. The landscape in the UK for people with learning disabilities is grim. Austerity has hit councils, who fund day centres, hard. A recent review found that available funding to support people with learning disabilities is insufficient, and cuts have been detrimental to them, their families and carers. Iniduals have lost social support and are experiencing increased social isolation.Price, who also runs a company that sends musicians into day centres and care homes around London, has seen this worsening environment first-hand. “It’s devastating. Where I used to go to loads of day centres 12 years ago, we no longer really do. A lot have withered on the vine because people can’t afford to go to them anymore.”He thinks part of the reason for this is that people with learning disabilities are “pretty invisible”. He says: “They’re in a bubble that the rest of the public doesn’t see and I think this is connected to why they’ve lost a lot of their funding. They’re not an effective lobby group and they don’t have a strong voice to stand up for themselves.”He adds: “These are people who don’t fit into the normal boxes of society. I think that’s captured in these tracks. I hope people will see that. I hope Kanye West picks up on one of the samples and turns it into a global phenomenon.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5b310cb7d9c1720fa812d629c73b4c5c34d038d9/0_7_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=325b4eaaede14b2e648d9ceb01f70f36","title":"rough sleeping rises in nearly all englands major cities london birmingham","story":"Rough sleeping rose in almost all England’s major cities last year, and across five of its nine regions, according to official figures.That overall figure will be a source of optimism for ministers, who have pledged to halve rough sleeping by 2022, and eradicate it entirely by 2027.However, Labour’s John Healey, the shadow housing secretary, said: “These new figures are desperately disappointing and show ministers must do much more to make good the huge damage done over the last eight years.“This new count shows that rough sleeping has more than doubled since 2010, but even these figures mask the true scale of the problem, as the government’s numbers are well known to be flawed and a massive undercount of the true level of rough sleeping.”Centrepoint’s head of public affairs, Paul Noblet, said: “Today’s snapshot statistics may show a slight decrease in the number of people rough sleeping but these figures are the tip of a much larger iceberg as they only attempt to count the number of people sleeping rough on one night of the year.“We know that for every rough sleeper seen on our streets, there are many more hidden homeless people who are sofa-surfing, staying in unsafe or unsuitable accommodation or putting themselves in desperate situations to find a bed for the night.”Research for the Crisis charity by Heriot Watt University estimated 12,300 people in Britain were sleeping on the streets last year, with a further 12,000 spending the night in cars, trains, buses or tents.The 10 local authority areas with highest number of rough sleepers were: Westminster, where there were 306 Camden (141) Manchester (123) Birmingham (91) Bristol (82) Newham (79) Enfield (78) Hillingdon (70) City of London (67), and Brighton and Hove (64).Rough sleeper figures are based on one-night counts or paper estimates carried out in October or November. They are defined as people sleeping, about to bed down or bedded down on the street, in doorways, parks, tents, and sheds, but does not include people in hostels or shelters."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/da132fd85f66ef64ae5033d465e1279c0e7aa026/79_98_1943_1166/master/1943.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=86a76b40897c6c2b090368dd6737e9e2","title":"england ireland six nations manu tuilagi elliot daly rugby union","story":"England have kept faith with Elliot Daly at full-back and named Jack Nowell on the right wing in their starting XV to face Ireland in Dublin on Saturday. Henry Slade and Manu Tuilagi have been paired in midfield with Owen Farrell captaining the team from fly-half.Head coach Eddie Jones has also opted to kick off the Six Nations by recalling George Kruis alongside his Saracens team-mate Maro Itoje in the second-row and shifting Mark Wilson to blindside flanker in a team showing six changes and one positional switch from the starting side which beat Australia 37-18 in November.The Wasps scrum-half Dan Robson is in line to win his first cap off the bench but there is no place in the matchday 23 for Mike Brown, who had been hoping for a recall at full-back, or Joe Launchbury. Instead Jones has retained Daly at 15 and invited Tuilagi to make his first Six Nations start for six years in the absence of the sidelined Ben Te’o. Injuries have severely restricted the Leicester centre’s Test opportunities in recent times but he remains a formidable physical presence.Slade and Nowell have both been rewarded for their good recent form for Exeter, while Kruis’s specialist lineout skills have earned him the nod ahead of both Launchbury and Courtney Lawes. England have not won in Dublin since 2013 and have not scored a try at the Aviva Stadium on their last three visits.“It is well documented no one thinks we can win but I can tell you everyone inside our camp believes we can win,” said Jones. “We are hugely looking forward to the weekend. I think it is quite clear to beat Ireland you have to beat them in the contest area. They are very good at the breakdown and in the air. Both those areas are a priority for us.“Traditionally England and Ireland games are always very close, they are tough affairs, there is a lot of emotion in the games so our ability to finish the game strongly is going to be vital.”On Tuilagi’s selection Jones said: “I just felt for this game the best option was to play Owen Farrell at 10 and Manu as a like-for-like replacement for Ben Te’o.

Sarah Hunter, the England captain, will be anxious to show their Twickenham paymasters that awarding her and 27 other top players full-time contracts will have the instant idend of taking their grand slam title back from France.Ireland, beaten 37-15 at Twickenham in the autumn, will have other ideas. It is expected to be chilly with the threat of snow at Energia Park and, if the Six Nations is a two-horse Anglo-French race, Ireland will be determined that Hunter’s side will have little in the way of soft-going.England, though, are loaded with experience, including their increasingly impressive leader Hunter, who will pack down in the Red Roses’ back row for the 109th time. Hunter is joined in the starting lineup by Emily Scarratt who forges a new centre partnership with Tatyana Heard and wins her 75th cap in Dublin.Scarratt is best remembered for slaloming through the Canadian defence in Paris in the World Cup final in 2014 to score the try that ensured the Red Roses’ finest hour. She has recovered from a hamstring injury to make her 15-a-side comeback after being given a contract following the end of her England sevens contract.But the 28-year-old admits that giving up the chance to play sevens in the Tokyo Olympics next year was not an easy one, even allowing for her Jonny Wilkinson moment. “No it wasn’t easy. I would have loved to have gone to Tokyo but sevens is a game for young players and I’m in the twilight of my career and this is a great opportunity.“Contracts have made a real difference to the girls who were having to fit in training sessions between work. It’s much easier to prepare for matches like this now and we have time to recover from matches.“It won’t be easy in Dublin. They’ve got players like Lauren Delany and Claire Molloy who are playing with us in the Tyrrells League. We’ve got some good memories from winning a grand slam there two years ago but we’re expecting a tough evening. Yes, everyone is talking about the France game as being the key fixture in the Six Nations but we won’t be underestimating Ireland.”Simon Middleton, England’s head coach, knows that the weather conditions are likely to be testing. “It could turn out to be a forward battle but we have a pack to cope with that,” he said.“Ireland are a good side. They’re better than the result in November suggested. They were a bit unlucky really, losing a couple of key players early on. But we’ve got some world‑class players like Emily returning from the 2017 World Cup as well as some newer names who’ve impressed through the season.”Poppy Cleall, meanwhile, is in England’s second row with her twin sister, the prop Bryony poised to win her first cap from the bench. An illustration of Middleton’s strength in depth is that the wing Lydia Thompson, who scored a hat-trick against Ireland two months ago, three of 21 tries England scored in three internationals in November, does not make the cut for Dublin.Ireland’s head coach, Adam Griggs, knows England will be favourites. “There’s no bigger challenge than to open against the side that are second in the world,” he said.Ireland have a strong back row that includes the Wasps openside Molloy and the captain and No 8 Ciara Griffin. England will also be wary of the threat of the dangerous Munster right-wing Eimear Considine who scored a brilliant try against them in the autumn.Elsewhere on the opening weekend, France begin the defence of their title against Wales on Saturday evening in Montpellier while Scotland take on Italy at Scotstoun on Friday night. France, who travel to Doncaster to face England in the second round, are missing their injured world player of the year, Jessy Tremouliere, as well as a number of players who are on sevens duty."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/57812f20d25adb525681908b9d760f383a69de2d/0_43_1770_1062/master/1770.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9f193ca2d59710b28177cd32c42c32de","title":"hugh mcilvanney ireland v england in dublin and blindfolded boxing","story":"This week’s roundup also features the Patriots and Rams’ Super Bowl highs, hockey fights and underarm box cricket1) The legendary writer Hugh McIlvanney, “a giant among journalists”, died last week at the age of 84.

England may have labelled the defending champions “boring” this week, but both teams will go some to match this fixture in 1963, a mud-caked nightmare that ended 0-0. It was a livelier affair in 2007 at Croke Park, when Ireland thumped their old rivals 43-13 – but went on to lose the title to France on points difference thanks to Elvis Vermeulen’s last-gasp try against Scotland. Finally, something for England fans to cheer: a 42-6 thumping that sealed the grand slam in 2003.3) Super Bowl Sunday is approaching, with the New England Patriots into their ninth Big Dance of the Bill Belichick era. The Pats’ first title came in 2002 against this weekend’s opponents, the Rams – then of St Louis. Not for the last time, second-year QB Tom Brady led his team down the field to set-up a game-winning field goal.

The Belgian dance-theatre company Peeping Tom follow up their hit show Mother with the second work in a family-themed trilogy. Fathers may be the focus, but really this seems like a show about ageing, the confusion and indignity of losing your agency and your concrete grasp on the world. Before us is a desolate hall with dim lights and trestle tables. It slowly dawns that we’re in an old people’s home, albeit one where nice middle-aged ladies play drums in jazz bands and a woman’s head pops out of a saucepan of soup.This oddball company’s work is made of visual jokes, rubber-bodied dance and an eerie not-quite-normality that is all entertainingly surreal. The sense of shifting reality suits this theme – the questioning of memory, the slipping of the self – and family dynamics, as ever, make rich material for the stage. Father picks up the frustrations of relationships where tempers are quick to rise (“You always ask the same questions!”), and the tenderness, exasperation and impatience of dealing with elderly parents.There are some silly gags – a bit of slapstick with a telescopic broom steals the show – but also brief moments that are truly harrowing: one man can’t remember his daughter’s name another is browbeaten and treated like a child. Other scenes are heartening. When a wizened, lank-haired man leaves an audience of elderly ladies swooning as he takes to the piano for a wobbly voiced chorus of Feelings, we’re reminded that older people are not a problem to be solved or pitied, but people with personalities, pasts and inner lives.The older members of the cast are joined by five younger dancers, whose bodies stretch and ping in elastic-limbed contortions, taking tiny actions, like battling away an insect or putting on a shoe, and expanding them into frantic numbers. There’s a question mark over what some of this dance adds, other than their bodies enhancing a sense of pliable reality, but Father is confident in the creation of its world, distinctive in its voice and poignant in its subject matter."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9d91fe2301f0cf6fbedd305de497e41ea937e4bd/0_0_4708_2826/master/4708.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9fa853a64dad203084aeb1879d08dd5b","title":"send a tip on a living museum in the uk for the chance to win a 200 hotel voucher","story":"Tell us about an immersive museum or historic site you’ve visited in the UK that brings the past to life.

The circular trek peaks three times – each at over 5,000 metres – and is regarded as the highest trek in Peru. I completed the circuit at 16 and while fit, I was hardly a finely tuned athlete. But acclimatising to altitude is essential. You are rewarded with some of the most stunning scenery in the world – with plenty of glaciers and cobalt-blue lakes. It’s a five-night camping trip so it’s handy there are several hot springs en route for bathing. We travelled from Cusco having spent three days acclimatising there, taking a three-hour drive to the start of the trek (4,000 metres) in Tinqui. We went with Outlook Expeditions, who put us in touch with a local guide. FreyaLie back and enjoy the glow-worms, they said, and they were right. Black water rafting in the underground cave system in Waitomo, North Island, is such fun that once won’t feel like enough. We were guided through the caves in provided wetsuits, holding onto our rubber tyres as we zip-wired from one cave system to another. We then plunged into pools to float and glide effortlessly along the subterranean stream. And to top it off, looking up, it’s not stars that you see but hundreds of glow-worms shining brightly on the cave roof. • Tour from NZ$125 (around £65), waitomoPaulLast April, I enjoyed a trek in the central desert in Iran (Dasht-e Kavir) where, with a local guide, I encountered amazing scenery, lots of wild camels, lizards and mindblowingly stark, empty salt flats. I camped and stayed in local hotels in the oases with their pistachio nut shrubs and roses and have never met such friendly people. I finished off the trip with a few days amid the empty beaches, mangroves, salt caves and gorges of Qeshm Island in the Strait of Hormuz. The cost of the trip, through Tehran-based Adventure Iran, was £495pp for six days, food, guide and transfers. I am going back soon, further south, to visit the Lut desert, which has a claim to be the hottest place on Earth, having recorded over 70C. Bernard PhelanLast summer, with my husband, I went on a road trip in the States. We had hoped to do lots of hiking, but we arrived in the middle of a 35C heatwave, so we changed our plans. We contacted Regis Canoe Outfitters, on the Saranac River (New York state), and spent the next three days canoeing around lakes and creeks, interspersed with lengthy dips to cool ourselves down. At night, we listened to the croaking of frogs from one of the many free wild camping spots. The camping sites are free, but designated, and are generally first come, first served. If you get lucky, you can have your own private island for the night, at zero cost. True bliss and so much better than hiking in the stifling heat.• Canoe hire for three days $52, canoeoutfittersBreeLast November, I ran the Extreme West Atlantic Trail race in Flores island in the Azores. The route, on a hard hiking trail, stretches 36km through mountainous terrain. The morning mist lifting in the volcanic crater lakes, the spectacular waterfalls, the dense forest and the old brick walkways and dry-stone walls gave the sense of a place lost in time. I stayed on the west coast of the island (the most western point in Europe), in Casas da Cascata (doubles from €70), a beautiful stone house under a waterfall. Sara Cycling the Four Rivers route from Seoul to Busan is a glorious trip along 600km of generally flat cycle path and quiet country roads covering the length of the country. Accommodation is cheap and plentiful with options from camping to hotels. We found local people to be extremely welcoming, even if you can’t speak Korean. Food was cheap and plentiful and the mountainous scenery was stunning. Taken at your own pace it’s as painful or relaxing as you want it to be, and the best way to see this gem of a country. Summer mosquitos mean autumn and spring are the best times to make the trip, excellent for foliage and wild flowers, too.BenI took a six-night swim trip with Strel in warm turquoise waters taking in the Gulf of Kotor, the stunning Plava Spilja (Blue Grotto) and in Yugoslavian submarine tunnels.

Enjoy the reading!”The tweet was posted in October last year by the account @HackingRedstone, according to the filing. A reporter was also offered leaked material via a direct message the same day. The account has since been removed from Twitter.Mueller’s court filing on Wednesday said the names and structure of folders containing the leaked files matched those used by Mueller’s office when it shared the data, and that these had not been made public.The prosecutors said the filesharing site had confirmed to the FBI that the account which posted the material was registered from an IP address – an identifier for devices connected to the internet – in Russia.FBI investigators had found no evidence that government servers holding the data had been hacked, according to Mueller’s team, pointing instead to a leak on the Russian side. Mueller disclosed the leak in a filing as part of his prosecution of Concord Management and Consulting, a Russian company that allegedly funded hacking operations by Russia’s notorious Internet Research Agency (IRA).The filing argued that attorneys for Concord should not be given access to “sensitive” evidence gathered by Mueller’s team for the case.It said: “The person who created the webpage used their knowledge of the non-sensitive discovery to make it appear as though the irrelevant files contained on the webpage were the sum total evidence of ‘IRA and Russian collusion’ gathered by law enforcement in this matter in an apparent effort to discredit the investigation.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aa5a0c119b9196b341ebb858f5379523e6fd014c/0_13_4000_2401/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9b7a4832a1f1b4e1bc28d78e876c31f6","title":"polar vortex us weather latest temperatures midwest east","story":"Thousands of flights canceled, schools close, and post office halts deliveries as Chicago lows approach recordFrozen Arctic winds brought record-low temperatures across much of the US midwest on Wednesday, as a blast of Arctic air known as the polar vortex unnerved residents accustomed to brutal winters.As of Wednesday evening, at least eight deaths were linked to the system, including an elderly Illinois man who was found several hours after he fell trying to get into his home and a University of Iowa student found behind an academic hall several hours before dawn. A man was struck by a snowplow in the Chicago area, a young couple’s SUV struck another on a snowy road in northern Indiana and a Milwaukee man froze to death in a garage, authorities said.Classes were canceled Wednesday and Thursday in many cities, including Chicago, home of the country’s third-largest school system, and police warned of the risk of accidents on icy highways.In a rare move, the US Postal Service appeared to temporarily set aside its credo that “neither snow nor rain ... nor gloom of night” would stop its work: it halted deliveries from parts of the Dakotas through Ohio.Temperatures in Chicago dropped to a low of around -23F (-30C) on Wednesday, slightly above the city’s lowest-ever reading, from January 1985. With the wind chill factor, temperatures in Los Angeles felt about 100F warmer than Chicago on Wednesday morning.Andrew Orrison, a meteorologist with the service, said the some of the coldest wind chills were recorded in International Falls, Minnesota, at -55F (-48C).

Some isolated areas could see as low as -40F (-40C), according to the National Weather Service. Daytime highs could climb into the single digits before warming up to the comparatively balmy 20s (-7 to -2 celsius) by Friday.

Advocates said there are rarely enough shelter beds for all homeless people.“I’m cold and I’m afraid,” Tony Neeley, a homeless Chicago resident, told the New York Times Tuesday evening. The mayor of Lansing, Michigan reported shelters in his city were becoming “overloaded,” and a senior advisor to the mayor of Detroit worried anyone who refused help would “freeze or lose a limb”, according to the Detroit News.Many cities opened warming shelters in government buildings, churches, high schools and charities. At the same time, powerful wind gusts have brought down tree limbs and knocked out power as temperatures began to fall. In Indiana, trees downed power lines as temperatures hit -10F.Some people shared pictures of their pet’s multi-layered winter outfits, and reminded people to bring pets inside.At least 2,700 flights were canceled nationwide on Wednesday, largely in Chicago’s two main airports. Another 1,800 flights scheduled for Thursday were also called off.Amtrak said it had canceled all trains in and out of the city, where Hurley forecast -15F on Wednesday and a record-low -27F on Thursday.

Now it’s poised to take on a $10bn Pentagon projectFirst it sold books. Then it added gadgetry, groceries and chipper virtual assistants. But Amazon’s latest expansion will take many shoppers by surprise.In the none-to-distant future, US soldiers may rely on Amazon-run systems to trade intelligence, relay orders and call for help. Drone footage might be scoured for wanted men and women by Amazon software. Defense department quartermasters would use Amazon technology to move ammunition and supplies.For Jeff Bezos, it’s not a question of whether customers will mind his company’s defense ambitions, or of complaints raised by civil liberties advocates. As Amazon’s face and founder casts it, the issue is one of patriotism.“This is a great country and it does need to be defended,” Bezos said during an October WIRED magazine summit. “If big tech companies are going to turn their back on US Department of Defense, this country is going to be in trouble.”Now Amazon is the leading contender for a 10-year, $10bn project to accelerate the Pentagon’s move into cloud computing. The Pentagon has said the goal of the Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure – widely known by its Star Wars-styled acronym, Jedi – is to increase American “lethality” by replacing its antiquated, segmented IT systems.Amazon is widely regarded as the strongest contender for the Jedi contract, which is expected to be inked in early 2019, in part because its ision Amazon Web Services already dominates American cloud computing. One 2017 estimate found AWS held more than half the worldwide cloud computing market. AWS hosts top secret data for the CIA, supports federal agencies from the justice department to Nasa, powers the national immigration case management system and stores hundreds of millions of identity documents.Jedi is expected to inject modern technology into a creaky system. An audit in November found that “systemic flaws” in defense department networks invite hacking, and that the department’s finance systems were so disorganized they could not be audited. Jedi is a first step toward a system that will handle tasks as erse as frontline communications, medical records management and scheduling.The finished system will move petabytes of data between every continent except Antarctica. Service members at the “tactical edge” will be equipped with rugged devices enabling them to check into the cloud. Modular data centers will be deployed to forward bases. The Pentagon hopes those can operate in space.If Amazon wins the Jedi contract and another contract to open a government e-commerce portal, the company will “vault from being a bit player to becoming one of the 10 most-dominant federal contractors, with potential to become one of the largest in relatively short order”, said Steven Schooner, a professor of government procurement law at George Washington University.Amazon makes no apologies for moving aggressively into the public sector in this way.“We feel strongly that the defense, intelligence and national security communities deserve access to the best technology in the world and we are committed to supporting their critical missions of protecting our citizens and defending our country,” a spokesperson for the Seattle-based company said, responding to a request for comment from the .The proposition that Amazon should defend America can be seen as a logical extension of a mission Bezos laid down in his 1997 letter to shareholders. Amazon targets dysfunctional systems that aren’t serving customers well – from book distribution to home delivery to computer networking – and leads their reinvention.“We will continue to focus relentlessly on our customers,” Bezos wrote. “We will make bold rather than timid investment decisions where we see a sufficient probability of gaining market leadership advantages.”Bezos is not the first in his family in the defense sector. His formative influences included his grandfather Lawrence Preston Gise, who is usually described in press accounts as Bezos would’ve known him – a semi-retired rancher showing his grandson how to castrate bulls. Yet Gise also made his living as a defense researcher and manager during the early days of the cold war and ultimately ran the New Mexico office of the Atomic Energy Commission, which was in charge of America’s civilian and military nuclear programs until the 1970s.Big tech and the defense industry have been intertwined since the second world war, when military funding financed the development of the first all-digital computers, said Margaret O’Mara, a University of Washington history professor. That connection deepened as defense money flowed to researchers developing software languages, networks, machine learning and artificial intelligence.“You name it, there’s some defense DNA in there somewhere,” O’Mara said.AWS made a splash in national security circles in 2013 when it launched a $600m cloud network for the CIA and other American intelligence agencies.John Wood, the CEO of Telos, a Virginia-based cybersecurity firm, likened the contract to the “shot heard ‘round the world”.“The CIA, arguably the most security conscious organisation in the world, decided that they were going to move to the cloud,” Wood said. “That really made the rest of the world stand up and take notice, and ask the question, ‘If it’s good enough for them, why isn’t it good enough for us?’”Dozens of agencies – from the FBI to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency – are now AWS users.Critics worry both that a “cloud-industrial complex” is forming as large tech companies wade into national security and that rapidly developing technologies will be misused by the military or police. AI-assisted facial recognition software has been an early flashpoint.Amazon’s move to sell its facial recognition software, Rekognition, to US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) prompted protest from the American Civil Liberties Union, a small group of shareholders and a hundred-or-so employees. Bezos was not deterred. AWS sales teams have also pitched Rekognition at defense industry events.Amazon declined to say which agencies, if any, are using Rekognition. What is clear to observers, though, is AWS’s desire to make money off defense and law enforcement customers.“They’ve been consistent in selling these technologies at trade shows,” said Shankar Narayan of the Washington state affiliate of the ACLU, which in January demanded Amazon, Google and Microsoft to stop selling artificial intelligence-assisted facial recognition to the US government. “They demo’d it to Ice. The FBI is testing it.”Amazon asserts Rekognition can spot Kalashnikovs and faces from a user-selected watchlist in near real-time. Image recognition software greatly speeds the review of surveillance footage. Speaking at an Amazon-organized conference in 2018, Christine Halvorsen, the FBI deputy assistant director for counterterrorism, said analysts combing video of the 2017 Las Vegas massacre could have completed their work in a day if they had access to Rekognition. Instead it took weeks to track the gunman’s movements.Microsoft and Google have, to varying degrees, recognized civil liberties and human rights concerns raised by the new technology. Amazon has largely declined to address the moral dimensions of national security work.“Amazon really has distinguished themselves as being an actor that doesn’t acknowledge any responsibility and really has doubled down on selling these technologies to the government, the military as well as law enforcement,” said Narayan.The company “has largely hewed to the position that their founder has articulated, that society supposedly has this ‘immune response’ to new technologies like these and things will get sorted out on their own”, Narayan said. “That’s an attitude that rests on a great deal of privilege and doesn’t really account for the human lives that are being impacted by this technology in real time.”Amazon declined to respond to the ACLU comments.Amazon is widely regarded as the strongest contender for the Jedi contract. Competition for Jedi has been bitter. Amazon’s rivals – Oracle, IBM and Microsoft – have protested, unsuccessfully thus far, that contract requirements they claim unfairly favor Amazon.Oracle, a California tech giant, sued the federal government in December. Attorneys for Oracle suggested defense department employees with connections to AWS biased the contract in Amazon’s favor. Notably, the AWS General Manager, Deap Ubhi, spent a year as a product director for the Defense Digital Service, the Pentagon’s tech ision. The Pentagon is currently reviewing Ubhi’s work developing the Jedi contract.The impact of the Jedi contract will reverberate. Neil Gordon of the Project On Government Oversight, a watchdog group examining federal contracting, said the Jedi contract may give the winner a lasting advantage in US government cloud computing – “a monopoly over this area for years to come”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/becf5049382ea31977dcd7a3d1f3737bf42cc466/0_384_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2b234f8239702460d40953e4fdc00471","title":"cold as of chicago residents make best of life in chiberia during polar vortex","story":"Residents brave the weather to post photographs on social media showing just how cold things have gotIn “Chiberia” – as locals have dubbed Chicago as temperatures have plummeted to -23F (-30C) – it is cold enough to freeze an egg on the sidewalk. Or to turn a bubble blown outside into a beautiful frosty snow globe before it splinters with the cold.A blast of polar air has swept across many cities in the US leading to the lowest temperatures in a generation. Schools and businesses have closed, flights have been cancelled and as of Wednesday evening, at least eight deaths had been linked to the system.Chicago isn’t the only city hit by the low temperatures, or the coldest, with the temperature dropping to -42F (-41C) in Park Rapids, Minnesota.While the extreme cold is miserable for many, some have been trying to find a bright side. In Chicago, residents have posted photographs on social media showing just how freezing life has become.Local news outlets have made their reporters brave the elements to test whether an egg placed in a frying pan at these temperatures would freeze – the opposite of frying an egg on the sidewalk in extreme heat, which the  Australia team found required hotter temperatures than you might expect.“Cold as ºF,” was the headline on the Loyola Phoenix, the official student newspaper of Loyola University in Chicago and on Tuesday, the Chicago Tribune ran sage weather-related advice on its front page: “Expert: avoid being outside”.But many ignored the expert warnings and ventured into the cold to attempt the “boiling water challenge”, which saw people throw pots of boiling water into the air, which froze before hitting the ground.Others posted videos of bubbles blown outside, which freeze into gorgeous baubles before cracking, or of their fork suspended in mid-air by a waterfall of frozen noodles. The hashtag #DogsofChiberia was created, showing pets rugged up in custom puffer jackets, hats and booties so they could survive a trip outside.Videos also circulated that appeared to show train tracks across Chicago on fire. The fires, which actually run next to the rails, are used by Metra, the Chicago-area commuter rail, to make the rails expand in an attempt to avoid cracks forming and switches clogging.Temperatures in Chicago were expected to fall into the -20s F (-30s C) again on early Thursday, but should warm up to the comparatively balmy 20Fs (-7 to -2C) by Friday."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/169120b21476114112906d60c9fd690a17aed49b/0_0_4940_3380/master/4940.jpg?width=880\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fe2a00a13e6681811322ad642b4792e4 880w","title":"eu leaders must do more to save rule of law in hungary says mep","story":"Judith Sargentini of Dutch Greens says situation has got worse since her report last yearEuropean Union leaders are failing to act despite the “worsening” outlook for the rule of law in Hungary, according to a leading MEP.Judith Sargentini, a Dutch MEP whose report triggered the EU’s most serious disciplinary procedure against Hungary last September, called on the Council of EU member states to start “a real process” that would examine the rule of law in that country.“Since the vote on my report in September things in Hungary actually only got worse,” said the Green MEP.Since MEPs voted to trigger action from EU member states, she said the Central European University had moved to Vienna and the government had created a new court that will be subject to ministerial control.She also listed the decision to award refugee status to a former Macedonian prime minister convicted of corruption, the “slave law” on overtime, which has brought Hungarians on to the streets, as well as the merger of 450 media outlets without authorities being able to make usual checks.The MEP called on Romania, which is chairing the EU rotating presidency, to produce a timetable for examining the rule of law in Hungary, as she accused Budapest of stalling the process. “Hungarian citizens have the right for protection and have the right to know what you are planning to do.”Frans Timmermans, the vice-president of the European commission, said he regretted that Sargentini had not been given a chance to present her analysis of threats to the rule of law in Hungary to EU ministers.The European parliament voted to trigger the EU’s most serious disciplinary procedure against Hungary last September, a move that was supported by some MEPs in the centre-right European People’s party, the group that houses the ruling Fidesz party.Although EU law requires member states to act, the procedure has languished and little progress is expected before European elections in May.Hungary’s government refused to take part in the latest debate in Brussels, saying that the European institutions had been hijacked by “the political left and political liberals” for a political rally. Viktor Orbán’s spokesman, Zoltán Kovács, claimed that the rule of law procedure was a “political plot” linked to the philanthropist George Soros, the Hungarian-born billionaire philanthropist who is subject to relentless attack by the Hungarian government.The government also singled out Timmermans, describing the Dutch EU commissioner as “an arm of these leftist liberal Soros-related organisations”.Timmermans, who is seeking to become the next commission president, rejected attempts to portray him as pursuing his own agenda. “In my work on the rule of law I have the full support of the president of the commission and all of the other members,” he told journalists. “I would be more worried if Viktor Orbán started praising me frankly,” in remarks that highlight the depth of tensions between Brussels and Budapest.During the debate on Wednesday evening Hungary’s government received support from conservative MPs, including members of the group created by David Cameron, once he took the Tories out of the moderate centre-right European People’s party. One Polish MEP, who sits with the British Conservatives, said the “European establishment” had been attacking “people you want to get rid of” ever since the moves to isolate the far-right Austrian leader Jörg Haider.Responding to such points, Timmermans said democracy was always invoked as justification for not complying with EU legislation. Hungary had made the “wonderful” and “sovereign choice” to become a member of the EU. “If you choose to become member of a treaty-based organisation, like the European Union, you by that choice say you will follow the rules of that treaty.”The debate came one day after new research from Transparency International showed that Hungary was deemed to have become more corrupt since Orbán returned to office in 2010. According to Transparency international’s latest corruption perceptions index, Hungary has fallen nine points in the rankings since 2012 to a level that suggests “serious problems with corruption”.Kovács dismissed suggestions that Hungary had questions to answer about alleged misuse of EU funds by Orbán’s friends and families. Kovács said it was “a very nice political agenda” for critics, but insisted Hungary obeyed all EU rules."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9eca4a4726a5bcaa9f9c4666f27586f889988125/0_192_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=097027fa38834a8d06cd893b59d9d1a8","title":"behrouz boochani asylum seeker manus island detained wins victorian literary prize australias richest","story":" writer on Manus Island wins $125,000 after sweeping non-fiction prize and Victorian prize for literatureThe winner of Australia’s richest literary prize did not attend the ceremony.His absence was not by choice.Behrouz Boochani, whose debut book won both the $25,000 non-fiction prize at the Victorian premier’s literary awards and the $100,000 Victorian prize for literature on Thursday night, is not allowed into Australia.The Kurdish Iranian writer is an asylum seeker who has been kept in purgatory on Manus Island in Papua New Guinea for almost six years, first behind the wire of the Australian offshore detention centre, and then in alternative accommodation on the island.Now his book No Friend But the Mountains – composed one text message at a time from within the detention centre – has been recognised by a government from the same country that denied him access and locked him up.It is, he said, “a paradoxical feeling”.“I really don’t know what to say,” he told  Australia in a conversation before the main award was announced, when he only knew of the non-fiction prize. “I certainly did not write this book just to win an award.“My main aim has always been for the people in Australia and around the world to understand deeply how this system has tortured innocent people on Manus and Nauru in a systematic way for almost six years. I hope this award will bring more attention to our situation, and create change, and end this barbaric policy.”Boochani speaks via text messages, because his internet connection keeps cutting out.For an asylum seeker kept in offshore detention to win such a major prize “brings enormous shame to the Australian government”, he said.Accepting the award on Boochani’s behalf was his translator, Omid Tofighian, who worked with interpreter Moones Mansoubi to translate Boochani’s Farsi text to English.“This is one of the most vicious forms of neocolonial oppression that is taking over the world at the moment – and to address this book in this way and to recognise it and draw attention to the narrative it is presenting will have repercussions for many generations to come.”The awards are split into seven categories, which are judged by a panel. In 2017 and 2018, women won each category, and they dominated the winners’ list again this year, with Elise Valmorbida winning the fiction prize with The Madonna of the Mountains Kendall Feaver winning the drama prize for her play The Almighty Sometimes Kate Lilley winning the poetry prize for Tilt Victoria Hannan winning the $15,000 unpublished manuscript prize for Kokomo and Bri Lee winning the people’s choice award for her memoir Eggshell Skull.After last year’s Nib prize, it is the second people’s choice award for the debut, a memoir that tracks Lee’s journey from being a judge’s associate to seeking justice through the courts for childhood sexual assault.She now receives “hundreds” of emails and messages from other sexual abuse survivors.“I respond to everyone,” she said. “Overall I get enough messages of such hope and optimism, and people just actually make life-changing decisions after reading this book, so even though I also get a lot of upsetting messages it all comes good. All I can hope for as a writer is to reach people in some way.”Lee said the unexpected commercial success of the book had given her “the most wonderful gift of freedom to write what I want next”.She is currently working on a series of essays.The young adult prize was won by Amelin and Ezekiel Kwaymullina, for Catching Teller Crow.Western Australian author Kim Scott, a dual Miles Franklin award winner, won the prize for Indigenous writing for his novel Taboo, which deals with a modern community coming to terms with the historical and cultural legacy of a massacre on Noongar country in south-west WA.It is based on an experience in his own country at Ravensthorpe, halfway between Albany and Esperance.“My ancestral country is regarded as taboo by many Aboriginal people because of the killing that happened there in the late 19th century,” he said. “I didn’t even know about it until I was an adult, that nasty edge to our history … the emotional infrastructure of the times didn’t enable or perhaps allow it.”Scott said the novel was for “a lot of us who have been damaged by colonisation, and I would imagine that’s non-Aboriginal people as well ... healing and strengthening our relationship to pre-colonial heritage.“It’s all about foundations and being grounded ... and finding a way for an emotional and spiritual infrastructure.

Residency rights were likely to be granted in 630 of the cases, government officials said.Derk Stegeman, a pastor at the Bethel church, said the Tamrazyan family had been reassured that they would be included among those allowed to stay in the country.Hayarpi Tamrazyan, an econometrics student at Tilburg University, said on leaving the church with her parents and siblings that it was “unreal, it is a relief” to “finally go outside again, walk around”.The amnesty was the result of an intense debate within the coalition government over the future of the so-called kinderpardon, a dispensation available to families with children who have lived in the Netherlands for more than five years, but which has been patchily applied.The Dutch government, led by Mark Rutte of the centre right VVD, includes the progressive D66 and two Christian parties, the relatively moderate CDA and the more conservative Christian Union.As part of the agreement, the kinderpardon will be taken off the statute books but the head of the Immigration and Naturalisation Service (IND) now has the discretionary authority in such cases rather than a politician.The government also said that only 500 rather than 750 people a year would be taken from refugee camps run by the UN in war zones.Luke Korlaar, head of protection at the the UN refugee agency in the Netherlands, said he was “happy for the children” but expressed his “pity that it is at the expense of refugees that need it”.Theo Hettema, chair of the General Council of the Protestant Church in The Hague, said he was “very grateful for a safe future for hundreds of refugees in the Netherlands” but also expressed his concern about the government’s wider immigration policy."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e9bb7caff362af4cb96195c6848c5ed7aaea3dd8/60_0_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=811fe9d5de7f84bb9ab8d4ff1f20cb9c","title":"tell us about the issues men face today","story":"From mental health to relationships, we’d like to hear from men of all ages about what they are really thinkingThe debate around modern-day masculinity has intensified in the wake of the #MeToo movement, and we are asking men to tell us what they are really thinking.As the role of men and women in society continue to change, so too do the dynamics from the workplace to the bedroom and everywhere in between.

Uber declined to say how many drivers work for it in Barcelona.Unauto VTC has previously criticised the regional government in Catalonia for “yielding to the blackmail of the taxi drivers, who are again kidnapping the city of Barcelona and using violence to shield their monopoly”.Taxi drivers in Madrid have been on strike for 12 days in an attempt to secure greater regulation of their disruptive rival.Last week, they blocked access to a trade exhibition centre in Madrid where a major tourism fair was on. On Monday, police in the capital used cranes to clear the central Paseo de Castellana after taxi drivers used their vehicles to obstruct the busy main road.Talks to resolve the standoff are continuing, but Madrid’s regional government has told the striking taxi drivers he will “not give into blackmail” and dismissed the Catalan government’s new measures as “heading back to the middle ages”.The region’s conservative president, Ángel Garrido, said: “We’re not going to give in to blackmail – not on day one not on day 10. If they’re trying to get rid of a sector, the answer is going to be no.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1381dfff5253a975eac481341d315fb779e99845/345_492_3060_1836/master/3060.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=59b03babbb502c1b9341325965f51637","title":"venezuela guaido urging west to keep up pressure says hunt","story":"UK foreign secretary speaks to Maduro challenger before EU ministers discuss sanctionsThe Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaidó has directly urged the west to keep up the pressure to bring about elections in his country within four weeks, the UK foreign secretary has said.Jeremy Hunt spoke with Guaidó by phone on Wednesday before an informal meeting of EU foreign ministers in Romania on Thursday that will discuss what further economic sanctions can be imposed on senior figures in the Venezuelan leadership.Key EU countries are prepared to recognise Guaidó as the legitimate interim president of Venezuela if Nicolás Maduro refuses to call fresh elections by Sunday.Guaidó, 35, a former student leader and head of Venezuela’s opposition-run national assembly, has been at the forefront of a renewed attempt to force Maduro from power.He said in an opinion piece for the New York Times on Wednesday that he had held “clandestine” meetings with the military to try to persuade them to withdraw their support for Maduro. Protesters marched in Caracas on Wednesday calling for Maduro to stand down.The European parliament has voted to recognise Guaidó due to his role as president of the national assembly. But not every EU state has issued the Sunday ultimatum, and Russia is looking to see if these isions can be prised open.Moscow has so far offered full-throated support for Maduro. It is estimated to have invested £13bn in Venezuela through refinancing of the country’s debt and through oil and arms deals.Although the bulk of the anti-Maduro sanctions policy is being determined in Washington and Latin America, the EU could have a role in trying to cut off supplies to Maduro. Spain, the leading EU country in the crisis, opposes military intervention.Members of Maduro’s administration have rejected and ridiculed the EU countries’ ultimatum, the end of which will be marked by a day of pro-opposition protests on Saturday. “These men from the EU who think Venezuela is a colony have given us eight days to call elections and the deadline runs out on Saturday,” the powerful socialist party leader Diosdado Cabello told a rally in the northern city of Coro on Wednesday.“How scary. How terribly scary!” Cabello added mockingly. “Is the US going to get involved in an attack against Venezuela?”Maduro has accused Donald Trump and a “group of extremists around him” of plotting to topple him in order to seize Venezuela’s oil, and said he risked transforming the country into a new Vietnam.Venezuela’s supreme court has imposed a travel ban and financial restrictions on Guaidó, including freezing his bank accounts.Speaking on BBC radio, Hunt said a humanitarian catastrophe was unfolding in the country, with citizens struggling to find scraps of food.“Here in Britain and Europe we cannot determine the outcome of what happens in Venezuela. It has to be for the people of Venezuela,” he said. “But what we can do is support the president of the national assembly that wants to uphold the constitution and is saying there need to be elections in four weeks because there is not a legitimate president.”He added: “We are not considering sanctions against the whole country because there is a humanitarian situation and we wouldn’t want to make the situation even worse. But targeted sanctions against the kleptocrats who have enriched themselves on the back of the rest of the population who are very poor, that is something I think can be effective.”He said a decision on sanctions is not expected immediately on Thursday.Hunt, a Conservative, said “this is not an ideological crusade”, pointing out that Guaidó was a member of Socialist International.“I doubt if he agrees with President Trump on very many policies at all and that is why it is rather extraordinary Maduro continues to get such strong support from Jeremy Corbyn and John McDonnell,” he said.The Labour frontbench has called for fresh elections in Venezuela but has not called for Guaidó to be recognised as interim president.The Spanish government has called for the immediate release of four members of a news team from the Spanish news agency EFE who have been detained in Venezuela.EFE said three of its journalists – a Spaniard and two Colombians – and their Venezuelan driver were arrested by the intelligence service in Caracas on Wednesday.According to the agency, the trio had travelled from Bogotá in Colombia to report on the crisis in Venezuela.“Since learning of the arrest, the government, through our embassy in Caracas, is doing everything necessary to secure their swift release,” the Spanish government said on Thursday morning. “The government demands that the relevant authorities release them at once. The government also urges the Venezuelan authorities to respect the rule of law, human rights and basic freedoms, of which the freedom of the press is a central element.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cbb9e34fb343adf4b0153176ecc951ed3faf913e/0_117_3504_2102/master/3504.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e415c131b167cbf3ecca3e8a4168d5c9","title":"how do trees survive in winter","story":"Some shed their leaves others rely on antifreeze in their veins (or pine needles) to survive the colder months. But trees couldn’t survive winter without the special relationship they have with birdsAside from the music of the westerlies playing through those skeletal canopies, British woods, when stripped of their leaves, tend to have an atmosphere of expectant quietude. Winter is a time of frugality, and the two major tree types, deciduous and evergreen, adopt very different strategies to cope with the double challenge of little sunlight and low temperatures.A deciduous tree operates by shedding all its leaves. This means that it lacks the means to photosynthesise and, thus, to generate fresh energy for five to six months of the year. However, there’s an upside to losing foliage, because it has ended the loss of moisture that occurs through leaves.This endless recycling of water from the trees to the atmosphere, known as transpiration, is costly. A single large mature oak may possess up to 200,000 leaves, and lose as much as 150,000 litres of water over the course of a year. A summer wood in full foliage conceals thousands of rising columns of tree-borne moisture, which is why it often feels so warm and humid within woods, when the surrounding countryside can be cool and breezy.Conifer trees reduce the stress of water loss by possessing fine needle-like leaves with minimum surface area and thick, waxy water-retaining cuticles. The adaptations slow down the process of transpiration. While the structure of evergreen foliage doesn’t have the energy-producing efficiency of a flat plate-like deciduous leaf, the fact that conifers can continue to photosynthesise year-round compensates for this. Some pines even have antifreeze in their needles, to enable them to work in icy conditions.The dormancy of winter trees means that this is the best time for planting or transferring them around our gardens. Choose a warm winter’s day so the earth is soft, dig a hole deep enough so the soil fully protects the roots from frost, then water well once planted. Observing how that new tree slowly grows and flourishes is one of the most satisfying processes in gardening.Trees also make use of the winter to do some self-propagation of their own. Much of the work for this process begins in the autumn, with the production of seeds and fruit. British oaks are a perfect example. From September onwards they leave a great larder of sugar- and protein-rich food for hungry birds or mammals, in the form of acorns. Squirrels, rodents and several species of crow store these nuts away to consume during the colder months. Yet, no species has more of a capacity to plan ahead than the creature that William Henry Hudson called the “British bird of paradise”: the European jay.In late autumn, this glorious pink-and-blue bird can be seen making repeat journeys to and from acorn-producing oak trees. The jay then buries them, sometimes flying several miles from the original source tree. Over the course of autumn, the average bird hides about 5,000 acorns. Across Britain and Ireland, the entire jay population stores somewhere in the region of 1.7bn acorns.The birds possess extraordinary memories for where they have hidden their stores, and yet – here is the clever part – they can’t remember them all. Not only do those forgotten acorns stand a strong chance of growing into oak saplings the following spring, but jays show a preference for open ground between tree cover in their choice of burial sites. In other words, they plant their acorns precisely where they might grow best.This acorn storage system thus benefits the jay twice over. Not only does it provide itself with food for the winter, but by forgetting some of its larder it also creates fresh habitat for future generations of jays. These birds are truly s of our oak woods. But it works both ways: by taking care of the birds, the trees ensure they prosper themselves.The dispersal of seed is, in fact, a major part of the woodland scene in winter. Hawthorn, holly, yew, mountain ash, crab apple, blackthorn and sea buckthorn – not to forget woodland shrubs, such as mistletoe and ivy, or garden favourites including cotoneaster and pyracantha – all produce fruit that birds love.Thrushes are especially drawn to these trees and consume vast quantities of their fruits. In return for this generosity, the thrushes then fly to their roosts in some hedge or tall tree at dusk and do what comes naturally. They poop out seeds during the night and leave each one in its own little store of fertiliser.So woods and birds are truly partners in reproduction. You can see how they interact on any winter’s day and in any wood, from John O’Groats to Land’s End, and from the mountain tops to the seashore.

The Psychiatric Nurses’ Association (PNA) said given the shortage of staff there would be insufficient nursing personnel to operate all services when the overtime ban was introduced. The union has also said that where the full complement of staff was not available for a shift, the union’s members would not work.It suggested the Health Service Executive (HSE) may seek to use managers to fill gaps and to redeploy nursing staff from the community to acute services.The HSE has said where there is a challenge in staffing an acute psychiatric unit or other residential mental health facility, it has available options. These include the assignment of nurse managers to patient care duty redeployment of psychiatric nurses assigned to day and non-essential services to patient care duty in the residential mental health services and seeking to negotiate a limited co-operation with overtime where there remains a gap.Peter Hughes, the general secretary of the Psychiatric Nurses Association (PNA), has acknowledged it is not clear what impact today’s ban on overtime will have, but he warned many community services may be affected and that senior nurse management may have to work to provide cover.The problem with recruitment and retention or nurses will not go away, he told RTÉ’s Morning Ireland.This is compounded by the “huge reliance” on overtime in the mental health services, he said.While the Public Service Pay Commission has said it does not believe that pay has anything to do with the retention of staff, Mr Hughes disputed this, adding that vacancy rates have increased by 40 per cent over the past year.He said the Bring Them Home campaign begun last year resulted in only six psychiatric nurses returning from the United Kingdom.Mr Hughes said any proposal would be brought to members for consideration but added they have not received any yet despite spending three days at the Workplace Relations Commission last week without any negotiations taking place.Mr Hughes said overtime is voluntary and therefore cannot be construed as industrial action. The issue can be resolved, and there should be no penalty on staff who take part in the ban, he said.Members of the Irish Nurses’ and Midwives’ Organisation (INMO) staged a 24-hour strike from 8am on Wednesday and plan another stoppage on Tuesday, February 5th. The PNA is threatening full strike action the following week. The nursing unions are seeking pay parity with other graduate-entry groups in the health service such as physiotherapists who they maintain receive about €7,000 more per year. The unions contend that such pay increases are essential to tackle recruitment and retention difficulties in the health service. However, the Government is holding a hard line saying that bringing nurses up to the levels of other specified healthcare workers would cost €300 million a year plus €120 million in reduced working hours. It also fears that any lee-way it gives to the nurses would quickly lead to the unpicking of the public sector pay agreement with claims from unions representing other sectors.Government sources expect that there will be further contacts with nursing unions over the weekend in an attempt to avert two further work stoppages by nurses and midwives scheduled to take place next week.However, the Government remains absolutely opposed to any general pay increase for nurses because of fears it would undermine the existing public service pay deal and lead to a spate of knock-on claims by other groups of State employees.There is concern in Government that it would be extremely difficult to resolve “because the two sides are so far apart”.“We’ve no choice, we have to hold out,” Government sources said on Wednesday night."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Evan Cullen (9) has cerebral palsy which also affects left side of his bodyAlan Kelly says public confidence in how large projects are managed is \u0026lsquolost\u0026rsquoJohn Kenny found badly beaten, tied up and left to die alone on the floor of toilet in 2011EU officials set to visit Dublin for no-deal preparations as Europe reaffirms backingFour soldiers and a civilian killed in 1974 IRA blast Families and those wrongly imprisoned sought new hearingBBC News suggests May may carry out (very) full-on attack on BrusselsInner City Helping Homeless founder to run as Independent in Dublin north inner citySenator proposes removal of property tax if people move into elderly housing co-opMet \u0026Eacuteireann warns of treacherous conditions, warning of frost, ice and snowPNA says where full complement of staff not available the union\u0026rsquos members will not workFirst funeral told it is one of the darkest days as they say farewell to four young men in their primeSchools closed and buses cancelled as \u0026lsquosignificant accumulations in places\u0026rsquoUnderstanding the difference explains why modern lifestyles damage our healthOpinion: Fears about GMO are not borne out by the science a rethink is in orderHarris insists Government cannot offer any increases outside public service dealClaims wildlife driven into extinction as habitat replaced by unnatural conifersProminent doctors line up to support fellow health professionals but wary note also soundedHundreds of tyres burnt on weighbridge at the Border on the side of the M1 motorwayEllis\u0026rsquos Yard in Ballyvolane a site of fly-tipping for almost 20 years, says campaignerEvidence links airborne particles to condition but more studies are needed"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3777290.1548932420!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit britain may need to delay exit to pass legislation jeremy hunt says","story":"Britain may need to delay its exit from the European Union in order to pass crucial legislation if a deal is agreed in late March, foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt has said. The British foreign secretary said a technical delay to Brexit would depend on how long the process takes. He told BBC Today programme: “I think it is true that if we ended up approving a deal in the days before the 29th March then we might need some extra time to pass critical legislation, but if we are able to make progress sooner then that might not be necessary.“We can’t know at this stage exactly which of those scenarios would happen.”Mr Hunt said it was “difficult to know” if negotiations would run to the end of March, but added: “Whereas a week ago none of us really knew whether this was going to be possible, we are now in a situation where it clearly is possible.“There are lots and lots of hurdles, no-one is saying this isn’t going to be very challenging, but we do now have a consensus in parliament.“We can use that consensus, providing we can meet these concerns, very reasonable concerns from our friends in Ireland about not having a hard border, concerns in the EU about access to the single market.“Providing we can do that, which I think we can, then I think there is a way through.”Separately House of Commons leader Andrea Leadsom said the February recess for MPs may be scrapped. The Commons was expected to rise at the end of business on February 14th and return on February 25th. It comes as officials from the European Commission are due in Dublin next week to discuss preparations for a no-deal Brexit, as preparations for a British crash-out intensify across the EU.EU official and diplomatic sources said while support for Ireland would remain strong and consistent in the weeks ahead, the logic of the situation was that Ireland would come under pressure on the backstop.“There will be no pressure from us,” said one EU diplomat. “But the situation will bring pressure.”EU officials and diplomats believe that with Britain facing a possible crash out, the option of softening Ireland’s stance on the backstop would inevitably be discussed – though all who spoke to The  said that the EU would not try to persuade or pressure Ireland. “It will be your call,” one said.Last night the British prime minister Theresa May offered no new ideas about avoiding a hard border in a telephone call with Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and senior Irish Government sources now say they will “sit tight” until Mrs May comes forward with proposals.As relations between Dublin and London grow ever frostier, Mr Varadkar is understood to have told the Fine Gael parliamentary party last night that he told Mrs May it is unusual to go back on an agreement.Both the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney – along with EU leaders – reaffirmed their unwillingness to renegotiate the withdrawal agreement and the backstop, as Mrs May has pledged to her MPs she will do.In London, Mrs May told the House of Commons that the proposal she will present to the EU on the backstop would be based on the concerns expressed by MPs. She said her colleagues had suggested putting a time limit on the backstop or including a universal exit mechanism.“The political declaration already refers to alternative arrangements and raises a number of proposals that can be addressed, such as mutual recognition of trusted trader schemes,” she said.Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn met the prime minister to discuss his party’s call for Britain to remain in a permanent customs union with the EU. Mr Corbyn initially refused to meet Mrs May until she ruled out a no-deal Brexit but Labour sources said the meeting was cordial, adding that the two leaders would meet again soon.“I set out the Labour case for a comprehensive customs union with the European Union, in order to protect jobs and trade. She certainly understood the point that we were making,” Mr Corbyn said afterwards. Mr Corbyn said that he had discussed Labour’s difficulties with the backstop with Mrs May, which the prime minister undertook to bring to the EU, but also reiterated his opposition to a no-deal outcome.In Brussels, the European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker told the European Parliament that Tuesday night’s vote at Westminster would not persuade the EU to renegotiate the text of the withdrawal agreement. And he counselled Britain against seeking comfort in the hope that the other 26 member states would abandon Ireland at the last minute.“But this is not a game. It goes to the heart of what being a member of the EU means. Ireland’s border is Europe’s border and it’s our union’s priority,” he said.Austrian chancellor Sebastian Kurz also ruled out reopening the withdrawal agreement and EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier criticised Mrs May for abandoning it. “She distanced herself from the agreement she herself had negotiated,” he said.“This agreement will not be renegotiated. We need this backstop as it is. Rejecting the backstop as it stands today boils down to rejecting the solution as we found it with the British.” –Additional reporting PADeal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Photograph:  Bastiaan SlabbersNurPhoto via Getty ImagesBoyle (41), the son of an emigrant from Glencolmcille in the Donegal Gaeltacht, became the only member of Congress with an Irish-born parent after his election to the House of Representatives in the 2014 midterm elections in a Democratic stronghold covering Philadelphia and its suburbs. After the electoral map was redrawn Boyle became the representative of Philadelphia’s 2nd district this year.Underlining his sense of gratitude towards his roots, Boyle has pinned a tribute to his Twitter timeline: “Dad immigrated to America when he was 19. Spent the next 50 years working in a warehouse and as a custodian. This week he attended the swearing-in ceremonies of both of his sons. Both @RepKevinBoyle and I know we wouldn’t be where we are without his hard work \u0026amp sacrifice.”Boyle’s intervention this week adds another dimension to the Brexit debate, given the UK’s eagerness to thrash out a bilateral trade agreement with the US after Brexit. After Tuesday’s vote in the Commons, Boyle expressed scepticism at prime minister Theresa May’s strategy towards the backstop. “After agreeing to the Irish backstop, Theresa May’s government has now reneged on it. Why would anyone negotiate with her now? #Brexit,” he tweeted.Several members of the Irish-American caucus in Washington have indicated that a return to a hard border in Ireland must be avoided at all costs. Tánaiste Simon Coveney is due to travel to the US capital next week to meet key figures in the Irish-American caucus.Congress will have a key role in approving any future US-UK trade deal after Brexit. Massachusetts congressman Richard Neal, who was centrally involved in the Good Friday Agreement and is the co-chairman of the Friends of Ireland caucus on Capitol Hill, has recently been appointed head of the Ways and Means committee that will oversee any future trade agreement.Boyle made his position clear on Tuesday. “A hard border would eliminate the free flow of people between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, which has proved fundamental to promoting peace and unity,” he said in a statement. “We must not go backwards.”"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2017/10/12/TELEMMGLPICT000140439032_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfy2dmClwgbjjulYfPTELibA.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"parliament accused conflict interest rejects nda debate","story":"John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, refused to allow Maria Miller to ask an urgent question on the use of gagging clauses by the wealthy and powerfulHouse of CommonsMaria Miller, the Tory MP, last night accused Parliament of a conflict of interest over Britain\u0027s MeToo scandal after it emerged she had been blocked from questioning the Government over it.The Daily  can reveal John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, yesterday refused to allow Ms Miller, who chairs the women \u0026amp equalities Commons select committee, to ask an urgent question on the use of gagging clauses by the wealthy and powerful, including the Topshop tycoon Sir Philip Green.Helen Jones, chairman of the petitions select committee, also rejected calls to allow a parliamentary debate on non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) after two separate petitions demanding a change to the law between them secured 250,000 signatures. It came as Topshop was forced to cancel a launch party for its latest collection after designer Michael Halpern pulled out.Ms Miller declined to comment on Mr Bercow\u0027s refusal but, writing for The Daily , highlighted the Commons\u0027 own use of NDAs, on which it spent £2.4million between 2013 and 2017. Perhaps Parliament would be better placed to challenge this abuse of the law if it weren\u0027t also caught up in the use of NDAs, she argued.There have been more than 50 severance agreements, most including confidentially clauses, relating to House of Commons staff alone over the past five years. Last week, Ms Miller called on Mr Bercow to resign over a report into bullying in the Commons, something he himself has been accused of. Andrew Bridgen, one of Mr Bercow\u0027s most vocal critics, said: He should recuse himself from any further participation in the House\u0027s response to the culture change required. In fact, the best thing he can do is stand down as Speaker.A spokesman for Mr Bercow, who has denied bullying or any knowledge of pay-offs to alleged victims, said it might be thought premature to grant an urgent question on NDAs given the Government\u0027s response to Ms Miller\u0027s committee\u0027s report on misconduct in the workplace was expected shortly.Ms Jones said her committee would love an NDAs debate but could not sanction it unless a petition was lodged on Parliament\u0027s website. The impact of the scandal on Sir Philip\u0027s retail empire began to emerge last night after Mr Halpern withdrew from a launch party for his line. He is understood to have felt unable to attend after Sir Philip was named as the businessman behind an injunction preventing The  publishing allegations against him of sexual harassment and racial discrimination. A fashion insider said: His brand is about female empowerment. That\u0027s his ethos. He couldn\u0027t go ahead with this, it wouldn\u0027t be a good look. It would be awkward.

Mr Hunt is expected to use an informal summit in Romania to make the call.In an op-ed in the Times Mr Guadio wrote: The military\u0027s withdrawal of support from Mr Maduro is crucial to enabling a change in government, and the majority of those in service agree that the country\u0027s recent travails are untenable, Guaido wrote.The transition will require support from key military contingents.

Finally, less than 5 percent of the people who chose to participate in this market research program were teens. All of them with signed parental consent forms.Apple and Facebook have found themselves arguing over user privacy and the protection of personal data in recent months. Tim Cook criticised Facebook over its handling of the Cambridge Analytica crisis and suggested it was different because it chose not to make its customers its products – which Mark Zuckerberg said was extremely glib and did not represent how Facebook thinks about its customers.Despite those fallouts, Facebook and Apple rely heavily on each other. That arrangement is said to have led to problems in the past, with Apple unable to punish Facebook without threatening many of the biggest apps on its platform.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

While experiencing visions of her daughter, who we learn died from cancer in her teens, Louise attempts to communicate with the race in a bid to discern the purpose of their visit.The twist: Louise deciphers the language, which gives her the ability to see into the future. What we thought were flashbacks are, in fact, flash-forwards – her daughter is yet to be born.The set-up: Briony Tallis (Saoirse Ronan) falsely accuses the housekeeper’s son (James McAvoy) of raping her cousin when she becomes jealous of his relationship with her older sister (Keira Knightley). He’s sent to prison, but is eventually freed to enlist in World War II – and the audience is told that he eventually rekindled his romance with Cecilia and lived happily ever after.The twist: Only, they didn’t. We learn that this is another lie from an older Briony – both Robbie and Cecilia died in the war.The set-up: Having been hired by Evelyn Mulwray (Faye Dunaway) to investigate her husband’s death, JJ Gittes (Jack Nicholson) discovers the existence of someone crucial to the case: Evelyn’s sister, Katherine. The twist: After being confronted by Gittes, Evelyn reveals that Katherine is also her daughter – and the result of being raped by her father when she was 15.The set-up: IRA member Fergus (Stephen Rea) promises to protect Dil (Jaye Davidson), the girlfriend of a soldier his group has imprisoned, and soon begins an unexpected relationship with her. The twist: Dil is transgender, and was born male. Fergus\u0027s love for her sees him take the fall for a shooting she commits.The set-up: Having awoken in a bathtub, and discovering he has telekinetic abilities, John Murdoch attempts to find the truth behind a dystopian world that’s inhabited by an evil group who can stop time and implant memories.The twist: His search for meaning sees him reach the end of the city. With nowhere left to go, he breaks through a wall and finds the city is actually an island floating through outer space.The set-up: Cop Frank Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio) infiltrates the organisation of gang chief Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson) at the same time that criminal Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon) infiltrates the police force – and both soon suspect they have spies in their midst.The twist: Both end up dead. A shocking sequence sees Sullivan kill Costigan who believes he\u0027s got away with it. Sergeant Sean Dignam (Mark Wahlberg) sees to that in an equally as shocking climactic scene.The set-up: A woman named Christina is enlisted into murdering her husband by his mistress. However, once the deed is done, his body disappears.The twist: Her husband faked his death with the help of his mistress. The pair wanted to make Christina believe she committed the murder in an attempt to destroy her.The set-up: Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) is trained by Obi Wan Kenobi and Jedi master Yoda to defeat the evil Darth Vader, leading to the showdown of all showdowns.The twist: Skywalker’s delivered a blow after making a pretty huge discovery: the villain is his father. Cue shock and awe.The set-up: The world of the film’s insomniac narrator (Edward Norton) collides with that of Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) as they start an underground club that permits ordinary people to have fistfights with one another.The twist: The narrator and Tyler are dissociated personalties – AKA they are the same person.The set-up: Nicholas Van Orton (Michael Douglas) flees after agreeing to participate in a twisted game that sees him – among other things – buried alive and contemplating suicide after accidentally murdering his brother. The twist: It really was just a game the entire time, set up by his brother who wasn\u0027t killed at all.The set-up: Rose (Allison Williams), a white woman, brings her black boyfriend Chris (Daniel Kaluuya) home to meet her family. Chris soon becomes convinced they bury a dark secret and attempts to convince his girlfriend they should leave. The twist: He’s not wrong – only Rose is in on the conspiracy. After uncovering photos of black men she’s had prior relationships with, Chris is abducted, realising that he’s been lured to her cult-like family who want to implant their loved ones’s brains into the body of younger black bodies.  The set-up: When Amy Dunne (Rosamund Pike) goes missing, her husband Nick (Ben Affleck) becomes the prime suspect behind her disappearance.The twist: Mid-way through the film, all becomes clear – Amy faked her abduction and spent months framing her husband in revenge for his extra-marital digressions.The set-up: Brothers Elias and Lukas (played by real-life siblings Elias and Lukas Schwarz) believe their mother to be an imposter after she returns home having had her face reconstructed due to a car crash. They take (rather disturbing) matters into their own hands. The twist: One of the twins actually died in the crash. The other, unable to accept his brother\u0027s death, has merely imagined him to be alive the whole time and exacts revenge, blaming their mother for his death.The set-up: As a convict awaits execution for several murders, 10 strangers find themselves stranded in a rainstorm at a remote Nevada hotel. Soon, they start getting killed off one by one.The twist: The strangers comprise the split personalities of the convict. The motel is a fabricated reality via which doctors are attempting to find out which one is causing his murderous tendencies. They zone in on limo driver Ed (John Cusack) without realising they\u0027ve selected the wrong one: the murderous personality is a nine-year-old kid named Timmy.The set-up: Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr) must track down and stop a terrorist known as the Mandarin (Ben Kingsley) who has launched a series of attacks on the world.The twist: He succeeds – but learns that the Mandarin is actually a British actor called Trevor Slattery who has been hired by the actual people responsible.  The set-up: Two contract killers are given a list of people to dispatch of. Their journey leads them to a cult ceremony where one of the men, Jay (Neil Maskell), must kill one final victim known as The Hunchback.The twist: The Hunchback is actually his imprisoned wife with their son strapped to her back. After he kills them, he is crowned by the cultists.The set-up: Leonard (Guy Pearce) is tracking down the man who raped and murdered his wife. However, his search is stunted by his short-term memory loss. Throughout the film, he tells the story of Sammy Jankis, a man who accidentally killed his diabetic wife she kept requesting more insulin as she didn\u0027t believe he had memory loss.The twist: The man responsible only raped his wife and Leonard killed him years ago – he just can\u0027t remember it. His wife\u0027s actual killer is... himself. His real name? Sammy Jankis.The set-up: A grizzled boxing trainer seeks atonement by helping Hilary Swank\u0027s underdog amateur boxer, Maggie, achieve her dream of becoming a professional.The twist: Mid-way through the film, Maggie breaks her neck after being sucker punched during a fight. What was a feel-good underdog story swiftly turns into a hard-hitting drama about euthanasia.The set-up: Helping several others dodge the monsters lurking in the mist, David Drayton (Thomas Jane) leads the escape from the supermarket they’ve been holed up in. They reach a car and drive away, but soon run out of gas and realise there’s no hope. David loads a gun and, as the camera cuts away, shoots the survivors, including his young son. The twist: As he’s gearing up to put the gun to his own head, shadowy figures roll toward him. He’s devastated to learn it’s actually the military who have combatted the mist creatures. He killed his son for no reason. Talk about awful timing.The set-up: Oh Dae-Su (Choi Min-sik) is kidnapped and held in captivity for 15 years. When he\u0027s finally released, he exacts revenge with the help of a young girl named Mi-Do (Kang Hye-jung) whom he falls in love with.The twist: The girl is actually his daughter. His captors orchestrated their meeting.The set-up: The plot centres on a couple who, after the death of their unborn child, adopt a mysterious nine-year-old girl named Esther (Isabelle Furhman) who starts displaying some disturbing behaviour. The twist: Esther is actually a 33-year old murderer who has a condition stunting her physical growth. The set-up: Nicole Kidman stars as Grace, a mother who tries to protect her two children from supernatural forces in their Victorian mansion.The twist: In a spin on the ghost story, it turns out it\u0027s Grace and her children who are the ghosts: she killed them – before turning the gun on herself – in despair over the presumed death of her husband in World War II.The set-up: The film tracks the rivalry of two magicians, Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) and Rupert Angier (Hugh Jackman), who go to extreme lengths to outsmart one another, each pulling off tricks the other considers impossible.The twist: It emerges that Fallon, the bearded carer of Borden’s children, is actually his twin (he’s also played by Bale) while Angier’s technique is far more disturbing: each night, using Tesla’s technology, he sends his clone plummeting into a water tank.2437 Planet of the Apes (1968)The set-up: Three scientists wake up hundreds of years after being launched into space to discover they’ve landed on a planet where primates rule over humans, who are their prisoners.The twist: As Charlton Heston’s character escapes his cell, he eventually finds the Statue of Liberty protruding from sand. Turns out it’s not just any planet – it’s Earth.The set-up: A defence attorney (Richard Gere) has a strong belief that his stuttering altar boy client (Edward Norton) is not guilty of murdering an influential Catholic Archbishop. He\u0027s later found not guilty by reason of insanity after being diagnosed with multiple personality disorder.The twist: He faked the  disorder. The film\u0027s closing moments see him drop the stutter and reveal his guilt as his attorney looks on, disturbed.The set-up: What viewers initially think is a film about a theft committed by Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) turns out to be something far more darker. On the run, she arrives at a motel owned by Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins) and is swiftly murdered by his mother.The twist: Only, it\u0027s not his mother – it’s Norman. He killed his mother years before and has since developed a split personality.The set-up: Having been chained up by the Jigsaw killer in a dilapidated bathroom – which has a corpse lying  in the middle of the room – photographer Adam (Leigh Whannell) overpowers and kills his captor. He rummages through his pockets, looking for the key that will unlock the chain around his leg, convinced the nightmare is finally over.The twist: Instead, he finds a cassette recorder that reveals his supposed captor was, in fact, another victim of the Jigsaw killer who was merely following his rules in order to obtain an antidote for a poison in his body. Cue a corpse in the middle of the room rising to reveal himself as the real Jigsaw killer. He was there the whole time.The set-up: David Mills (Brad Pitt) and retired PI William Somerset (Morgan Freeman) have closed in on serial killer, John Doe (Kevin Spacey), who has been using the seven deadly sins as inspiration for his murders.The twist: He has one final murder left to commit – only he’s already committed it. We discover Doe has killed Mills’s wife (Gwyneth Paltrow), which prompts him to complete Doe’s plan by murdering him out of wrath.The set-up: US Marshal Teddy Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his partner (Mark Ruffalo) arrive at a centre for the criminally insane to find an escaped killer who drowned her three children.The twist: Teddy is actually a patient, and his partner is his doctor. He killed his wife after she murdered their three children and the elaborate  ruse is an attempt to bring his repressed memories to the surface.The set-up: A young boy who can see dead people encounters a child psychologist named Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis) and attempts to discover the reason behind his disturbing ability.The twist: Crowe is, in fact, dead all along. He got killed during a robbery that we see in the film’s opening scene.The set-up: The introverted Angela (Felissa Rose) becomes terrified when a murderer wreaks destruction at the same campsite where her brother Peter was killed eight years before.The twist: Angela is the killer. She\u0027s also not Angela at all, but her presumed dead brother Peter, who was raised as a girl by her aunt following Angela\u0027s death.3237 The Skin I Live In (2011)The twist: The Vera we\u0027re seeing is not wis wife, but a young man whom Robert abducted and subjected to a vaginoplasty six years before.The set-up: Peter Parker (Tom Holland) takes a break from trying to stop the film\u0027s villain, the Vulture (Michael Keaton), to go to his school\u0027s Homecoming dance. The twist: He shows up to his date\u0027s house, knocks on the door... and comes face to face with The Vulture. He\u0027s her father.The set-up: David Dunn survives a train crash that kills 130 passengers, and begins to believe he may have special powers. His life soon collides with comic book store owner Elijah (Samuel L Jackson), who has a rare bone disorder, and helps David discover he has the ability to see the criminal acts of those he comes into contact with. The twist: Elijah is the biggest criminal of them all. When David shakes his hand at the end of the film, he sees that “Mr Glass” is the mastermind behind numerous terrorist attacks – including the train crash he survived.The set-up: Verbal Kint (Kevin Spacey) reveals a criminal plot concocted by the notorious Keyser Soze. He\u0027s eventually set free.The twist He made the whole thing up – Kint is Keyser Soze.The set-up: A mother’s rift with her parents is healed when she sends her two children, who they’ve never met, to stay with them when she goes on holiday. All is going well until the kids become somewhat weirded out by their strange behaviour.The twist: Their mother becomes disturbed when she sees her parents while Skyping her children - it’s not them. It emerges that these imposters are mental home patients who murdered the couple, and have now taken up residence in their house. The twist: The girl was never missing – it was just an elaborate hoax to lure an out-of-towner so the island\u0027s residents could sacrifice him to their Sun God.The set-up: The services of linguistics professor Louise Banks (Amy Adams) are called upon when aliens arrive on Earth. While experiencing visions of her daughter, who we learn died from cancer in her teens, Louise attempts to communicate with the race in a bid to discern the purpose of their visit.The twist: Louise deciphers the language, which gives her the ability to see into the future. What we thought were flashbacks are, in fact, flash-forwards – her daughter is yet to be born.The set-up: Briony Tallis (Saoirse Ronan) falsely accuses the housekeeper’s son (James McAvoy) of raping her cousin when she becomes jealous of his relationship with her older sister (Keira Knightley). He’s sent to prison, but is eventually freed to enlist in World War II – and the audience is told that he eventually rekindled his romance with Cecilia and lived happily ever after.The twist: Only, they didn’t.

The twist: After being confronted by Gittes, Evelyn reveals that Katherine is also her daughter – and the result of being raped by her father when she was 15.The set-up: IRA member Fergus (Stephen Rea) promises to protect Dil (Jaye Davidson), the girlfriend of a soldier his group has imprisoned, and soon begins an unexpected relationship with her.

The set-up: When Amy Dunne (Rosamund Pike) goes missing, her husband Nick (Ben Affleck) becomes the prime suspect behind her disappearance.The twist: Mid-way through the film, all becomes clear – Amy faked her abduction and spent months framing her husband in revenge for his extra-marital digressions.The set-up: Brothers Elias and Lukas (played by real-life siblings Elias and Lukas Schwarz) believe their mother to be an imposter after she returns home having had her face reconstructed due to a car crash. They take (rather disturbing) matters into their own hands. The twist: One of the twins actually died in the crash. The other, unable to accept his brother\u0027s death, has merely imagined him to be alive the whole time and exacts revenge, blaming their mother for his death.The set-up: As a convict awaits execution for several murders, 10 strangers find themselves stranded in a rainstorm at a remote Nevada hotel. Soon, they start getting killed off one by one.The twist: The strangers comprise the split personalities of the convict. The motel is a fabricated reality via which doctors are attempting to find out which one is causing his murderous tendencies. They zone in on limo driver Ed (John Cusack) without realising they\u0027ve selected the wrong one: the murderous personality is a nine-year-old kid named Timmy.The set-up: Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr) must track down and stop a terrorist known as the Mandarin (Ben Kingsley) who has launched a series of attacks on the world.The twist: He succeeds – but learns that the Mandarin is actually a British actor called Trevor Slattery who has been hired by the actual people responsible.  The set-up: Two contract killers are given a list of people to dispatch of. Their journey leads them to a cult ceremony where one of the men, Jay (Neil Maskell), must kill one final victim known as The Hunchback.The twist: The Hunchback is actually his imprisoned wife with their son strapped to her back. After he kills them, he is crowned by the cultists.The set-up: Leonard (Guy Pearce) is tracking down the man who raped and murdered his wife. However, his search is stunted by his short-term memory loss. Throughout the film, he tells the story of Sammy Jankis, a man who accidentally killed his diabetic wife she kept requesting more insulin as she didn\u0027t believe he had memory loss.The twist: The man responsible only raped his wife and Leonard killed him years ago – he just can\u0027t remember it. His wife\u0027s actual killer is... himself. His real name? Sammy Jankis.The set-up: A grizzled boxing trainer seeks atonement by helping Hilary Swank\u0027s underdog amateur boxer, Maggie, achieve her dream of becoming a professional.The twist: Mid-way through the film, Maggie breaks her neck after being sucker punched during a fight. What was a feel-good underdog story swiftly turns into a hard-hitting drama about euthanasia.The set-up: Helping several others dodge the monsters lurking in the mist, David Drayton (Thomas Jane) leads the escape from the supermarket they’ve been holed up in. They reach a car and drive away, but soon run out of gas and realise there’s no hope. David loads a gun and, as the camera cuts away, shoots the survivors, including his young son. The twist: As he’s gearing up to put the gun to his own head, shadowy figures roll toward him. He’s devastated to learn it’s actually the military who have combatted the mist creatures. He killed his son for no reason. Talk about awful timing.The set-up: Oh Dae-Su (Choi Min-sik) is kidnapped and held in captivity for 15 years. When he\u0027s finally released, he exacts revenge with the help of a young girl named Mi-Do (Kang Hye-jung) whom he falls in love with.The twist: The girl is actually his daughter. His captors orchestrated their meeting.The set-up: The plot centres on a couple who, after the death of their unborn child, adopt a mysterious nine-year-old girl named Esther (Isabelle Furhman) who starts displaying some disturbing behaviour. The twist: Esther is actually a 33-year old murderer who has a condition stunting her physical growth. The set-up: Nicole Kidman stars as Grace, a mother who tries to protect her two children from supernatural forces in their Victorian mansion.The twist: In a spin on the ghost story, it turns out it\u0027s Grace and her children who are the ghosts: she killed them – before turning the gun on herself – in despair over the presumed death of her husband in World War II.The set-up: The film tracks the rivalry of two magicians, Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) and Rupert Angier (Hugh Jackman), who go to extreme lengths to outsmart one another, each pulling off tricks the other considers impossible.The twist: It emerges that Fallon, the bearded carer of Borden’s children, is actually his twin (he’s also played by Bale) while Angier’s technique is far more disturbing: each night, using Tesla’s technology, he sends his clone plummeting into a water tank.2437 Planet of the Apes (1968)The set-up: Three scientists wake up hundreds of years after being launched into space to discover they’ve landed on a planet where primates rule over humans, who are their prisoners.The twist: As Charlton Heston’s character escapes his cell, he eventually finds the Statue of Liberty protruding from sand. Turns out it’s not just any planet – it’s Earth.The set-up: A defence attorney (Richard Gere) has a strong belief that his stuttering altar boy client (Edward Norton) is not guilty of murdering an influential Catholic Archbishop. He\u0027s later found not guilty by reason of insanity after being diagnosed with multiple personality disorder.The twist: He faked the  disorder. The film\u0027s closing moments see him drop the stutter and reveal his guilt as his attorney looks on, disturbed.The set-up: What viewers initially think is a film about a theft committed by Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) turns out to be something far more darker. On the run, she arrives at a motel owned by Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins) and is swiftly murdered by his mother.The twist: Only, it\u0027s not his mother – it’s Norman. He killed his mother years before and has since developed a split personality.The set-up: Having been chained up by the Jigsaw killer in a dilapidated bathroom – which has a corpse lying  in the middle of the room – photographer Adam (Leigh Whannell) overpowers and kills his captor. He rummages through his pockets, looking for the key that will unlock the chain around his leg, convinced the nightmare is finally over.The twist: Instead, he finds a cassette recorder that reveals his supposed captor was, in fact, another victim of the Jigsaw killer who was merely following his rules in order to obtain an antidote for a poison in his body. Cue a corpse in the middle of the room rising to reveal himself as the real Jigsaw killer. He was there the whole time.The set-up: David Mills (Brad Pitt) and retired PI William Somerset (Morgan Freeman) have closed in on serial killer, John Doe (Kevin Spacey), who has been using the seven deadly sins as inspiration for his murders.The twist: He has one final murder left to commit – only he’s already committed it. We discover Doe has killed Mills’s wife (Gwyneth Paltrow), which prompts him to complete Doe’s plan by murdering him out of wrath.The set-up: US Marshal Teddy Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his partner (Mark Ruffalo) arrive at a centre for the criminally insane to find an escaped killer who drowned her three children.The twist: Teddy is actually a patient, and his partner is his doctor. He killed his wife after she murdered their three children and the elaborate  ruse is an attempt to bring his repressed memories to the surface.The set-up: A young boy who can see dead people encounters a child psychologist named Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis) and attempts to discover the reason behind his disturbing ability.The twist: Crowe is, in fact, dead all along. He got killed during a robbery that we see in the film’s opening scene.The set-up: The introverted Angela (Felissa Rose) becomes terrified when a murderer wreaks destruction at the same campsite where her brother Peter was killed eight years before.The twist: Angela is the killer. She\u0027s also not Angela at all, but her presumed dead brother Peter, who was raised as a girl by her aunt following Angela\u0027s death.3237 The Skin I Live In (2011)The twist: The Vera we\u0027re seeing is not wis wife, but a young man whom Robert abducted and subjected to a vaginoplasty six years before.The set-up: Peter Parker (Tom Holland) takes a break from trying to stop the film\u0027s villain, the Vulture (Michael Keaton), to go to his school\u0027s Homecoming dance.

He\u0027s her father.The set-up: David Dunn survives a train crash that kills 130 passengers, and begins to believe he may have special powers. His life soon collides with comic book store owner Elijah (Samuel L Jackson), who has a rare bone disorder, and helps David discover he has the ability to see the criminal acts of those he comes into contact with. The twist: Elijah is the biggest criminal of them all. When David shakes his hand at the end of the film, he sees that “Mr Glass” is the mastermind behind numerous terrorist attacks – including the train crash he survived.The set-up: Verbal Kint (Kevin Spacey) reveals a criminal plot concocted by the notorious Keyser Soze. He\u0027s eventually set free.The twist He made the whole thing up – Kint is Keyser Soze.The set-up: A mother’s rift with her parents is healed when she sends her two children, who they’ve never met, to stay with them when she goes on holiday. All is going well until the kids become somewhat weirded out by their strange behaviour.The twist: Their mother becomes disturbed when she sees her parents while Skyping her children - it’s not them. It emerges that these imposters are mental home patients who murdered the couple, and have now taken up residence in their house. The twist: The girl was never missing – it was just an elaborate hoax to lure an out-of-towner so the island\u0027s residents could sacrifice him to their Sun God.Affleck\u0026nbsphas since appeared to confirm rumours of his departure from the role.Sharing the\u0026nbspDeadline\u0026nbsparticle that said he was passing the torch to the next generation of Bruce Wayne, he tweeted: “Excited for #TheBatman in Summer 2021 and to see @MattReevesLA vision come to life.”It is unclear as to whether Affleck\u0026nbspever plans to return to the role. According to\u0026nbspIMDb, cast members for the new film will include Joe Manganiello, JK Simmons and Jeremy Irons. There is currently no news as to who might replace Affleck.\u0026nbspHinting at what\u0026nbspThe Batman\u0026nbspmight be about, Reeves\u0026nbsptold\u0026nbspThe Hollywood Reporter\u0026nbspin an interview this week: “It’s very much a point of video-driven, noir Batman tale. It’s told very squarely on his shoulders, and I hope it’s going to be a story that will be thrilling but also emotional.”He added that he was focusing on the superhero’s detective roots and plans on having him face off against “multiple villains”.\u0026nbspThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

MPs voted on Tuesday to remove the Irish backstop from Theresa May’s Brexit deal and find an alternative, as yet unknown, replacement. Companies in Northern Ireland are “upset and confused” by the result of the votes, according to Stephen Kelly, chief executive of Manufacturing Northern Ireland, which represents 5,500 firms in the region.

Newtownabbey, Co AntrimThe uncertainty is already having a huge impact on companies in Northern Ireland. “I know a number of firms have been taking on agency workers instead of full-time staff so they have greater flexibility if it comes to a no-deal Brexit,” said Mr Kelly. “So at a minimum, Brexit is making work short-term and tenuous.”One business owner based in Northern Ireland, who did not want to be named, said Brexit was already creating problems with trade. He told The Independent that a customer based in the Republic of Ireland had already stopped working with his firm “because they are scared about what will happen after Brexit”.“We have customers asking us about what we are going to do and about our supply chains. It’s really, really difficult,” he said. “It’s the uncertainty more than anything. Business does not like uncertainty and it’s creating havoc with us.”Trading partners across Europe are nervous about the future, and investment at a standstill because of the uncertainty. “We are holding back and keeping our cash because we many need it to get over the next few years,” the businessman said. “It’s created a real issue for us going forward. We just don’t know what’s going to happen and we won’t be investing until we know what’s going to happen and until we know what happens with the customs union.“If we get into the position where we can’t trade freely across the border our competitors in the rest of Europe will jump on that and take that trade away from us.”He pointed out that if a deal is reached, there will still be two years of negotiations to get through.\u0026nbspThe alternative – a no-deal Brexit – is even more daunting. “If we go into WTO rules, that’s going to create serious issues,” he said. “Within Northern Ireland we will have a struggling economy in the UK on one side, the Republic of Ireland is going to have issues, and we will be left in the middle trying to trade. It’s a no-win situation.” Meanwhile, firms feel like they have been somewhat abandoned by the UK government. Mr Kelly said that the government’s advice to business in Northern Ireland was essentially “not to do anything”. “It’s 58 days to go – there’s food on the shelves that has a longer shelf life than that,” he added. “The Irish government has been working with industries for the past two years. We have nothing, we’ve have been left hung out, hoping for the best. It’s unacceptable.”The business owner told The Independent that communication from Westminster had been “very, very lacking”. “The whole thing has been handled particularly badly,” he said.\u0026nbsp“We are in limbo, paddling away. We aren’t growing but we haven’t contracted, so that’s something – but that could change very quickly. It’s a nightmare.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

He didn’t specify which markets, although China is a racing certainty.\u0026nbspBut such a move makes all kind of sense, particularly in the aforementioned where local champion Huawei has been putting out whizzy competing handsets to tempt patriotic Chinese buyers.\u0026nbspApple has been squeezing its consumers for a long time. Will this be enough to stop the pips from squeaking?\u0026nbspThe talk of prices being ‘slashed’ certainly looks\u0026nbspover done. The iPhone is going to remain a pricey piece of kit, and recent upgrades have been obeying the law of diminishing returns.\u0026nbspThe phenomenon of people changing their handsets less often is an industry wide one, and it’s an open question as to whether relatively limited price cuts in some markets will be enough to turn back that particular tide.\u0026nbspThe reason investors have less reason to be concerned than it might appear is that the iPhone is not the only string to Apple’s bow.\u0026nbspA notable feature of the results was that while revenues from sales of the device fell by 15 per cent, group revenues fell by just 5 per cent as other parts of the business grew.The money taken in\u0026nbspfrom selling Macs increased by 9 per cent, wearables, home and accessories (iWatches, speakers, headphones) put on 33 percent,\u0026nbspthe iPad\u0026nbsp17 per cent.\u0026nbspThe most important, and closely watched, line was, however, services.

But it is closing, and the margins are stunning.\u0026nbspApple’s shares have lost nearly a third since October, driven by a widespread tech tumble as well as its own problems. It has also surrendered its much vaunted status as the world’s biggest company by market value. Accustomed to dazzling investors, the weather looks set to be cloudy for some time to come and full year revenues will likely be down on last year.\u0026nbspStill, Cook is sitting on a near $250bn cash pile, and the stock’s fall may have been over done. Big investors seem to think so. They’ve started to order portions of Apple pie, scenting a buying opportunity at the current levels. They may well be right about that.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Part of the experience was the need to change from one money into another. Now both the thrill and the nuisance have vanished.\u0026nbspA single currency prevails over most of the Continent west of the old Iron Curtain with the notable exception of Norway.For some unthinking\u0026nbsppro-Europeans this has been a triumph.\u0026nbspProfessor Ashoka Mody, distinguished US economics professor, who has held very senior positions at the IMF, it has at least been a profound mistake. Exchange rate changes enable countries with very different economic structures histories and habits to trade peacefully with each other.\u0026nbspIf exchange rates remain stuck for whatever reason disaster may await.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialEurotragedy by Ashoka Mody, reviewHelmut Kohl, who died only in 2017, believed that a single European currency was God’s gift to mankind. He frequently promoted expansionary monetary and fiscal policies which he knew were not in Germany’s interests but which he thought would be his legacy for Europe and mankind.Mody’s study takes us in more detail than most readers would want to know about the events leading up to and following the launch of the euro at the beginning of 1999. Meeting followed meeting and conference followed conference. During most of this time I was mainly concerned with the parochial problems of the British economy.\u0026nbspBut I did go to a notorious conference in Bonn at which the German Minister Franz-Josef Strauss announced a devaluation of the French franc, only to have this rescinded from Paris within a few hours.Mody argues convincingly that the French economy was held back by the struggle to create and maintain the euro. But its misfortunes fade into insignificance compared with the experiences of Greece which only joined the euro at the beginning of 2001. Despite its glorious history Greece was now a small misgoverned Balkan state and was made to pay heavily for its decision. By 2017 Greek GDP was down by 25 per cent since the EU bailouts began and unemployment remained stuck at 20 per cent. Since then the Greek tragedy has worsened rather than improved.What lessons can we draw from two decades of the euro?What is the moral for the British reader? A tribute is in order for those who kept Britain out of the euro. The pound was devalued in 1947 and after a bitter internal wrangle in 1967.\u0026nbspBy the time the next run on the pound developed in the early 1980s the attempt to fix an official rate was abandoned and the British currency was mercifully allowed to float. There was a final attempt to fix a rate for the pound in the crisis of the early 1980s but since then market forces have partially prevailed and there has been no official rate for sterling, despite various attempts first to “shadow the D-mark,” and later the euro.There are still many unanswered questions in the whole debate.\u0026nbspAs the late Canadian economist Harry Johnson once remarked the discussion assumes that “a country is a country is a country.” It is not obvious why the French town of Strasbourg should be more clearly bounded to Paris than to Kehl on the other side of the Rhine.Meanwhile let us be thankful for small mercies and the lack of courage of successive British governments in not going the whole hog after the euro. It is far too early to provide the credits for this narrow escape. But we shall know soon enough - probably well before the thirty year rule allows the relevant documents to be published.Sir Samuel Brittan is a former economics editor of the Financial TimesOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Newtownabbey, Co AntrimThe uncertainty is already having a huge impact on companies in Northern Ireland. “I know a number of firms have been taking on agency workers instead of full-time staff so they have greater flexibility if it comes to a no-deal Brexit,” said Mr Kelly. “So at a minimum, Brexit is making work short-term and tenuous.”One business owner based in Northern Ireland, who did not want to be named, said Brexit was already creating problems with trade. He told The Independent that a customer based in the Republic of Ireland had already stopped working with his firm “because they are scared about what will happen after Brexit”.“We have customers asking us about what we are going to do and about our supply chains. It’s really, really difficult,” he said. “It’s the uncertainty more than anything. Business does not like uncertainty and it’s creating havoc with us.”Trading partners across Europe are nervous about the future, and investment at a standstill because of the uncertainty. “We are holding back and keeping our cash because we many need it to get over the next few years,” the businessman said. “It’s created a real issue for us going forward. We just don’t know what’s going to happen and we won’t be investing until we know what’s going to happen and until we know what happens with the customs union.“If we get into the position where we can’t trade freely across the border our competitors in the rest of Europe will jump on that and take that trade away from us.”He pointed out that if a deal is reached, there will still be two years of negotiations to get through.\u0026nbspThe alternative – a no-deal Brexit – is even more daunting. “If we go into WTO rules, that’s going to create serious issues,” he said. “Within Northern Ireland we will have a struggling economy in the UK on one side, the Republic of Ireland is going to have issues, and we will be left in the middle trying to trade. It’s a no-win situation.” Meanwhile, firms feel like they have been somewhat abandoned by the UK government. Mr Kelly said that the government’s advice to business in Northern Ireland was essentially “not to do anything”. “It’s 58 days to go – there’s food on the shelves that has a longer shelf life than that,” he added. “The Irish government has been working with industries for the past two years. We have nothing, we’ve have been left hung out, hoping for the best. It’s unacceptable.”The business owner told The Independent that communication from Westminster had been “very, very lacking”. “The whole thing has been handled particularly badly,” he said.\u0026nbsp“We are in limbo, paddling away. We aren’t growing but we haven’t contracted, so that’s something – but that could change very quickly. It’s a nightmare.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This follows a subdued December, when price growth slowed to 0.5 per cent.“Indicators of housing market activity, such as the number of property transactions and the number of mortgages approved for house purchase, have remained broadly stable in recent months, but forward-looking indicators had suggested some softening was likely.Brexit uncertainty will push rents up faster than house prices by 2023The big Brexit forecast: what will happen to house prices in 2019?UK house prices growing at slowest pace in five years“In particular, measures of consumer confidence weakened in December and surveyors reported a further fall in new buyer inquiries towards the end of 2018.“While the number of properties coming on to the market also slowed, this doesn\u0027t appear to have been enough to prevent a modest shift in the balance of demand and supply in favour of buyers in recent months.”Mr Gardner said the uncertain economy is likely to be acting as a drag on the housing market, despite strong\u0026nbspemployment figures,\u0026nbspwage growth and low interest rates.He continued: “Near-term prospects will be heavily dependent on how quickly this uncertainty lifts, but ultimately the outlook for the housing market and house prices will be determined by the performance of the wider economy - especially the labour market.Howard Archer, of the EY Item Club said: “If Brexit is delayed, ongoing uncertainty is likely to weigh down on the housing market and could well see house prices stagnate or fall slightly.”Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said: “The uncertainty created by Brexit largely is responsible for the further decline in year-over-year growth in house prices to near-zero, from a broadly stable rate of about 2 per cent\u0026nbspin the 18 months before November.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But no guarantee on funding has been given after 2020, leaving maintained nursery schools unable to plan and budget for the future.Government must take ‘urgent action’ to stop nursery school closuresMs Powell, who is chair of the All Party Parliamentary Group on Nursery Schools, Nursery and Reception Classes, said: “The loss of maintained nursery schools would be a terrible act of social vandalism.“Unless action is taken we could see the mass closure of these vital institutions, with tens of thousands of children losing the specialist care that is making all the difference in closing the social mobility gap.“Whilst we often hear warm words about the excellent education nursery schools provide, this needs to be urgently backed up by secure, long term funding, so that we can safeguard the future of nursery schools across the country.”Beatrice Merrick, chief executive of national early years charity Early Education, said: “Without the supplementary funding virtually all nursery schools are at risk of closure.“Most have been through multiple rounds of funding cuts already, have restructured and cut costs wherever they can, and in an increasing number of cases now have recurrent deficits, so trying to find ways to cope with the loss of an average of a third of their budgets is just untenable.”Nadhim Zahawi, minister for children and families, said: “We want every child to have the best start in life, which is why we are spending more money than ever before to support early years education and childcare – around £6bn a year by 2020.\u0026nbsp“However, we recognise the need to monitor costs and the childcare provider market.“Maintained nursery schools make a valuable contribution to improving the lives of some of our most disadvantaged children, which is why we are providing local authorities with around £60m a year up until 2019-2020 to protect maintained nursery schools funding.“The position beyond this will be determined by the next spending review.”Department for EducationOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Poor students may therefore be more inclined to live at home and unless there is a high-tariff university nearby, this will restrict their choice.”Cambridge to offer \u0027dozens\u0027 of poorer students free year of studyMr Barton called on the government and top universities to do more to widen access. “The student loans system stacks the odds against those from the most disadvantaged backgrounds,” he added.A spokesperson for the Russell Group said: “These are sobering figures and they should strengthen our resolve to continue opening up top universities to young people from all walks of life.\u0026nbspThis is a big, complex social problem with no quick fixes – but recent years have seen important progress and universities, schools, government and parents must work together to keep it on track.”Sir Peter Lampl, founder of social mobility charity Sutton Trust, told The Independent: “It is worrying to see that there has been limited progress in closing the gap between advantaged and disadvantaged students getting into top universities.\u0026nbspAll young people, regardless of their background, should have a fair chance to get into these top institutions.”He added: “Young people from disadvantaged backgrounds are often not getting the advice and support they need in a highly competitive admissions process.“It is vital that we ensure that all young people, regardless of where they live or go to school, have access to high quality careers advice and guidance that allows them to make informed choices.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Facebook development teams would do well to look at this precedent and prioritise user privacy, Mr MacKey told\u0026nbspThe Independent.\u0026nbspWith the integration project currently expected to take a year to complete, and with end-to-end encryption as part of the plan, we should expect the Facebook engineering teams to focus attention on uniform data security both in their platform and in the apps themselves.”In response to such privacy concerns, Facebook said in a statement: We’re working on making more of our messaging products end-to-end encrypted and considering ways to make it easier to reach friends and family across networks. As you would expect, there is a lot of discussion and debate as we begin the long process of figuring out all the details of how this will work.Ireland\u0027s Data Protection Commission, which regulates the social network in the EU, has since called for an urgent briefing on the matter in order to assess the how the proposals will fit with GDPR rules.\u0026nbsp“Previous proposals to share data between Facebook companies have given rise to significant data protection concerns and the Irish DPC will be seeking early assurances that all such concerns will be fully taken into account by Facebook\u0026nbspin further developing this proposal, the commission said in a statement.\u0026nbspIt must be emphasised that ultimately the proposed integration can only occur in the EU if it is capable of meeting all of the requirements of the GDPR.”Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

In the same year, the company\u0027s shares dropped 30 per cent.\u0026nbspJosie Cox\u0026nbspexplains how\u0026nbspit got there and where it\u0027s going nextClick to followThe IndependentApple Park, the new headquarters in Cupertino designed by Lord Norman Foster, cost roughly $5bn, and will house 13,000 employees when everyone has moved inFor an interview published in the\u0026nbspFinancial Times\u0026nbspback in 2006, journalist Richard Waters hauled himself to a nondescript corner of the Californian city of San Jose to meet with a corpulent computer scientist called Steve. As Richard walked into a vinyl-clad diner called The Hickory Pit, Steve sat –\u0026nbspbearded and burly – hunched over some sort of hand-held device, engrossed in a game of Tetris.The setting of the interview was unusual for the FT. The salmon pink daily is more widely known for its profiles of the buffed and manicured business elite, lounging in grand villas, chalets and penthouse pads, preferably in Davos or Cannes. But Steve – eating cherry pie in a washed-out T-shirt – had certainly earned his column inches: 30\u0026nbspyears earlier, together with another Steve and an electronics industry worker called Ronald, the Hickory Pit’s favourite tech geek created what would later become the world’s largest publicly traded company. For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialHis unremarkable appearance and the profoundly mundane setting of his encounter with the FT, convey a banality neatly reflected in the origins of the very firm he was instrumental in founding: An experimental three-man band (the original start-up, if you will) that took a crazy punt on a simple motherboard and now has more cash than the vast majority of countries.Apple was founded on 1 April 1976 by the late Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak and Ronald Wayne in Cupertino. It wormed its way on to the tech scene with a creation named the Apple I, a computer designed and built by Tetris-loving Wozniak, and sold for the ominous sum of $666.66 – or about $2,900 in today’s inflation-adjusted money. Unremarkably, the name reportedly stems from Jobs’ fondness of the humble fruit.Less than a year later, the company was incorporated. Wayne had already jumped ship, having sold his stake in the group for the paltry sum of $800, but –\u0026nbspunhampered by the exit of a third of its staff –\u0026nbspApple’s operational revenues were heading north. According to media reports, they almost doubled every four months during the first five years of the company operating. Between September 1977 and the same month in 1980, sales increased by more than 500 per cent, on average annually.Apple’s mysterious new charger might be about to arriveThe Apple II and Apple III followed, and the company’s success grew with every launch. On 12 December 12 1980 it listed on the stock exchange, publicly floating around 4.6 million shares at $22 apiece. The offering turned scores of Apple’s early employees into instant millionaires. Shares in the company ended the day at $29 each, giving Jobs a net worth of well over $200 million. He was 25 at the time.In 1984, Apple launched the Macintosh. Its debut was marked with a high-budget neo-noir dystopian commercial, aired during that year’s Super Bowl and directed by Bladerunner’s Ridley Scott. The release was hailed a watershed moment not just for the tech world, but also for the advertising industry. Already then Apple was inventing itself as a generation-defining, industry straddling brand a firm that challenged the status quo and confronted the norm ruthlessly.Though Jobs and Wozniak both left the company in the mid-1980s amid disputes with management, predominantly over strategy, Apple’s success initially continued untarnished.In 1991 the company created the PowerBook, presenting a blueprint for all modern laptops. That same year it launched System 7, adding colour to the interface. But not all its products proved a hit. The company was struggling to tap into its client base and it was failing to gain traction with its strategy of marketing high-end products with a high price – dubbed the High-Right Policy – while simultaneously battling heavyweight rivals, like Microsoft, which in many cases were offering similar technology at a vastly smaller price.By 1997, marred by constant leadership change, an unclear approach to the market and a series of painful restructuring exercises, Apple was forced to choose between sticking to its poorly performing guns or risking a dramatic high-stakes turnaround. It chose the latter. It snapped up NeXT, – Jobs’ new venture – for $429 million and scrapped the High-Right Policy. Shortly after, it launched the iMac G3, an affordable machine with a quirky, futuristic look that jarred with Apple’s previous designs, but spoke to a new generation of tech-savvy, progressive professionals. The move proved a lifeline for the financially bruised group and catapulted it into a new era. Apple computers were no longer just the tools of businessmen and accountants, but the product of choice for students, designers and artists. It had won over the creative elite and would continue to claim there support for many years to come.Jobs, who had returned to Apple as an adviser in early 1997, assumed the position of interim CEO when Gilbert Frank Amelio, the company’s boss since February 1996, was pushed out for overseeing several quarters of lacklustre earnings. And it was at this time too that Jonathan Ive joined the upper echelons of management, injecting fresh energy into the brand and later designing the decade-defining iPod and iPad.\u0026nbspThe 2000s were a period of revival for Apple, which the company kicked off with a wild buying spree. It snapped up a portfolio of corporations, including a DVD authoring platform and a music software group. In May 2001, doors to its first retail stores opened and it debuted the iPod, of which more than 100 million were sold over the subsequent six years. The iTunes Store launched in 2003. Within just two years it was the world’s largest music retailer. The MacPro, MacBook, and MacBook Pro hit the market with resounding success, marking the dawn of Apple’s gradual shift away from computers and towards the future of portable consumer electronics.At the Macworld Expo on January 9 2007, Jobs announced the launch of the iPhone of which hundreds of thousands were sold within hours. A year later the App Store was introduced, allowing users to buy third-party applications for their devices and generating millions of dollars of revenue within its own right.\u0026nbspIn 2010, shortly after Jobs took his first medical leave of absence, Apple introduced the iPad which was met with massive demand globally, helping the company’s market capitalisation eclipse that of arch rival Microsoft for the first time in over two decades. The iPhone 4 was released in June of that year, offering a range of new features, including video calling, and sporting a now iconic stainless steel design. The iPod Nano, iPod Touch and iPod Shuffle were also relaunched and the MacBook Air was updated, powering Apple to the top of the list of the world’s most valuable consumer brands.In dire contrast to his professional success though, Jobs’ health was deteriorating. In January 2011 he announced to staff that he would be taking another period of leave of indefinite length, handing the reigns to chief operating officer Tim Cook.\u0026nbspIn August 2011 he officially resigned as CEO. He passed away in October in Palo Alto, succumbing to a rare and aggressive form of pancreatic cancer. Jobs was 56 years old.In many ways, Apple’s post-Jobs years were an era of superlatives. Thanks largely to the launch of the iPhone4S and iPhone 5, and later the iPad mini, Apple’s market value in 2012 soared to an unprecedented $624bn, beating the previous record set by Microsoft. It used that financial momentum to further its quest to ersify into newfangled fields like augmented reality and artificial intelligence. It also remained fiercely committed to design and in 2013 recruited the former CEO of Yves Saint Laurent, as well as former Burberry executive Angela Ahrendts to oversee its digital strategy.Why Apple plans to stop putting a number on iPhone salesApple boss says data is being ‘weaponised with military efficiency’Tim Cook responds after Apple becomes first trillion-dollar companyThe company became a staple on lists of the world’s most valuable, best-known and influential brands. By January 2016 a billion Apple devices were reported to be in active use around the world. It moved into smart home technology and ride-sharing, through its investment in Chinese Uber rival Didi Chuxing. It bought Shazam, a music recognition service, launched its own video unit and signed a content partnership with Oprah Winfrey. Several series are reportedly in development as well as a film. Elsewhere collaborations with Hermes and Nike spurred sales of the Apple Watch, and in October 2018 it launched the twelfth generation of the iPhone. Its slogan? “Brilliant. In every way”.In\u0026nbsp2018, Apple became the first company in history to have a market value in excess of $1 trillion, an amount greater than the gross domestic product of most countries in the world, including TurkeyIn late summer 2018, Apple became the first company in history to have a market value in excess of $1 trillion, an amount greater than the gross domestic product of most countries in the world, including Turkey, the Netherlands, Saudi Arabia and Sweden.\u0026nbspEmployment hit more than\u0026nbsp90,000 and, according to some reports, the company has more readily deployable cash than the US Treasury. The combined wealth of the world’s 10\u0026nbsprichest people – a list that includes Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, financier Warren Buffett, and Facebook founder Mark Zuckergerg – doesn’t even come close to the size of Apple’s market capitalisation.The “too big to fail” economic theory prescribes that some organisations, particularly banks, are so large and influential, that their failure would be catastrophic for the broader economy. Apple is undoubtedly one of those organisations, and in the last few months of 2018 markets were offered a taste of what that could actually mean.Shares peaked around the launch of the latest iPhone, and started trending lower shortly thereafter. Between early October and the end of the year, Apple’s shares lost more than 30 per cent of their value, taking them to below $160 from a peak of over $230 just a week earlier, and dragging swathes of the broader stock market with them.Analysts said that investors were falling out of love with the name for a slew of reasons. Product sales were slowing and consumers were becoming more sensitive to prices amid fears of an impending economic downturn. After reporting a set of quarterly results on 1 November\u0026nbspthat reflected a weakening in crucial emerging markets, Apple’s shares fell by 7 per cent in a single day wiping an estimated $70 billion off the group’s value.Executives at the time said that they would stop providing quarterly updates for the number of iPhones, iPads and Mac computers sold, unnerving investors further. The cost of new products also spawned worries, with the average selling price of iPhones climbing to $793 during the final quarter of 2018.After reporting quarterly results that reflected a weakening in emerging markets, Apple’s shares fell by 7 per cent, wiping $70 billuon off the group’s value“Our worry is there must be a limit to Apple’s pricing power,” George Salmon, an analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, told Reuters at the time. “The group is now charging close to $800 per phone, and while that’s helping revenues climb despite flat sales volumes, one has to wonder how the strategy to shimmy up the price ladder fares in a downturn. If consumers start feeling the pinch, those price tags could put the punters off.”Analyst Chaim Siegel at Elazar Advisors told the agency that trade issues between China and the US are also threatening to throw a ner in the works if they make it hard for Apple to get the supplies it needs. “As for emerging markets slowing, that’s also contagion from China. Both trade war issues coming to reality,” he said.Elsewhere analysts at Bank of America Merrill Lynch slashed their recommendation on the stock to “neutral” from “buy”, explaining that they are “incrementally concerned that not all the weakness is captured in the near-term” and that there are likely to be “further negative estimate revisions” to Apple’s financials. Analysts at Goldman Sachs cut their share price target on the stock repeatedly.Others have shown concern about the company’s emphasis on its services business: ApplePay, Apple Music and the App store. Potential for growth is undoubtedly there, but the company has yet to share concrete plans about its strategy going forward and how it intends to keep growing.\u0026nbspNot helping the situation, Tim Cook in early January wrote a letter to shareholders in which he announced that Apple’s results for the quarter that ended on 29 December\u0026nbsp2018 were likely to be worse than previously anticipated. Cook cited the unforeseen “magnitude” of the economic slowdown in markets such as\u0026nbspChina. The profit warning was Apple’s first since 2002 and dealt a fresh hefty blow to the share price, as well as the performance of dozens of smaller suppliers and competitors whose fate is closely linked to that of Apple. It also sent shockwaves through broader financial markets, sending stocks – which are generally considered a fairly risky asset – sharply lower in most regions and driving demand for perceived safe havens, like gold and Japan’s yen. The sell-off was a dramatic reminder of the sheer scale of the Apple ecosystem. If Apple sneezes many parts of the financial system will most certainly catch a cold.Since then Apple shares have continued to trade sideways, keeping the company’s market capitalisation well below that psychologically significant $1\u0026nbsptrillion\u0026nbspmark and raising questions about how much more correcting still needs to be done, before – or if – the trajectory can turn.So what will 2019 hold for the company which is no longer quite the world’s largest (having\u0026nbsprelinquished that role to Microsoft and Amazon)? Opinions are ided. While many experts who have been tracking the stock for years predict this to be a turning point, others consider it more of a blip.“When we get into these situations where the current product may not be moving as well as investors expected, some get scared and then the fear compounds itself,” Jason Benowitz, a senior portfolio manager at Roosevelt Investors, told Bloomberg. “We’re not really too concerned. Some of this is probably just noise like it always is.”Also speaking to the news agency, Ross Gerber, co-founder of Gerber Kawasaki Wealth \u0026amp Investment Management, described the climate of fear around Apple as “absurd”. “It doesn’t make any sense. It’s a solid business even if it’s not going to grow as much as it did,” he said.Apple is still hugely profitable. It’s sitting on well over $200 billion of cash, and shares – despite their recent brutal tumble – have roughly doubled in the past five years. The omnipresence of Apple devices across the planet also suggests that if the company’s heyday really is over, then its decline would likely be glacial rather than sudden. It simply has too many dependents, both in the corporate world and the consumer world, to swiftly fizzle out.As for Wozniak, the smiley 68-year old with a penchant for pie and Tetris, is unperturbed the ultimate bull, in market parlance. In an interview with CNBC at the end of last year, he said that Jobs would be proud of what Apple had become. Speaking of rivals, like Samsung, Wozniak said that they don’t present a real threat. They’re not innovating, he explained. They’re simply creating “fun features”. Apple, meanwhile, is concentrating on innovations that “literally affect everything we do all the time in life”.If Wozniak is right, then Apple’s dominance is far from over. Technology famously knows no limits and it’s increasingly evident that consumer appetite hardly does either. We want lives that are interconnected, homes that are smarter than us, phones that manage our whole existence and privacy that is safeguarded unconditionally.Amid all this, the most serious challenge for Apple will be to keep up with contracting attention s. In a world of instant gratification, it’s becoming clear that he who fails to innovate is lost. Perhaps, just perhaps, that will prove Apple’s greatest obstacle yet.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Apple has focused on photography in its recent phones as it aims to encourage purchases despite falling demand for new handsets.The 2020 camera will include technologies that allow it to scan the world around it, creating a three-dimensional picture of the world around it. In that respect, it will work similarly to the Face ID scanner that currently allows people to unlock their phones with facial recognition – but it will use different a different method, and work over much longer distances.The laser-powered camera will be part of a phone that will also include upgraded chips, an improved lens system as well as alterations to how the phones can take photos, the same report claimed.Created with Sketch.Gadgets and tech news in pictures Show all 42Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.5G wireless internet is expected to launch in 2019, with the potential to reach speeds of 50mbsUber has halted testing of driverless vehicles after a woman was killed by one of their cars in Tempe, Arizona.

That will help Apple\u0027s push into augmented reality, which has seen it release a range of tools to allow people to overlay virtual objects onto the real world.iPhone price to be reduced in many countries, Apple saysThe extra sensing capabilities could also improve traditional photos, allowing for images that capture better depth, according to the Bloomberg report.The technologies could be a trial run for Apple\u0027s plans for an augmented reality headset or glasses, which it has been repeatedly rumoured to be working on\u0026nbsp– and which the company has not explicitly denied.Apple\u0027s 2019 phone will also have a range of improvements to its camera technologies, according to the same report. They will include three cameras to allow for improved photo capabilities, which could allow for the phone to take a larger field of view, better zoom, and potentially allowing the phone to automatically improve photos or videos after they are taken.The 3D cameras were being worked on for this year\u0027s phones but were not ready in time, the Bloomberg report claimed. Instead, they will come to next year\u0027s line on the the 2020 version of the\u0026nbspiPhone XS Max, though they might not make it onto the upgraded versions of the XS and XR.As well as new camera technologies, Apple plans to improve the software used to take photos. That will include changes to the Live Photos feature – which captures video either side of a photo to allow people to see them in context – so that they take six seconds of video rather than three.The new phones will also have improved chips and an updated Face ID sensor so the phones unlock more quickly. Otherwise, they are expected to look largely similae to this year\u0027s models, with more dramatic changes coming in 2020.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

While experiencing visions of her daughter, who we learn died from cancer in her teens, Louise attempts to communicate with the race in a bid to discern the purpose of their visit.The twist: Louise deciphers the language, which gives her the ability to see into the future. What we thought were flashbacks are, in fact, flash-forwards – her daughter is yet to be born.The set-up: Briony Tallis (Saoirse Ronan) falsely accuses the housekeeper’s son (James McAvoy) of raping her cousin when she becomes jealous of his relationship with her older sister (Keira Knightley). He’s sent to prison, but is eventually freed to enlist in World War II – and the audience is told that he eventually rekindled his romance with Cecilia and lived happily ever after.The twist: Only, they didn’t. We learn that this is another lie from an older Briony – both Robbie and Cecilia died in the war.The set-up: Having been hired by Evelyn Mulwray (Faye Dunaway) to investigate her husband’s death, JJ Gittes (Jack Nicholson) discovers the existence of someone crucial to the case: Evelyn’s sister, Katherine. The twist: After being confronted by Gittes, Evelyn reveals that Katherine is also her daughter – and the result of being raped by her father when she was 15.The set-up: IRA member Fergus (Stephen Rea) promises to protect Dil (Jaye Davidson), the girlfriend of a soldier his group has imprisoned, and soon begins an unexpected relationship with her. The twist: Dil is transgender, and was born male. Fergus\u0027s love for her sees him take the fall for a shooting she commits.The set-up: Having awoken in a bathtub, and discovering he has telekinetic abilities, John Murdoch attempts to find the truth behind a dystopian world that’s inhabited by an evil group who can stop time and implant memories.The twist: His search for meaning sees him reach the end of the city. With nowhere left to go, he breaks through a wall and finds the city is actually an island floating through outer space.The set-up: Cop Frank Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio) infiltrates the organisation of gang chief Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson) at the same time that criminal Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon) infiltrates the police force – and both soon suspect they have spies in their midst.The twist: Both end up dead. A shocking sequence sees Sullivan kill Costigan who believes he\u0027s got away with it. Sergeant Sean Dignam (Mark Wahlberg) sees to that in an equally as shocking climactic scene.The set-up: A woman named Christina is enlisted into murdering her husband by his mistress. However, once the deed is done, his body disappears.The twist: Her husband faked his death with the help of his mistress. The pair wanted to make Christina believe she committed the murder in an attempt to destroy her.The set-up: Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) is trained by Obi Wan Kenobi and Jedi master Yoda to defeat the evil Darth Vader, leading to the showdown of all showdowns.The twist: Skywalker’s delivered a blow after making a pretty huge discovery: the villain is his father. Cue shock and awe.The set-up: The world of the film’s insomniac narrator (Edward Norton) collides with that of Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) as they start an underground club that permits ordinary people to have fistfights with one another.The twist: The narrator and Tyler are dissociated personalties – AKA they are the same person.The set-up: Nicholas Van Orton (Michael Douglas) flees after agreeing to participate in a twisted game that sees him – among other things – buried alive and contemplating suicide after accidentally murdering his brother. The twist: It really was just a game the entire time, set up by his brother who wasn\u0027t killed at all.The set-up: Rose (Allison Williams), a white woman, brings her black boyfriend Chris (Daniel Kaluuya) home to meet her family. Chris soon becomes convinced they bury a dark secret and attempts to convince his girlfriend they should leave. The twist: He’s not wrong – only Rose is in on the conspiracy. After uncovering photos of black men she’s had prior relationships with, Chris is abducted, realising that he’s been lured to her cult-like family who want to implant their loved ones’s brains into the body of younger black bodies.  The set-up: When Amy Dunne (Rosamund Pike) goes missing, her husband Nick (Ben Affleck) becomes the prime suspect behind her disappearance.The twist: Mid-way through the film, all becomes clear – Amy faked her abduction and spent months framing her husband in revenge for his extra-marital digressions.The set-up: Brothers Elias and Lukas (played by real-life siblings Elias and Lukas Schwarz) believe their mother to be an imposter after she returns home having had her face reconstructed due to a car crash. They take (rather disturbing) matters into their own hands. The twist: One of the twins actually died in the crash. The other, unable to accept his brother\u0027s death, has merely imagined him to be alive the whole time and exacts revenge, blaming their mother for his death.The set-up: As a convict awaits execution for several murders, 10 strangers find themselves stranded in a rainstorm at a remote Nevada hotel. Soon, they start getting killed off one by one.The twist: The strangers comprise the split personalities of the convict. The motel is a fabricated reality via which doctors are attempting to find out which one is causing his murderous tendencies. They zone in on limo driver Ed (John Cusack) without realising they\u0027ve selected the wrong one: the murderous personality is a nine-year-old kid named Timmy.The set-up: Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr) must track down and stop a terrorist known as the Mandarin (Ben Kingsley) who has launched a series of attacks on the world.The twist: He succeeds – but learns that the Mandarin is actually a British actor called Trevor Slattery who has been hired by the actual people responsible.  The set-up: Two contract killers are given a list of people to dispatch of. Their journey leads them to a cult ceremony where one of the men, Jay (Neil Maskell), must kill one final victim known as The Hunchback.The twist: The Hunchback is actually his imprisoned wife with their son strapped to her back. After he kills them, he is crowned by the cultists.The set-up: Leonard (Guy Pearce) is tracking down the man who raped and murdered his wife. However, his search is stunted by his short-term memory loss. Throughout the film, he tells the story of Sammy Jankis, a man who accidentally killed his diabetic wife she kept requesting more insulin as she didn\u0027t believe he had memory loss.The twist: The man responsible only raped his wife and Leonard killed him years ago – he just can\u0027t remember it. His wife\u0027s actual killer is... himself. His real name? Sammy Jankis.The set-up: A grizzled boxing trainer seeks atonement by helping Hilary Swank\u0027s underdog amateur boxer, Maggie, achieve her dream of becoming a professional.The twist: Mid-way through the film, Maggie breaks her neck after being sucker punched during a fight. What was a feel-good underdog story swiftly turns into a hard-hitting drama about euthanasia.The set-up: Helping several others dodge the monsters lurking in the mist, David Drayton (Thomas Jane) leads the escape from the supermarket they’ve been holed up in. They reach a car and drive away, but soon run out of gas and realise there’s no hope. David loads a gun and, as the camera cuts away, shoots the survivors, including his young son. The twist: As he’s gearing up to put the gun to his own head, shadowy figures roll toward him. He’s devastated to learn it’s actually the military who have combatted the mist creatures. He killed his son for no reason. Talk about awful timing.The set-up: Oh Dae-Su (Choi Min-sik) is kidnapped and held in captivity for 15 years. When he\u0027s finally released, he exacts revenge with the help of a young girl named Mi-Do (Kang Hye-jung) whom he falls in love with.The twist: The girl is actually his daughter. His captors orchestrated their meeting.The set-up: The plot centres on a couple who, after the death of their unborn child, adopt a mysterious nine-year-old girl named Esther (Isabelle Furhman) who starts displaying some disturbing behaviour. The twist: Esther is actually a 33-year old murderer who has a condition stunting her physical growth. The set-up: Nicole Kidman stars as Grace, a mother who tries to protect her two children from supernatural forces in their Victorian mansion.The twist: In a spin on the ghost story, it turns out it\u0027s Grace and her children who are the ghosts: she killed them – before turning the gun on herself – in despair over the presumed death of her husband in World War II.The set-up: The film tracks the rivalry of two magicians, Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) and Rupert Angier (Hugh Jackman), who go to extreme lengths to outsmart one another, each pulling off tricks the other considers impossible.The twist: It emerges that Fallon, the bearded carer of Borden’s children, is actually his twin (he’s also played by Bale) while Angier’s technique is far more disturbing: each night, using Tesla’s technology, he sends his clone plummeting into a water tank.2437 Planet of the Apes (1968)The set-up: Three scientists wake up hundreds of years after being launched into space to discover they’ve landed on a planet where primates rule over humans, who are their prisoners.The twist: As Charlton Heston’s character escapes his cell, he eventually finds the Statue of Liberty protruding from sand. Turns out it’s not just any planet – it’s Earth.The set-up: A defence attorney (Richard Gere) has a strong belief that his stuttering altar boy client (Edward Norton) is not guilty of murdering an influential Catholic Archbishop. He\u0027s later found not guilty by reason of insanity after being diagnosed with multiple personality disorder.The twist: He faked the  disorder. The film\u0027s closing moments see him drop the stutter and reveal his guilt as his attorney looks on, disturbed.The set-up: What viewers initially think is a film about a theft committed by Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) turns out to be something far more darker. On the run, she arrives at a motel owned by Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins) and is swiftly murdered by his mother.The twist: Only, it\u0027s not his mother – it’s Norman. He killed his mother years before and has since developed a split personality.The set-up: Having been chained up by the Jigsaw killer in a dilapidated bathroom – which has a corpse lying  in the middle of the room – photographer Adam (Leigh Whannell) overpowers and kills his captor. He rummages through his pockets, looking for the key that will unlock the chain around his leg, convinced the nightmare is finally over.The twist: Instead, he finds a cassette recorder that reveals his supposed captor was, in fact, another victim of the Jigsaw killer who was merely following his rules in order to obtain an antidote for a poison in his body. Cue a corpse in the middle of the room rising to reveal himself as the real Jigsaw killer. He was there the whole time.The set-up: David Mills (Brad Pitt) and retired PI William Somerset (Morgan Freeman) have closed in on serial killer, John Doe (Kevin Spacey), who has been using the seven deadly sins as inspiration for his murders.The twist: He has one final murder left to commit – only he’s already committed it. We discover Doe has killed Mills’s wife (Gwyneth Paltrow), which prompts him to complete Doe’s plan by murdering him out of wrath.The set-up: US Marshal Teddy Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his partner (Mark Ruffalo) arrive at a centre for the criminally insane to find an escaped killer who drowned her three children.The twist: Teddy is actually a patient, and his partner is his doctor. He killed his wife after she murdered their three children and the elaborate  ruse is an attempt to bring his repressed memories to the surface.The set-up: A young boy who can see dead people encounters a child psychologist named Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis) and attempts to discover the reason behind his disturbing ability.The twist: Crowe is, in fact, dead all along. He got killed during a robbery that we see in the film’s opening scene.The set-up: The introverted Angela (Felissa Rose) becomes terrified when a murderer wreaks destruction at the same campsite where her brother Peter was killed eight years before.The twist: Angela is the killer. She\u0027s also not Angela at all, but her presumed dead brother Peter, who was raised as a girl by her aunt following Angela\u0027s death.3237 The Skin I Live In (2011)The twist: The Vera we\u0027re seeing is not wis wife, but a young man whom Robert abducted and subjected to a vaginoplasty six years before.The set-up: Peter Parker (Tom Holland) takes a break from trying to stop the film\u0027s villain, the Vulture (Michael Keaton), to go to his school\u0027s Homecoming dance. The twist: He shows up to his date\u0027s house, knocks on the door... and comes face to face with The Vulture. He\u0027s her father.The set-up: David Dunn survives a train crash that kills 130 passengers, and begins to believe he may have special powers. His life soon collides with comic book store owner Elijah (Samuel L Jackson), who has a rare bone disorder, and helps David discover he has the ability to see the criminal acts of those he comes into contact with. The twist: Elijah is the biggest criminal of them all. When David shakes his hand at the end of the film, he sees that “Mr Glass” is the mastermind behind numerous terrorist attacks – including the train crash he survived.The set-up: Verbal Kint (Kevin Spacey) reveals a criminal plot concocted by the notorious Keyser Soze. He\u0027s eventually set free.The twist He made the whole thing up – Kint is Keyser Soze.The set-up: A mother’s rift with her parents is healed when she sends her two children, who they’ve never met, to stay with them when she goes on holiday. All is going well until the kids become somewhat weirded out by their strange behaviour.The twist: Their mother becomes disturbed when she sees her parents while Skyping her children - it’s not them. It emerges that these imposters are mental home patients who murdered the couple, and have now taken up residence in their house. The twist: The girl was never missing – it was just an elaborate hoax to lure an out-of-towner so the island\u0027s residents could sacrifice him to their Sun God.The set-up: The services of linguistics professor Louise Banks (Amy Adams) are called upon when aliens arrive on Earth. While experiencing visions of her daughter, who we learn died from cancer in her teens, Louise attempts to communicate with the race in a bid to discern the purpose of their visit.The twist: Louise deciphers the language, which gives her the ability to see into the future. What we thought were flashbacks are, in fact, flash-forwards – her daughter is yet to be born.The set-up: Briony Tallis (Saoirse Ronan) falsely accuses the housekeeper’s son (James McAvoy) of raping her cousin when she becomes jealous of his relationship with her older sister (Keira Knightley). He’s sent to prison, but is eventually freed to enlist in World War II – and the audience is told that he eventually rekindled his romance with Cecilia and lived happily ever after.The twist: Only, they didn’t. We learn that this is another lie from an older Briony – both Robbie and Cecilia died in the war.The set-up: Having been hired by Evelyn Mulwray (Faye Dunaway) to investigate her husband’s death, JJ Gittes (Jack Nicholson) discovers the existence of someone crucial to the case: Evelyn’s sister, Katherine. The twist: After being confronted by Gittes, Evelyn reveals that Katherine is also her daughter – and the result of being raped by her father when she was 15.The set-up: IRA member Fergus (Stephen Rea) promises to protect Dil (Jaye Davidson), the girlfriend of a soldier his group has imprisoned, and soon begins an unexpected relationship with her. The twist: Dil is transgender, and was born male. Fergus\u0027s love for her sees him take the fall for a shooting she commits.The set-up: Having awoken in a bathtub, and discovering he has telekinetic abilities, John Murdoch attempts to find the truth behind a dystopian world that’s inhabited by an evil group who can stop time and implant memories.The twist: His search for meaning sees him reach the end of the city.

A shocking sequence sees Sullivan kill Costigan who believes he\u0027s got away with it. Sergeant Sean Dignam (Mark Wahlberg) sees to that in an equally as shocking climactic scene.The set-up: A woman named Christina is enlisted into murdering her husband by his mistress.

However, his search is stunted by his short-term memory loss. Throughout the film, he tells the story of Sammy Jankis, a man who accidentally killed his diabetic wife she kept requesting more insulin as she didn\u0027t believe he had memory loss.The twist: The man responsible only raped his wife and Leonard killed him years ago – he just can\u0027t remember it. His wife\u0027s actual killer is... himself. His real name? Sammy Jankis.The set-up: A grizzled boxing trainer seeks atonement by helping Hilary Swank\u0027s underdog amateur boxer, Maggie, achieve her dream of becoming a professional.The twist: Mid-way through the film, Maggie breaks her neck after being sucker punched during a fight.

They reach a car and drive away, but soon run out of gas and realise there’s no hope. David loads a gun and, as the camera cuts away, shoots the survivors, including his young son.

The set-up: Nicole Kidman stars as Grace, a mother who tries to protect her two children from supernatural forces in their Victorian mansion.The twist: In a spin on the ghost story, it turns out it\u0027s Grace and her children who are the ghosts: she killed them – before turning the gun on herself – in despair over the presumed death of her husband in World War II.The set-up: The film tracks the rivalry of two magicians, Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) and Rupert Angier (Hugh Jackman), who go to extreme lengths to outsmart one another, each pulling off tricks the other considers impossible.The twist: It emerges that Fallon, the bearded carer of Borden’s children, is actually his twin (he’s also played by Bale) while Angier’s technique is far more disturbing: each night, using Tesla’s technology, he sends his clone plummeting into a water tank.2437 Planet of the Apes (1968)The set-up: Three scientists wake up hundreds of years after being launched into space to discover they’ve landed on a planet where primates rule over humans, who are their prisoners.The twist: As Charlton Heston’s character escapes his cell, he eventually finds the Statue of Liberty protruding from sand. Turns out it’s not just any planet – it’s Earth.The set-up: A defence attorney (Richard Gere) has a strong belief that his stuttering altar boy client (Edward Norton) is not guilty of murdering an influential Catholic Archbishop. He\u0027s later found not guilty by reason of insanity after being diagnosed with multiple personality disorder.The twist: He faked the  disorder. The film\u0027s closing moments see him drop the stutter and reveal his guilt as his attorney looks on, disturbed.The set-up: What viewers initially think is a film about a theft committed by Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) turns out to be something far more darker. On the run, she arrives at a motel owned by Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins) and is swiftly murdered by his mother.The twist: Only, it\u0027s not his mother – it’s Norman. He killed his mother years before and has since developed a split personality.The set-up: Having been chained up by the Jigsaw killer in a dilapidated bathroom – which has a corpse lying  in the middle of the room – photographer Adam (Leigh Whannell) overpowers and kills his captor. He rummages through his pockets, looking for the key that will unlock the chain around his leg, convinced the nightmare is finally over.The twist: Instead, he finds a cassette recorder that reveals his supposed captor was, in fact, another victim of the Jigsaw killer who was merely following his rules in order to obtain an antidote for a poison in his body. Cue a corpse in the middle of the room rising to reveal himself as the real Jigsaw killer. He was there the whole time.The set-up: David Mills (Brad Pitt) and retired PI William Somerset (Morgan Freeman) have closed in on serial killer, John Doe (Kevin Spacey), who has been using the seven deadly sins as inspiration for his murders.The twist: He has one final murder left to commit – only he’s already committed it. We discover Doe has killed Mills’s wife (Gwyneth Paltrow), which prompts him to complete Doe’s plan by murdering him out of wrath.The set-up: US Marshal Teddy Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his partner (Mark Ruffalo) arrive at a centre for the criminally insane to find an escaped killer who drowned her three children.The twist: Teddy is actually a patient, and his partner is his doctor. He killed his wife after she murdered their three children and the elaborate  ruse is an attempt to bring his repressed memories to the surface.The set-up: A young boy who can see dead people encounters a child psychologist named Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis) and attempts to discover the reason behind his disturbing ability.The twist: Crowe is, in fact, dead all along. He got killed during a robbery that we see in the film’s opening scene.The set-up: The introverted Angela (Felissa Rose) becomes terrified when a murderer wreaks destruction at the same campsite where her brother Peter was killed eight years before.The twist: Angela is the killer. She\u0027s also not Angela at all, but her presumed dead brother Peter, who was raised as a girl by her aunt following Angela\u0027s death.3237 The Skin I Live In (2011)The twist: The Vera we\u0027re seeing is not wis wife, but a young man whom Robert abducted and subjected to a vaginoplasty six years before.The set-up: Peter Parker (Tom Holland) takes a break from trying to stop the film\u0027s villain, the Vulture (Michael Keaton), to go to his school\u0027s Homecoming dance. The twist: He shows up to his date\u0027s house, knocks on the door... and comes face to face with The Vulture. He\u0027s her father.The set-up: David Dunn survives a train crash that kills 130 passengers, and begins to believe he may have special powers. His life soon collides with comic book store owner Elijah (Samuel L Jackson), who has a rare bone disorder, and helps David discover he has the ability to see the criminal acts of those he comes into contact with. The twist: Elijah is the biggest criminal of them all. When David shakes his hand at the end of the film, he sees that “Mr Glass” is the mastermind behind numerous terrorist attacks – including the train crash he survived.The set-up: Verbal Kint (Kevin Spacey) reveals a criminal plot concocted by the notorious Keyser Soze. He\u0027s eventually set free.The twist He made the whole thing up – Kint is Keyser Soze.The set-up: A mother’s rift with her parents is healed when she sends her two children, who they’ve never met, to stay with them when she goes on holiday. All is going well until the kids become somewhat weirded out by their strange behaviour.The twist: Their mother becomes disturbed when she sees her parents while Skyping her children - it’s not them. It emerges that these imposters are mental home patients who murdered the couple, and have now taken up residence in their house. The twist: The girl was never missing – it was just an elaborate hoax to lure an out-of-towner so the island\u0027s residents could sacrifice him to their Sun God.“We had the best intentions for\u0026nbspSerenity.\u0026nbspWe were excited for the opportunity to release this uniquely original movie and work with such a stellar cast and talented filmmakers.

Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.110 Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers  – 2008No frills, just good old-fashioned rock and roll. Tom Petty’s performance is often omitted from rankings of the best Super Bowl halftime shows, but we’re including it here because he absolutely crushed it. Kicking things off with “American Girl”, he followed it up with “Won’t Back Down”, “Full Moon Fever” and the emotional “Free Fallin’”, rounding off with a stirring rendition of “Runnin’ Down a Dream”.U2 had the unenviable task of trying to raise everyone’s spirits just six months after the 911 attacks, but they did an admirable job, with performances of uplifting tracks like “Beautiful Day”.McCartney preceded the pop stars trying to outdo one another with extravagant stage designs and lavish costumes. Instead, he offered four beautifully played songs, of which the final one, “Hey Jude”, prompted an epic singalong with the crowd at Jacksonville’s EverBank Field Stadium.One of the few to outdo Katy Perry’s 2015 entrance was Madonna, three years earlier, who appeared on a giant golden chariot led by about a hundred buff men dressed as Roman soldiers. She brought out Nicki Minaj and MIA for “Give Me All Your Luvin’” and also performed hits “Like a Prayer”, “Music” and “Express Yourself”.There are few entrances as grand as standing on top of a giant golden lion with glowing eyes. Katy Perry went all out for her halftime show in 2015 with performances of “Roar”, “Dark Horse”, “California Gurls”, “Firework” and “Teenage Dream”. And who can forget the notorious Left Shark and his poor coordination?“Put the chicken fingers down and turn your television all the way up,” the Boss ordered. Springsteen’s 12-minute set started out with “Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out” and also included “Born to Run”, “Glory Days” and “Working on a Dream”.710 Janet Jackson and Justin Timberlake – 2004Janet Jackson delivered a blistering, brilliantly choreographed show that ended with “Rock Your Body”. But the moment Justin Timberlake ripped away her costume, and exposed her breast for approximately half a second, overshadowed all of that. The incident, dubbed “nipplegate”, even inspired the creation of YouTube. Jackson was turned into a scapegoat for the ensuing controversy, while Timberlake didn’t receive anywhere near as much scrutiny.One of the most outlandish halftime shows in recent memory, Lady Gaga began her performance by hurtling herself from the top of the stadium (attached to a harness, of course) – sparking a thousand memes. Once safely on the ground, she thrilled audiences with her biggest hits: “Poker Face”, “Born This Way”, “Telephone”, “Just Dance”, “Million Reasons” and “Bad Romance”.Beyonce basically ties with Prince for the greatest all-time Super Bowl performance. It was bold, it was fierce, it was virtually flawless. Bursting onto the stage with “Crazy in Love” after an a capella “Love on Top”, she threw down some of her best dance moves, before moving on to other hits including “End of Time” and “Baby Boy”. Lastly, there was a hysteria-inducing Destiny’s Child reunion with Michelle Williams and Kelly Rowland – a performance so powerful, the lights at the stadium cut out when it ended.The greatest. Of course, the Purple One wasn’t responsible for the rain that began to pour during his hair-raising 12-minute performance, which included covers of “We Will Rock You” and “All Along the Watchtower”. But the timing was so perfect, you wanted to believe he was. Following renditions of “1999Baby I’m a Star”, Prince closed on “Purple Rain” in what has to be ranked among one of his greatest live performances of that song.110 Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers  – 2008No frills, just good old-fashioned rock and roll.

But does one exist? Ben Chu looks at the evidenceClick to followThe IndependentIs the prime minister looking for something that isn’t actually there?Theresa May is returning to Brussels to try to renegotiate the European Union withdrawal agreement to make it acceptable to a majority of MPs in the House of Commons.But what will she ask for?On Tuesday night almost all of her party’s MPs and\u0026nbspa majority of the Commons voted in favour of an amendment put forward by the senior Tory backbencher Sir Graham Brady calling for the Irish backstop (the insurance clause that says the entire UK will remain in an EU customs union if there is no EU free trade deal struck that manages to avoid a hard border in Ireland) in the withdrawal agreement to be replaced with unspecified “alternative arrangements”.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialDowning Street’s logic is that, if the EU agrees\u0026nbspto this, the agreement she brings back will finally make it through the Commons.But what might these alternative arrangements be? Even if the EU was prepared to reopen the withdrawal agreement, do they really exist?How badly could Brexit disrupt farming exports from Northern Ireland?The “Malthouse Compromise”, a proposal put together by Tory MPs from both wings of the party, refers to a “protocol” to replace the backstop in a document put out last month called “A better deal”. This was written by Shanker Singham of the Institute of Economic Affairs, a think tank with opaque funding.This protocol offers various technological and procedural measures – including, among other things, customs checks away from the border and a new regime of regulatory equivalence between the UK and EU – which would supposedly eliminate any new frictions on the Irish border as a result of the UK leaving the EU customs union and single market.But how credible is it?Dr Katy Hayward of Queen’s University Belfast says its provisions for policing standards and preventing smuggling would not be secure.Sam Lowe of the Centre for European Reform agrees that the document is not\u0026nbspcredible in terms of policing.“Can you do it without physical infrastructure? Maybe. Can you do it without a significant uptick in ‘associated checks’? I don’t think so. Would it still constitute a border in many peoples’ minds and be disruptive? I think yes,” he says.In other words, if the Singham\u0026nbspplan is the only alternative to the Irish backstop that Theresa May can offer to Brussels her renegotiation effort looks likely to be short and unsuccessful.Got an unanswered question about Brexit?

Still,\u0026nbspit would be foolish not to listen to the concerns of a group of companies that between them sell about half the\u0026nbspnation’s groceries.Their warning is backed up by evidence from several sources. Government figures show the UK produces 48.7 per cent of the food it eats and the proportion has been steadily declining. The rest is imported, with about two thirds of that coming from the EU.\u0026nbspAdditional border checks on thousands of containers of food each year could mean significant delays which are a particular problem for fresh fruit and vegetables (the very items we are most dependent on imports for,\u0026nbsp84 per cent of our fruit and 48 per cent of our vegetables\u0026nbspnot being homegrown).\u0026nbspEventually, supermarkets may be able to re-engineer their supply chains to restore the flow\u0026nbspof fresh produce but many goods will undoubtedly be more expensive.Rising prices of fruit and vegetables will lead to 12,400 additional cardiovascular deaths between 2021 and 2030, research published in the British Medical Journal this week estimated.While some have argued that Brexit presents an opportunity to reduce\u0026nbspour reliance on food imports and boost British farming, this cannot happen in the short term.And even if domestic production were\u0026nbspto be ramped up drastically, UK climate conditions will not be suitable for all crops. We could heat thousands of greenhouses of course, but that raises significant environmental questions.There is a saying among optimists\u0026nbspthat when life give you lemons, you should make lemonade. But what if there are no lemons, only turnips by the bucketload?Got an unanswered question about Brexit?

But Ms May’s spokesman said: “It is right that we do this work.“It is something that we have said we would be keen to take forward and work on with the EU.“It was set out in the withdrawal agreement and the political declaration that this was something both parties were committed to looking at as an alternative means of guaranteeing there would be no hard border in Northern Ireland.”The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The best way to do this is to support a people’s vote on the Brexit deal, and to truly give us a final say.”The fall in student support for Labour could be explained by several different reasons, but the concurrent rise in support for a new vote just as Mr Corbyn’s own MPs accuse him of prevarication over the issue is stark.At an event on the steps of parliament last week Labour and Tory MPs announced they would not table a cross-party amendment for a second referendum because it stood no chance of passing the Commons without Mr Corbyn’s support.Created with Sketch.Final Say petition delivered to Downing Street Show all 30Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Today the Independent\u0027s Final Say campaign and People\u0027s Vote delivered to 10 Downing Street their respective petitions calling for a public referendum on Theresa May\u0027s Brexit dealL to R:  Christian Broughton, Editor, The Independent, Justine Greening, Conservative MP for Putney, Labour MP for Streatham Chuka Umunna, Lara Anne Spirit from People\u0027s Vote, Caroline Lucas, Green Party MP for Brighton Pavilion, Holly Baxter, Co-Editor Independent Voices and Christina Koci-Edwards from People\u0027s Vote hand in a petition to Downing StreetFront row L to R: Christina Koci-Edwards from People\u0027s Vote, Caroline Lucas, Green Party MP for Brighton Pavilion, Labour MP for Streatham Chuka Umunna, Christian Broughton, Editor, The Independent, Vince Cable Lib Dem MP for Twickenham, Lara Anne Spirit from People\u0027s Vote and Justine Greening, Conservative MP for PutneyThe Independent\u0027s editor Christian Broughton delivered over one million Final Say signatures and People\u0027s Vote spokesman Chuka Umunna MP delivered 300,000 signatures to Downing Street on Monday December 3 at middayA supporter of the second referendum helps Vince Cable Lib Dem MP for Twickenham out of the rain during a protestL to R:  Labour MP for Streatham Chuka Umunna, Lara Anne Spirit from People\u0027s Vote, Christian Broughton, Editor, The Independent, Caroline Lucas, Green Party MP for Brighton Pavilion, Justine Greening, Conservative MP for Putney and Christina Koci-Edwards from People\u0027s Vote on their way to hand in a petition to Downing StreetChristian Broughton, Editor, The Independent, Justine Greening, Conservative MP for Putney and Labour MP for Streatham Chuka Umunna hand in the petition to Downing StreetCaroline Lucas, Green Party MP for Brighton Pavilion, Labour MP for Streatham Chuka Umunna and Justine Greening, Conservative MP for Putney hand in petitions to Downing StreetToday the Independent\u0027s Final Say campaign and People\u0027s Vote delivered to 10 Downing Street their respective petitions calling for a public referendum on Theresa May\u0027s Brexit dealL to R:  Christian Broughton, Editor, The Independent, Justine Greening, Conservative MP for Putney, Labour MP for Streatham Chuka Umunna, Lara Anne Spirit from People\u0027s Vote, Caroline Lucas, Green Party MP for Brighton Pavilion, Holly Baxter, Co-Editor Independent Voices and Christina Koci-Edwards from People\u0027s Vote hand in a petition to Downing StreetFront row L to R: Christina Koci-Edwards from People\u0027s Vote, Caroline Lucas, Green Party MP for Brighton Pavilion, Labour MP for Streatham Chuka Umunna, Christian Broughton, Editor, The Independent, Vince Cable Lib Dem MP for Twickenham, Lara Anne Spirit from People\u0027s Vote and Justine Greening, Conservative MP for PutneyThe Independent\u0027s editor Christian Broughton delivered over one million Final Say signatures and People\u0027s Vote spokesman Chuka Umunna MP delivered 300,000 signatures to Downing Street on Monday December 3 at middayA supporter of the second referendum helps Vince Cable Lib Dem MP for Twickenham out of the rain during a protestL to R:  Labour MP for Streatham Chuka Umunna, Lara Anne Spirit from People\u0027s Vote, Christian Broughton, Editor, The Independent, Caroline Lucas, Green Party MP for Brighton Pavilion, Justine Greening, Conservative MP for Putney and Christina Koci-Edwards from People\u0027s Vote on their way to hand in a petition to Downing StreetChristian Broughton, Editor, The Independent, Justine Greening, Conservative MP for Putney and Labour MP for Streatham Chuka Umunna hand in the petition to Downing StreetCaroline Lucas, Green Party MP for Brighton Pavilion, Labour MP for Streatham Chuka Umunna and Justine Greening, Conservative MP for Putney hand in petitions to Downing StreetLuciana Berger, a former shadow health minister,\u0026nbspsaid: “Regrettably the Labour leadership won’t commit to an achievable policy and yet we know that the majority of Labour voters, supporters and members want a final say on any Brexit deal.“Yet at a time when Labour should be championing a people’s vote, the leadership avoids answering that call.”She added: “There are millions of young people in our country that supported the Labour Party at the last general election. Over two million of them were under the age of 18 in 2016. They would today now have a vote. And so many whom I speak to cannot understand why Labour is standing in the way of the younger generation having a say on this.”Three of Mr Corbyn’s MPs later moved in parliament to redraft his strategy, so it ties Labour unambiguously to giving Britain a new referendum.The leader has already submitted the Labour Party’s own amendment setting out how he thinks the country should proceed, but it disappointed many backers of the People’s Vote campaign because it failed to fully commit the party to backing a new referendum.Mr Corbyn’s approach would require ministers to find time for MPs only to “consider and vote on options” including renegotiating the withdrawal agreement and also then “legislating to hold a public vote” on any deal that successfully passes through the Commons.The Labour Party has been contacted for comment.HEPI sponsored Wave 5 of the HEPIYouthSight Monitor, which was answered by 1,048 full-time undergraduate students and undertaken between 4-8\u0026nbspJanuary.

But if we are able to make progress sooner then that might not be necessary.We can\u0027t know at this stage exactly which of those scenarios would happen.His comments mark the growing concern among ministers to pass the necessary legislation before exit day, amid reports that February recess could be cancelled to give Ms May more time to win over the EU.Mr Hunt said a solution had not been properly worked up to replace the\u0026nbspIrish backstop - which aims to prevent a hard border on the island of Ireland.\u0026nbspMPs backed a bit to\u0026nbspreplace it\u0026nbspwith alternative arrangements in a series of crunch votes on Tuesday.He said it was difficult to know if negotiations would run to the end of March, but added: Whereas a week ago none of us really knew whether this was going to be possible, we are now in a situation where it clearly is possible.There are lots and lots of hurdles -\u0026nbspno-one is saying this isn\u0027t going to be very challenging -\u0026nbspbut we do now have a consensus in parliament.We can use that consensus\u0026nbspproviding we can meet these concerns, very reasonable concerns from our friends in Ireland about not having a hard border, concerns in the EU about access to the single market.Providing we can do that, which I think we can, then I think there is a way through.However his Austrian counterpart Karin Kneissl said it would be very difficult for the Brexit timeframe to be extended and warned that Britain could be heading for a no-deal exit.She said: According to the Article 50 procedures, the deadline is 29 March,\u0026nbspso there is a time pressure because what couldn\u0027t be reached by negotiation over the last years, it\u0027s very difficult to imagine that there can be a tremendous breakthrough - a magic solution - in the next few days in order also to have this ratified in due time for the remaining EU members.Created with Sketch.

It is shameful that in a nation as rich as the UK thousands are still facing freezing temperatures on the streets. With the right political will there is action we can take right now to give people shelter, and I urge the Government and local authorities to consider measures like opening up Britain’s many empty buildings.In the longer term we need to see an end to policies like Universal Credit and benefit sanctions which push people into poverty, and real commitment to policies which help deal with the causes of homelessness so no one is forced to sleep rough in the first place.”Ms Leadsom told MPs:The House will know that recess dates are always announced subject to the process of business.In this unique session of Parliament and in light of the significant decisions taken by the House this week, it is only right that I give the House notice that there are currently no plans to bring forward a motion to agree dates for the February recess, and the House may therefore need to continue to sit to make progress on the key business before the House.I realise that this is short notice for colleagues and House staff, but I do think our constituents would expect that the House is able to continue to make progress at this important time.\u0026nbspOur Associate Editor, Sean O\u0027Grady has done a video on how to Brexit proof of your life - give it a watch!Continuing on Mr Hunt said:\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp“There are lots of things that we can consider. I\u0027m not expecting a decision to be made this afternoon. But one of the things that the EU often does in these circumstances is put sanctions on iniduals who are responsible for some of the worst things that can happen. And the fact is that the elections that were held last year were not free and fair. They were not legitimate. We have made a very clear request to Nicolas Maduro to announce elections within eight days. So if he does not, we need to do something to increase the pressure to show that we mean what we say and we are not alone – this is Spain, France, Germany, many other countries, who have equally strong views as the United Kingdom. We are not considering sanctions against the whole country because there is a humanitarian situation and we wouldn\u0027t want to make the situation even worse. But targeted sanctions against the kleptocrats who have enriched themselves on the back of the rest of the population who are very poor, that is something I think can be effective.”Speaking to the BBC this morning\u0026nbspon the situation in Venezuela, Jeremy Hunt said:\u0026nbsp“When I spoke to Juan Guaido yesterday, I said to him that many people in the United Kingdom salute his courage and bravery for standing up for institutions in Venezuela. It is not for the UK to decide the outcome of what happens in Venezuela, that is for the people of Venezuela. Mr Guaido was very clear - he wanted us to put pressure on Nicolas Maduro, because they need change. \u0026nbspThe elections were not legitimate, there was vote rigging on an unprecedented scale. Opposition parties were banned and we have a country whose GDP has nearly halved. People are in desperate straits. And what I want us to do is to put every pressure on Maduro and I\u0027m urging EU foreign ministers to do exactly the same when I meet them this afternoon so that we do have free and fair elections and we give the people of Venezuela a fresh chance to start again.\u0026nbspTheresa May spoke to European Council president Donald Tusk yesterday evening in what was described as an open and frank conversation, according to reports from Brussels.Afterwards, he tweeted: The EU position is clear and consistent. The withdrawal agreement is not open for renegotiation.The CBI said its study showed that spending on buildings, machinery and training are expected to be lower this year.Alpesh Paleja, CBI principal economist, said: Uncertainty in the domestic and global trading environment is clearly hitting manufacturing SMEs hard, with sentiment falling, concerns over political and economic conditions abroad spiking and investment plans still well down on the past year.To give the UK\u0027s SME manufacturers some much-needed certainty, it is crucial that politicians now work together to break the\u0026nbspBrexit\u0026nbspdeadlock.Smaller manufacturing firms expect only a slight increase in output in the coming months, while orders are set to be flat, a new report suggests.A survey of almost 300 small to medium sized firms (SME) in the sector indicated that optimism is falling and investment intentions for the coming year are weak.Jeremy Hunt was on Radio 4 this morning - here is a clip of what he had to say:\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspPlease allow a moment for the live blog to loadAccording to reports, the prime minister is now offering to provide additional investment for deprived areas that supported Leave in an attempt to secure the backing of potential Labour rebels ahead of any further votes on her\u0026nbspBrexit\u0026nbspwithdrawal agreement.Estimates suggest that Ms May requires at least 20 Labour MPs to support her deal.The promise of local investment could include spending on former mining communities as Ms May searches for a parliamentary majority, The Times reported.The plea comes as the scheduled date for the UK\u0027s withdrawal from the\u0026nbspEU - 29 March - draws ever closer and the prospect of\u0026nbspno-deal\u0026nbspexit appears to grow\u0026nbspincreasingly likely given Brussels refusal so far\u0026nbspto reopen\u0026nbspnegotiations on Ms May\u0027s rejected agreement.Last month the government announced it was accelerating\u0026nbspno-deal Brexit\u0026nbsppreparations and pledged an extra £2bn\u0026nbspof funding but\u0026nbspexperts at the Institute for Government (IFG) believe the UK is “not ready for no-deal”.\u0026nbsp“The disruption from no-deal - simply from the lack of preparation - would be extremely damaging,” Bronwen Maddox, IFG’s director, told the BBC.\u0026nbspIt cannot be dismissed as a mere blip.The think tank predicted that in eight out of 11 broad policy areas, including health and borders, the government would be unable to avoid some major negative impacts.Created with Sketch.Brexit so far: in pictures Show all 37Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Boris Johnson MP, Labour MP Gisela Stuart and UKIP MP Douglas Carswell address the people of Stafford in Market Square during the Vote Leave Brexit Battle Bus tour on 17 May 2016.

UK infrastructure projects.The committee argued\u0026nbspthat Britain should give swift and serious consideration to\u0026nbspcreating a state-backed infrastructure bank to replace funding the country will lose.Baroness Falkner of Margravine, who chairs the committee, said: “For the last 45 years the UK has relied on the European Investment Bank to invest in all manner of vital infrastructure projects such as Crossrail, London’s ‘Super Sewer\u0027, the expansion of Manchester’s tram network and Scotland’s Beatrice offshore windfarm.“The UK’s infrastructure, and the industries that depend on infrastructure spending, will be hurt if the government does not quickly find a way of plugging the funding gap that will be created if access to the EIB is lost after Brexit.“We’re calling on the government to give serious and swift consideration to the creation of a UK infrastructure bank.”\u0026nbspThe Liberal Democrat peer also urged Ms May\u0026nbspto come clean about why the government is not claiming Britain\u0027s share of €7.6bn\u0026nbspfrom the EIB as part of its Brexit plans.Under the terms of Ms May\u0027s Brexit deal, the UK will receive the €3.5bn\u0026nbspof capital it has paid into the EIB but it will not receive any share of the bank\u0027s profits, which the committee says could amount to €7.6bn.Responding to the report, a Treasury spokesperson said: “As we leave the EU, we will get every penny of the more than £3bn we put into the European Investment Bank back to invest in UK infrastructure. We also have assurance that existing UK projects will face no disruption from our exit.Brussels says UK should still pay into EU budget after no-deal Brexit“This is just one of part of a much larger settlement that we have negotiated with the EU, which honours our commitments and is a good deal for taxpayers.“We are investing record amounts in Britain’s infrastructure, with funding for roads, railways, schools and hospitals reaching levels not sustained for forty years.”Ms May was recently criticised for choosing to launch her long-term plan for the NHS from a hospital that was built with £50bn of EU financing.Liverpool’s Alder Hey Children’s Hospital received £56m from the EIB\u0026nbspfor reconstruction work in 2013, according to research by the Best for Britain campaign.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This follows a subdued December, when price growth slowed to 0.5 per cent.“Indicators of housing market activity, such as the number of property transactions and the number of mortgages approved for house purchase, have remained broadly stable in recent months, but forward-looking indicators had suggested some softening was likely.Brexit uncertainty will push rents up faster than house prices by 2023The big Brexit forecast: what will happen to house prices in 2019?UK house prices growing at slowest pace in five years“In particular, measures of consumer confidence weakened in December and surveyors reported a further fall in new buyer inquiries towards the end of 2018.“While the number of properties coming on to the market also slowed, this doesn\u0027t appear to have been enough to prevent a modest shift in the balance of demand and supply in favour of buyers in recent months.”Mr Gardner said the uncertain economy is likely to be acting as a drag on the housing market, despite strong\u0026nbspemployment figures,\u0026nbspwage growth and low interest rates.He continued: “Near-term prospects will be heavily dependent on how quickly this uncertainty lifts, but ultimately the outlook for the housing market and house prices will be determined by the performance of the wider economy - especially the labour market.Howard Archer, of the EY Item Club said: “If Brexit is delayed, ongoing uncertainty is likely to weigh down on the housing market and could well see house prices stagnate or fall slightly.”Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said: “The uncertainty created by Brexit largely is responsible for the further decline in year-over-year growth in house prices to near-zero, from a broadly stable rate of about 2 per cent\u0026nbspin the 18 months before November.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

These people are ­consistent and have my respect.But there are just as many who are in danger now of sitting on the fence until rigor mortis sets in, coming up with process rather than substance.They are simply hoping that others will do the dirty deed and respect the will of the people.It is also, for every Labour and Conservative MP, the manesto ­promise that we stood on at the last election. We voted for a referendum. We promised to respect the result.We got re-elected promising the same, yet Parliament continues to sit on the roundabout to nowhere.It is time to stop the shenanigans and work across the political ide to bring our country and our people together.At stake is our democracy. And in a democracy the winner prevails.Of course, in future years, people can argue that we have got it wrong and that people are entitled to change their mind. But for democracy to be true and real, we have to deliver the mandate we have been given and leave the EU on March .The referendum ided people and families, with lots of strong and dfering views. But in cherishing our democracy, we now need to come together to deliver a Brexit that respects the people’s vote and helps heal that ide.In le we have to compromise. We all have our own perfect Brexit, me included. And with ten of my colleagues we have forced through a big part of that, guaranteeing in law workers’ rights, health and safety and environmental standards. We will be competing with Europe by being the best, not by being the cheapest.I would love to have been a fly on the wall when Theresa May told union bosses that she was meeting their key demands not just with a promise but with a legal guarantee. But then she knew it was only right, because union members were the bedrock of leave voters across the country.And, I believe, we can get more in the next fortnight. A clear commitment to a once-in-a-generation investment into the Leave-voting areas that have long been starved of our fair shares — those former coal, iron and steel industrial heartlands, the unfashionable places, the areas still manufacturing. I think, as well, that union bosses and industrialists can be brought to act as advisers to the trade negotiations when we have left the EU, bringing their expertise into play to ensure a jobs-first Brexit for Britain.A country, proud and independent, standing on its own two feet, ­confident again in our democracy, bold enough to compete by being the best, British workers making high- quality products and delivering high-quality services.A country that says it will be the best by having better pay, conditions and a healthier environment than anyone  in Europe or worldwide.Is that not something to be confident in voting for, my fellow MPs  Let’s get on with it.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Along with the likes of megabucks Remainers Tony Blair, Peter Mandelson and PR guru Roland Rudd, he seems to think Brexiters are basically pond le.That theory should be buried forever after this weekend’s passionate plea from leading academic Sir Noel Malcolm for MPs to stop wrecking Brexit.Writing in the devoutly pro-EU Financial Times, this distinguished Fellow of All Souls, Oxford, spells out the essence of the Leave case: “Brexit is about sovereignty — and parliament must respect that.”“If the UK is now on the brink of a constitutional crisis,” he adds, “one major reason is that a signicant number of MPs still oppose any version of Brexit, and seek a second ­referendum solely for the sake of reversing the decision of the last one.”Sir Noel does not believe people voted Out because they were racist.“The most important reason was democracy,” he says.“They wanted to live under laws made by the people they elected. Immigration came second.What they objected to was a supranational government ­making some of their laws and lting all immigration controls on the inhabitants of  other countries.”Another Remainer fiction is that Brexiters are narrow-minded Little Englanders.Yet the Daily Mail found space for a German view that Brussels should stop “insulting Britain” and honour us as champions of peace in Europe.“Such blinkered and sour responses are wrong-headed,” says Alexander von Schoenburg, a senior editor of Germany’s biggest newspaper, Bild.“They ignore the great debt Germany and the whole ­Continent owes our friends across the Channel.“We must always remember that throughout your history, independence and sovereignty have been paramount.“Germany in particular should tread lightly when it comes to dealing with your proud nation. It was Great Britain that first stood up to Hitler in .And it was Britain that opened its doors to thousands of ­Jewish refugees fleeing certain death during the Holocaust.“Put simply, there would be no free Europe without you and the bloody sacrice you made to rescue the Continent.”This remarkable tribute ­follows a recent love letter to the UK from Germany’s next Chancellor calling for a friendly Brexit orce and an end to bitterness.It is now clear hardline Remainers have over-reached themselves. The worm has turned.Talk of a second referendum is dead and voters are on the warpath against MPs plotting to scupper Brexit in tomorrow’s Commons showdown.Brussels is in chaos over the Northern Ireland backstop.Michel Barnier has started muttering about new tech- nology to police post-Brexit ­frontiers — a UK idea initially dismissed as “magical thinking”.EU allies are breaking ranks to demand a decent deal — for their sake as much as ours.It is way past time now for Theresa May to scrap the backstop and tell Brussels exactly what she needs to get her deal through Parliament.“There is absolutely no truth in speculation that ­passengers are being advised not to book,” stormed Brittany Ferries as it announced plans to INCREASE services.Meanwhile, mischief-making aviation giant Airbus admits it was asked by Downing Street to warn – incredibly – that it would shut up shopBritain left without a deal.Project Fear is shameless.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Have a trophy.”And it’s a depressing cycle that will continue for as long as there are National Television Awards, live from The O.A ceremony where the categories may chop and change every year, but the stupidity remains ritualised.As well as getting all the usual winners though, viewers also had to endure a technical nightmare on Tuesday, where things went wrong — from the shambolic opening scenes right through to the unedited version of the closing credits: “With thanks to — Television Centre White City or just Television Centretoo long.”It’s always a case of fine margins, of course, at the NTAs, and the evening might have strayed into so-bad-it’s-good territorythe cameras had just focused on one of the Love Island gang when host Dermot O’Leary said: “Danny DeVito will be in Dumbo next year.”They didn’t, though. So a night bedevilled by sound issues, rotten acceptance speeches and foul Danny Dyer language was crowned by Special Recognition winner David Dimbleby eulogising the BBC and ordering us to be nicer to politicians, in a speech that could hardly be descri- bed as “mood capturing”.It’s the awards themselves though, that I know get viewers’ goats the most, starting, painful as it is to admit, with the fact perennial winners This Morning absolutely robbed Piers Morgan’s Good Morning Britain operation in the Daytime category.Given that Jack Whitehall’s Travels With My Father managed to scrape on to the Comedy shortlist, there’s also an argument that says Chunk, Charlotte Hawkins, Richard Arnold and Susanna Reid — who was styled quite magnicently on the night as Waitrose’s answer to Vicky Pattison — should have made that final five as well.Because almost no show made me laugh as loud or as regularly as Good Morning Britain did in .A glaring omission too in the TV Judge section — always won by David Walliams — which included X Factor’s Robbie Williams on the shortlist, but not Craig Revel Horwood, who didn’t take a two-week sabbatical in the middle of Strictly, cost the BBC £million or throw in his other half as part of the deal.The award that made a nonsense of the whole occasion though was Ant  Dec winning Best Presenters for the th time in a row, despite the presence of Bradley Walsh and Graham Norton on the shortlist, and the fact Ant spent far more weeks in rehab than he did in a TV studio.The mutual affection is touching in one way, of course, but it ultimately does neither them nor the NTAs any good at all and has robbed both of a glorious moment of redemption when they win the  award.Before that foregone conclusion takes place, please stay tuned to This Morning and sit tight until mid-March, when Dr Chris will be along with part II of his bottom-wiping masterclass: Flushing, FLU-SHING.Practially the only programme I watched at the weekend that wasn’t punctuated by uncontrollable sobbing fits from the participants was BBC’s landmark Holocaust documentary The Last Survivors.Men and women who are all in their late eighties and nineties now and understand that time is precious.When you’re a living part of history you also know facts are far more precious than tears.So in the words of the remarkable Anita Lasker-Wallfisch, who avoided the Auschwitz gas chamber purely because she could play the cello: “I won’t give people the pleasure of seeing my emotions.”The very least we owe all of them is an audience. The Last Survivors is available on the BBC iPlayer and will probably be the most unforgettable  minutes of television you’ll watch all year.At approximately : hours, Sunday, Gemma Collins stumbled over while Dancing On Ice.The tectonic plates groaned a little on impact, the front row scattered like ten pins and there was a surge on the national grid as several million viewers went “click, rewind, play,” then “click, rewind, play,” again.In fact, by the time I’d stopped rewinding and playing, Gemma had “bounced back,”and Piers Morgan, no doubt angling for a Le Stories interview, had claimed it was “the gutsiest thing I’ve seen on a talent show” – probably since the days Piers himself was wedged in behind the judges’ desk on Britain’s Got Talent.It was an undeniably great television moment, though.A proper face plant, with a full Klinsmann snow plough to finish.The downside, obviously, is that it’s guaranteed she’ll be back next week, when Melody, Wes, James and the others will be performing to a Fairytale theme and Gemma will be clearing the B Fettercairn to Banchory road,ITV want to find a proper use for her.Click, rewind, play.Things remain cheerful as hell on EastEnders.Alfie Moon’s car has been discovered near some clfs and a policeman has the job of breaking the most awful news imaginable to Kat and the Slaters.“Considering the location and the evidence at hand, we would suggest you prepare yourself for the worst.”Big Mo: “You understand what they’re saying ”Yes, bloody Redwater’s getting a second series.

But she also says Britain will not leave the EU without a deal.And her deal — the only one on the table at this late stage — was defeated in the House of Commons by a record majority just two weeks ago.Tonight’s Brexit votes are not quite the final shoot-out between the dferent factions in Parliament. The Government has promised that MPs will vote soon on a new plan.Remainers and soft Brexit supporters in government are pushing to hold that vote as soon as possible.And MPs — backed by a Speaker who will rewrite any Commons rules to soften or stop Brexit — will force more votes on what happens next.Nevertheless, tonight’s votes do matter.One proposal comes from Yvette Cooper, a Labour MP.Her Yorkshire constituents voted to leave the EU by more than two to one and, during the election, she promised them she would “not vote to block Brexit.”Yet that is what her plan does:     MPs vote for her   amendment, they will be able to stop Brexit happening this year.Cooper has the support of several rebel Tories, soJeremy Corbyn whips his MPs to vote for it, she stands a good chance of getting her way.Caroline Spelman and Jack Dromey, Conservative and Labour, have an amendment that calls on the Government to avoid a no-deal Brexit.Dominic Grieve wants MPs to control the Commons timetable, allowing Parliament to vote on dferent ways of watering Brexit down.Labour want to present MPs with options that include, predictably, a second referendum.Despite drafting a manesto saying “Labour accepts the referendum result”, the Shadow Brexit Secretary Keir Starmer says in a second referendum he would campaign to overturn the result of the first.It is possible that none of these amendments might pass.Remainers and soft Brexiteers are ided about what should happen.Some want to delay Brexit, some want to tie us to European rules and regulations, and others want another referendum to stop it altogether.Evenno proposal wins a Commons majority, the votes cast by MPs will probably demonstrate that there is a majority to water down Brexit one way or another.For Brexit supporters, this is very dangerous indeed.Some believe they simply need to run down the clock and, in  days, we can leave without a deal.For Leavers who want a negotiated departure, this feels like a serious risk.But Leavers who favour no deal need to ask themselves, can they really be so sure they will get what they want With several Cabinet ministers, many more junior ministers and a Commons majority against no deal, it seems increasingly likely that MPs will ultimately find a way of stopping no deal.When they do, Brexit will only get softer and softer.This is why the amendment proposed by Graham Brady, a senior Conservative, is so important.His idea is to approve the Prime Minister’s original Brexit deal, but with the “backstop” removed.The backstop is hated by unionists, because to prevent barriers to trade between Ireland and Northern Ireland, it creates new barriers to trade between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.And it is hated by Leavers, because it ties the UK to the EU’s customs union, and Northern Ireland to EU single market rules.Brady wants MPs to vote simply for “alternative arrangements” to the backstop.By avoiding a specic proposal, he hopes the amendment can win a Commons majority and, in doing so, demonstrate to Brussels that the deal they struck with Theresa May can be ratied — but only without the backstop.Critics, largely Remainers, say this is impossible.But in the past week or so, Angela Merkel has questioned whether the backstop is such a good idea after all.The Polish foreign minister has suggested it should expire after five years. And the European Commission effectively conceded that in the event of no deal, they would use policy and technology to prevent a hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland.In other words, they proposed solutions they once dismissed as “unicorns” and “magical thinking” when they were suggested by the British — and which could render the backstop unnecessary.But this is not all. Some European officials have floated, in private, a more inventive solution: that the UK and Ireland should form a British Isles customs zone, with Britain compensating Ireland for any new friction in their trade with Europe.So it is clear: whatever Remainers claim, alternatives to the backstop are technically and politically feasible.Recognising this, the Brady amendment would give the Government one last chance to negotiate something better.Yet Tory Brexiteers say they might not vote for it. They fear the ambiguity of “alternative arrangements” could allow ministers to negotiate an even worse deal, perhaps tying the whole of the UK to the EU’s customs union and single market rules for good.They do not trust May, her advisers, or most of her Cabinet and demand a specic time limit on the backstop.Butthey vote down the Brady amendment, they will not get what they want, and are more likely to get what they fear.As the clock ticks on and bottoms get even squeakier, MPs will coalesce around a plan to stop a no-deal Brexit.The EU will have no reason to compromise, and Parliament will soften our departure by aligning us with more and more European laws.If Leavers vote against Brady, they will be shooting themselves not in one foot, and not even in both feet, but in the head.As the Commons debates the proposals today, Leavers need to start compromising with reality. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Both are powered by an inexorable sense of self-righteousness. And both have an awful lot of experience of saying sorry.The most recent example came when Sir Nick appeared on the BBC in the wake of the furore over the death of -year-old Molly Russell.It turned out, after she was found dead in her bedroom in December , that she had been viewing material online relating to depression, self-harm and suicide — material which was shockingly easy to find.As her father Ian Russell put it bluntly: “Instagram helped kill my daughter.”Sir Nick, to his credit, said all the right things about how the firm was determined to do more. But he also made the striking claim that it is sometimes better for Facebook and Instagram to keep suicide images online, because it helps other vulnerable young people get support.This after The Sun, on Saturday, found and flagged up multiple images appearing to normalise and even romanticise suicide, all within a few clicks. Many remained published for days, and a Facebook spokesman claimed they could be beneficial to users battling mental health issues.Sir Nick says the firm is following the advice from leading experts and charities. And it may well be doing the right thing. But this is the latest example of Facebook — and other social media giants in general — only acting to tackle a problem once it becomes impossible not to.Over the past decade, social media has come to dominate our lives. The latest research from Ofcom shows internet use rocketing among children and teenagers, with friendships and social lives increasingly run through screens and phones.And it is now clear that this great move online has been accompanied, for our children, by a staggering increase in mental health problems.The situation is particularly alarming when it comes to young women. The latest NHS data found that one in four of those aged  to  report having a mental health disorder — twice the rate among boys.In  alone, one in five US girls aged between  and  suffered a major depressive episode — one in five! Suicide rates for teenage girls, according to academic Jonathan Haidt, have risen by  per cent in the US and  per cent in the UK in a decade.This isn’t just about what happens on the internet. Those having problems online often tend to be experiencing problems offline too, such as bullying, harassment or broken families.More broadly, Haidt believes the “snowflake” phenomenon reflects that “helicopter parenting” leaves children less prepared to cope with shocks and dficulty. But the internet, and social media, are very clearly intensying those problems. And the big tech firms are still playing catch-up.The traditional argument from Silicon Valley is that it’s not their job to regulate human behaviour. They add that eventhey wanted to, there is simply too much out there.They are doing their best to crack down on inappropriate content, but it’s like trying to stem the tide. Behind the scenes — they insist — thousands of people are working day and night to detect and delete messages promoting terrorism, hatred, Holocaust denial and self-harm.But this argument just doesn’t wash. It’s very clear that, in the interests of their bottom lines, many of the big social media firms have long failed to put enough resources into detecting damaging content.Researchers have shown, for example, how following the recommended links from reputable YouTube content can lead to a carnival of horrors. News reports that segue into crackpot conspiracy theories and videos for toddlers that give way to horrendous scenes of a bloodied Minnie Mouse trapped in an escalator.Every day brings new horror stories, such as rival fans of royals Kate and Meghan using the Kensington Palace Instagram to send death threats to each other. Increasingly, online hate is triggering real-le violence. The slaughter of the Rohingya Muslims in Burma was, The New York Times said, “a genocide incited on Facebook”.Part of the reason that Zuckerberg has hired Clegg is to put his house in order. Clegg has talked the right talk about changing Facebook’s culture, and in particular doing more to tackle self-harm.He even says they might start paying more tax. ButZuckerberg’s answer to “how to fix the internet” is “hire Nick Clegg”, we have still got an awfully long way to go.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Some EU figures have admitted it isn’t. They could tweak the text, time-limit the backstop or find another solution.They choose not to. And they will stick to that as long as they believe Parliament’s Remainers will ultimately strip the Government of its only negotiating leverage, the threat to just walk away.Remainers, some in Cabinet, may well yet do that. Nonetheless last night should sow doubt in Brussels’ minds.The victorious Brady amendment demands a vital, legally binding change to the Irish backstop before the PM’s deal can pass, just as The Sun called for.

It was ­particularly silly to discuss Ireland before the main trade talks, since the obvious way to prevent a hard border on the island is through a deep and ­comprehensive trade agreement between the UK and the EU as a whole.That, though, would have given Ireland a strong incentive to get the best possible terms for the UK, and for itself.So instead, at the end of , the EU suddenly came up with the idea of an “Irish backstop”.It wanted Britain to promise that, unless it came up with a long-term ­trading ­relationship that satisfied ­Brussels, it would stay in the customs union and leave Northern Ireland under EU regulations.Stupidly, British negotiators accepted the backstop. Wisely, our MPs did not.The backstop would mean Brussels continued to control Britain’s trade deals with non-European countries after we left.It would mean placing part of our country under permanent EU jurisdiction.MPs threw the deal out. Then something sensible happened.Leavers and Remainers began to talk directly to each other and hammered out a deal that both sides could live with.There were lots of aspects of the ­withdrawal agreement that Eurosceptics resented.They didn’t like being non- voting members for another  months.They didn’t like Euro judges continuing to rule here even after we had left.They didn’t like forking out more than billion quid in exchange for the better part of bugger all.But they were ready to make ­compromises. If the Irish ­backstop were removed, they’d swallow the rest of the withdrawal terms.On Tuesday, the House of Commons adopted this position. The EU responded with a theatrical snort of indignation.“We stand by the agreement that we have negotiated,” said Michel Barnier, the European Commission’s negotiator.“The withdrawal agreement is not ­renegotiable,” said Jean-Claude Juncker, President of the European Commission.But hang on. Juncker is simultaneously telling us thatwe alter our red lines — by, for example, agreeing to a ­permanent customs union — then the agreement could indeed be reopened.So there is plainly no technical or legal reason why the backstop could not be removed or at least time-limited.Nor, by the way, is anyone still ­pretending that, without the backstop, there will be checkpoints in Londonderry and Crossmaglen.The Irish government has confirmed that,there is no deal, it will not place any infrastructure at the border.The British Government has been saying the same all along.Barnier says there would be ways to carry out necessary checks away from the frontier.In other words, the whole row is about a border that no one is going to build anyway.It’s ­surreal. There is plainly no way the House of Commons is going to accept the backstop.It also became clear on ­Tuesday there is no majority for a ­second ­referendum, because the last thing Jeremy Corbyn wants is to have to come down on one side or the other.That leaves only two options. Either the backstop is dropped but everything  is agreed, or the backstop is lost and so is everything .From the EU’s point of view, it must surely be preferable to agree the bulk of the Withdrawal Agreement, including reciprocal citizens’ rights and the ­£billion payment, while finding an alternative way to guarantee the Irish border stays open.From Dublin’s point of view, the logic is even stronger.Insisting on the backstop risks,not a hard border, certainly more dislocation between the Republic of Ireland and the UK — the very thing the backstop is ­supposed to prevent.The EU has calculated the cost will be worse for Britain than for ­Continental states, since cross-Channel trade is ­proportionately more important for us.But, by that measure, it is more ­important still for Ireland.In private, some Continental politicians are pushing for a pragmatic outcome — one that minimises disruption and ­preserves the long-term alliance between the UK and its neighbours.You especially hear these arguments in countries that trade heavily with Britain, such as Denmark and the Netherlands.You also hear them from governments that want to ensure the rights of their citizens in Britain are guaranteed.But for Eurocrats, in particular the anti-British Martin Selmayr who has seized control of negotiations, this isn’t about finding an outcome that works.If it were, the EU could have signed a continuity deal with Britain easily.The truth is many Euro-fanatics are happy to inflict pain on the EU  ­provided they inflict even more on us.If their view prevails over that of the pragmatists, then Britain has no option but to leave without an agreement.

The people who can’t get beds in our hospitals, or a place for their kids in the local school. All the while that £billion is being spent on fabulously berserk ­projects in the developing world.To her total credit, Mordaunt has said that our current level of spending on overseas aid is unsustainable. It’s been rising every year. Due to a law passed by the coalition government, we have to spend . per cent of our income on aid to the Third World each year.So right now we spend just under £billion. And where does this money go  No less than  per cent of it is siphoned off to global outfits like that most useless of organisations, the United Nations.This is the body which sent out some dimbo Australian envoy to tick off our Government about economic policy. An organisation which elected Saudi Arabia on to its Women’s Rights Commission. An anti-Western and rabidly anti-Israeli convocation of leftie Third World thugs with chips on their shoulders.The world would be enormously improvedthe UN was shut down tomorrow. And the rest of it  Some of the stuff you wouldn’t believe. A total of £, went to a project investigating Tibetan verbs. Nope, not kidding.I would assume that “climb” was one of the verbs they were investigating. They use that a lot, over there. Thanks to our overseas aid, someone, ­somewhere is now able to say in Tibetan: “F*** me, is that a yeti  Run away!”Then there’s the £, spent on a scheme to stop Indian schoolchildren imbibing sugary drinks. India itself gives overseas aid and has an income rather bigger than our own. Where is the point Another six-figure sum was spent ­persuading Chinese people not to smoke too much — China! The second richest country in the world.Another one was to help Indian workers cool their work­stations down — this in a country which has its own space programme, for Chrissakes. So much of our money is swallowed up by useless leftie quangos and charities to keep themselves in jobs.Still more is pocketed by despots in the horrible countries they run. It is a source of corruption and dependency. It makes things worse. And when we tried to ert our overseas aid to some of the Caribbean countries stricken by hurricanes we were told we couldn’t — they were too rich!It’s a nonsense and a racket. If I thought our overseas aid, in its current form, really alleviated misery and suffering I’d be all for it. That’s why I agreed with the last secretary of state, Priti Patel, who wanted to give a decent chunk to the Israel Defence Forces, which saves a lot of lives in Syria.So my recommendation would be to end it all NOW. Divert the money into our beleaguered and creaking infrastructure. And when a tragedy occurs overseas — sure, splash the cash.Anyway, Penny — hope I’ve helped by starting the conversation. Over to you, babes.SCOTTISH politician Ross Greer has already been called a “ginger turd” by Piers Morgan, and I don’t think I can improve on that. But it’s his ignorance and stupidity that staggers – rather than his hatred for Great Britain, which is something we’re used to from north of the border.Greer described Winston Churchill as a white supremacist, a mass murderer and a racist, and likened him to Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin. He says he is simply challenging the “myth” of Churchill. No, Ross, you’re not.You’re just pig ignorant, with a very poor grasp of history. Of course Churchill was racist. Just about everybody was of his age at that time.If you can’t see the importance of Churchill to winning the Second World War – against REAL racists, REAL mass murderers – when Britain stood alone, then you lack all sense of context and proportion.The more I think about it, the more I reckon “ginger turd” was an understatement.HERO of the week is the excellent Rachel Riley, who has been speaking out against anti-Semitism. As a consequence, she now needs greater security when she’s doing TV’s ­Countdown. The left-wing Jew-hating trolls have been after her.Rachel,  said: “The more I speak, the more abuse I get, and the more abuse I get, the more I speak. It’s got to the point where I can’t look at my Twitter feed any more. It’s just a constant stream.”She’s pretty clear who is behind it, too.  A lot of the abuse comes from people who sign off with the hashtag JCPM.SO, Labour MP Fiona Onasanya is off to prison. Found guilty in court of lying through her teeth.But the remarkable thing is she’s still going to be paid as an MP while she’s inside. She has refused to resign her seat and so her £, salary will continue to be paid by the rest of us.If you got sent to the nick, do you think your employers would continue to pay your wages  You’d be out on your ear. It’s kind of ­outrageous, no THIS cultural appropriation business is getting out of hand. Marks  Spencer has been slammed by leftie nutters with nothing better to do with their time. For selling a biryani wrap.They say it’s not authentic. Well of course it’s not bleedin’ authentic.  This is the UK, not Mumbai. Singer Katy Perry was attacked for wearing a kimono because she isn’t Japanese.White people in the US get criticised for wearing training shoes or sporting afros – that’s appropriating black culture, apparently. Though I think it was white folks who invented training shoes. Thing is, cultural appropriation is brilliant.It’s the way we have of sharing our respective cultures.  think it’s wonderful that countries outside Europe and the US have “culturally appropriated” democracy, sanitisation, railways, computers and so on. I wish more would do the same.SOMALIA is the most corrupt country in the world, according to a list compiled by a group called Transparency International.Not a great surprise, is it  Nor to see most of the rest of Africa hogging the bottom quarter of the world table.It’s bad governance and corruption that is keeping Africa poor – not colonialism. You can tell that the compilers of the report are lefties, though. Asked what countries were becoming more corrupt recently, they named the US, Hungary and Brazil. All three have elected right-wing governments.A NEW study says that women who wear short skirts are more likely to be ­promoted.The lesson I’d take from this,I were a women, is to wear a short skirt to work. But I don’t think that’s the lesson they mean us to take.I wonderwomen who wear short skirts but have the legs of an obese ­elephant also are more likely to get ­promoted I think that’s the next study for those researchers at the ­University of Surrey.I TOLD you last week that the reason we haven’t had a proper winter yet is that the people who run winter couldn’t agree on stuff.Such as whether it should be a hard winter, with lots of snow, no winter at all or a compromise deal with a backstop of some sleet for a bit.But I understand that on Tuesday the President of ­Winter won an astonishing ­victory and was able to push her deal through.Which was why it immediately snowed like hell.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The swelling on her forehead now extended to include more of her face and eyelids, and she experienced sharp, shooting pains in the area.So she ed to hospital, and this time, docs discovered an opening in the centre of the lump which was leaking a watery discharge.According to Dr Farah Shahi, an infectious disease specialist at York Teaching Hospital who treated the woman, the opening was actually a breathing hole for a baby fly or maggot.Doctors applied petroleum jelly to the area which essentially blocked the insects source of air - forcing it to move towards the surface of the skin.After that, they were able to remove the live maggot from the womans forehead before it was sent to the London School of Tropical Medicine for examination.The larva was identied as Lunds fly - a rare species from the rainforests in Africa.An ultrasound found that there were more baby flies in the womans forehead and she had to have surgery to remove them.These flies dont usually infect people, according to the British Medical Journal case report.So, how did it come to buried into her face The most likely explanation is that she wrapped her hair in a damp towel that was infested with maggots, Dr Shahi told Live Science.The towel had been hanging on an outdoor clothing line, and a fly couldve laid its eggs on the towel, which hatched into maggots.Theres only been one other case in the UK of such an infestation its super unusual for these flies to burrow into foreheads as they usually go for the skin on the chest, back, belly and thighs.After four days in hospital, the woman was sent home."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/NINTCHDBPICT0004594149221.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"parents torquay toddler wandering streets caution neglect","story":"Family members previously revealed how the tot had managed to squeeze through the homes catflap before walking around the neighbourhood by himself. The little boy was eventually found by worried neighbours who took him in as cops searched for his parents.Devon and Cornwall Police later confirmed a woman in her s and a man in his s were arrested on suspicion of child neglect and then released on bail.

Something has finally happened on Brexit.What has happened is that the Tories have agreed to stop screaming up their own bumholes and scream at the EU instead. This will come as a relief to all those who witnessed their -month act of circular self-abuse, but they did at least give us a new definition for windbags.  This has been described as Theresa Mays best day at work since  by all those people who have not had enough fresh air recently. Her great success is that someone  has been able to unite the Tories around a version of Brexit that is impossible, impractical and undeliverable.They even managed to persuade  of the crazier members of the Labour Party to join them in this unmedicated dreamland, where the DUP have long gambolled in the insane belief it will reignite their holy war against the Fenians.The Tories have, for the first time in two and a half years, decided what they want. The problem is that it is the opposite of what Theresa has done or can do. On November , , she told the House of Commons: The Brexit talks are about acting in the national interest, and that means making what I believe to be the right choices, not the easy ones.I know there are some who have said I should simply rip up the UK’s commitment to a backstop, but this would have been an entirelyirresponsible course of action. It would have meant reneging on a promise made to the people of Northern Ireland during the referendum campaign and afterwards - that under no circumstances would Brexit lead to ato the borders of the past - and it would have made it impossible to deliver a withdrawal agreement.As Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, I have a responsibility to people in every part of our country, and I intend to honour that promise.And last night, she was told to do all the things she didnt want to do on the grounds that doing them would be f***ing disastrous. What has happened is this: . Theresa presented Plan A, which guaranteed the rights and safety of .m British citizens in Northern Ireland, and was punched in the face by Parliament which snarled stuff em.. Theresa presented Plan B, which was much the same but had a dferent letter on the front page, and Parliament said well maybe so long as we can decide to say stuff em later, slapped Theresa lightly and sent her back to Brussels. The EU are about to say alors, but you people cest tres thick. Theresas people are already briefing therell be a Plan C. And I can tell you now whats in it.  Plan C will have moved on signicantly from Plan B by being more like Plan A. Itll have the same words in much the same order, with very similar promises about protecting those .m British citizens with a backstop, and it will get voted through by Parliament for two reasons.First, theyve voted on it twice already, and have been dragged towards accepting a version of it. On the third time of asking, theyll be ready to back ANY version, in much the same way a man who has kicked himself in the head will wonderits possible to do it again.Imagine such a person, and you will have invented Iain Duncan Smith.  Secondly, there will be no other option.There is now no Parliamentary time left for Theresas deal to get the necessary legislation through before its self-imposed Article  deadline. There isnt even enough time for the new laws we need to trade under WTO rules in the event of a No Deal Brexit.By automatic operation of the law, on March  all EU treaties cease to be effective. Predicted results include motorways turning into lorry parks, medicines being rationed, the imposition of martial law and Jacob Rees-Mogg declaring an ancestral right to eat peasants. Even those Parliamentarians whove been hoarding gold and have a Barbudan bolthole dont want that sort of legacy hung around their neck, so extending the deadline is inevitable. And fortunately, the law they wrote about all this allows for a minister to change the exit date whenever they fancy. And most importantly there is no other option for the border in Northern Ireland. No way to take back control, no way to superimpose a UK referendum on to a people who had a referendum on this already, and managed a % mandate on an % turnout. People traffickers and drug smugglers dont fill in customs forms, weve no way to police a -mile border with  crossing points, and as the cherry on the cake elderly IRA bombers are coming out of retirement to make car bombs for new splinter groups.The only way all these things were resolved was with an open border, that allowed the unionists to remain British while allowing the republicans to pretend they were Irish.No-one has an alternative to that, and it is a fact of quite beautul irony that the only way anyones going to Brexit isthey refuse to take back control of our sole land border with the EU.So we wont Brexit on March , because we cant. Well call it Brexit a bit later, and it wont be because all this arguing was just to get us to the point where we could discuss what Brexit will look like. And it wont ever BE Brexit, because every power-crazed demand the backbench fruitloops have made has had to be dropped - when courts ruled it unlawful, when public opinion swung against them, and when Theresa persisted them into submission.Her problem is that all the Brexit chaos has been laid at her door. She has been blamed for the indecision, poor negotiation and infighting, for a dud election and international humiliation.Yet somehow, through either great stupidity or brilliant stratagem, she has forced her party and the country to agree what it never would have done in , a year or even  months ago. Leavers and Remainers now fervently believe any deal is better than none at all, appreciate Northern Irelands problems in a way few ever bothered to do, andthe polls are right are coming to the opinion that the current deal we have with the EU is the best of all possible worlds.What happened last night is that the hardliners have taken their latest of , tiny steps towards admitting their dream is just that. Thats why Theresa is stronger than ever, why the Labour Party is on the back foot and the EU is scratching its head.Sanity is beginning to reassert itself. It says do something, avert disaster, extract cranium from bum, ask yourselfthis is a good idea. All those Parliamentarians who complained Parliament was being undemocratic are now praising it for embodying the will of the people.Theres months and probably years more of arseing about, of course, and any group of people with a fetish for rectal screaming are probably going to try it a few times more before they realise it hurts too much.Sanity is not immediate. But it is there, flickering gently in the place where dreams meet geography.

Angela Davey, , was a married mum-of-two with a successful career before she got involved with a gang selling heroin and crack cocaine. It happened after her marriage hit trouble - and now her family have begged her to give herself up. Davey had been due to be sentenced for dealing cocaine after being caught during an undercover drugs operation. A close family member, who asked not to be named, said: Angela went from being a bright, well-educated person to somebody who the last time she was seen, was sleeping in a shop doorway in Norwich. Shes hopelessly addicted to drugs.  The relative said he feared the family would not get her back, adding: Her brain has changed. Everybody wants her to just come in so we can help her to deal with the situation. Davey had been due to appear at Norwich Crown Court along with David Teixeira, , from London, who was described as being the branch manager of the county lines gang, transporting drugs from the capital to London. Jack Parrish, , from Norwich, was said to be the main local dealer on the streets, while Tara Kelf, , allowed her Norwich flat to be used as a base for the operation.   All three defendants admitted conspiracy to supply Class A drugs and were jailed for a total of  years.

Ian Brewster, , attacked his partner Kayleigh Rutter at knepoint, stopped her from seeing friends and threatened to smash up her propertymen contacted her on Facebook during their brief romance. In one attack, Miss Rutter, , was pinned to the bed and had a blade held to her throat, leaving her fearing she would die. During another attack, Brewster, from Hyde, Greater Manchester, went berserk when his friend sent a Facebook message to Miss Rutter. He told her: Get him around here and I will stab you first and make him watch, then I will stab him through the neck.   The mother-of-one blamed Brewsters controlling behaviour for her subsequently losing a custody battle over her daughter from a previous relationship. She later moved into a womens refuge to get away from him and he has now been jailed. In a statement Miss Rutter said: His actions have made me feel scared and frightened. I also feel very angry as he has messed things up for me - I have lost a custody battle for my daughter, which is why I didnt want the police involved. I am always on edge now and in constant fear. At the moment, I just feel numb - I dont know how to feel.  At Minshull Street Crown Court, Manchester, heavily tattooed Brewster blamed his paranoid behaviour on him being ly branded a sex offender at the age of . He was jailed for  months after he was found guilty of controlling or coercive behaviour upon Miss Rutter plus other charges of assault upon another ex-girlfriend and criminal damage to her TV. The court heard Miss Rutters ordeal began just days after the pair began a relationship in Apr-l last year. Joshua Bowker, prosecuting, said: He asked her to go to the shops and get groceries but when she did, he accessed her Facebook account and sent messages to all her male friends saying that they couldnt contact her anymore.  To justy this to her, he said that he had been cheated on in the past anda male ever sent her a message, he would threaten to smash her phone in her face. On one occasion, he punched the bedroom door three times, creating holes in it. Another time, one of the defendants friends called her and he put his foot through the door. Miss Rutter said he was going psycho and he pinned her to the bed and had a kne against her throat. She said that she thought she was going to die. She was so scared in her own home, he would put the knives out of reach from her so that only he could get them.  On May , she received a phone call from a friend using her boyfriends mobile and the defendant became angry again. He said to her get him around here and I will stab you first and make him watch, then I will stab him through the neck. The next day, her mother picked her up from her home in the morning and took her away. He sent her more abusive messages on Facebook when police were notied the police, he accused Miss Rutter of being a liar.  Brewster denied wrongdoing but failed to attend his trial in August last year and was convicted in his absence. He was later put on a police wanted list and was arrested last Christmas. His lawyer, Ben Knight, said in mitigation: The defendant is paranoid about why people want to be in relationships with him and he is paranoid about infidelity, and I think this controlling behaviour bolsters his own self-esteem. Also, at  years of age, he was accused of sexual assault. No further action was taken at that time but the accusation has been used by a number of people in his le as a weapon against him. On social media, people have shared photos of him saying that he is a paedophile. As a result of this vigilante behaviour on social media, he has spent quite a lot of time looking over his shoulders. He did not commit any such offence, but that does not matter in the court of public opinion and Facebook. He has been ly painted as a paedophile and has been assaulted because of that. Sentencing, the judge Miss Recorder Samantha Presland told Brewster: Over a period of three weeks, you engaged in pretty relentless, violent, coercive and controlling behaviour. You would regularly threaten Miss Rutter with a kne, not let her see her friends, and you threatened to stab her and her friends. She eventually had to go and live with her mother. You are displaying destructive co-dependant behaviour which is not good for you or for them and it needs to to stop.

Danial Elliott was beaten up as he walked home from school last Thursday. The youngster was hit from behind and kicked in the back and neck by his attackers who then fled the scene, Hull Live says.The schoolboy initially hid his injuries from his worried mum Vikki Elliott until they got back home. But the stress of his attack alongside being repeatedly bulled at school led to him later threaten serious self-harm. Ms Elliott, from Beverley, East Yorkshire, said: He looked fine when he got into the car. He said nothing to me which is not unusual and because of the bullying he will dust himself off as he is the eldest sibling.   We got into the house and he was stomping about I was asking what was wrong. He got into a bit of a confrontation with me before going into the hallway, putting his hands on his head and dragging his nails into his own face. He then shouted I might as well kill myself. The mum-to-four, , said Danial has been bullied since primary school, with children targeting him because of his bowel problems. She added: They call him things like smelly, a toilet, they call him all sorts. He doesn’t tell me anything now because he just gets fed up with repeating it.   It’s getting to the point where they are bullying him that badly that he doesn’t want to be around here anymore and before Christmas he threatened to hang himself. We are keeping an eye on him but there is nothing we can do to help him with this condition he has got. He is on medication andit stops working we have to up the dosage. He sees doctors and paediatricians but there is nothing  we can do until he is older. After the attack, Danial ended up in hospital until am on Friday, January , and he had to have his head put in a neck brace for extra protection. They could have killed him, Ms Elliott said. One kick in the wrong place could have broken his neck or paralysed him and the people who did this need to understand that.  You hear about it all the time – one punch in the wrong place and you can kill someone. They could have left me without my son and his three younger siblings without a brother and that is just devastating to think about. They were so worried on Thursday when he was in hospital and losing Danial would have left a big whole in our family.The incident has been reported to Humberside Police but it cannot be confirmed whether Danial was attacked by the same bullies who have been making his le hell at school.His mum continued: He is not ready to go back to school. He is so withdrawn and becomes even more withdrawn when school is mentioned. He is in a lot of pain and I want to doctors to write a note so that the school knows he needs time to recuperate.

She was hired by the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge when Prince George was just a few months old and now also looks after Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis .She trained at the famous Norland College, the countrys top training centre for childcare, and has a lot of experience. Author Louise Heren spent a year at the college researching a documentary, so knows exactly what the students are taught. Speaking to , shes revealed some of the techniques and tricks the nannies use to ensure kids behave - and its likely Maria is using them on the royal children.   She believes that despite the extraordinary lives they have ahead of them, le at home will be fairly normal.Louise, author of Nanny in a Book , said: Given what we have seen of Catherine when she is out in public, shes very hands on.I imagine her relationship with Maria is very close and they collaborate greatly on the care of the children. Ive spoken to nannies who have worked with other royal families and le is pretty normal. You get up, have breakfast, you go to school and you wear your school unorm whether you like it or not. It would be quite like the average British school children. Here are some of the Norland Nannies tips and tricks: Always involve children in planning Once the child is old enough, Norland Nannies believe its important to let them help plan the day. Give them options to pick fromsuch as going to the park, baking a cake or reading. Louise says: It means that the nanny has got some control but the child has chosen what to do and is happy that they got the choice.   Explain exactly what is going to happen when heading out Marias job is unique in that the children she is raising are far from normal and she has to prepare them for royal events and tours. Louise said: Her job is to keep them happy, safe and well but equally they need to be presentable and well behaved when they are on parade. Before royal events she believes Maria and Kate will speak to the children to tell them exactly what is going to happen, who they are going to see and what people are going to do - for example everyone will be waving and they should wave back. Meal times Norland Nannies believe routine is essential for children, especially for big parts of the day. Louise said: Children understand routine but they like to be informed of that routine. Evenlunchtime is half an hour later, the clues that lead up to it stay the same. Ten minutes to go, wash your hands, can you help me lay the table    The nannies also use meal times as a key learning opportunity. Setting the table involves the child counting out the right amount of cutlery for each person and the right number of plates and cups. They can also practice their colours when picking out dferent items. The nannies also try to give children choices when it comes to their dinner. For example, which two vegetables would you like today  This allows them a choice and also means you have a responsethey are unhappy about eating it. Louise said: If they are informed beforehand you dont get a grizzly child. Bedtime Much like meal times, routine is key. Bath, pajamas and a bedtime story every night help the child know its time for bed.  Louise, who has also written a book on the history of Norland College , said: It is training resilience in the children that they are happy to be on their own in the dark at night.Her relationship with the children Louise said: [Maria] will be friendly with the children butthey need a little bit of discipline shes more than able to step in and do that. Their approach is very nurturing and loving. It is entirely centred around the children.  It is about training the children by example rather than just telling them. Its about saying why did you do that  Think about how that would have been received. Make everything an opportunity to learn The day is filled with dferent learning opportunities. Nannies will ask the children to count dferent things. Louise believes that Maria will probably ask the children how to say dferent things in Spanish and French, as they are learning both languages.   Tantrums There isnt a set way Norland Nannies deal with tantrums, as every child is dferent. But they will always try to spot the tantrum before it unfolds. Louise says that there is normally an early trigger, so the trick the nannies are taught is to spot this earlier. Speaking about the dreaded terrible twos, she said: The child has the mental ability to want something but they havent got the language ability to say can you get that for me. The tantrum can build because youre not observing what theyre trying to get or do. Frustration is building. One word that is banned There is one banned word in the Norland College, which probably means Maria doesnt use it when referring to George, Charlotte and Louis. According to Louis, children are always referred to children and NEVER kids.

I wasn’t sure at first, but when my mate explained I’d get good money and wouldnt need to have sex with anybody, I went for it - I had no close family to help me out and I was desperate, she said.

I would never be able to forgive myselfsomething happened and I hadnrsquot done something about it, said Mr Middleton.He is particularly concerned that many drivers do not know the cycle track is there because it is set back roughly  metres from the road, through the garden of the Green Drive Hall.Mr Middleton said when the cycle path was upgraded three years ago, a barrier was removed which had separated the path clearly from the road.There is now a sign at the end of the path before it meets the road, warning cyclists to dismount. But Mr Middleton said that the sign was being ignored and there was a danger at the bend where cyclists meet traffic.Speed reducing tables have been installed at the site, but Mr Middleton said: ldquoCars are going over the raised tables at mph and then drivers are putting the foot down in between them.He has reported his concerns to the council who carried out a survey in May last year. It revealed the average speed in the mph zone at the busiest time in the morning is .mph.He is now urging the council to instal signs to alert the drivers to the oncoming cyclists or a speed indicating devicewhich will show road users their speed.The path is used by pupils from Lochardil Primary, Inverness Royal Academy Holm Primary and the Gaelic school.Mr Middleton fears young people on the path may not be seen by fast moving vehicles: ldquoWe have crossed this road many times andin the company of two or four of my grandchildren this is more dficult, the main reason for this is in estimating the speed of accelerating vehicles since the tables were installed said Mr Middleton.A Highland Council spokeswoman said: ldquoA mph zone was recently installed in the Culduthel Lochardil area at the request of the community council.

especially in this weather, she said.ldquoEvery parent that sends their child to school by bus is depending on the council to ensure that happens safely.ldquoIt is the councilrsquos responsibility as corporate parent to ensure these children get to school safely.A spokeswoman for Stagecoach North Scotland said: ldquoSince we started operating the additional school contracts on January  there have been some issues with capacity we have identied and are working to resolve.ldquoWe are working closely with Highland Council to resolve these problems by issuing school children with passes allocating them to specic buses to prevent the overloading problems we have seen.She added that in terms of the issues raised by Mrs Paterson an additional bus is now running to and from Croy.Thursday  Jan  : PM"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04119000/04119409.jpg","title":"Site for Inverness homes not acceptable","story":"Councillor Ken Gowans hit out at the application by agent Bracewell-Stirling for DMPM Services.He said the site was not zoned for housing and would pile pressure on local school rolls which are already well over  per cent capacity.ldquoWhile we need more affordable houses, any development must be part of the local plan, and this development is not.ldquoThis is likely to generate more unacceptable pressures on infrastructure which is already struggling to cope at the moment.ldquoWhile developers pay contributions towards education, it doesnrsquot change the fact that local schools are beyond full, and the councilrsquos school roll projections indicate these will worsen in the short to medium term, he said.Highlands MSP and road safety campaigner David Stewart also expressed some concern: ldquoI am mindful that the dual A will be at one side of this site and the rural B road will extend along another side of the site.ldquoAs it stands, this particular road has no pavement for pedestrians and this would be an issue that would cause me concern.Thursday  Jan  : PM"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117111.jpg","title":"Work starts on new outlets at Eastgate Shopping Centre","story":"WORK has begun at the Eastgate Shopping Centre in Inverness to develop four food outlets.The units, suitable for restaurant or bar operators, are being created by the reconfiguration of two existing shops fronting Falcon Square.Burger King UK is the first operator to sign up while talks are ongoing with operators for the other units.In addition, a new kiosk will be created fronting the Falcon Square mall entrance.

In January , Aberdeen missed out on the capture of Jim McInally in extraordinary circumstances.The former Dundee United midfielder had fallen out of favour at Raith Rovers and a move to Pittodrie had been proposed.The Dons had offered the Kirkcaldy club former Stark’s Park midfielder Peter Hetherston in a straight swap for McInally.Everything seemed to be going according to plan, with McInally paraded at a Pittodrie press conference on January  .However, later in the day it emerged Hetherston had failed his medical at Raith and the deal was off.McInally, now manager of Peterhead, said: “I had fallen out with Jimmy Nicholl, who was Raith manager, and there was really no way back for our relationship.“He was taking the players away the week before Christmas to Magaluf but I refused to go.“I didn’t want to leave my two young kids because at that age Christmas week was a special week for the family.“When I refused to go that was me and Jimmy finished and he was desperate to get Peter Hetherston back at Raith because he was a hero at the club.“It was a dream come true for me really because it would have brilliant to go to a club of Aberdeen’s stature at that stage of my career.“To say it was long drive back down the road after that was an understatement – I was gutted.”In the - season, Aberdeen were enjoying a good campaign under Roy Aitken’s management.They had lted the League Cup in November and would end up finishing third in the Premier Division.For McInally, to this day there remains a sense of “what might have been ” over his move to the Granite City.He added: “It was a massive low for me what happened.“I hadn’t been in a situation before like I was with Jimmy at Raith and with the move not happening it felt like the rug was pulled from underneath me.“Going up to Aberdeen gave me a real lt and I remember being paraded at Pittodrie and doing the press conference.“Then I was supposed to play Cove Rangers in a friendly that night at Allan Park.“I was taken to a guest house and went for a sleep in the afternoon to prepare for the game.“Then I got a phone call from Roy Aitken saying Peter had failed his medical, so it was a disaster.“I was preparing to play the friendly that night and everything was fine at my end.“So for the move not to happen was a massive let-down.“It shows how things can go wrong with transfers and for me it would have been brilliant to play for a club like Aberdeen.“I was  at the time, so I was maybe past my best, but I was still fit.“Something like that hadn’t happened to me until near the end of my career and at that time there wasn’t transfer windows either, but the move still couldn’t be resurrected.“Now it must be a nightmare for playersthe window is coming closer to shutting and you can’t move and then are left in a situation knowing you’re not going to play.“It was a brilliant for me that day when I thought I would join Aberdeen.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2019/01/5c52a40442f8f3.99064901-390x564.jpg ","title":"blind groups horror over cycle path plan","story":"A blind group today slammed plans for a new Aberdeen cycle path, saying it will create a “no-go area” for people who suffer from sight problems.Sandy Taylor, Scottish representative for the National Federation of the Blind , said the proposed Dyce cycle route could present a danger.The new path will create a shared walking and cycling space as well as provide better links with the train station in Dyce.Under the plans, a .-metre shared-use cycle route will be created.Mr Taylor believes potentially having blind people and cyclists in the same area could be a danger.He said: “We’re not happy about it.

It was written for Count Friedrich Wilhelm, supposedly simplied for amateurs to play. However, Jamal and Jâms being master musicians showed the power of this often disregarded piece, to be immense. One of the first works to make piano and cello equal musical partners, it is full of ingenious dialogue between the instruments. The structure is unusual, but with such expert performers it delighted the audience who were moved by every turn and twist of this deeply emotional work.Jâms, from North Wales, after remarking on the three ferry crossings required to get to Ardrishaig via Bute, introduced the next piece, Ernest Bloch’s work ‘From Jewish Le’. In a style close to Jamal’s heart and heritage, having been born in Baku Azerbaijan, its three elements, ‘Prayer’, ‘Supplication’ and ‘Jewish Song’, are full of the pathos and sorrow felt by the Jewish nation and also full of the signature augmented intervals and minor key tonality of much of middle eastern musics. How beautully these pieces demonstrated the lyrical qualities of the cello. Jamal’s bow searched for all possible nuances of tone and dynamic as his instrument sang from its lowest notes to a seductive soprano register.The concert continued after the interval with a second Beethoven work. The audience may have noticed a minor kerfuffle at the piano as many pages were rapidly turned before starting. Would it be the ‘Seven Variations’ for cello and piano or the ‘Twelve’, both based on themes from Mozart’s Magic Flute  The ‘Seven Variations’ won, being on the theme from the ‘Pamina’ and ‘Papageno’ duet entitled ‘In men, who know the feeling of love’. This work exhibits Beethoven’s practised ingenuity in the iation form and brought a lighter mood to the programme.Jâms Coleman introduced the final work, Frank Bridge’s Cello Sonata. He told of the four years of torment for the composer as he struggled to express his feelings about the First World War, finally finishing the composition in . The adagio in the piece caused the composer the most dficulty as he struggled with ambivalence about his own pacist views. Jâms and Jamal dealt with the challenges of this complex work which tracks huge changes in the world of music composition that were under way at that time. Again, the lyrical powers of the cello came to the fore as did the virtuosic requirements heaped on the pianist. Despite its undoubted innovations, this piece generously reaches out to its audience. Bridge uses the new musical freedoms only when justied, being happy toto more traditional tonal stability in the lyrical sections.Fulfilled, but not overburdened by the weightiness of the final piece, the audience applauded Jamal and Jâms back to the concert room to perform the ‘Swan’ from Saint-Saens ‘Carnival of the Animals’ as encore. This piece so beautully confirmed the excellence of Jamal’s playing and the superb quality of his quite special instrument.PIC:Jamal Aliyev and Jâms Coleman. no_aJamalandJam"},{"url":null,"title":"inveraray carpet bowling club festive pairs competition","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe Inveraray Carpet Bowling Club held its annual festive pairs competition.The first prize of turkeys was won by George Morrison and Alan Cameron.

Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.

Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13926204.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_18355078.jpg","title":"ayr united 2 inverness 3","story":"NewsAyr United  Inverness : John Roberston hails Somerset Park among best grounds in worldThe Inverness gaffer was full of praise for the old fashioned surroundings as his side clung on in the face of a stirring fightback.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  JAN Updated:,  JAN NewsNathan Austin puts Caley - up \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailJohn Robertson hailed Somerset Park as one of the best grounds in the WORLD after Caley held off a storming Ayr fightback. Inverness were three up and on easy street after a crazy opening  minutes which saw United gt-wrap the game. But a Lawrence Shankland inspired comeback almost grabbed a share of the spoils for Ian McCalls title contenders. A relieved Robertson said: Had it finished - you wouldnt have been surprised. Somerset Park is one of these grounds that sucks you inyou give them a snf. Its a good throwback and their fans make it intimidating and a good atmosphere for teams when you lose a goal. Its brilliant...one of the best grounds in the world to come and play your football. In the past we might have lost a game like this so Im delighted.  Ayr knew a win here would take them top of the Championship and started well with Robbie Crawford missing a good chance in the first minute. But they soon hit the self destruct button as their defence went AWOL to allow Nathan Austin in for a double before Liam Polworth rammed home a third. The game looked over with barely  minutes on the clock and shellshocked Ayr took time to regroup. Coventry-bound Michael Rose rocked the post with a header before Michael Moffat drew a fingertip save from Cammy Mackay. McCall turned to the bench at half time and introduced top gun Shankland who immediately turned the tide. He set up Declan McDaid to haul Ayr back into the contest with a close range finish eight minutes after the restart. And a resurgent Ayr thought they had a penalty when Carl Tremarco appeared to handle in the box but ref Nick Walsh waved away loud protests. United continued to pour forward as the clock ticked down and Shankland set up a grandstand finish when slamming home a  yard free kick with five minutes left.  But their comeback proved too little too late as Inverness clung on. Ayr boss McCall said: Im just gutted. Weve conceded three goals and at least two of them were gted with just crazy defending. And were the team with the best defensive record in the league. I think a draw would’ve been fair but it’s just one of those nights.

It is the first solid guarantee in the long-awaited Ayrshire Growth Deal.The nine-figure sum will be announced by Scots Secretary David Mundell tomorrow, the Ayrshire Post can exclusively reveal.Sources say he will reveal the jackpot figure during a visit to the Halo urban regeneration on the old Johnnie Walker whisky land in Kilmarnock. A senior source said: “The UK Government’s contribution to the Ayrshire Growth Deal will be in the region of pound million. “It’s clear from the growth deal process that a lot of very exciting projects have been put forward. We are confident the deal can deliver a massive boost to the local economy.” The Ayrshire Growth Deal will provide signicant investment in the key sectors of aerospace and space at Prestwick, le sciences, manufacturing and tourism. It has been talked about for years as a poundm fund but the Scottish Government and three Ayrshire councils have all failed to reveal their financial input. The aim is to make key investments that will grow the economy and lead to , new jobs.  To do that the poundm public sector finance will have to trigger poundbillion of private investment. It is widely accepted Ayrshire has missed out on big investment deals as it has three councils scrapping for superiority, rather than a single strategic voice. Growth money is expected to be spent on luring a medicines manufacturing innovation centre, developing brownfield sites for industry, improving the Bellfield Interchange, upgrading digital infrastructure and free port status at Prestwick , the Port of Ayr and Falkland Rail Yard in Ayr and a renewable energy hub in Cumnock. It is expected the signing of heads of terms - the stage when all the ious partners get together and announce which projects will receive funding - will be reached within several months. All seven of Scotland’s cities are now covered by the deals and Ayrshire is in the first wave of regions. The poundm for Ayrshire takes total UK Government commitment to pound. billion across Scotland.

A friend flagged up that they were looking for someone to do some voiceover work for a TV programme.\"She went for that and spent a day doing some voiceover work. The woman who was in charge of that asked her to go to the open audition for Molly and Mack.\"That was in December  and we found out after that she got the part of Molly.\"Filming for the first series predominantly took place in Glasgow. Mimi said: \"It was hard work, doing really long days, but I really enjoyed it and I learned a lot. I had lots of lines to learn and had a tutor on the days when I was meant to be at school.\"I also loved the Big Hub where the show was set up because it is a very special place with all the cool little market stalls to have adventures in.\"I enjoyed doing the filming in North Queensferry for the titles, although it was a bit chilly so it was hard to pretend not to be cold!\"I was a very comfortable playing Molly because she is quite similar to me. She is very energetic, always has ideas, loves adventures, and whenever therersquos a problem she always wants to fix it.Dad Mark added: \"I was more overwhelmed that she was - she took it all in her stride. She had a ball - she loved it.\"Aside from the children it was a real veteran cast and crew who had been doing tv and theatre for years. Mimi would come home and tell me what shed learnt that day.\"Mimi added: \"It was cool to have my questions being answered on how they make TV shows - I always got to see how the cameras worked, how actors spend their morning before they go on set and how they did all their hair and makeup.\"With the family based in the Borders and the filming taking place in Glasgow, the logistics of Mimi working in Glasgow proved to be a family affair. Mark said:\"The whole family mucked in to make it happen. We are not a stage or theatre family so it was all new to us.\"Were really proud of her and what shes done, its been a lot of fun.\"And its not just Mimis family who have been supporting her in her new role as a television star.Mimi is a pupil at Knowepark Primary School in Selkirk and her classmates helped celebrate her success with a special screening of Molly and Mack.Mimi said: \"My friends didnrsquot believe me at first because no one had ever done something like this, but once we started watching episodes in class they believe me and are super supportive about it.\"The second series of Molly and Mack will begin production later this year.Mimi said: \"I was very, very excited and glad that there is another series coming because I will get to see all the cast and crew members again, like the producer and director and all the chaperones.\"Molly and Mack is currently on CBeebies every weekday at .pm and .pm."},{"url":null,"title":"ae-figures-show-increased-waiting-times","story":"THE number of people waiting more than four hours at Borders General Hospitalrsquos AE department has increased signicantly over the past year, new figures reveal.Data published by the Information Services DivisionScotland, an NHS body which publishes statistics on NHS Scotland, show that the number of patients waiting for more than four hours to be seen by medical professionals has increased by nearly a third.More than , people waited for more than four hours in , which is a .% increase on the figures from .Furthermore, the number of people waiting for longer than eight hours has increased by %, and the amount of people waiting for over  hours has increased by %.However, the percentage of people being seen within four hours has also increased over the  months, from .% to .%, meaning that while the number of people of waiting longer than four, eight, and twelve hours has grown, the vast majority are still seen within four hours.Claudia Beamish, Scottish Labour list MSP for South Scotland, used the figures to criticise the Scottish Government: ldquoScottish Labour has been concerned about the pressures on health boards for some time and these staggering figures expose the scale of the challenge NHS staff face in delivering patient care and how badly they have been let down by years of SNP mismanagement of our NHS.ldquoIncreasing numbers of people waiting too long at AE reveals unacceptable pressure in other parts of our health service such as in social care and primary care.ldquoWe already know that staff do not feel they are getting enough support and that the level ofunfilled health posts is unsustainable.ldquoI have written to NHS Borders to understand more about the underlying reasons for these increases.ldquoMinisters set the health service targets for staff to hit and then do not deliver the support andresources needed.

is not what we would wish for the people of the Borders and we continually strive to improve our services so that we can provide prompt care to our patients.ldquoTo ensure our patients receive the right treatment from the right services we would encourage people to continue to keep the emergency department for emergencies by using their local community pharmacy, minor injuries units , and

statue to Coulters Candy originator Robert Coltart will be unveiled in his hometown this summer.But the people behind the le-sized bronze tribute are desperately trying to confirman old newspaper photograph sent from Canada is the weaver-turned-sweet seller.Historians Graeme McIver and Mary Craig have been championing Coltarts story for over a decade.And they are delighted that celebrated sculptor Angela Hunter is currently sketching designs for the tribute which will be placed in the towns Market Place.Graeme told us: \"Coulterrsquos Candy is arguably Scotlandrsquos best known and

his adopted hometown playing a whistle and singing his jingle - Ali Balie Bee - with a trail of children in his wake.Coltart also lived at houses in Henderson Close and Park Street, which have both since been demolished.And he was known to travel to nearby Melrose and Selkirk, as well as other Borders towns, to sell his candy on the streets - traders in Selkirk even raised a court order against him as he was taking away their trade.One report from the time states: \"He wore a tam a shanter, or was it a Balmoral bonnet  With a pheasantrsquos feather sticking straight up from a buckle above his ear.\"A shiny black bag slung over his shoulder held stock of the famous candy!\"While there are many descriptions of the larger-than-le Robert Coltart, who died in  at the age of , only one photograph is known to exist.And the researches, as well as sculptor Angela, are trying to have the image veried before the final detail is made to the bronze statue.Angela, whose work includes the iconic Turn bull bronze in Hawick, said: \"We do have one newspaper cutting from the Gala Post, sent from Canada, and we are hoping to confirm this is Robert.ldquoIt is hoped that someone may have further information on his le, so we can make this sculpture as accurate as possible.\"I was born in Galashiels and am therefore incredibly proud to be involved in this project.\"Although the recipe for Coulters Candy was lost after Roberts death, his Ali Balie Bee jingle was passed through the generations.And after it began to be sung at folk nights all over the country in the s, eventually being recorded by Donovan in .The statue, which will feature Coltart selling his candy with two children by his side, will be erected close to his Overhaugh Street home at Market Square.The artwork is

streetscape improvements.Among the supporters of the statue and trail is business councillor Mark Rowley.Councillor Rowley said: ldquoThe story of Robert Coltart is a fascinating one which should be known by more people and alongside the other regeneration works taking place in Galashiels, I am sure it will attract people to the town and the Borders.ldquoA partnership approach is being used to take forward the project with a iety of stakeholders from the local community and businesses involved in finalising the streetscape improvements as priorities.\"These improvement works would not have been possible without the Great Tapestry of Scotland visitor complex, which helped secure the overall support from the Scottish Government Regeneration Grant Fund.ldquoThis year is to be an exciting

core issues of how, when and where the four young soldiers and one civilian died had not been sufficiently established in public proceedings, following a campaign from the families of victims, survivors, and those wrongfully imprisoned to complete the hearings.Soldiers Caroline Slater, , William Forsyth, , John Hunter, , and Ann Hamilton, , and civilian Paul Craig, , died in the blast ndash carried out by the IRA at the height of the Northern Ireland Troubles ndash at the Horse and Groom pub, which was popular with soldiers, in the town on October  .The aftermath of the IRA bomb blast at

Richardson ndash were convicted over the bombings in .They were handed le sentences but had their convictions overturned in  ndash the case becoming one of the best-known miscarriages of justice in British legal history.Reading out his ruling during a -minute hearing at Woking Coronerrsquos Court, Mr Travers said: ldquoIt is not in doubt that the deceased were unlawfully killed by a team of Provisional IRA terrorists, probably comprised of eight people in two cars.ldquoWhat the resumed inquests can and will investigate are issues such as the time of the blast, the respective locations of the bomb and its victims, who was with the victims at the time of the blast, whether each of the deceased died immediately and,not, how long they survived for, whether they said anything to anybody prior to their deaths and the response of first aiders and emergency services.But he said the resumed inquest would not have the scope to explore who was responsible for the bomb, the composition of the explosive device or any claims that police lied during the trial of the Guildford Four.He said that, while there might be some evidential dficulties due to the fact that many witnesses may have died in the years since the blast, others would only be in their s or s, and should therefore be available to be called as witnessesnecessary.Gerry Conlon and Annie McGuireleave the House of Commons after then PM Tony Blair apologised for them being wrongly convicted of the Guildford pub bombings Mr Travers added: ldquoI take the view that the deceased, their families and the public are entitled to have these matters formally explored in open court and in proceedings which are untainted by allegations of impropriety or misconduct.ldquoDoing this will establish and record a credible and reliable account of what happened to the victims in a way that respects and honours their memory, and I believe this would represent an important and worthwhile exercise.ldquoThe deaths in question and the occurrence of a terrorist atrocity in Guildford town centre still matter to the families of those who died, the people of Surrey, and the wider public notwithstanding the lapse of time.ldquoThis case is not of such antiquity that it should be considered ancient history.He added that the inquests would not make determinations which are inconsistent with the Guildford Fourrsquos overturned convictions.The incident and its aftermath became so notorious that it inspired the  film In The Name Of The Father, which saw Mr Conlon played by Oscar-winning actor Daniel

several incidents during bad weather when lorries have been blown on to their sides, leading to the route being closed and ersions introduced from Thistly Cross Roundabout at Dunbar to

It was a cold day but my friend, who is skilled in bushcraft, had brought his portable fire pit with him.We searched for drtwood and sat by the fire, roasting marshmallows and warming our hands. It was a short walk but dramatic rock formations loomed above us, making it feel like a real adventure. The kids climbed them and explored the rocky beach, where once there had been an open-air bathing pool.On our , we went through a small tunnel-like arch. I stopped for a moment, suddenly taken by the view. The ruins of Dunbar Castle were beautully framed by the archway. Locals call this archway the keyhole and I reflected that the term is a perfect name.When we look through a keyhole, our vision is narrowly focussed. Such was the effect here. It cast a visual spotlight on what is left of what was once a mighty fortress.The kids trundled on before me, noticing smaller wonders: a frozen worm on the path, a sea shell and interesting-looking stones. But I stood for some moments, taking in the view beyond and thinking of what stories those old stones of the castle could tell.Many people pass this way every day, both locals and visitors. Itrsquos a section of the John Muir Way. I have often been with my family to Dunbar Leisure Pool and the harbour and town. But somehow I had missed this short but spectacular nearby walk until this day.Dunbar Castle is now but a fallen-down ruin. Indeed, itrsquos dficult to imagine what it once was. But the weathered sandstone castles on the shoreline built by nature still stand defiant, somehow reminding us of their greater permanence in the face of human transience. But as I stood looking at the ruins, the keyhole focussed my thoughts as well as my vision.History is also viewed through a keyhole, a very narrow one. The lives and events of the castle were lived in most part unrecorded by it. The spotlight of history has illuminated only brief moments, and even then the characters have been only those deemed lsquoimportantrsquo.There are moments where the view through the narrow keyhole of history has included insights to untold stories. The bravery of Black Agnes, as she defied the siege in , is one of those. With her husband away, she was in charge of this important fortress during war with England. She refused to give up the castle, even in the face of bombardment and attempts to starve her small garrison into submission. Her mocking of her besiegers by dusting down the battlements with her maids after a bombardment is an image seared in legend.But itrsquos a chink of light on a huge untold story we are led to believe by historyrsquos silence that women were insignicant players in events. For sure they were oppressed and put down by a system that centred on male power, but they are half of humanity and at least half the story.As the actions of Black Agnes reveal, even with such constraints put on them, women were there, part of events and often refusing to accept their assigned role.The le of Mary Queen of Scots has always been for me an example of this. Yes, she was privileged and powerful by birth, but because of this history took notice of her.Despite all the political and religious challenges she faced, it was her womanhood which men deemed her main failing. And so she was judged by dferent standards. Had she behaved with the morals of her father she would not have lasted five minutes in power. But no one raised an eyebrow because he was a man.But more than this, even though Mary was the monarch, her royal authority was deemed diluted and even less legitimate merely because she was a woman.So she understood she needed to find a husband to bring her royal authority to full strength in a country full of powerful and bullying misogynist men.She chose the dashing young Darnley, and the fact that he turned out to be dross was not, in my opinion, Maryrsquos fault. How easy it is to blame a woman for a manrsquos failings. She was taken in by him it was he who was the failure, not her.Thatrsquos what Irsquove always maintained, despite the protestations of my tutors at university. And her third husband Bothwell, well he was a disappointment as well.It is the stones of Dunbar,they could speak, who could tell us of the truth of his forced union with Mary. She had been taken there by him in April . The circumstances of this still remain debated. Was she abducted by him as later claimed, or did she go willingly It was also claimed she was raped and forced to marry Bothwell soon afterwards to save her honour . This idea has been disputed by some because Mary is said to have miscarried with twins while imprisoned at Lochleven Castle some months after, suggesting a relationship with Bothwell even before Darnleyrsquos murder. So a woman cannot be abused by a man she has had a relationship with  Really If they could talk, the stones of Dunbar would whisper the truths of those events in , and the despair and desperation of a strong and clever woman whose destiny was stolen mainly because of her sex.These were my thoughts as I stood looking through the keyhole towards Dunbar Castle. Suddenly, my daughter Manja broke my trance by wiggling the frozen worm in front of me. I smiled and thought to myself that thankfully times have changed since the days when the castle was a fortress.But sometimes, I fear, not as much as we think they have."},{"url":null,"title":"new-fidra-gin-hoping-for-east-lothian-base","story":"Fidra Gin is the brainchild of Emma Bouglet and Jo Brydie and is currently based at Ballencrieff and Aviemore.The duo came together to create the juniper berry-based drink and have already enjoyed immediate success, with the product already available in a number of Edinburgh restaurants.Now they are hoping to make it  per cent based in the county, with plans under way to find suitable premises.Emma said: ldquoWe pick all the botanicals in East Lothian and, at the moment, we use a still in Aviemore.ldquoA friend has lent us his still for the time being so we can get enough momentum behind us and bring the whole operation to East Lothian.ldquoWe have potentially secured a premise in East Lothian.

Woking Coronerrsquos Court, Mr Travers said: ldquoIt is not in doubt that the deceased were unlawfully killed by a team of Provisional IRA terrorists, probably comprised of eight people in two cars.ldquoWhat the resumed inquests can and will investigate are issues such as the time of the blast, the respective locations of the bomb and its victims, who was with the victims at the time of the blast, whether each of the deceased died immediately and,not, how long they survived for, whether they said anything to anybody prior to their deaths and the response of first aiders and emergency services.But he said the resumed inquest would not have the scope to explore who was responsible for the bomb, the composition of the explosive device or any claims that police lied during the trial

happened to the victims in a way that respects and honours their memory, and I believe this would represent an important and worthwhile exercise.ldquoThe deaths in question and the occurrence of a

I still have many of the books I bought with pocket money when I was young, carried through le like a lucky charm. TS Eliotrsquos Prufrock may have measured out his le with coffee spoons I have measured out mine with Puffins and King Penguins, Peregrines and Pelicans. If pressed, I could tell where I found each one.Like radio, the demise of the book has been often foretold. Books, we were unreliably informed, were yesterdayrsquos technology, so th century, so redundant in a digital age. I well recall the gleeful obituaries. The internet would sweep them away with tsunami-like ferocity. Kindles, apparently, were the future, and even I owned one once. Who knows where it lies unloved now. And who cares Similar prophesies of doom were made about bookshops, for what need was there for themno one wanted books  And for a while things did look a bit glum. With the demise of the Net Book Agreement, which determined that books must be sold at their cover price, many privately-owned bookshops found they couldnrsquot compete with the discounts offered by supermarkets and chain stores. Inevitably, sadly, some went to the wall or sold out to more voracious competitors.Of late, however, in what has been the bleakest of midwinters for the high street, there are signs that reports of the death of the bookshop were premature. In the last couple of weeks, I have heard of two new bookshops opening in Edinburgh. And last Saturday evening, I attended a mini book festival in Linlithgow, organised by the local independent, Far From the Madding Crowd, which was very well-attended, a testimony to the loyalty and warmth the shop engenders.The best bookshops are like that. When one of them is threatened it is a cause for mourning and resentment and the raising of petitions. For me, a town without a bookshop is unworthy of the name, a place where civilisation is yet to reach, where culture must surely fail to thrive. I have been in such outposts and nothing would drag me back.Where there is at least one bookshop there is hope. A year ago, I visited Christchurch in New Zealand, which is still struggling to recover from the devastating earthquakes of  and . The centre of the city was preternaturally quiet and the shopping mall was bereft of customers. But the one shop that was buzzing was Scorpio Books, also independently owned, which against all odds had managed to resurrect itself. Would the same, brave decision have been made by the fund managers who control chain stores  Perhaps. Then again, perhaps not.One of the new Edinburgh shops will be Toppingrsquos, which has a wonderful branch in St Andrews. The companyrsquos founder is Robert Topping, formerly of Waterstonersquos in Manchester, which he left after being told to limit the size of the stock. The story is told in a new memoir by Glasgow-born Sir Tim Waterstone, of whom I was briefly an employee ndash the least said about which the better. ldquoThe Waterstonersquos model, recalls Sir Tim, ldquowas simply this: the highest class of heavily stocked literary bookselling run on a national scale by an unusually enthusiastic and highly knowledgeable young staff.Waterstonersquos was born in  when the book trade was in dire of need of modernisation. Complacent, rival shops kept short hours and unsatisfying stock, and their staff were more inclined to turn custom away than welcome it. Waterstonersquos ndash which was in the vanguard of Sunday opening ndash initiated a bookselling revolution and played an intrinsic role in making the literary novel cool. In the store in which I worked, on any given night you might catch a reading by Gore Vidal, Richard Ford, Raymond Carver or Edna OrsquoBrien. It was like a club of which anyone could become a member.Scratch any writer and they will regale you with tales of their favourite bookshops. I have one ndash Main Street Trading in St Boswells ndash a handful of miles from where I live in the Borders.

This featured on full- follow-up, Paranoic Critical, while the live set will also feature excerpts from Valentinorsquos, a collection of musical sense memories named after Campbellrsquos Rational era club and available for one day only on February th.ldquoPort Sulphur is effectively my indulgence, MacIntyre says of what began as a solo project excavating half-formed recordings and reconstructing them using chance elements drawn from Luke Rhinehartrsquos novel, The Dice Man, and Brian Enorsquos oblique strategies. ldquoThe initial idea was to have no collaborators, and taking any notions of authenticity out of the project was really liberating for me.Things changed, however, and MacIntyre started seeking musical responses to what already existed from a pantheon of fellow travellers.ldquoOnce you have Vic Godard or Davy Henderson from the Sexual Objects on a song it becomes amazing, says MacIntyre, ldquoand you let them sculpt those songs the way they would rather than how Irsquod do it. The best example of that was when I gave James Kirk a really electronic track, and it came back sounding like Orange Juice.Sharing joint headline status is Pop Group guitarist Gareth Sager and the new beat combo he styles as The Hungry Ghosts. Sagerrsquos musical eclecticism has seen him move from the incendiary ferocity of The Pop Group, through the free jazz playfulness of Rip, Rig and Panic, the punk-funk of Head and even a Debussy and Satie influenced solo piano record recorded at Abbey Road.The Hungry Ghosts, however, strip things down to what Sager styles as ldquostomp-glam-funk. Irsquove made about  albums, and Irsquove never put any limits on what I do, but it felt like the right time to do something just with guitar, bass and drums and nothing . Irsquove never written in a purely rock and roll context before, and I wanted to seethe songs would stand up without me being tempted to put strings or a Hammond organ on them.The results of this back to basics approach can be heard on Juicy Rivers, which forms the third part of Sagerrsquos Creeping Bent triptych begun with The Last Second of Normal Time, first released in , with the second part, rsquos Slack Slack Music, just released in a new CD edition.Sager also appears on Paranoic Critical, providing loops and fuzz clarinet on constructions based around the vocals of poet and sometime collaborator, the late Jock Scot on one track, and the also departed Suicide vocalist Alan Vega on the other.ldquoItrsquos not everyone whorsquod phone me up and ask to put music to this recording by Alan Vega, says Sager, ldquobut Douglas is a maverick, and I think itrsquos important as we become an older generation not to just curl up in front of the TV, but to get out there and do what you want to do whatever age you are.Friday nightrsquos extravaganza will be presented under the guise of Everything Flows, a happening new lsquocultural events organisationrsquo which has already hosted German record label Marinarsquos similarly styled quarter-century shindig. This weekendrsquos event, which also features support from nouveau indie janglers The Plastic Youth, looks set to be even more conceptual. Itrsquos attitude dates back to A Leap into the Void, the Yves Klein referencing multi-media extravaganza that launched Creeping Bent at Tramway in Glasgow back in .ldquoTo me, Creeping Bent isnrsquot a record label, says MacIntyre. ldquoItrsquos an art project. We believe in having total control over the means of production.This is something picked up from Bob Last and Hilary Morrisonrsquos Edinburgh sired Fast Product imprint, which understood the value of packaging, both in terms of visual identity and putting on events rather than plain old gigs. Itrsquos also about working with artists over a long period of time.ldquoA core part of Creeping Bent has been working with Gareth and with Davy Henderson, says MacIntyre. ldquoWhat theyrsquore doing is really valuable, and itrsquos not a nostalgia trip. The work theyrsquore producing today matters as much as anything theyrsquove done at any time in their careers. Theyrsquore great artists, and itrsquos important to get their work out there.Key to Creeping Bentrsquos cross-generational continuum is Green Door, the Glasgow-based studio credited on Paranoic Critical which has become a musical think-tank for some of the most interesting younger musical auteurs in town. This includes Sam Joseph Smith, who will play as part of Port Sulphur on Friday.ldquoItrsquos great being around the place, says MacIntyre. ldquoIt feels like anything interesting coming out of Glasgow just now is coming out of Green Door. For us, working in that environment and seeing whatrsquos going on is really exciting. Itrsquos all about keeping your antennae up on whatrsquos happening, he says, ldquoand then stealing it.Things Are Tough, We Can Still Picnic,  Years of the Creeping Bent Organisation, featuring Gareth Sager and The Hungry Ghosts, Port Sulphur and The Plastic Youth, CCA, Glasgow as part of Celtic Connections, February .

A statement is expected this morning.The second demand is for a longer-term commitment to overhaul local taxation.The Greens want to replace council tax with a % annual property levy, and for councils to have far greater powers to raise their own taxes and set business rates.It is understood the government has agreed to discuss council tax reform, possibly through a cross-party forum, with a view to legislation by the end of this parliament.However it would probably for the next parliament to decide whether to pass any new law.In the short term, the government will also consider new local taxes such as a tourist tax.The financial and political demands come as a package - unless the Greens agree to the revised council funding, they will not get the tax reforms they have long campaigned for.Opposition parties said the Greens had always been likely to agree because of how it would look for Holyroodrsquos only pro-independence parties to fall out.Mr Mackay has also been under pressure to find a deal because the SNP has contrasted Holyrood stability with Brexit chaos at Westminster.A budget failure would also have undermined that message, as well as putting a dent in Mr Mackayrsquos leadership ambitions.Mr Harvie told the Herald: ldquoThe government has moved more than I thought they would this time last week. We are continuing to work hard in the final stages to reach an agreement that will protect local services.ldquoThe government know what they need to do.

I urge all MSPs to unite behind the   Scottish Budget - that is what people theand breadth of Scotland expect.ldquoWe are open to compromise in order to ensure we deliver the Budget that the country expects, and I am confident others will approach things in the same spirit.Tory MSP Dean Lockhart said: ldquoRight across Scotland businesses are struggling to cope under an anti-business SNP government.ldquoDerek Mackay needs to stop the tax rises on people and firms, and set out pro-business plans to generate wealth, encourage investment and reward hard work.Labour urged all opposition parties to vote down the budget.If the Budget Bill is defeated today, the government would be able to table it again, with or without revisions, for another vote almost immediately.If there was a tie, the Presiding Officer would use his casting vote to continue the Bill.Final budget and income tax votes are due in mid-February."},{"url":null,"title":"rock-meets-gaelic-tradition-and-xbox-fantasy-in-celtic-connections-concert","story":"Yet on Thursday night, theyrsquoll take concert-goers into a world of fantasy, traditional music and live-action combat in a unique cross-over performance fusing traditional Scots music and Gaelic singing with interactive gaming.Simple Minds bass player Ged Grimes will lead a team of musicians and singers, including Deacon Blue guitarist Gregor Philp, in a one-off performance of the soundtrack from an American-made computer game set in th century Scotland.Players fight an evil force which has lain in wait for hundreds of years following mysterious events at Skara Brae, Orkneyrsquos famous neolithic settlement.The adventure is set against hours of Celtic music, scored exclusively for the game by Mr Grimes, working with a number of prominent musicians from Scotlandrsquos traditional scene.Mr Grimes, from Dundee, was approached by New Orleans-based game developers inXile Entertainment, having worked on soundtracks for games such as Earthworm Jim, Enter the Matrix and the Bourne Supremacy since the late s.Collaborating with musicians and singers from the Scots and Gaelic musical backgrounds, including -year old Peigi Barker, the voice of Young Merida in Disney film Brave, as well as -year-old Gaelic singer Rona Lightfoot, Mr Grimes was inspired by a visit to Japan to stage a live version of the music from the game featuring a full band and footage from the game.Tonight, his vision will be realised at Glasgowrsquos Royal Concert Hall as part of Celtic Connections.Mr Grimes said: ldquoYears ago I met Nobuo Uimatsu in Japan.

One thing Simple Minds have done, which I have total respect for, is that theyrsquove never rested on their laurels.ldquoWe did an acoustic tour a few years ago which tied in well with what I did on the games.ldquoBut this has opened up a world of incredible young Gaelic singers and musicians who are confident, multi-talented iniduals with a real pride in their culture and they want their culture and their language to be relevant and used.ldquoThe idea of that community being represented in an Xbox game is great.

Or maybe it just does not seem fair to have a fight in which thousands, including a Cabinet Minister , line up against one -year-old.Mr Greerrsquos  minutes began last week after the Conservative Party sent a tweet to mark the anniversary of the death of Sir Winston Churchill, who died in  at the age of .ldquoFor many, the party noted, ldquothe greatest Briton to have ever lived. Mr Greer reckoned this deserved a response, as stated previously, and lo there poured forth upon his head much outrage, the stickiest of it coming from Mr Morgan, the host of ITVrsquos Good Morning Britain.The Scottish Parliamentrsquos youngest MSP went on GMB to defend his view. Rather brave of him, I thought. No sign of the Scottish cringe in this one. He acquitted himself well enough, with an answer for every point put to him.As Piers went into full Tasmanian Devil mode, Mr Greer, getting his retaliation in first, accused him of being a snowflake. Cheeky. When the MSP called a comment Mr Morgan made ldquowildly ahistorical, the host clearly did not know what the word meant.It was such a drubbing for Piers that his co-host Susanna Reid had to step in and save the interview, telling the MSP: ldquoNo one is denying that every historical hero should be scrutinised, but the use of the language is so offensive.Cometh the woman, cometh the point. While it is reasonable to appeal for some perspective on Churchillrsquos career, Mr Greer could have chosen his words, and his medium, more carefully.Just as children are told that there are outdoor voices and indoor ones, so there is language you might use in, say, a student union bar, or among friends. His Twitter summary was brutal, over the top, and yes, designed to provoke a response.Such is the way points are made on social media. Twitter is no place for reasoned debate. Twitter is where nuance goes to die. The fact that so many politicians, from Mr Greer to the US President, see it as a primary vehicle for communication with the public, is deeply worrying, and indicative of these populist times.So much for what he said. What should not be in doubt is his right to say it. Nothing he tweeted was against the law. As for Piers Morgan telling Mr Greer thatldquoit wasnrsquot for Winston Churchill you would be speaking German and goose-stepping your way to Holyrood, it is a rum do to praise Churchillrsquos part in the fight for freedom at the same time as condemning someone for exercising their right to free speech.Even the most cursory look at Churchillrsquos history, pre-Second World War in particular, would find him a knotty, dficult character with a long, sometimes chequered career. He was a product of his era, his class, his prejudices. This was well known to people at the time.By the s Churchill was considered a busted flush. Then along came another world war. People could appreciate his blood, toil, tears and sweat because they had provided no little measure of these things themselves.While they valued the role Churchill had played, perhaps even thought him a military genius, they were not above seeing him in the round. By wars end they did not regard him as the man to lead them into the future. Hence Labourrsquos landslide victory at the polls in . That voters re-elected him in  is simply proof that times change and opinions with them.The further away we have come from the Second World War the more perspective on Churchill has been lost. There has grown up an almost infantile desire to portray him as a saintly figure who should never be criticised. No serious historian has taken such a tack, but others have. Take the  film, Darkest Hour. Won two Oscars Gary Oldman, brilliant. Fine movie, right up to the scene where Churchill takes a ride on the Tube and is urged by men and women of all classes and colours to stand up to Hitler, to fight, fight, fight and never surrender.From there, the audience is led to believe it was a straight journey to Churchillrsquos ldquofight them on the beaches speech. What a great story. Except it never happened. The filmrsquos director, Joe Wright, said the scenes were ldquoa fictionalisation of an emotional truth, a way to show that Churchill could read the mood of the British people better than his peers.The trouble with history is not, as one character said in Alan Bennettrsquos The History Boys, that it is ldquoone ******* thing after another. That is a statement of fact. The problem with history comes when we accept only one version of an event or person, usually from the victors side, as the truth and nothing but the truth.History is a deeply political, and politicised, pursuit. How it is told,it is even told in the first place, says much about the times and where power lies.How is it the case, for example, that I spent all my school years in Scotland yet was never taught a thing about my own countryrsquos history The American Civil War. The Peterloo Massacre. The Russian Revolution. All of this, but not a word about the Clearances, the Act of Union, anything to do with Scottish history. Anyone would think there was a conspiracy at work.

Major change is needed and for me that means a sht to pure electric driving. Public promotional campaigns, grants towards vehicles and public charging infrastructure development are just some of the initiatives that both the government and local councils have been implementing since the early s to help to create an environment for electric cars to thrive.Dr Colin Herron CBE,Managing Director of Zero Carbon Futures.Despite all of this, encouraging consumers to adopt electric vehicles is the most challenging of tasks. By the end of October , there had been a total of , plug-in vehicles registered in Scotland accounting for only .% ofthe overall total vehicle ownership.Although EV registrations have increased signicantly in the last year, this is still a market in its infancy.So why is this  There are many reasons why people have not yet embraced electric driving.The most cited one we hear is still ldquoThey donrsquot go far enough.With more than % of journeys made under  miles and most electric cars being able to cover at least  miles on one chargethis is definitely a matter of perception over reality.ldquoTherersquos nowhere to charge is another objection. Again, this is also not the case in Scotland. Thanks to the work of Transport for Scotland and the Charge- Place Scotland programme, the national network of charge points has grown to around  chargers.And as an added bonus, theyrsquore all free to use. It is fair to say that the cost of purchase is still also a barrier. The second hand market is still very limited so those looking to switch to electric are for the most part buying or leasing from new.The marketplace desperately needs to increase, so that we have more options for buyers of all price brackets. And to me, this is the key challenge. Itrsquos not about consumer acceptance at all but rather the supply available.Governments all over the world are setting ambitious targets for electric car ownership however,the reality is that there are waiting lists for these vehicles.To get the market moving and to get us all replacing our vehicles with an electric version, the car industry needs to ramp up battery production and do it fast. Only time will tellthey can do it fast enough to help stop this ticking time bomb.The Heraldrsquos Climate for Change initiative supports efforts being made by the ScottishGovernmentwith key organisations and campaign partners.

A shortage, and in some cases an excess of minerals can have a negative effect on production. Supply from pasture can also y through the season, as can livestock requirements.She added: “Fiona and Peter are both enthusiastic and engaging presenters with a great reputation of being able to communicate complex issues in an easily understandable way.

He worked ‘On the Beat’ for a few years and was then asked to set up the first dog unit in the area. He and Rennie were the sole members of the unit to start with but Sandy gradually built up a team of handlers and dogs.After setting up the dog unit Sandy went on to set up the Underwater Diving Unit for the Force and also the Specialist Policing Unit based at Aberdeen Airport. Sandy retired as a Sergeant in Bucksburn in .Speaking about the celebration Instructor PC Steve Warden said: “We are delighted to have Sandy back in the unit today to help us celebrate  years of the North East Dog Unit. Since founding the unit, there have been hundreds of dogs and handlers who have all worked hard to help keep people safe here in the North East. We are a very special unit and we assist operational colleagues on all manner of calls from locating missing people, searching for items such as weapons, evidence and drugs and helping control volatile or aggressive situations. “Despite the many changes in policing in the North East over the last  years, it is great that the dog unit has remained and developed. We have a very strong team with a mix of experience but with the same dedication to the unit and the job. We hope that the North East Dog Unit enjoys many more decades of work.” As part of the celebration, Mr Reid has donated Rennie’s original collar and dog tag which is engraved stating that Rennie was owned by the Chief Constable of Aberdeen City Police and has been framed as a lasting memento.Retired officer, Sandy Reid added: “I have kept in touch with the Unit since I retired more than  years ago and it was great to celebrate this milestone with them today. The current dog handlers face much of the same challenges I did. It is a ied and exciting job to have but the most special element is the unique bond which develops from working and training with your dog.”PC Laura Fairbairn has been a police officer for  years and recently completed her dog handler training at the Scottish Police Dog Training Centre. PD Ava is a two year old German Shepherd who was bred in the Czech Republic and sourced by the national dog unit last summer. Ava and Laura were paired up during Laura’s initial training and have been putting into practice what they have learned during their training.Speaking about her new role PC Fairbairn said: “I’m really pleased and excited to be part of the dog unit. It’s a unique team and very dferent to the roles I’ve held within the police so far. Ava and I are getting on great. She’s a really good dog and we’ve bonded really well. She’s a general purpose dog so we get called to tracking and tracing calls at the moment.\"Once we’ve developed our experience and expertise I’ll take on a second specialist dog such as a drugs or explosives dog.

Help, I feel like a pair of curtains! – Pull yourself together then!” also featuring in the top ten.Meanwhile, the poll by Dundee-based magazine The Beano found that whilst fathers are notorious for their cringeworthy “dad jokes”, almost half of British children chose their dad as the funniest person in their family, while it was claimed that mums are generally found to tell the worst jokes.Two-thirds of kids polled said they usually hear the best jokes in the classroom and playground, while nine in ten British children insist that kids are far funnier than adults.Stand-up comedian Jay Lafferty, who organises the Comedy Kids events with the Edinburgh Youth Theatre at Edinburgh’s The Stand comedy venue, said: “Kids absolutely love word play and also anything to do with toilets or bottoms – they think it’s hilarious. “The joke that has come top here combines those two things – the pun on the ‘sea weed’ and also the toilet humour.

Publicly, the government has stated that it is focused on getting its spending plans passed and is confident of reaching a compromise.In , when an SNP minority government had its budget defeated by the Scottish Parliament, then-First Minister Alex Salmond threatened a snap election before the deadlock was broken.The current SNP minority has struck a more conciliatory tone and sought to calm speculation about an election, with Finance Secretary Derek Mackay last night appealing for MSPs to “act responsibly”.Last ditch talks are set to continue today in the final hours before a vote, with the Green Party holding out for concessions on local government spending and council tax reform.Mr Mackay must secure the support of the six Green MSPs to pass his budget, with all other opposition parties committed to voting against it.Green Party co-convener Patrick Harvie has dismissed suggestions his party could bring down the government by rejecting the SNP’s budget as a “myth”.But senior Nationalist figures were openly speculating about the possibility of an election earlier in the week, with SNP committee convener Gillian Martin warning Green MSP Andy Wightman on social media that voting down the budget could force an election and put a second Scottish independence referendum at risk.“You’ve seen the way the other parties coalesce against us to try and bring down the government,” Ms Martin posted on Twitter. “Since  everything for them is about defeating the pro-Indy Parliament.”She added: “We are at risk of an election that might see pro Indy parties lose seats and put us in a weaker position.”Polls show the SNP remains in the lead in Scottish Parliament voting intention, but that the nationalists have lost ground compared with their performance in the  Holyrood election where they narrowly lost their majority.Scottish Conservative shadow finance secretary Murdo Fraser claimed uncertainty around the budget showed the SNP were “unfit” for government.“The SNP has neglected the day job so badly that it’s now struggling to get the single-biggest responsibility taken care of. Nicola Sturgeon is so resigned to the weakness of her own administration, she’s been forced to rally the troops for another election.“Hers would be the first government in the history of the Scottish Parliament to call an election because it couldn’t pass a budget.“That would be a shameful legacy, and shows just how unfit the Nationalists are for government of any kind.”Scottish Liberal Democrat campaign chair Alex Cole-Hamilton MSP said: “We’ve made clear to the SNP that we want a budget that focuses on education, mental health and local government funding.“If their inability to get a budget through necessitates a new Scottish Parliament election then I have every hope that people in Scotland will want to use that to eject the Nationalists.”A Labour spokesman said “no credible anti-austerity party would propose” the draft budget put forward by the SNP.With no deal last night, Mr Mackay said: “Our spending plans for the coming year contain additional money for schools and hospitals, protecting vital public services and investing in our economy, while also providing stability amid the ongoing uncertainty caused by Brexit. “With that backdrop in mind, there has never been more need for MSPs, of all parties, to act responsibly and not add to that uncertainty.”Mr Mackay added: “We are open to compromise in order to ensure we deliver the Budget that the country expects.” ©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4862285.1548404780!/image/image.jpg","title":"alex salmond unique case is not unprecedented says advocate","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...Many people are asking whether Alex Salmond, with his major public profile, could possibly get a fair trial in Scotlandany charges proceed.Many people are asking whether Alex Salmond, with his major public profile, could possibly get a fair trial in Scotlandany charges proceed.If challenged, the court’s answer will be considered in the context of the publicity around the allegations. To date no case in Scotland has been stopped because of prejudicial publicity and that’s despite there having been some high-profile cases that attracted considerable, sometimes extremely prejudicial, media attention.These cases were dferent in that the accused were not well-known public figures, but it was argued that publicity about the allegations could prejudice any trial.I wouldn’t call this case unprecedented, but it has its own unique aspects. However, the challenges for the court have been considered before. Two examples are the trial of William Beggs for what became known as the “Limbs in the Loch” murder, and that of Nat Fraser, who was accused of killing his we, Arlene. There had been a great deal of reporting about the cases and the courts had to decide whether fair trials could be achieved. In both situations, the courts decided the cases could proceed fairly, referring to the safeguards of the passage of time between any publicity and a trial the focusing effect for a jury of listening to the evidence and the strong directions given to a jury in such cases to decide only based on evidence they hear in court.Those representing Salmond may argue that he is uniquely well-known and that some allegations against him have, to an extent, been canvassed in the media. They may say that it will be almost impossible to find jurors who have never heard of him. But that doesn’t matter – more to the point is whether it will be possible to find jurors that are untainted by prejudicial knowledge about the allegations.The Crown will say Contempt of Court rules apply and no-one can now publish anything that might prejudice the trial. There is now signicant protection in place and the media can only really report on procedural aspects such as the fact he has been charged.Very senior people at the Crown Office will be involved in decisions about possible proceedings once they have seen all statements and reports.

The Edinburgh and Lothians Viral Intervention Studyfor short, has discovered that nose drops and gargling with salt water can shorten the averageof a cold virus by almost two days. The research project run by the University of Edinburgh initially showed last September that NaCLinhibited all types of viruses. The prevention of viruses is caused by the chloride component of salt, not the sodium. Now the latest findings show that nasal irrigation and gargling with salt water will also help relieve the misery of the common cold. Patients were asked to keep track of symptoms by collecting a nose swab on five consecutive days, and to treat the illness by snfing hypertonic saline nasal irrigation drops that has a higher concentration of salt and gargling. The participants in the study displayed a reduction in the overallof the illness of . days, as well as a  per cent drop in over-the-counter medicine use and a  per cent reduction in infection of others in the household. Dr Sandeep Ramalingam, consult­ant virologist at the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh, who led the study, said cells use chloride ions to produce hypochlorous acidwhich is the active ingredient that is found in bleach.In effect, cells use the chloride ion to produce bleach to get rid of viral infections – since bleach kills all viruses Dr Ramalingam believes that this will work across the board.He added: “Jala Netihas been recorded in ancient texts that are thousands of years old. “I understand that gargling with salt water was commonly recommended by GPs in the UK, up until the First World War.“It probably became an “old wives tale” after antibiotics were invented.“With ELVIS, we are in a way re-inventing the wheel by proving that salt water helps reduce the duration of the cold. “However, we have also done laboratory-based research where we have proved that our cells need the chloride ion from salt to stop viruses from multiplying. “Since this mechanism works against all types of viruses, it is an effective remedy for the common cold.”Based on the success of this study, its authors are launching another to focus on children. ELVIS Kids, hopes to recruit  children to take part.Scientists based at Edinburgh Children’s Hospital will teach parents how to make salt water and apply nose drops for their children at home. Parents will need to meet a trial nurse only once to take part in the study, and their child does not need to attend the meeting.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"kalfordhame sandness shetland","story":"Offers over £,- bed bungalow for sale in Sandness.

If anything, it should be amplied.It turned into a trilogy. There was a Great Book of Skye Two in , and now we have the #Great Book of Skye Three#.That was perhaps predictable. In the first volume, Cailean Maclean commented that he had two problems in persuading Norman Macdonald to prepare the book. The first problem was to get him to start the second was to get him to stop.Three books and , pages later, the prof has stopped — or so he says.The three volumes comprise a Dictionary of Skye Biography. The lives of almost , people are profiled and illustrated inside their pages. They have all #been Skye born or bred or are people who have had an intimate connection with the island. They have all been noteworthy in one way or another… #There has never been more than , people living in Skye at any one time, and for much of history — particularly recent, recorded history — its population has been much smaller than that.Nobody, however, will be too surprised that Norman and Cailean uncovered and portrayed over a thousand eminent Sgiathanaich. Without wishing to kickstart Norman once again, the miracle is that they enumerated so few. The island, like almost all Hebridean islands, has been a breeding ground of talent and character.The only other qualication for entry in the Great Books of Skye is that you must be dead. You, dear reader, however, accomplished you might be, will not be able to read your entry unless metaphysics permits you access from your celestial cloud. These are obituaries, not panegyrics.That lends a sombre tone to certain pages of the Great Book of Skye Three. There are people featured here who, we are sharply reminded, were alive when volume one was in preparation.Here, for instance, is the smiling face of Dr Vicky Ann Galbraith, who was born in Portree in  and who died at home in Aird Bernisdale of brain cancer in .Vicky Ann was achievement personied. A leading scientist for Roche Pharmaceuticals, she also played for Scotland#s national women#s rugby union team on  occasions. Following her fatal diagnosis, she raised thousands of pounds for cancer research by leading sponsored walks from Portree to Glasgow, up the West Highland Way and where.Here is Thomas William Mackenzie. You may have known him as Tommy. He was born in  and he died last March. He was, in the GBS abbreviated subheading, a #printmaker, etcher and gallery owner, Chieftain of Skye Highland Games, boat race devotee, tug-of-war revivalist, shinty enthusiast, and half-marathon runner.#That just about covers it, as a dictionary of biography is forbidden to indulge itself and cannot add that for very many people, Tommy Mackenzie was the face and personality of modern Portree.These volumes, these hefty Great Books of Skye, are a leisurely parade along Wentworth Street and then out to the peninsulas, pausing to wave at or pass the time of day with Victorian land reformers, clan chiefs, bards, teachers, surgeons, fishermen, and climbers. It#s a verbal Skye equivalent of the cover of #Sergeant Pepper#s Lonely Hearts Club Band#.Sir Harold Boulton was not a Sgiathanach. He came from Hertfordshire and was educated at Harrow and Oxford.In  he married into the Highland quality via a Dingwall military family. Boulton already had an interest in Gaelic song and music.He enters the Great Book of Skye because, in the late th century, Boulton seems to have heard a Gaelic rowing song and put his own, English, words to the tune.Those lyrics and that tune have become internationally known as #The Skye Boat Song#. Norman Macdonald digresses wonderfully on Boulton#s creation of a supposed Jacobite anthem.We are still left with the dilemma of the bonnie boat#s journey. The original Gaelic version may have celebrated a voyage from Torrin to Loch Coruisk. For most of the th century, it was assumed to refer to Charles Edward Stuart#s post-Culloden flight by sea from the mainland to Skye.As Charles never made such a journey directly by sea, pedants have more recently suggested that Boulton must have been referring to the Pretender#s actual sea voyage It really, really, does not matter. We are in the realms of mythology. Charles may as well have been sailing from Papua New Guinea. Harold Boulton invented the whole damn thing — the misty isle#s most famous song is a Victorian concoction — and in recognition of that, he deserves his entry in the Great Book of Skye Three.And finally, here we are back in Portree. William Cowie was born in Kiltarlity in  and became an agricultural advisor in Skye in the s. The brother of a professional footballer, Cowie devoted himself to shinty and became one of the greatest players of his era.Fittingly, he married in  a grand-daughter of the captain of the Skye shinty team which had won the inaugural MacTavish Cup in .William and Margaret Cowie had two sons, Ross and William. He died too young, at the age of  years, while playing badminton in Portree Drill Hall.William Cowie would, therefore, have been shy of his th birthday had he led his natural course to June  and a day in Fort William which would have caused him, more even than the rest of Skye, unimaginable pride.It is tempting to say of all three Great Books of Skye that they are for dipping in and out rather than reading as a single narrative. The trouble with that suggestion is that once you#ve dipped in, it is very hard to dip out again.As a trilogy, they are a phenomenal publishing achievement. They should take their place, alongside the inevitable Tommy Mackenzie print, in every home in Skye."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/INDOOR-SHINTY-19-P4-7-FINAL-2.jpg","title":"skye schools indoor shinty competition all the action in","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineYoung shinty players fromthroughout Skye gathered to take part in two indoor tournaments for primary school teams last weekend.Portree High’s Fingal Centre hosted competitions for P-P and for P-and-under teams.On a fast and furious day of excellent shinty action teams fromBun-sgoil Ghàidhlig Phort Rìgh won both competitions.Broadford were runners up in the P- competition, with North West taking second spot in the P-under tournament following an epic final."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/homeinthehighlands17-2-360x100.jpg","title":"skye charities work to be showcased at skeabost","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineA multi-charity event will be held in Skeabost on Saturdayto highlight the work of several good causes across Skye.The event will be held at Skeabost Memorial Hall from  am until  pm and will provide information on the work carried out by a iety of charities in the area, as well as insight into the costs and challenges they face.to raise awareness of the event, which will support Skye and Lochalsh Young Carers the Skye and Lochalsh Foodbank Crossroads Care # Skye and Lochalsh Macmillan Cancer Support Skye Dance Bloodwise, and Rotjanas Hands, which Mr Williams set up with his we nearly  years ago.He said: “I have been an independent fundraiser for many years – I am a trustee of Rotjanas Hands – formally known as Hands Across the Water – which I set up alongside my we following the Indonesian Tsunami .”He added: “For me, it has always been important to share particularly when we are so fortunate and others not so.

An entrepreneur and pioneer in his field, Sir William, despite his worldwide success, has never forgotten his strong ties to Ballymena.“His vision and dedication has put our borough firmly on the map as an area of manufacturing excellence and innovation.”Mid and East Antrim Borough Council agreed to bestow the Honorary Freedom of the Borough of Mid and East Antrim on the Wrightbus founder in February . It followed a motion proposed by the previous Mayor, Councillor Paul Reid, and seconded by Councillor Audrey Wales MBE.Among those who paid special tributes to Sir William was former Mayor of Ballymena, P.J. McAvoy, who, as a long standing SDLP representative was poles apart on constitutional issues from the ardent unionist. On Friday, however, he told the audience of the personal bond that had grown between the pair during their service on Council.“I well remember Sir William giving me a lt in that great big car of his many times when going or coming from council meetings! “I’m happy to be here today to pay tribute to the man I call my friend,” he said. Further tributes came from North Antrim MP, Ian Paisley who remarked on Sir William’s political activism at a time when many in the business community ‘kept their heads below the parapet’. And he recalled nights in the harsh days of the troubles when his late father would receive ‘phone calls from the man he codenamed ‘Ahoghill’. Mr. Paisley said Sir William was a rare breed in today’s society: “He is a character. If anyone wants to see what makes a real Ballymena man they need only look at Sir William Wright.” Lauren Christie, speaking on behalf of the extended Wright family, thanked all who attended for the honour conferred on her grandfather and paid special tribute to Mrs. Ruby Wright, who, she described as ‘the great woman behind the great man’.

The  album release ‘Up Among The Heather, The Scottish Album’, reflects the Scots influence on their Northern Irish roots - the album will be released on tour. Last year, their previous album ‘The Unicorn, the Continuing Story’ gave the long-awaited sequel to their famed Unicorn song.BRAID DATEBand leader, George Millar says: “In some ways it seems like yesterday, in other ways it seems a million years ago when I first met and played with Jimmy . “Neither of us had any idea what could possibly be ahead of us. Tohome and play after all these years, will be a highlight of our career and one we’re looking forward to immensely. Like the famous Bushmills Irish Whiskey, The Irish Rovers continue to improve with age and The Braid Arts Centre and Mid  East Antrim Borough Council are delighted that the boys are making a visit home to be applauded for all they have done over the years for the music industry, and for promoting this part of the world across North America and beyond. Thursday March  will see the Rovers will be performing at The Braid and they will be guests of honour at a reception where the Mid  East Antrim will welcome them home.AIR AMBULANCEAll proceeds from tickets will be donated by The Irish Rovers to the Mayors Charity Northern Ireland Air Ambulance.Another great honour for the band this year was being recognized as one of these islands greatest eacutemigreacutes by Ireland’s newest and most state of the art museum in Dublin, EPIC Ireland. Museum Director Mervyn Greene says: “The Irish Rovers are iconic, world class and with very a long career. “That’s important to us in Ireland. “They’ve truly taken Ireland with them and shown the world.As it happens, The Unicorn album is part of EPIC’s Irish Rovers installation. As young immigrants, the Rovers emigrated to Canada and became so much a part of the Canadian culture that Canada’s Prime Minister Trudeau personally asked them to become full citizens so they could officially represent Canada around the world.In , The Irish Rovers had a breakout hit with their second album, The Unicorn.That album and the ‘lucky little ditty’ of a title track written by Shel Silverstein, took them from folk clubs of America to concert halls and television sets worldwide.LAST MINUTE“The Unicorn, which was in fact a last minute add to the original album, left us all with a tear or two, plus the unanswered question, ‘Whatever happened to the Unicorns when the ark left them stranded on the shore ” says George. Since that first big hit, the band ed to the charts  more times with other songs, nevertheless, the magic of ‘The Unicorn’ remains.To pay appropriate tribute on its Gold Anniversary, the Rovers are releasing ‘The Unicorn, The Continuing Story’.It includes all new recordings, plus the sequel to the original song, which answers the question of the last fty years.A new music video also tells the story.The World Wildle Fund, and wildle cinematographer Adam Ravetch assisted in the production. Since the s, the Celtic super-group have travelled the world as musical ambassadors - with performances from as far apart as the Arctic Circle, Japan, and Germany, with regular tours to Australia, New Zealand, and the US.The Rovers first became known in the US in the s on shows like The Tonight Show, The Smothers Brothers, Mike Douglas Show, The Dating Game , and even starring in The Virginian.In the s they hosted their first of three international television series, ‘The Irish Rovers Show’ and throughout the next  years their weekly television shows brought Ireland into living rooms of America and the rest of the world.More recently, their  Drunken Sailor album went viral on YouTube, made news headlines back home in Belfast and put them back on radio across North America with a new younger generation audience.A Canadian CBC producer saw the Belfast news articles about the Rovers new song and video and asked George Millar to sing his new song ‘The Titanic’ to help their telling of the th Anniversary of Titanic. The   Years triple CD broke tour sales records, while the lads ed to the small screen with three North American television specials, ‘The Irish Rovers Home In Ireland’, ‘The Irish Rovers Christmas’, ‘The Irish Rovers LIVE on St. Patrick’s Day  th Anniversary Special’, all produced in the last few years.The days of the long tours are finally coming to an end for these Irish lads as they are now completing one last world tour.

Squinter’s been running his eye over the top-performing personalities as we hurtle towards the ration book, conscription, petrol riots and raffling oranges. Jacob Rees Mogg’s rocky road to DublinArch remainer Lord Snooty has made a fortune from providing financial services through his company, Somerset Capital Management . Thoughhe will be luxuriously insulated from the worst effects of a no-deal Brexit evenhe never worked another day in his le, he is a leading light in the fanatically anti-EU European Research Group , which makes UKIP look like the Alliance Party and which sees a Brexit crash-out as pretty much an ideal scenario. But as the Brexit negotiations descended into chaos and then high comedy, SMG decided that it was time to open two new funds in, ah, Ireland. Although Jacob is a co-founder of the company and is paid £, a month for doing eight hours work a week for the company , he said the decision to set up business in Irelandwas nothing to do with him. Asthat’s not bad enough, the company’s prospectus for the coming financial identies among the key ‘risks’ facing the business in the coming financial year is ‘Brexit’. Simply spfing, old bean.Boris and his zig-zag BrexitBack in  when Boris Johnson was still considering what outcome in the Brexit referendum would be best for him – sorry, for the country – his close pal Sir Nicholas Soamestweeted this: “Whatever my great friend Boris decides to do I know that he is NOT an outer.” But regardless of where his heart and or his head is, Boris is certainly shoulder-to-shoulder with Jacob in the vanguard of the hard Brexit storm troops. ’Twas not always thus, truth to tell. Pre-referendum Boris famously came out for Brexit in his Dailycolumn. But what people didn’t know until some time later was that Boris had written two columns that week for the : one pro-Brexit and one pro-Remain. In the pro-Remain column, which was never published in the paper, he wrote: “Shut your eyes. Hold your breath. Think of Britain. Think of the rest of the EU. Think of the future. Think of the desire of your children and your grandchildren to live and work in other European countries to sell things there, to make friends and perhaps to find partners there.” Cue soaring violins. Boris’s most recent comment on the single market was that it is “useless” In  he said in Paris: “Personally, I would like to stay in the single market. We need to stay in the council of ministers of the internal market. In my view, the British have done good things for Europe.” Google Boris’s stunned reaction when the referendum vote was announced and then remember what Nick Soames tweeted.Nigel glad to be rid of the EU Former UKIP leader and Brexit poster boy Nigel Farage has two children by his German we, Kirsten Mehr. He has told journalists that both of them support England at the football, so that’s alright then. Except they both have German passports and so, thrillingly, unlike their English neighbours, will continue to enjoy free movement throughout the EU post-Brexit. And, of course, Nigel will continue to draw his £, per year EU pension – no-one hates the EU that much, not even our Nige. Squinter was particularly moved by Nigel’s claim in the weeks leading up to the referendum that staying in Europe would “spell the end of the steel industry in this country”. But Nige and his UKIP colleagues were in  among a tiny number of MEPs to vote against a move to tighten up rules on the import of cheap non-EU steel. Business, as they say, is business. The Man from the Daily MailFormer Daily Mail editor Paul Dacre was the man responsible for all those headlines that frightened the horses during the referendum campaign and, subsequently, the attacks on Parliament and the judiciary as the political and legal implications were fought out. So he’s the Brexiter’s Brexiter. But it’s estimated that as a landowner Dacre benefited to the tune of around £, a year in EU subsidies. The veteran journalist was on over £m a year towards the end of his time with the Mail, so he’ll not be begging outside the Red Lion in his local villagethe UK leaves the EU. Brexit-voting and Mail-reading Farmer Browns, however, may be left sucking thoughtfully on a wheat stalk as they contemplate their own looming subsidy deficit, which may not be so lightly borne.Bordering on the ridiculousThe DUP’s singular focus as we hurtle towards Brexit D-Day is to block any deal that involves regulatory ergence with the mother ship – in other words: we must be treated exactly the same as Britain by the EU. Whether that’s a gentle wave goodbye with best wishes, or a massive, eye-watering boot in the ging-gangs matters not. We’re all in this together . The DUP’s insistence on alignment with the ‘mainland’ may be extremely touching, but it is an entirely new concept, for this little corner of empire long ago gave up any pretence of a claim to be as British as Finchley. Presumably, the party will continue to lobby for a dferent VAT and Passenger Duty regime post-Brexit, for they were white-hot on those ideas before the EU balloon went up. They’ll continue to block defamation law reform, keeping loyal Ulster as a magnet for libel tourists . Most famously, the DUP remains the bulwark against the equal marriage and abortion rights that are accorded to every other part of these two islands. Luckily, the party stood firm and insisted that Are Wee Country has to have exactly the same RHI regime as across the water, avoiding the possibility of widespread and catastrophically expensive abuse of the boiler scheme*Sub-editors: please check this last line for accuracy. Thanks, SquintPapers, pleaseAndrew Bridgen, Tory MP for West Leicestershireis another European Research Group charmer, without the profile of Jacob Rees Mogg but with the same level of warmth and likeability. Andy’s most notable brush with fame before Brexit thrust him into the public eye alongside Boris and Jacob was his posting of a raunchy video on a WhatsApp group composed of Tory MPs, some of them ministers. Suffice to say that the video included a scantily clad woman, a man and a sports car. A suitably repentant Andy explained to colleagues that it had been a terrible error caused by “fat fingers”. In October past he said in a radio interview that all English people are entitled to an Irish passport, a claim that nearly caused Twitter to explode and was the impetus for more jokes than Ian Paisley’s summer holidays.In response to a question on free movement between Britain and Ireland post-Brexit, Andy said: “As an English person, I do have the right to go over to Ireland and I believe that I can ask for a passport. Can’t I ” No, Andy, mate, you can’t. We’ve enough West Brits on this island, ta very much.Doctor Jekyll and Mr SnideThat Michael Gove’s a reasonable bloke, ain’t he  There he’s been for the past few months, urging cool heads and common sense, quietly and assiduously working to help Prime Minister Theresa may with a withdrawal agreement that’s harder to sell than a Northern Ireland shirt in O’Neills. While those nasty Brexit nutjobs in the ERG snarl and threaten, Michael’s been a model of loyalty and stf upper-lipped British discretion. But wait. Wasn’t it a bloke who looked exactly like him who said during the campaign that Turkey was about to join the EU, opening the gates to allow five million-plus Turks to come cascading into the UK.Yes, indeed: it was Michael Gove who made that claim. He has subsequently admitted that it was baloney and should not have been made. So them Turks stay in the mess they’re in.

An SDLP conference is scheduled to take place on February  in Newry where the party membership is set to vote on the plans.Speaking exclusively to the Andersonstown News. West Belfast Councillor Tim Attwood said he was “not an advocate of the SDLP and Fianna Fáil partnership”. It’s known that South Belfast MLA Claire Hanna is also at odds with the party leadership over its move to link up with Fianna Fáil.“I recognise that the political landscape of this island has been changed utterly given the failure of the DUP and Sinn Féin to bring back the power-sharing Executive, the catastrophic consequences of Brexit and the emerging debate about Irish unity,” said Cllr Attwood.Cllr Attwood continued: “I have the greatest respect for the leadership of the SDLP and recognise that in a post-conflict situation there is a natural and wider debate about political realignment on this island,” he said. “The reality is my politics is steadfastly rooted in the social democratic and labour traditions embodied by the SDLP and parties of the Party of European Socialists.”Mr Attwood, who has served as a West Belfast councillor these past  years, said that over the coming days he would be speaking to his family and SDLP members in his constituency area about the proposal for a new partnership between the SDLP and Fianna Fáil. “I will make a further statement after these discussions,” he added.Meanwhile, SDLP Lagan Valley MLA Pat Catney is supporting the party leadership in entering into a partnership with Fianna Fáil.Mr Catney said: “Northern Ireland is crying out for a response to the fast changing and signicant challenges across these islands as a result of Brexit. “Twenty years after the Good Friday Agreement, people here must be offered something new, credible and forward-looking in its approach.”The Lagan Valley MLA added: “Brexit has shted the political sands dramatically. It poses many challenges that sit outside the boundaries of local devolution. Our politics in the past two years, a politics of ision, of deadlock and of repetition is frighteningly at odds with the vast challenges that now face us. Old solutions to new challenges can no longer cut it.“It has always been the SDLP’s vision to unite our people. To seek an Ireland, befitting of the st century, where opportunity and prosperity are more than slogans on a placard but a way of le whether you are Catholic, Protestant or Dissenter. That will never change.“I am all too aware of the uneasiness some of my unionist neighbours may feel about this new partnership. Neighbours who have put their trust in me in countless elections. But let me be crystal clear a new Ireland, one without the full inclusivity of unionism is not one I want to be part of let alone build. You are part of the fabric of this island, woven into history every bit as much as any nationalist and you are a critical part of its future.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"its good to talk media take note","story":"“You are trying to achieve Irish Unity by stealth.” The woman spoke accusingly.I was sitting in Dublin. In the Irish Department of Foreign Affairs’ building. It was a meeting to discuss women, peace and security. It was like being thrust back into the early s when words like Irish unity were considered “succour to terrorism”. In some ways I felt a little sorry for this  counties-born woman. She clearly had been influenced by the Section  RTÉ psyche and hasn’t kept up since the Good Friday Agreement. But maybe that’s patronising. Maybe she feels sorry for me.The accusation was made as I and my colleague explained how Irish citizens, particularly women, are having their rights denied to them in the north east of our country, and how under the terms of citizenship and responsibility in the Good Friday Agreement the Irish government need to step up and ensure they defend those citizens’ rights and not hide. The woman, who lives near the north-south border, is challenged by challenging self-imposed borders. It set the tone for the week.On Saturday, Queen’s University human rights Professor Colin Harvey, a very quietly spoken, humble inidual, took to the stage in the Waterfront at the first-of-its-kind nationalist conference. I was lucky enough to introduce him and take a seat next to him. The stage was shaking as he forcefully and loudly proclaimed: “We will not be seeking permission from anyone to talk about the unity of our country” “we apologise to no-one for being here today and having the conversation about the rights of Irish citizens.”Yep, it was that kind of week. The content of the Beyond Brexit conference, despite its wealth, was almost lost as the issue became about whether Irish citizens have the legitimate right to talk to each other about Irish unity or Brexit or both. Some unionists and media outlets felt that they should have a veto on how Irish nationalists will frame their own conversations. The manufactured ‘controversy’ was a modern-day version of those old laws which forbade Catholics congregating in numbers of more than five for fear they might engage in sedition. Indeed, the post-conference coverage has continued to focus on nationalists daring to hold such a professional well-attended conference as a spectacle, rather than these citizens raising issues that need to be engaged with.And of course, Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil have played the game too by telling us when it is appropriate to talk about a border poll. Their words would have far more meaningthey were calling on working groups in the Oireachtas to draw up policies and plans that might form part of a conversation on unity – like they did in addressing the referendum on the th Amendment, when they were actually trying to address violations of human rights and not just assuage them. Their tones of moderation feed the narrative that us northern nationalists are just too hot-headed or maybe even dangerous when we push at constitutional obligations. That feeds the concept of us being a people apart and tells us something about their complicity in the problem.I was reminded of the words of Parnell, written on his statue in Dublin:“No man has the right to say to his country, ‘Thus far shalt thou go and no further.’” "},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37768497.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/POLITICS791.jpg","title":"blockchain technology could be the solution for border trade","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Initially created as the infrastructure for decentralised cryptocurrencies, it is effectively a digital list of records or transactions that are linked together in a public database. Advocates of blockchain have long argued it could work by monitoring goods moving across the border in a non-disruptive way that would not breach the Good Friday Agreement. Blockchain would do this by digitally recording goods transparently and would be updated by those using it. Andrew Bird, chief executive of digital transformation firm GS Marketplace, said: \"In our opinion, the Northern Ireland border issue is a non-issueyou use technology. The whole thing just ceases to be a problem. \"But someone needs to define what you want the border to look like - is it checking everything  I doubt it - thats against the Good Friday Agreement. \"If its maintaining the current level of rigour, which I would assume is going to be acceptable, then absolutely blockchain could do this relatively quickly.\" Mr Bird said scanning devices could be used, saving drivers from needing to get out of their truck. Critics of blockchain have described it as a \"wild card\" because they believe no one really understands it. \"If there are wonderful technologies that make borders near frictionless, why arent they being used where - or where are they being used \" asked Professor Vili Lehdonvirta, associate professor at the University of Oxfords Internet Institute.\"If were talking about a world-first, especially at some kind of an accelerated, break-neck speed, the chances of failure seem very high, considering the track record of the UK government in large IT projects.\" Another alternative being discussed is the Malthouse compromise, a proposal put together by Tory MPs from both wings of the party. It refers to a \"protocol\" replacing the backstop.This offers ious technological and procedural measures - including customs checks away from the border and a new regime of regulatory equivalence between the UK and EU - which would supposedly eliminate new frictions on the border as a result of the UK leaving the EU customs union and single market.But Dr Katy Hayward, of Queens University, Belfast, said its provisions for policing and preventing smuggling would not be secure. \" self-assessment and periodic declarations simply do not provide data that is substantive enough for managing movement of goods between dferent customs and regulatory regimes,\" she said.\"Secondly, computerised risk analysis without the means of intervention is pointless.\""},{"url":null,"title":"dup accuses eu of intransigence over refusal to renegotiate deal","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The withdrawal agreement will not be renegotiated.\"EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier said the backstop was \"part and parcel\" of the agreement and nobody had detailed the \"alternative arrangements\" that London was seeking to replace it with.On Tuesday the Prime Minister succeeded in uniting the Tories behind a plan to renegotiate the draft agreement to address concerns about the backstop, securing a -strong House of Commons majority.Mrs Dodds said: \"The EU may be burying its head in the sand, but there is no path to ratying a final Brexit deal without legally enforceable changes to the draft withdrawal agreement.\"Mr Barnier cannot paper over the cracks emerging in the EU position. National leaders across Europe are beginning to realise that the single-track focus on the backstop may in fact lead to the very outcome it set out to avoid.\"To insist on a proposal which is not deliverable in the UK shows intransigence.\"We say calmly and clearly to the EU leadership that we do not need the backstop. It is now time for a sensible and pragmatic renegotiation.\"DUP deputy leader Nigel Dodds urged the Irish government to \"tone down the rhetoric\" and work towards a \"sensible deal\" that avoided a hard border.He described some of Dublins comments as \"reckless\" and said while the withdrawal agreement was not acceptable to unionists, with \"renewed focus\" a consensus which worked for everyone was possible.But Sinn Fein urged the EU not to budge over the backstop.The party held several meetings on Brexit at Westminster yesterday.Francie Molloy MP said: \"We met today with the British Secretary of State, Karen Bradley, to discuss the ongoing Brexit crisis in the British parliament and reiterated our position that the backstop is not open for renegotiation.\"We also met with the British Labour partys Shadow Secretary of State, Tony Lloyd, to convey the same message. At both engagements we made it absolutely clear that the British Parliament cannot tear up or alter the Irish backstop.\"Ulster Unionist MLA Steve Aiken said the backstop was incompatible with the principle of consent. He also challenged the claim by SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford that Mrs May had ripped up the Good Friday Agreement.\"The UUP will take no lessons from anyone when it comes to the Belfast Agreement,\" Mr Aiken said. \"We negotiated it, so we are well placed to know what it says.\"Of key importance to unionism was the principle of consent being enshrined.

But when her former employer paid her wages into her bank account a day late, Orlagh claimed she couldnt access the £ December payment she was legally entitled to.Two months on - and currently thousands of pounds in debt - the -year-old from Dunmurry still hasnt received a penny and revealed that shes getting more and more desperate.\"Im living on money borrowed from my mother and my friends,\" she said. \"Its very stressful. Im trapped in this world now.\" Despite no longer being able to afford to eat or heat her home, Orlagh said shes been desperately trying to get other reception work, although the odds are stacked against her.\"Ive been sitting for days on end with no gas and empty cupboards,\" she said. \"Ive been for interviews but my confidence and self-esteem are gone. In my job, grooming and presentation are important youre expected to have your nails painted, your make-up on and no grey roots showing.\"I have no money to get my hair done. Im having trouble with a tooth, but I cant afford to see a dentist. Who is going to employ a toothless receptionist with grey roots \" She added: \"I havent kept my spirits up. Ive turned off people on social media to avoid upsetting myself over what theyre doing and what theyve got.\"The Department for Communities said that while it cannot comment on inidual cases, it is \"looking into the concerns raised in this case\".Orlagh said her money problems first began on August , , when her working tax credits stopped after her son Oisin turned  and left full-time education.\"That basically plunged me into financial chaos,\" she said.\"I was on a -hour contract at my previous job and when I asked my employer for at least  hours they couldnt offer me anything extra, so I had to leave.\"I was frantic. I was in real financial trouble so in a blind panic of desperation I left a job I really loved for another offering more hours.\"Prior to switching employers, Orlagh, whose only luxury is her television, said she really tried to make ends meet.\"From August  until October I lived on a part-time wagewith no benefit help and it wasnt enough - I was hungry,\" she said. \"Thats why I took a job offering more hours. But, after a one-month trial period, it didnt work out.\"With a monthly rent bill of £, and a weekly spend of £ on electricity and £ on gasand £ on work transport, Orlagh found that it all soon adds up.\"I dont have a mobile phone or extravagant expenses. I dont go on holiday,\" she said.The new job lasted from October  until November . When she phoned to claim Universal Credit the next day, she was initially told to register online.But she couldnt register online because she didnt have the right technology. Therefore, she physically had to visit the job centre and was told to expect a five-week wait for payment.\"I hadnt been paid since October, when I left the previous job, so by that stage I was in minus figures,\" she said.\"I was supposed to receive £ on January  for the month of December - and that includes my rent - but I didnt get anything because my last employer paid me a day late, on November .\"I have repeatedly explained that the wages paid into my account on November  represent earnings from October  to November , .\"But they refuse to accept this. According to their computer, those wages were earned between November  and December , . \"Therefore nothing can be done to help me.\"Orlagh raised a complaint on January . But, three weeks later, there is still no news and she is yet to receive a payment. Meanwhile, she revealed that her financial situation is likely to get even worse as she struggles to repay two government loans.\"There was no Universal Credit payment in December and goodness knows when Ill get something,\" she said.\"I wouldnt have a penny to my nameI hadnt borrowed around £ from the Social Fund to see me through. \"But because Im also paying back another Social Fund loan from a previous time, it means that £ a week will be taken out of my £ Universal Credit benefit when I finally get it.\"Orlagh said she was speaking out today to reduce the stigma of being poor because \"there are so many people out there who are pretending that everything is OK when its not\".She added: \"One catastrophic event after another has led me to this position.\"Im not a tracksuit-wearing person out on the streets whos never worked a day in her le. Once youre on minimum wage youre screwed youre nothing.\" The Department for Communities said statistics are not available to confirm how many local families rely on Universal Credit.In a statement it added: \"Current figures at January ,  show , live claims in respect of , claimants.\"The department also said there have only been  complaints since Universal Credit was introduced here in September .What the Department for Communities says... “Universal Credit is assessed on a monthly basis and is based on the claimant’s circumstances and earnings. All claimants are offered an Advance Paymentthey feel they will need financial support during the wait for the first payment, which can be up to % of the estimated entitlement.“DFC has also put in place a Universal Credit Contingency Fund, available to customers who require further financial assistance before receiving their Universal Credit. Unlike advance payments, the Universal Credit Contingency Fund payments are non-repayable grants. Loans or grants are also available through the Discretionary Support Service which is unique to Northern Ireland and helps customers who require short term assistance in crisis or emergency situations.“The Department has been working closely with the Independent Advice sector to prepare customers for the introduction of Welfare Reform and has provided funding in the region of £m to the advice sector to provide support for claimants impacted by Welfare Reform.” "},{"url":null,"title":"coroner rules inquests into 1974 guildford pub bombings","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

died had not been sufficiently established in public proceedings, following a campaign from the families of victims, survivors, and those wrongfully imprisoned to complete the hearings.Soldiers Caroline Slater, , William Forsyth, , John Hunter, , and Ann Hamilton, , and civilian Paul Craig, , died in the blast – carried out by the IRA at the height of the Northern Ireland Troubles – at the Horse and Groom pub, which was popular with soldiers, in the town on October  .\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  The aftermath of the IRA bomb blast at the Horse and Groom pub in Guildford, Surrey, in October  Original inquest proceedings were opened and suspended after the Guildford Four – Gerry Conlon, Paul Hill, Paddy Armstrong and Carole Richardson – were convicted over the bombings in .They were handed le sentences but had their convictions overturned in  – the case becoming one of the best-known miscarriages of justice in British legal history.Reading out his ruling during a -minute hearing at Woking Coroner’s Court, Mr Travers said: “It is not in doubt that the deceased were unlawfully killed by a team of Provisional IRA terrorists, probably comprised of eight people in two cars.“What the resumed inquests can and will investigate are issues such as the time of the blast, the respective locations of the bomb and its victims, who was with the victims at the time of the blast, whether each of the deceased died immediately and,not, how long they survived for, whether they said anything to anybody prior to their deaths and the response of first aiders and emergency services.”But he said the resumed inquest would not have the scope to explore who was responsible for the bomb, the composition of the explosive device or any claims that police lied during the trial of the Guildford Four.He said that, while there might be some evidential dficulties due to the fact that many witnesses may have died in the years since the blast, others would only be in their s or s, and should therefore be available to be called as witnessesnecessary. leave the House of Commons after then PM Tony Blair apologised for them being wrongly convicted of the Guildford pub bombings \" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Gerry Conlon and Annie McGuireleave the House of Commons after then PM Tony Blair apologised for them being wrongly convicted of the Guildford pub bombings Mr Travers added: “I take the view that the deceased, their families and the public are entitled to have these matters formally explored in open court and in proceedings which are untainted by allegations of impropriety or misconduct.“Doing this will establish and record a credible and reliable account of what happened to the victims in a way that respects and honours their memory, and I believe this would represent an important and worthwhile exercise.“The deaths in question and the occurrence of a terrorist atrocity in Guildford town centre still matter to the families of those who died, the people of Surrey, and the wider public notwithstanding the lapse of time.“This case is not of such antiquity that it should be considered ancient history.”He added that the inquests would not make determinations which are inconsistent with the Guildford Four’s overturned convictions.The incident and its aftermath became so notorious that it inspired the  film In The Name Of The Father, which saw Mr Conlon played by Oscar-winning actor Daniel Day-Lewis.Coroner Mr Travers said a pre-inquest review would be held at a later date before the resumption of the inquests.In a statement on behalf of the family of Pte Hamilton and survivor Yvonne Tagg, lawyers KRW said: “KRW welcome the ruling on behalf of our clients and welcome the opportunity for an effective investigation into the Guildford pub bombings.”Surrey Police said in a statement following the coroner’s ruling that they have already begun cataloguing all material held in relation to the bombings, but that it would take up to further  months to complete."},{"url":null,"title":"facebook sued by dissident group saoradh over removed pages","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER

It was designed around British red lines,\" he said.\"Ireland has the same position as the European Union now, I think, when we say that the backstop as part of the withdrawal agreement is part of a balanced package that isnt going to change.\"However responding, the Health Secretary Matt Hancock said delaying Brexit would not resolve the issues.

He said Mr Varadkar was reminding people of what the border once looked like.\"What I would ask people to think about is how far we have come in the last  years and what the peace agreement has done for relationships between our two island. Lets not go backwards and cause tension,\" He said.\"Lets not just listen to one political partys voice from Northern Ireland because they happen to sit in Westminster. Lets listen everybody in Northern Ireland is saying.

This is not just about Britains future. This is about how we work together in the future.\"He added: \"People keep talking about games of chicken and the UK position being against the Irish or the EU position. We are all trying to work together here.\"Britain and Ireland are two islands next door to each other, we have an extraordinary history at times a very tragic history. But we have to work out these things together and stop talking about games of chicken.\"Mr Coveney said he did not believe the only reason for Theresa Mays crushing defeat in the Commons earlier this month was down to the backstop alone.\"If you look at the withdrawal agreement it is actually not that controversial. It is about protecting citizens rights.. about protecting British citizens rights in the EU .. its about a financial settlement.. its about creating the time and space for a transition period.. for preparing for new realities.\"And its about protecting a peace process which I believe the Prime Minister is deeply committed to.\"He added: \"The problem with the argument is that nobody has come up with a pragmatic, sensible and legally sound way of avoiding border infrastructure reemerging between the two jurisdictions on the island of Ireland. And that is why it took two years to get the backstop agreed and that is why I believe the Prime Minister is correct when she defends it.\""},{"url":null,"title":"dive team to conduct survey of royal oak wreck site","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

As the most intact underwater dreadnought-era battleship, she has an architectural grandeur befitting of any national memorial.“However, at the smaller end of the scale, artefacts pertaining to everyday le on board are scattered around the site, bringing home the human story of those lost.“The site is peaceful, yet vibrant and supports a thriving marine eco-system.

However, councillors subsequently switched attention to the former St. Maryrsquos Girlsrsquo Primary School campus at Shanslieve Drive.Despite a number of protracted attempts to secure the site and hopes that a deal could be agreed, it was bought by supermarket giant Lidl.While widely regarded as one of Northern Irelandrsquos premier tourist resorts, Newcastle does not have a modern indoor leisure facility and while there are some politicians who would like a swimming pool as part of any new development in the resort, this seems unlikely given there are local authority pools in Downpatrick, Kilkeel and Newry.It was previously suggested that the sale of the Annesley Buildings would free up the site for a new hotel and, signicantly, generate funds to help provide new leisure provision in the resort. But that now looks unlikely.As part of the drive to signicantly enhance leisure provision in the resort, council officials are continuing to work alongside education officials to develop a major new sports hub.Shimna Integrated College is planning to redevelop its King Street site which would include the creation of additional sports facilities at nearby Donard Park.It has been suggested that the proposed sports facilities could potentially be developed by the Department of Education in partnership with Newry, Mourne and Down Council with pitches and a sports pavilion forming the new sports hub which could also used by the community.While discussions are ongoing, the local authority still has to address the issue of no meaningful indoor sports facility in the resort to cater for both residents and visitors and is turning its attention to the Annesley Buildings site.Senior council officials have admitted that their initial thoughts about using the location for a town centre hotel have changed, confirming they are working to make a final decision on the way forward. It is also being suggested that the most likely outcome is developing a new leisure-cum-community facility at the Central Promenade site.A feasibility study on the redevelopment of the town centre site for a new hotel was completed several years ago which suggested a two or three-storey extension extension would be acceptable.The new hotel was viewed as a key ingredient in the plan to deliver highly ambitious proposals outlined in the Mournes Gateway proposals aimed at shaping future tourist provision in Newcastle.Other proposals include a gondola ride into the heart of the Mournes and a visitor centre at the site of the old quarry at Thomasrsquo Mountain.It has emerged that work on the high profile tourism project is progressing with moves to establish a board to deliver its ious elements, with membership including representatives from the local council, Tourism NI, Forest Service, Mourne Heritage Trust and National Trust.Over the next month, work is scheduled to start on tendering for consultancy and architectural services, alongside the recruitment of environmental and traffic management services.

Scrum half Conor Gibson was on hand to move the ball quickly to Hutley, who put Luka Walsh in space for the first score of the game.Omagh bounced back well, again using the wind effectively, and their pressure gave way to a penalty which they successfully struck to close the gap.As they continued to apply pressure, the home side had a chance to take the lead on the  minute mark, but their kick drted to the right hand side of the posts.With  minutes left in the half, Down High extended their lead. Having forced Omagh deep into their own half, Luka Walsh capitalised on Omaghrsquos decision to play out from their own quarters when he intercepted the ball to score his second of the day. Hutley slotted over the conversion. Down carried a - lead into half-time.With the strong wind now on their tails and a reasonable points buffer, Down High controlled the game well. Omagh continued to apply plenty of pressure, but the Down defence was hungry and with the exception of a few indiscretions they soaked up the Omagh onslaughts.With  minutes left the game took a critical turn when Hutley slotted agoal to take the Down lead to -.As would be expected from the men from the west, they didnrsquot lie down, but they were forced to chase the game.

However, the book kept me from thinking dark thoughts. Soon, all I wanted was to hold a copy of the book in my hand.Maureenrsquos dream came true in the autumn of  when her haunting story was finally published.Maureen, who is the mother of five grown-up children, explained some of the background as to why she put pen to paper.She added: ldquoI was initially setting out to piece together my family tree and the computer screen flashed up information on my great aunt Brigid. I was so fascinated with what I read that I could see the story unfold in a book and in turn I felt the plot would work well on screen too.Research took Maureen to the Presentation Convent in Co Kildare, which Brigid entered at the age of .Maureen said: ldquoI met with such a warm and friendly welcome from the community of sisters, that it gave me the desire to pursue Brigidrsquos story further. I travelled to Australia shortly after and I received the same, warm and friendly welcome from the sisters of the Presentation of the Blessed Virgin Mary in Wagga Wagga.On herMaureen set about sting through a mountain of information and carefully crafted the remarkable story of her great aunt. The book was published in July  and was officially launched a few months later to a rapturous reception in Murphyrsquos Bar in Downpatrick.A chance meeting which her web designer, Michael McLaughlin, had had a year later led to a further development.She said: ldquoMichael was working on a display in Eclipse Cinema in Downpatrick for another movie when he struck up a random conversation with Colin McIvor.ldquoAs they chatted Michael mentioned that he had recently read a book written by a Downpatrick woman which he thought might make a great movie.ldquoWithin days Colin, with the backing of Northern Ireland Screen, was in my house and we were signing contracts on a movie deal. That was in July last year and since then the whole thing has snowballed.ldquoIt has been a pleasure putting the whole thing together. I wrote it like a novel which makes it easy for the reader to follow the story. My story is entirely based on fact.As Maureen describes the plot her face lights up. She believes her great aunt would be delighted at her revealing the long-lost tale to a new generation.ldquoBrigid had trained as a teacher and in  there was a great demand for priests and nuns with skilled trades in Australia and so she was shipped off to the mother house in Wagga Wagga.ldquoBrigid proved herself capable and popular with the children she taught for six years. But a bad day in front of a teaching inspector led the convent demoting her to refectory duties.ldquoTwo weeks turned into two years of hard labour that took their toll physically and mentally on poor Brigid. Requests toto her former duties were denied and feeling she had no real means of complaint, it left Brigid desperate.ldquoOne day she wandered outside the convent walls. Tears welled up in her eyes as she called at a strangerrsquos home. Her afternoon of tea and warm company by the fire ended all too soon and Brigid was sent back to the convent, seen by a doctor and put to bed, Maureen added.The story really begins in earnest at this crossroads in Brigidrsquos le. Drawing on every ounce of courage she had, Brigid leapt from her bed that night and made a hasty escape barefoot in her nightgown on a foggy winterrsquos night in .This night set the scene for a religious storm unprecedented in Australiarsquos history. Brigid found refuge in the home of Protestants who refuse to disclose her whereabouts to the Catholic authorities.A bishop swore before a magistrate that Brigid was insane and a warrant was issued for her arrest. She was hunted down like an outlaw and the local media attention created a level of sectarian tension rarely unseen in that part of the world.Later, when there was no apology from the bishop for the arrest and slur on her character, Brigid turned to the courts for redress. But taking on the bishop meant taking on the Catholic Church.Maureen had a challenging time presenting Brigidrsquos story.She said: ldquoIt was a scandal at the time but I had to be careful to write it from both sides and let people judge for themselves. Itrsquos all I can do.Maureen says she is looking forward to the filmrsquos premiere.She added: ldquoIt will be the culmination of not just my five years of writing and telling the story, but all the hard work and effort that my family have put into supporting and helping me and, of course, the efforts of the film company, the director and the actors.Colin spoke of his enthusiasm over Maureenrsquos forthcoming film.ldquoI am thoroughly delighted to have optioned such an amazingly powerful book and to have met the inspirational Maureen and her family through the process, he said.He is currently adapting the book into a screenplay. ldquoI believe the film will offer a fantastic role for a strong female lead and supporting cast, he said. ldquoTo be able to bring this beautully written, dramatic and deserved piece to the silver screen some day would be just fantastic.Log on to Maureenrsquos website toon the forthcoming movie premiere at www.theextraordinarycaseofsisterliguori..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C January 30%2C 1979  ","story":"DOWNPATRICK mdash A Strangford man had a narrow escape from death when he turned up for work on Monday morning at the new Abbey Lodge Hotel, outside Downpatrick.A muffled explosion during the night had ripped apart a section of the hotel mdash which was due to open in three weeksrsquo time mdash but no alarm was raised and workmen were unaware of the danger when they reported for work.One of the men, Mr Francis Black, from Strangford, passed through the lounge and noticed a black bag and two yellow tins. He thought it was some material left for him to carry on with a job and picked it up.Mr Black failed to notice several wires leading from the bag, but an examination of the contents told him something was wrong. He put it down and it was discovered later that the contents were competence for a lethal fire-type bomb.By then Mr Blackrsquos colleagues had discovered the damage caused by another bomb and a warning was raised. Police and firemen rushed to the scene and the main Downpatrick-Crossgar Road, beside the hotel, was sealed off as army bomb disposal experts raced from Lisburn.An army officer successfully defused the second bomb and workmen moved in to assess the damage, which was confined that bedroom section of the hotel.The hotel owner, Mr William Polly, said: ldquoDoors, windows, the gable and the roof have all been damaged and this includes a total of eight bedrooms. It will mean that an entire section of the building containing the bedrooms will have to come out.

These premises will be our new premises with dedicated areas for Lowden acoustic guitars and new electric guitar ranges, said George.ldquoWe are currently planning out the logistics of our move from Down Business Park. This will require attention to detail and be orchestrated stage by stage to minimise any disruption to our ability to complete and ship our guitars to waiting customers.Lowden Guitars successfully managed to keep news that it was working with Sheeran mdash one of the worldrsquos biggest music artist, who has sold  million albums and has had more than  billion streams mdash under wraps for considerable time.

But a starting price for a Lowden was three grand. When yoursquore , three grand may as well be a million pounds.ldquoThe dream of any kid who likes music is to have a guitar and the dream of any musician is to have a signature guitar.George realised that he needed to make a range that was something special and revealed that he sought inspiration from the North Coast.ldquoEvery guitar that I design and make I have to feel afterwards proud of it, I have to feel that I have achieved something with it. That itrsquos not just a normal guitar, he explained.ldquoThe main aim was to design and make a guitar here at an affordable price noticeably better than anything  at that price range. So I went up to the North Coast and spent a week at the Giants Causeway walking and thinking and drawing. Then having designed it, of course I sent it off to Ed and the rest is history.Sheeran has previously bemoaned that fewer youngsters seem to be interested in guitar-playing these days.ldquoThere are fewer guitar bands and fewer artists using guitars now, and not as many kids picking up guitars, he added.ldquoThat is something I would like to change by getting these great quality guitars, made in Ireland, into kidsrsquo hands and encouraging them to learn and progress.The Sheeran by Lowden acoustic guitar range features eight inidual models across two small body sizes familiar from the Lowden range, known as the S and the Wee Lowden.The guitars have been designed for uncompromising tone and playability and are made using sustainably-sourced wood including naturally fallen trees and reclaimed spruce.George says that the new range combines years of hand-crafting and traditional luthier methods with new construction technology.ldquoItrsquos taking everything I have learnt over the last  years, cherry-picking from that a few traditional methods of working by hand and introducing those into a whole series of new groundbreaking procedures for guitar making so that the end result is a guitar made in Ireland but one which really sings and which I hope inspires many young musicians and older ones as well, he added.The first orders should be shipped in March.

This massive project, spearheaded by Richmount Rural Community Association, aims to take the town land from the cradle of civilisation to the present day.Ballintaggart, a townland between Portadown and Armagh, has the Giants’ Gravesto a wonderful Plantation House later rebuilt in the style of a French Château.Association chairman Joe Garvey said this major heritage project aims to uncover the wealth of history, with the help of local schools and the local community.He revealed: “Sir Robert Hart, the Inspector-General of China’s Custom Service, courted one of the residents of Ballintaggart for all of  hours before proposing marriage. “We have Cinnamon’s Lanewith labourers’ cottages which served the local watermill. We have the Georgian Hannavale House and its sister house on the Armagh Road.We have tales of strange phenomena and the “mountain dew” being brewed long before the cider of today. There is also evidence of battles and highway men. “This community heritage project will gather local information and look at the le and culture of former residents and piece together the Ballintaggart story for both a local and wider audience and place it firmly on the Heritage Trail. There will be training, research, video making, storytelling, writing, informational trips and it will be fun.“We will also be involving local schools in the project with Hart Memorial, Portadown, Richmount Primary School and St John’s Eglish, Annaghmore agreeing to take part in the project. It is vital that our heritage is preserved and we hope to foster the desire to be mindful of our heritage with the younger generation. We wish to have this important area of heritage placed firmly on the heritage trail.”Mr Garvey said they were delighted with the lottery award.Lord Mayor of ABC Council Julie Flaherty commended Richmount Rural Community Association for taking on ‘this most interesting and challenging project’. She asked: “Is this project the catalyst to investigatethe Giants Graves could be ed to their native setting in Ballintaggart If they could be ed it would really put Ballintaggart on the Heritage trail.”Jim McGreevy, Member of NI Committee of Heritage Lottery Fund said it should result in a compelling and fascinating addition to NI’s heritage. “We wish the team every success as they embark on their project.”WATCH: Firefighters continue to tackle pub blaze Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"try catch  TrendingDying single mother, , with motor neurone disease whose children have to dress her refused disability benefitsThese properties are just some of the least expensive currently up for sale in NISnow, ice and fallen debris could make your morning drive dficult - as Roads Service confirm salting of roads network underwayN.I. man headbutts police officer before spitting in nurses faceP.S.N.I. shutdown N.I. road after car crash - N.I.

From its founder Ian Paisley being pictured with a sledgehammer and the slogan ‘smash Sinn Féin’ to deputy leader Peter Robinson leading an ‘invasion’ of the border town of Clontibret in the s to Ian Paisley Jr repeatedly shouting “moo, moo, moo” as a member of the Women’s Coalition spoke in the s, the DUP has always been far less concerned about the niceties of politics than most of its rivals.That willingness to act beyond the normal constraints of political discourse has been one of the secrets of the DUP’s ability to extract signicant concessions during negotiations - most obviously in  when the party secured a minimum of £ billion in new money for Northern Ireland in order to prop up Theresa May’s government.Even when in a weak position, the party believes that attack is the best form of defence.Over the last year there has been open DUP frustration – reaching a crescendo in December – at what it saw as Mrs May’s far less robust style of negotiation.But that simmering discontent has come to the fore over the last week as the DUP saw what it viewed as an open goal from the EU side.Last week – in what was the most dficult week for the otherwise watertight Dublin-Brussels relationship since the talks began – the European Commission’s chief spokesman said that in the event of a no deal Brexit it is “pretty obvious you will have a hard border” in Ireland.Dublin dismissed that argument, with Taoiseach Leo Varadkar stating that “even in a no deal, there will not be ato a border”.The very obvious question from the DUP was: If a hard border is not going to happen under any scenario – even a no-deal Brexit – why is the EU unprepared to move on the backstop, when it is supposedly there as an ‘insurance policy’ to prevent a hard border When asked that question, Tanaiste Simon Coveney has been evasive, something which will have heightened the DUP belief that it is a point of vulnerability for Dublin and Brussels.Last week also saw Michel Barnier state that “even in the absence of an agreement, we will do our utmost not to create a hard border in Ireland”, while the Polish foreign minister suggested that the backstop could be time-limited to five years, a proposal which is anathema to Dublin.The shambolic state of the British negotiation has to some extent obscured these problems for Ireland.Belfast murder victim’s family need answers, vigil told Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"On Tuesday, Sammy Wilson was quite open about the party’s desire, stating that “now is the time for the Prime Minister to exploit the chaos in Brussels and Dublin and press for a better deal”.Signicantly, that statement was endorsed by the party and released through its central press office rather than as a solo run by Mr Wilson.However, the DUP faces two dficulties of its own. While it is influential, the party is not in charge of the British side of the negotiations and the prime minister has done little to suggest that she has the appetite or aptitude for the DUP’s methods.And the UK is also facing a formidable negotiating partner, the EU, which is so far sticking to the sort of hard-nosed tactics followed by the DUP.try catch  TrendingDying single mother, , with motor neurone disease whose children have to dress her refused disability benefitsThese properties are just some of the least expensive currently up for sale in NISnow, ice and fallen debris could make your morning drive dficult - as Roads Service confirm salting of roads network underwayN.I. man headbutts police officer before spitting in nurses faceP.S.N.I. shutdown N.I. road after car crash - N.I.

The site will potentially generate up to  new work positions across management, supervisory, warehousing staff and apprenticeship roles.Speaking of the new facility and what it will bring, Mr Rattenbury said: ldquoWe are delighted that our vision of a lsquoone stop shoprsquo for our customers is being realised and having a  hour, seven day a week co-packing facility in the heart of Wales, is a game changer for our industry. We can now offer our customers a streamlined product supply chain package by integrating their co-packing requirements with the grouprsquos warehouse and transport subsidiary companies.ldquoLogistically, this works out to be more cost effective overall, but also lowers the carbon footprint on the transportation of food products, which is something we are passionate about.Wild Water Group has a current annual turnover of poundm and Mr Rattenbury believes the company can increase that figure by a further poundm within  months and then reach poundm within two to three years.The project is backed by a pound. million investment from Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking and the Development Bank of Wales and has secured Welsh Government funding under the new economic contract.Using a similar business model to the grouprsquos other three sites in Merthyr Tydfil, Llanishen and Cardf Bay, the first phase of development will be the conversion of available space into a large ambient open plan co-packing facility, which will be operational early November  to meet festive season demand.During the first quarter of , Wild Water Group will move the entire Cardf Bay co-packing facility to Aberbargoed, once freezer facilities, production lines and machinery are in place.The company will then continue services such as frozen to frozen storage, bagging, over wrapping, sleeving and tray sealing, as well as the full spectrum of print labelling applications required under the Food Safety Technicalspecications.Economy Secretary Ken Skates said: ldquoThis project will not only see a successful, growing Welsh business create an additional  jobs, it will also create a new strategic hub and facility for both large and small food and drink businesses across the region to pack or store products themselves. This could, in turn, open up new markets for those businesses ndash so Irsquom excited about what this means not only for Wild Water Group and Aberbargoed, but for the region more widely.ldquoIt shows that both our Economic and Food and Drink Action plans are delivering what we had hoped ndash jobs, prosperity and sustainable growth. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It was made with willow grown in the grounds of Cogan Primary School.More than  people attended the hill rolling ceremony down Clf Hill towards Penarth Esplanade - with the school pupils from Cogan and pupils and families from Ysgol Pen Y Garth helping to roll it along.The head was accompanied by a wooden frame from the Mabinogion stories called the Window of Sorrows made by Tony Simms, and the artist Ifor Davies undertook the ritual sawing of the Window of Sorrows on the clftops and read the Bendigeidfran story from the Mabinogion tales before the rolling went ahead.The head of Bendigeidfran and the Window of Sorrows was accompanied by Penarths Mari Lwyd which is a symbol of hosting, and negotiating hospitality through song and teasing. Richard Parry led the Mari Lwyd this year, and on arriving at the bottom of the hill the celebration visited local shops and resaurants along the sea front wishing the proprietors and customers a Happy New Year. We sang for Romeo Italian restaurant, The Fig Tree, James Sommerin, The Crazy Cafe and Hamptons seaside shop. After reaching the bottom of the hill the head was carried by the children along with the Mari Lwyd to the shops and cafes along the seafront where dferent New Year songs - called Calenig - were sung in each venue and led by local opera singer Richard Parry.Speaking about the event, artist Haf Weighton said: \"I loved working with Cogan School. Itrsquos a hidden gem in Penarth with very enthusiastic staff who were happy to jump in to get involved in this project at short notice. Richard Parry and the schools deputy head Tom Lewis, ran a assembly to the whole school on the new year traditions. Then children from across the school came to see me working on the piece. \"It was lovely to hear children who donrsquot come from homes where Welsh is spoken enthusing about the mabinogi tales and Welsh traditions. Children from Pen y Garth joined in after the head was created. They helped us roll it down the hill from the clf tops.\"Richard Parry, who helped to organise the event and led the Mari Lwyd, said: \"It was great to see so many people come together to celebrate Hen Galan in Penarth. The giant Bendegeidfran got his name because he was the Blessed Bran - the best friend anyone could ever want - and in the stories of the Mabinogion he was loved by those who knew him. He is a symbol of friendship and celebrating together. \"The community celebration on the clftops was thoroughly enjoyed by children and adults alike, and even though its a bit chilly it was wonderful to see so many people out of doors, celebrating, singing and enjoying wishing everyone we met Blwyddyn Newydd Dda and Happy New Year.\"The head will now go on display at a iety of places, including Pen y Garth School, Cogan Primary School, Penarth Library and The Hearth Gallery Llandough Hospital. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He’s just taken over at the helm of the internationally renowned next generation science park which is home to  innovative knowledge based companies, who are employing more than , engineers, researchers, entrepreneurs and executives, across four locations – and has his sights firmly set on making Northern Ireland a leader in two key innovative areas of tech business.Taking on the role as chief executive of Catalyst from stalwart Professor Norman Apsley OBE, just two months ago, plans are under way to build on the foundations of an organisation which has an estate of , sq ft of agile workspace filled with innovative companies. Catalyst leads the way in innovation and entrepreneurship by supporting the creation and growth of innovation companies in Northern Ireland.“We have a rightful place in leading the world. We aren’t going to follow anybody. Let’s get back to leading the world,” Steve tells Ulster Business.“I am going to take the foundation that Norman left and look at how we leverage that by a signicant factor – in terms of economic activity and dynamism for Northern Ireland.“We need deeper, more strategic partnerships with key institutions. It is through collaboration we can do something to scale and put Northern Ireland on a world map.”Catalyst is the thriving, beating heart of Northern Ireland’s booming technology sector and leading the way in educating and preparing companies and young people for the changing world of work through the impact of the ‘Fourth Industrial Revolution, which is seeing the impact of new technologies impacting on le, work and society.Formerly known as the Northern Ireland Science Park, Catalyst is an independent not-for-profit organisation operating across the region. It provides agile workspace across four locations – the main site in Belfast’s Titanic Quarter, the Innovation centres in Londonderry, and Ballymena and most recently opened Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub, a co-working space dedicated to the fintech sector in Belfast city centre, which is a partnership with Danske Bank.“The business model we have had for the first  years was the perfect model for that period. We need a new model for the next. We are identying a simple, but ambitious strategy – building on the existing foundation.”Part of the strength of Catalyst is in attracting big international firms, such as Citi, in close proximity to businesses at the very birth of existence. Steve says as a result, “accidental encounters” lead to relationships and outcomes which otherwise, would not have happened.It also plays host to Queen’s University’s leading research body, ECITwhich itself is home to CSIT .Some of the leading thinkers based at the site include ECIT’s Professor Maire O’Neill – one of the youngest ever engineering professors at Queen’s, one-time UK Female Inventor of the Year and a leading researcher. “You have US companies looking at why would they want to move to Northern Ireland – they want to meet Professor O’Neill. She’s amazing,” Steve says.“Then there are cyber companies, like B-Secur. The firm specialises in technology which can read your ECG heartbeat as a unique biometric identy verication.“There are other indigenous companies, like Titan IC in cyber-security, Displaynote and ProAxsis. We have great companies that are now making a dent in the world.”And pushing forward with what his predecessor Norman Apsley built, plans are under way to expand and redevelop Catalyst further still.That includes another new building, Pierpont  – which will provide another , sq ft of space – and a revamp and refurbishment of Catalyst’s Innovation Centre, as part of an addition £m investment.“We want to make this the best place to work – improving the environment, the flow around the campus, the accessibility, and the experience, so that you love being here.“We want to refresh some of the buildings on the site. The Innovation Centre will be modernised by March and we will freshen-up our identity.”His big goal is to lead the way in two areas of technology and business at Catalyst – putting Northern Ireland front and centre.“We want to help to incubate two clusters where Northern Ireland leads the world.“How do we build on what ECIT is doing  We take the start-up capability, and ecosystem we have in Northern Ireland and leverage that further.“We want to make it easier for corporations to set up in Belfast and Northern Ireland in order to access amazing research talent. They want to define what the next big breakthrough is.“We can develop something for global companies that they can’t find where in the world. We want to create clusters, that will act as a magnet to attract hundreds of companies.”One of the unique elements of Catalyst is Connect – a network of experienced entrepreneurs, business professionals, top research talent and potential investors who provide their time and experience pro bono to help foster and develop the next generation of entrepreneurs.“It’s helping entrepreneurs to figure out how to build a company around their product idea and providing the support to validate and access the marketplace, capital, investment and or talent,” Steve says.“With the Connect network, we had  early stage companies or entrepreneurs engaged in our programmes last year. There is a lot of exciting and vibrant activity going on at the moment.”And it was Connect, which Steve founded and developed at Catalyst, which first drew him back home to his native Northern Ireland, following years of running and founding tech firms in the West Coast of the US.“I was an entrepreneur in Calornia for a number of years, in San Francisco and San Diego. I was there for the peak of the dot coms,” he said.That included his own start-up business, Kineticom, as well as other tech companies. It was his time in San Diego which resonated strongly with Steve.“Personally, I became obsessed with the San Diego story and the parallels to Northern Ireland. When they started on their journey in , San Diego had a population of . million people, % of their economy was dependent on the public sector. They have an ocean to one side, a mountain range around them and another country to the bottom of them.”San Diego went from the bottom of every league table to the top – with the collaboration of top universities, research and development and entrepreneurship, building the city into the tech stalwart it is now.The Connect  emanated from San Diego – a concept which help shaped the programme in Northern Ireland.“Meeting Norman Apsley at the Science Park was just the most beautul thing ever,” Steve says.The financial and economic impact and contribution that Catalyst has is hard to ignore. It’s estimated the businesses which operate there contribute around £m in GVA each year.“Everything we do is based on the simple belief that innovation has the power to transform our economy. People around the world are all innovating quickly, adapting new technologies, articial intelligence, for example. In Northern Ireland,people are producing goods and services, but are behind in adopting those new technologies, our economy is going to be in trouble as we will not be competitive.“The question is, how does innovation become the foundation on which everything is based ”And as a result of Catalyst’s research into the NI Knowledge Economy, an annual report published later this month, which acknowledges the huge changes to the workplace in the coming year, Catalyst is hosting their second Future of Work summit in May  – aimed at demystying how roles and traditional jobs are changing, right across the Knowledge Economy sectors.Of course, Brexit is still on the horizon. For Steve, the main concern is around the availability of talent. “The tech sector is hungry for talent, but with the uncertainty in the last couple of years, fewer people have been willing to consider moving to Northern Ireland. That places a lot of pressure on the existing employees in the sector.”“Long-term, we have to be optimistic and look at the opportunities which can come out of Brexit. The businesses within the Knowledge Economy are export driven, representing over % of all NI exports. With % of these exports outside the EU, the Knowledge Economy is the sector least dependent on Europe and should be the key for driving growth at this time of uncertainty.”So, for Steve, his level of optimism and dynamism is clear in his new role, one which he says he is “very fortunate” to have.“It’s a position which comes around so rarely, and whoever gets the opportunity is so blessed and fortunate to have the opportunity to lead. We have a talented team of people who are all passionate about what is possible. It’s so exciting. The opportunities and possibilities are endless.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/323433.jpg","title":"theresa mays brexit deal voted down business reaction","story":"Posted on Wednesday  January  by John Mulgrew Business groups have overwhelmingly raised concerns over crashing out of the EU without a deal after Prime Minister Theresa May’s withdrawal plan with Brussels was overwhelmingly rejected by MPs. Ann McGregor, chief executive of Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry “The business communities that we represent have always had a erse range of views on what form the UK’s future relationship with the EU should take, however they do agree on the need to avoid a messy and disorderly Brexit. “To achieve this we therefore need an agreement that will secure the transition period and protect jobs. As businesses wait to see what happens next in Parliament, it is crucial that those at Westminster move beyond tactical manoeuvring and look at all the options in order to avoid a ‘no deal’s scenario. “Firms are in the dark on too many aspects of le after March . This has already led to many businesses taking action – pausing on recruitment and investment, stockpiling goods, and relocating factories in other parts of the EU. In fact, a third of NI Chamber members are currently putting growth and investment plans on hold in the absence of clarity from Westminster. There is however nothing to stop government acting decisively on areas within their control, such as migration and customs procedures.”  Aodhan Connolly, director of the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium “The result this evening will be a cause for concern across the Northern Ireland business community. Northern Ireland businesses desperately need certainty about the UK’s future trading relationship with the EU and will be severely disadvantaged by a no deal. A no deal Brexit means that Northern Ireland households will face higher prices and less choice on the shelves something they can ill afford. “Se need politicians  to coalesce around a workable solution that protects consumers from the costs and disruptions due to the loss of tarf-free and frictionless trade we currently enjoy with partners in the EU. We are now closer than ever to the possibility of a no-deal that will be a disaster for Northern Ireland.” “  Angela McGowan, CBI Northern Ireland director “Every business will feel no deal is hurtling closer. A new plan is needed immediately. This is now a time for our politicians to make history as leaders. All MPs need to reflect on the need for compromise and to act at speed to protect the UKs economy. “No deal would immediately put Northern Irish jobs and businesses at risk and jeopardise years of positive economic development and integration across the island.  It must be avoided to protect our all-island economy.”  Glyn Roberts, Retail NI chief executive “This is a disappointing but not unexpected result. While the Prime Minister’s draft Withdrawal Bill was in no way perfect, it was definitely preferable to crashing out of the EU with no deal. “The Government now needs to work on a cross-party basis with Labour and other opposition parties to reach a broader agreement for a withdrawal deal and secure the transition period, protect jobs and a positive future relationship with the EU  Colin Neill, chief executive, Hospitality Ulster “Leaving the EU without a deal would damage the sustainability of the Hospitality industry and impact on the potential growth of Tourism in Northern Ireland. We appeal to our elected representatives to work together in a spirit of consensus government to ensure that a no deal scenario does not happen.”  Tina McKenzie, FSB NI policy chair “With the clock ticking down to Brexit Day in just  weeks, we are running out of time to avoid a clf-edge, no-deal outcome. “A disorderly exit from the EU would be deeply damaging for small businesses, causing disruption to supply chains, increasing costs and stling investment. “A no-deal is something which we simply cannot countenance, so it is imperative that political leaders sharpen their focus and do all they can to reach agreement in the short time available.”  View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"no deal brexit could cost ni economy bn by ","story":"Posted on Monday  January  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland’s economy could suffer a £bn drop in output by  in the event of a ‘no deal’ Brexit, it’s been claimed.

The CBI calculates this could amount to an annual loss of output worth almost £bn by , based on today’s prices. It says “manufacturing activity is particularly important in Northern Ireland, and the agri-food sector, which employs thousands, is likely to be severely impacted as it is particularly exposed to the risk of higher tarfs and trade costs”. Angela McGowan, Northern Ireland director of the CBI, said: “CBI members across Northern Ireland are clear:the new approach to finding a Brexit deal continues to be a game of who blinks first, the Northern Irish economy will pay the price. “The deadlock will only be broken by a genuine attempt by all MPs to find consensus and compromise, not stick to rusting red lines and political conditions. Like the rest of the UK, Northern Ireland is not – and cannot be – ready for no deal. “The projected impact on our economy would be devastating and while business will do all it can to reduce some of the worst aspects, a no deal scenario is unmanageable. “The message from the CBI to our politicians is clear – we must see compromise or the whole country faces the unforgivable prospect of a disorderly Brexit which will affect jobs and livelihoods in Northern Ireland for decades to come. It’s time to put prosperity before party politics and dogma.”  View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/Air-1.jpg","title":"eight part belfast made airbus passenger jets delivered","story":"Posted on Friday  January  by John Mulgrew Eight part-Belfast made Bombardier Airbus passenger jets were delivered at the end of last year – bringing the total number to  during .

We tell client’s stories through engaging content written by former journalists – grab their customers’ attention with stunning design, maximise conversions by using the latest digital marketing expertise, and develop websites which are living, breathing, online stores or shop windows. As content director, my role is to bring almost  years’ experience in journalism, political communications, corporate PR, crisis management and digital content crafting to Grofuse. How did the business start and how has it grown The business was created by a fusion of expertise to achieve sales growth, including experienced digital marketers, PR consultants, web developers, software developers, graphic designers, illustrators and motion designers. I co-founded the company with expert digital marketer Denis Finnegan who has spent  years fuelling online lead generation for businesses. Growth has been swt over the last  months. We’ve employed an effective combination of marketing efforts and created fans of our existing clients.What is your background I’m a seasoned hack, having worked in print journalism for almost  years followed by a few years as a political communications adviser. I spent a brief period teaching English and history at secondary level before entering a newsroom. The working environments were poles apart in terms pace, excitement and... language choices. As a school pupil and university student, I worked on building sites, supermarkets, farms, bars, bread delivery vans, a bakery and even a bacon factory kill-line. However, I had never encountered such flurries of expletives as I did in newsrooms. Great places to work. High pressure, tight deadlines and great target-setting – a superb way to fuel productivity in any work environment.What do you do dferently from your competition and what are your strengths Clear communication with our clients is our greatest strength. We listen intently to what our clients’ goals are, take time to learn about their products and gain full understanding of their ideal customers. We start with a blank canvass and devise bespoke digital strategies to fuel each client’s business growth by engaging their target market effectively and delivering genuine sales leads that are easily quantiable.Who are your main customers Our customers operate across a wide range of sectors. We are currently working with clients across the UK and Ireland, US, France and Spain. Do you have a target in mind in terms of where you want the business to grow We are currently focusing the bulk of our efforts on the island of Ireland with a particular focus on Dublin and Belfast. What challenges have you faced The somewhat ‘snake-oil industry’ reputation of digital marketing sometimes poses a barrier to speaking with decision makers who in the past have invested with little . However, once we’re given an opportunity, we like to let the results do the talking. Who most inspires you Those who thrive in the face of adversity and have strong growth mind-sets. The type of person with the right measure of accountability, skill and relentlessness to inspire their teams to achieve targets. It’s a mind-set akin to that of a top athlete whose body is screaming ‘slow down’ in the business end of a race but whose mind interprets that as a cue to go faster. My we Martina – a former operations manager with Lidl Ireland who co-founded and runs leading human resources consultancy, HR Team – has these qualities in abundance. She inspires me in everything I do.Where do you see yourself in the next few years I love living and working in the North West. Whatever people like to call Derry or Londonderry, it’s a very special place with a lot of talent and a big future in driving the cross-border regional economy. With our headquarters at Catalyst Inc and plans underway for satellite offices in Dublin and the UK, we want to ensure our agency plays a part in shaping that economic prosperity with the provision of more high-quality jobs for the area.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
